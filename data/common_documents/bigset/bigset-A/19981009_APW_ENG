Malaysian opposition group plans rally in southern state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Despite police clampdowns on
political rallies, opposition activists planned Friday to step up
nationwide anti-government demonstrations calling for reform.
	   The Islamic-led Malaysian People's Justice Movement, a coalition
of opposition parties and non-governmental groups, said it expected
a turnout of 15,000 people at a gathering Friday evening in the
town of Batu Pahat in the southern state of Johor.
	   The rally was to take place at the regional headquarters of
Islamic opposition group, Parti Islam SeMalaysia, known as PAS.
	   The fledgling coalition has rallied a growing number of
supporters in calls for justice for ousted deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim and a repeal of the harsh Internal Security Act,
under which he was arrested Sept. 20.
	   On Tuesday, the group staged a rally in the eastern state of
Pahang that drew 10,000 people. Thousands of postcards addressed to
the prime minister were circulated, demanding Mahathir hold a
general election or step down. Organizers said similar gatherings
were planned in northern states.
	   Authorities, meanwhile, revoked permission for the group to hold
a mass rally on Oct. 17 at the capital's new national stadium, said
Mahfuz Omar, a chief organizer of the fledgling coalition and a top
PAS official.
	   Mahfuz said that stadium officials told him Thursday the venue
needed maintenance and repairs and could not be used for the
planned rally, despite earlier permission.
	   The rally was planned to counter another one scheduled for
Saturday at the same stadium by Malaysia's governing coalition. It
was intended to bolster support for Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Police, however, banned the pro-government rally earlier this
week citing security reasons. The ruling followed a spate of street
protests after Anwar's dismissal Sept. 2, where thousands of people
clogged the streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur, many demanding reform
and an end to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Mahathir, Asia's longest serving ruler, was quoted in a
Singapore newspaper Friday as saying he was prepared to retire from
politics once the nation's economy stabilized.
	   The Straits Times said in a front-page report that Mahathir told
a closed-door meeting of grassroots supporters on Thursday ``that
he was prepared to step down after 17 years as prime minister of
Malaysia, once the economy stabilizes.''
	   ``They roared in disapproval and urged him to stay on,''
according to the newspaper account.
	   Mahathir had said he dismissed Anwar, his deputy and finance
minister, because he was morally unfit to lead. The two had
differed over economic policy, and Anwar has said Mahathir feared
he posed a power threat.
	   Anwar since has been charged with corruption and illegal
homosexual acts, and will stand trial Nov. 2. He has pleaded
innocent to all the charges.

Charges against woman held in foiled London bomb plot are dropped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The case against an Irish woman charged in July
with plotting a wave of bombings across London has been dropped,
police said.
	   Elaine Moore, 21, of Hampstead, northwest London, has been held
along with three men in connection with a failed bombing campaign
that has been blamed on Irish Republican Army dissidents opposed to
Northern Ireland's peace process.
	   Moore's case had been championed by some of the Irish Republic's
senior politicians, who say she is innocent.
	   She was granted bail in August when former Irish presidential
candidate and influential politician Mary Banotti intervened.
	   Ms. Banotti provided a character reference for Moore and, along
with former Irish foreign minister Peter Barry, pledged money
toward her bail conditions.
	   Her release on bail was welcomed by Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern.
	   Anthony Hyland, 25, whose address was not given; Darren
Mulholland, 19, of Dundalk in the Irish Republic, and Liam Grogan,
21 of Naas in the republic, still face charges, a spokeswoman for
Scotland Yard said Thursday night, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity.
	   Moore and the three men were charged with conspiracy to cause
explosions. Mulholland, Grogan and Moore were also charged with
possessing explosives.
	   At the time, police said they had thwarted an imminent terrorist
attack on London. They have refused to identify the intended
targets, but the British media, quoting unnamed police sources,
reported that the firebombs were destined for London department
stores.

North returns remains of Americans who died in Korean War
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PANMUNJOM, Korea, (AP) _ North Korea on Friday handed over five
sets of remains of American soldiers who died during the Korean
War.
	   The skeletal remains were unearthed by a U.S. military forensic
team operating in North Korea.
	   About 100 American and Canadian veterans of the war saluted as
the aluminum caskets changed hands in this border village.
	   The remains were being sent to a U.S. Army laboratory in Hawaii
for possible indentification.
	   North Korea began repatriating American remains in 1990. In
1996, it began allowing U.S. forensic experts to search for remains
in its territory, assisted by North Korean officials.
	   Twenty sets of remains believed to be those of American soldiers
have been unearthed and returned by North Korea since the joint
recovery operation began.
	   All told, about 230 sets of remains have been repatriated by
North Korea, but fewer than a dozen have been positively
identified. North Korea handed over three sets in the last
repatriation in early September.
	   The recovery of remains of American war dead is a key U.S.
demand for improving relations with North Korea.
	   More than 50,000 American soldiers were killed in the 1950-53
Korean War. About 8,100 of those are still unaccounted for.
	   No peace treaty was ever signed to end the war, and the Korean
peninsula remains one of the most heavily armed areas in the world.

 &UR; Former Filipino sex slaves say they will continue to seek Japanese
compensation

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Filipino women who were forced into
sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II said
Friday they will continue to seek redress from Japan despite a
Tokyo court's refusal to grant them compensation.
	   Nelia Sancho, spokeswoman for the former sex slaves, called the
decision a ``letdown for women's human rights worldwide.''
	   About 30 elderly former sex slaves, many sitting on cardboard
and newspapers, held an overnight vigil in front of Manila's
Japanese Embassy while waiting for Friday's court verdict.
	   ``Rape victims have a right to compensation,'' said a sign held
by one woman.
	   In its ruling, the Tokyo District Court rejected claims from 46
Filipino women for 20 million yen (dlrs 169,000) each in
compensation.
	   The presiding judge said the international law under which the
plaintiffs sought damages did not permit compensation demands by
individuals, Kyodo News said.
	   Sancho said the women would immediately appeal the ruling.
	   ``This has made the Filipino women even more determined to
continue with the struggle to pursue redress,'' she said.
	   She said the decision was ``both sad and painful'' for the women
because it showed that some parts of Japanese society were still
unable to admit and make amends for Japanese war crimes.
	   Sancho said the women are also seeking passage of a compensation
law by Japan's Parliament.
	   Friday's ruling was the second on compensation lawsuits filed by
former sex slaves in Japan.
	   In April, a court in southwestern Japan ordered the Japanese
government pay 300,000 yen (dlrs 2,500) in damages to three South
Koreans used as sex slaves during the war.
	   Historians say as many as 200,000 women, mostly Koreans but also
Filipinos, Chinese and Dutch, were forced into sexual slavery
during the war.
	   It was only in 1992 that the Japanese government admitted that
its Imperial army was involved in establishing and running the
front-line brothels.
	   Japan maintains, however, that all questions of compensation for
the war already have been settled with the various nations
involved.
	   Of the 46 Filipino women, some were age 10 and others were
teen-agers when they were seized by the Japanese for service in
brothels, their lawyers have said.
	   To date, seven of the Filipino plaintiffs, including Maria Rosa
Henson, the first Filipino woman to publicly admit she was forced
into sexual slavery, have died.
	   Japan has provided some aid to former sex slaves through a
privately-funded body. Most women have refused to accept the
payment, saying it is not enough and is part of attempts by Japan
to avoid taking official responsibility for its wartime actions.

British national sentenced to death for child's rape in Philippines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Philippine court sentenced a
46-year-old British man to death Friday after convicting him of
having raped the 12-year-old daughter of his common-law Filipino
wife.
	   Albert Ernest Wilson of Kent, England, pleaded innocent to the
charges.
	   People in the packed courtroom in suburban Valenzuela cheered as
the death sentence was read. The girl, now 14, cried and told
reporters that she hoped to be able to watch Wilson's execution.
	   Wilson's lawyer, Ismael Billena, said he would appeal the
verdict.
	   ``This will not be the end of the case,'' Billena said. ``We are
not giving up hope.''
	   Wilson was brought into the courtroom in handcuffs and wearing a
bright yellow prison T-shirt.
	   Throughout the proceedings, he sat bent over with his face
between his legs and used a bag to hide his head from
photographers. He made no statement.
	   The girl had told her mother she was raped in their Valenzuela
home in metropolitan Manila while the mother was out shopping,
court records show. But the mother refused to believe her, accusing
her of telling lies.
	   The girl then went to her biological father, with whom the
mother is separated. They filed a complaint to the police.
	   Regional Trial Court Judge Adriano Osorio cited a new anti-rape
law that imposes the death penalty for rape of minors if the
offender is a relative or a common-law husband of the mother of the
victim.
	   The girl thanked her supporters but expressed no compassion for
Wilson.
	   ``I am very happy today,'' she said.
	   Surrounded by her supporters and her lawyer, Peter Principe, who
coached her replies to reporters' questions, she said: ``I cannot
forgive him because he is not of my own blood and I do not know how
to forgive. He deserves the death penalty and I hope we can watch
it.''
	   Under Philippine law, the Supreme Court will automatically
review the trial court's decision even if the defense motion for
reconsideration is denied.
	   Principe said the verdict was ``very significant'' because it
was the first time a foreigner has been sentenced to death for rape
in the Philippines.
	   ``This is a historic day because the world will know that we
know how to apply the law no matter who is the offender,'' he said.
	   Sitting behind Wilson in the courtroom were the girl and her
biological father surrounded by supporters from several women's and
anti-crime groups. The British Embassy also sent three observers.

Police arrest British national for drug trafficking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian police arrested a
British journalist for allegedly smuggling heroin in condoms
stashed in his underwear, a news report said Friday.
	   In Malaysia, a drug trafficking conviction carries a mandatory
death sentence.
	   The 55-year-old man, identified only as a freelance journalist,
was stopped by airport security before boarding a flight from the
northeastern state of Penang to Australia, the Star newspaper
reported.
	   Police then conducted a body search on the man and found 655
grams (1.5 pounds) of high-quality heroin worth 200,000 ringgit
(dlrs 52,600), the report said.
	   Two bags filled with 133 condoms were found inside the man's
underwear, the report said.
	   Mazlan Ayob, a Penang police superintendent, confirmed the
arrest. A state court ruled the man remain in police custody for
two weeks, pending an investigation.
	   The man was believed to have been in Malaysia for a week after
visiting Thailand.

Waters receding, but more misery ahead for Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL; 
 &UR; By DONNA BRYSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ The waters of Bangladesh are placid
now, but their reservoir of rage is evident everywhere.
	   Children emaciated by waterborne illnesses crowd hospitals,
thousands of homeless are camped out on the street, and stretches
of crumbling road are lined by abandoned trucks and cars, fringes
of river weed clinging to their undercarriages.
	   The floods finally began to recede in September after two months
_ the longest inundation in memory. Experts say it's a lingering
disaster for Bangladesh, with deadly disease, food shortages and a
crushing rebuilding bill ahead for one of the poorest countries in
the world.
	   ``The task ahead seems almost too huge to comprehend,'' the
International Red Cross said in its post-flood assessment.
	   ``Normally, we face floods every year,'' Bangladeshi Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina said in an interview. ``But this time,
damage is so colossal we cannot face it alone.''
	   Hasina has appealed for nearly dlrs 880 million in foreign aid.
Some is needed to buy rice and pay for other relief for those
affected. The bulk is needed to repair roads, schools, homes and
more.
	   By early October, nearly 70 countries and organizations ranging
from the tiny kingdom of Bhutan to several United Nations offices
had pledged a total of more than dlrs 200 million in cash, food,
and materials.
	   Government officials dismiss fears of famine, saying foreign aid
will help cover a grain shortfall estimated at more than 4.4
million tons. But Hasina acknowledged that because of the heavy
damage to roads, bridges and rail lines, authorities are facing
difficulty in getting food, water purification tablets, material
for building shelters and other help to the needy.
	   Floods chewed away much of the main highway leading south from
the capital, Dhaka, turning what is normally an eight-hour drive to
the main port city of Chittagong into 14 hours of swerving from
pothole to pothole. In all, the government said, nearly 10,000
miles (16,000 kilometers) of roads were damaged.
	   Farmer Zainul Abedin wonders what he will do when the food his
family and neighbors managed to put aside runs out. Their entire
village of Phalshatia, 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Dhaka,
is underwater. Their jute and rice fields are now a lake, the
waters unlikely to recede in time for another planting before
winter sets in.
	   ``We have been staying here since the British times'' in the
1940s, Abedin said. ``But we have never seen such floods before.''
	   Phalshatia's 26 families huddle along a roadside under tin roofs
sitting on damp sand. Only a few had built new walls for the roofs
salvaged from their homes.
	   Here and elsewhere across Bangladesh, dirty floodwater has
seeped into wells, contaminating drinking water. Most of the
villagers said they have diarrhea, which can lead to fatal
dehydration. Abedin said he was especially worried about the
children crowded around him.
	   Children are most at risk from serious diarrhea. At the Dhaka
hospital attached to the International Center for Diarrhea
Research, 80 percent of patients are youngsters. They lie
listlessly on cots covered with red or green plastic sheets, tubes
running from bags of rehydration solution to their wrists or
ankles. A few children have the distended bellies of malnutrition,
their heads appearing too large over thin chests.
	   The hospital serving the capital and surrounding areas has 250
beds, but treated as many as 850 patients a day during the worst of
the flooding in August.
	   According to government figures, 918 people died during the
flooding, most drowned or were buried in collapsed buildings. That
toll is a fraction of the numbers at risk in the flood's aftermath.
	   In a normal year, diarrhea kills 110,000 Bangladeshis, most of
them children. With this year's floods, the toll could be double
that. The country's Health Ministry has said diarrhea and other
waterborne diseases threaten 20 million Bangladeshis this year, and
the World Health Organization says the death rate could be as high
as one percent because of poor sanitation conditions due to
flooding.
	   Much of Dhaka was also flooded, but destruction was greater in
the countryside. Refugees from the villages are joining the
capital's already teeming shanty towns, looking for work, but in
most cases finding only a dry place on the pavement to sleep. More
than 33 million of the country's 120 million people were displaced
by flooding.

New Zealand reacts to record losing run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand rugby chiefs have
reacted to the All Blacks' record losing run by streamlining the
coaching and selection staff from five to three.
	   Head coach John Hart, who earlier survived moves to replace him
after his team's run of five straight defeats this season, will
take a more hands-on role with the backs while assistant coach
Peter Sloane, who will also become a selector, will focus on the
forwards.
	   Wayne Smith, assistant backs coach this season, has been
appointed to a new technical advisor's position while Gordon Hunter
will continue as a selector.
	   As expected Ross Cooper, a selector for the past six years and
tipped as a challenger to Hart, was the main casualty.
	   Cooper will take on full-time coaching duties with the Chiefs in
the Super 12 competition and then as coach of New Zealand A.
	   Cooper denied reports that he made threats of legal action
regarding his contract with the New Zealand Rugby Union.
	   ``All of the discussions between me, my legal counsel and the
NZRFU were amicable and constructive and have reached a positive
outcome,'' Cooper said Friday.
	   He will replace Graham Henry as New Zealand A coach with Henry
gone to Wales as its national coach.
	   New Zealand A will play the All Blacks in a trial match, a game
against France, as well as tour South Africa where it will play two
matches against South Africa A ahead of next year's World Cup.
	   ``Ross Cooper is one of our best coaches, no question about
that. He was a success with the Chiefs this year,'' NZRFU chairman
Rob Fisher said. ``He was keen to continue with the Chiefs and he
now has that. He has been a selector for six years and he obviously

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ The waters of Bangladesh are placid
now, but their reservoir of rage is evident everywhere.
	   Children emaciated by waterborne illnesses crowd hospitals,
thousands of homeless are camped out on the street, and stretches
of crumbling road are lined by abandoned trucks and cars, fringes
of river weed clinging to their undercarriages.
	   The floods finally began to recede in September after two months
_ the longest inundation in memory. Experts say it's a lingering
disaster for Bangladesh, with deadly disease, food shortages and a
crushing rebuilding bill ahead for one of the poorest countries in
the world.
	   ``The task ahead seems almost too huge to comprehend,'' the
International Red Cross said in its post-flood assessment.
	   ``Normally, we face floods every year,'' Bangladeshi Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina said in an interview. ``But this time,
damage is so colossal we cannot face it alone.''
	   Hasina has appealed for nearly dlrs 880 million in foreign aid.
Some is needed to buy rice and pay for other relief for those
affected. The bulk is needed to repair roads, schools, homes and
more.
	   By early October, nearly 70 countries and organizations ranging
from the tiny kingdom of Bhutan to several United Nations offices
had pledged a total of more than dlrs 200 million in cash, food,
and materials.
	   Government officials dismiss fears of famine, saying foreign aid
will help cover a grain shortfall estimated at more than 4.4
million tons. But Hasina acknowledged that because of the heavy
damage to roads, bridges and rail lines, authorities are facing
difficulty in getting food, water purification tablets, material
for building shelters and other help to the needy.
	   Floods chewed away much of the main highway leading south from
the capital, Dhaka, turning what is normally an eight-hour drive to
the main port city of Chittagong into 14 hours of swerving from
pothole to pothole. In all, the government said, nearly 10,000
miles (16,000 kilometers) of roads were damaged.
	   Farmer Zainul Abedin wonders what he will do when the food his
family and neighbors managed to put aside runs out. Their entire
village of Phalshatia, 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Dhaka,
is underwater. Their jute and rice fields are now a lake, the
waters unlikely to recede in time for another planting before
winter sets in.
	   ``We have been staying here since the British times'' in the
1940s, Abedin said. ``But we have never seen such floods before.''
	   Phalshatia's 26 families huddle along a roadside under tin roofs
sitting on damp sand. Only a few had built new walls for the roofs
salvaged from their homes.
	   Here and elsewhere across Bangladesh, dirty floodwater has
seeped into wells, contaminating drinking water. Most of the
villagers said they have diarrhea, which can lead to fatal
dehydration. Abedin said he was especially worried about the
children crowded around him.
	   Children are most at risk from serious diarrhea. At the Dhaka
hospital attached to the International Center for Diarrhea
Research, 80 percent of patients are youngsters. They lie
listlessly on cots covered with red or green plastic sheets, tubes
running from bags of rehydration solution to their wrists or
ankles. A few children have the distended bellies of malnutrition,
their heads appearing too large over thin chests.
	   The hospital serving the capital and surrounding areas has 250
beds, but treated as many as 850 patients a day during the worst of
the flooding in August.
	   According to government figures, 918 people died during the
flooding, most drowned or were buried in collapsed buildings. That
toll is a fraction of the numbers at risk in the flood's aftermath.
	   In a normal year, diarrhea kills 110,000 Bangladeshis, most of
them children. With this year's floods, the toll could be double
that. The country's Health Ministry has said diarrhea and other
waterborne diseases threaten 20 million Bangladeshis this year, and
the World Health Organization says the death rate could be as high
as one percent because of poor sanitation conditions due to
flooding.
	   Much of Dhaka was also flooded, but destruction was greater in
the countryside. Refugees from the villages are joining the
capital's already teeming shanty towns, looking for work, but in
most cases finding only a dry place on the pavement to sleep. More
than 33 million of the country's 120 million people were displaced
by flooding.

Vietnam to launch first libraries for the blind
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam is setting up its first library
facilities for the blind in the country's two biggest cities.
	   With government funding of 180 million dong (dlrs 13,000), the
Hanoi Library will be the first to offer services later this month
when conversion of a reading room is completed, Pham Thi Kim, the
library's deputy director, said Friday.
	   It initially will be equipped with 100 braille books, 20
cassette players with headphones and 500 cassettes, which will
provide patrons with works of literature and general knowledge.
	   Kim said the room will accommodate 20 people at a time, and
other rooms will be converted if there is demand. The library hopes
to add 100 Braille books each year, she said.
	   The Ho Chi Minh City General Science Library's reading room for
the blind, expected to get its first visitors in two months, will
target people pursuing higher knowledge.
	   It will be equipped with computers, and readers must have a fair
command of both that technology and English, said Huynh Ngoc Suong,
the library director.
	   Kim estimates Hanoi has some 6,000 blind people and Ho Chi Minh
City 3,000.

Philippines, United States sign second military agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos MLA101-102
 &UR; By CLARO CORTES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine and U.S. officials signed
an agreement Friday granting benefits to Filipino soldiers being
trained in the United States _ a sweetener for an earlier pact that
would allow a resumption of large joint military exercises in the
Philippines.
	   The earlier pact, the Visiting Forces Agreement, was signed in
February but must be approved by the Philippine Senate. Church and
leftist groups have opposed the agreement and the return of U.S.
forces.
	   Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said the second agreement,
which needs no ratification, will take effect only after the VFA is
approved. The VFA was submitted to the Senate on Wednesday but has
yet to be scheduled for debate.
	   The new agreement allows Filipino defense personnel being
trained in the United States to bring their dependents with them.
It also provides waivers of customs duties and federal taxation.
	   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Hubbard said American troops who visit
the Philippines for training would not enjoy similar benefits.
	   He said American soldiers will stay in the Philippines for at
most a month, while Filipino soldiers and their dependents will
stay in the United States for extended periods.
	   ``We are convinced that the VFA and counterpart agreement
together will enhance defense cooperation between the two
countries,'' Hubbard said. ``This in turn will contribute to peace
and stability in the region.''
	   Siazon said the rights under the new agreement are enjoyed only
by three other countries _ Israel, Spain and Singapore _ with
similar agreements with the United States.
	   The United States halted all major exercises in the Philippines
and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996, when the Manila
government ended a legal loophole that had shielded U.S. military
personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for crimes committed
here.
	   The VFA provides certain protections to U.S. troops in the
Philippines. Critics say it overly limits the Philippine
government's right to prosecute American soldiers who commit crimes
while in the country.
	   They say it also would promote prostitution.
	   The VFA generally gives the United States jurisdiction over
soldiers who commit crimes while on duty in the Philippines, and
the Philippines jurisdiction over crimes committed while off duty.
	   The Philippine Senate ordered the last U.S. base in the
Philippines to close in 1992, ending nearly a century of American
military presence in its former colony.

Philippine stock index surges 4.1 percent as yen continues to rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rose sharply Friday
in their fourth straight day of gains as most regional markets
continued to respond positively to the rising Japanese yen, traders
said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index jumped 50.95
points, or 4.1 percent, to 1,301.36, adding to Thursday's
37.66-point, or 3 percent, rise.
	   Since Tuesday, the index has gained a total of 134.82 points, or
12 percent.
	   Traders said the stronger yen eased pressure on other Asian
currencies which had been worsening the already dismal economic
outlook for the region and dragging down investor sentiment in
regional stock markets.
	   The dollar reached a low of 111.73 yen overnight in New York,
its lowest level in over a year.
	   ``The overnight yen gain was a great reprieve for Asian
financial markets,'' said Ian Kane, trader for Anscor-Hagedorn
Securities Inc.
	   He said the Japanese currency's advance provided a much-needed
boost to the peso. At midday, the dollar averaged 43.019 pesos,
down from Thursday's 43.486 pesos.
	   He said the strong showing of the peso was long overdue, having
been outperformed by other Southeast Asian currencies such as the
Thai baht.
	   However, concern remains over the quality of third quarter
corporate earnings, which are due toward the end of the month, Kane
said. The economic slowdown has put pressure on corporate earnings.
	   ``But such concern has more or less been discounted and this is
reflected in the stock prices,'' he said.
	   Gainers trounced decliners 73 to 22, while 34 issues were
unchanged.

Dollar drops against yen, Japanese stocks mixed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid afternoon currency and bond
prices

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar continued its plunge against the
yen Friday as hedge funds scrambled to stem losses from the
greenback's slide. Japanese stocks fell.
	   The dollar bought 116.86 yen as of midday, down 5.50 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of
119.05 yen overnight.
	   The dollar dove briefly to a 16-month low of 111.73 yen in
overnight trading from more than 135 yen earlier this week.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average fell 146.09 points, or 1.12
percent, to close at 12,879.97. On Thursday, the Nikkei index
closed at 13,026.06 points, down 799.55 points in its largest point
fall of the year.
	   The U.S. currency swung wildly as hedge funds _ known for
betting huge sums on world currency movements _ rapidly sold dollar
and then bought again as rumors swept the market.
	   But the overall trend remained down. The drop, which began
Wednesday as Japanese officials discussed new stimulus measures,
caught many hedge fund managers by surprise. Many had been betting
the dollar would rise against the Japanese currency.
	   When the dollar started to fall, they sold their holdings, only
fueling to the greenback's slide.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa attributed the rapid fall
partly to a correction in the Japanese currency's recent weakness,
adding that the central bank had no plans to intervene.
	   ``The yen has continued to decline since September of last year.
We're now at a time where it's acceptable to see a correction to
that. But the dollar's recent fall is a bit rough,'' Miyazawa told
a regular news conference.
	   On the Tokyo stock market, share prices were lower as exporters
were sold in reaction to the stronger Japanese currency. A higher
yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive abroad.
	   ``The apparent weakening of the U.S. economy is also drawing
selling of export shares,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manger of
trading at Tokyo Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 19.00 points, or 1.93 percent, to 982.50.
The TOPIX closed down 45.48 points, or 4.34 percent, the day
before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond edged up to 0.790 percent from Thursday's finish of
0.785 percent, driving its price down to 109.08 yen from 109.13.

Party chief warns of continuing commercialization trend
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam Communist Party chief Le Kha Phieu
has warned of increasing commercialization in local media.
	   Speaking Thursday at a conference of officials in charge of
culture, arts and media, Phieu said the trend is on the rise in
newspapers, magazines and books, including those targeted at
children.
	   He said there are signs that some media are straying from
editorial policy and avoiding political issues which need to be
targeted as a reflection of Vietnam's will.
	   Some media organizations have lowered their standards to attract
readers with sensational stories to make a profit, hurting national
cultural tradition, he said.
	   Phieu said local media has done a good job in fighting
corruption and covering violations of freedom and democracy by a
number of party members and cadres.
	   In Vietnam, the media is under tight party and government
control, and Phieu said that will continue.
	   ``Throughout different stages of the revolution, the party
maintains its principle of direct leadership over the media,'' he
said.

Egar defends himself and points finger at the ICC
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former Australian cricket team manager
Colin Egar has rejected claims that he didn't believe Australian
players' allegations of bribery, and has accused the International
Cricket Council of inaction on the issue.
	   Egar was manager of Australia's 1994 tour of Pakistan. Four
months after the tour ended, reports surfaced that three players _
Mark Waugh, Shane Warne and Tim May _ claimed that Pakistan's Salim
Malik tried to bribe them to play badly.
	   The issue is subject of a hearing in Lahore and Waugh and
captain Mark Taylor told it this week that they informed Egar
immediately of the alleged bribery attempt.
	   Pakistan authorities are questioning why the issue wasn't raised
with them directly _ they found out when the story was broken by a
newspaper in early 1995, four months after the alleged incident.
Former Pakistan Cricket Board member Nusrat Azeem told the
Lahore-based judicial commission that he had asked Egar why
Pakistan cricket authorities weren't told of the claims when they
were made on the 1994 tour there.
	   ``Egar said it was not brought to my notice because not much
credence should be paid to this,'' Azeem reportedly told the
hearing Thursday. ``He said it was an attempt to fracture the
Pakistan cricket team.''
	   Azeem said he was a friend of Egar, but the Australian said he
was not certain that they had met and could not recall having a
conversation with the Pakistani.
	   ``I think I probably do know him because I know a lot of
Pakistanis over the number of times I've been to Pakistan, but no,
I don't recall it,'' Egar said Friday. ``What's more, I was rather
annoyed about the whole thing that happened over there so I
certainly think this comment that was made by him was absolute
rubbish.''
	   Egar had immediately passed the allegations on to ICC chief
executive David Richards who was in Pakistan at the time.
	   ``When I heard about it, of course, it's just one of those
things that one has to listen to and from there just hope that
well, it's not true or if it is true, let somebody prove it and I
think at the time the ICC should have taken a hold on the whole
allegations,'' Egar said.
	   Asked why he thought Azeem made the comments about Egar
rejecting the allegations, Egar said, ``personally, I think it's a
bit of a circus and probably it's just adding to the circus.''
	   Meanwhile May, now retired from playing and the president of the
Australian Cricketers' Association, also criticized the ICC.
	   ``I think it's been handled poorly from the start,'' said May.
``We gave sworn statements in 1995 and we stick by every word of
them.''

Japan considers way to get consumers to spend: coupons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese shoppers, get out your scissors. Desperate
for measures to spur the stagnant economy, the government is
considering yet another way of getting thrifty consumers to spend:
coupons.
	   The idea is still in its infancy. But with tax-cuts so far
failing to jump-start Japan's comatose consumption rate, officials
are casting about for just about any idea to get folks to part with
some yen.
	   At its bare bones, the idea is to provide gift certificates to
consumers _ with an expiration date to make sure they get used
quickly. Officials are not yet sure whether all consumers would get
them.
	   The idea has high-powered backing. It was first proposed by the
Komei opposition party, but Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and other
ruling party leaders have shown interest.
	   Some, however, are skeptical. After all, there is no guarantee
consumers would not just spend the coupons on essentials and put
more money in their burgeoning savings accounts.
	   The director-general of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, for
example, said Friday that the government should ``cautiously
consider'' the voucher idea.
	   ``There are various technical problems with the implementation
of gift coupon measures, and it's unclear how it will bolster the
economy,'' Taichi Sakaiya said.
	   Such technical problems are how and who can receive merchandise
coupons, and whether there won't be legal problems, for example, in
cashing in such coupons instead of buying goods, Sakaiya said.
	   Kyodo News agency reported Friday the government was studying a
1 trillion yen (dlrs 8.6 billion) proposal for possible inclusion
in a second extra budget for fiscal 1998, which ends next March.
	   But it could be postponed and become part of the initial budget
for fiscal 1999, if local governments _ which would administer the
actual issuance _ take longer than expected to prepare, the report
said.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa was quoted by Kyodo as saying
Friday morning that no details had been worked out.

Shares of Long-Term Credit Bank plunge to 7 yen (6 cents) per
</HEADLINE>
share &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Stock of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan plunged 42 percent to an all-time low of 7 yen (6 cents)
Friday, a day after its expected merger partner suggested the deal
was dead.
	   Shareholders rushed to sell the stock after Sumitomo Trust and
Banking Co. president Atsushi Takahashi said Thursday that the
in-house group set up to plan the merger with LTCB would begin
looking into other possible tie-ups.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank, one of Japan's biggest lenders, has been
rumored to be on the verge of collapse since summer. The bank, like
many others in Japan, is struggling under the weight of failed real
estate loans.
	   In June, LTCB announced it was in talks to merge with Sumitomo
Trust _ a move that was widely regarded as a government-directed
bailout.
	   But Japan's ruling and main opposition parties have recently
agreed to a new mechanism to support ailing banks with public
funds.
	   Under the new legislation, now being deliberated in the nation's
upper house, LTCB will be nationalized temporarily and its bad
loans will be sold.
	   In a news conference on Thursday, Takahashi said his bank had
expanded its ``options'' and would consider other alliances if it
gave up on the plan to merge with LTCB.
	   On Thursday, LTCB shares closed at 12 yen (10 cents) per share,
the previous record low.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian authorities have cracked down on poachers
in the Russian Far East, confiscating 24 tons of salmon and one ton
of red caviar during the fall fishing season, a news report said
Friday.
	   Much of the poaching takes place on the Amur River outside the
city of Khabarovsk, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Authorities have also confiscated 30 kilometers (19 miles) of
fishing nets, and shut down two illegal canning plants that were
processing the red caviar that comes from the salmon, the report

Schroeder pushes economic program further, promising tax cut

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder has
taken the first step toward overhauling German taxes, which are
often seen as a heavy burden on Europe's biggest economy.
	   Schroeder's Social Democrats and their likely junior partner,
the Greens party, agreed Thursday on the outlines of reform,
including tax relief for average wage earners and businesses but
also a commitment to raise energy taxes over the next four years to
finance a cut in other levies.
	   With both parties hoping that lower taxes will bring down
double-digit unemployment, the project could be key to the success
of Schroeder's administration, Germany's first center-left
government in 16 years. Since coalition talks began last week, the
two parties have already agreed to launch a government program to
find work for 100,000 young people trying to enter the job market.
	   In the toughest bargaining so far in talks on forming a new
government, the Social Democrats on Thursday smothered a dispute
over the environmentalist Greens' call for a broad rise in energy
prices, including a sharp hike in the gasoline tax.
	   The Social Democrats' chairman, Oskar Lafontaine, said only that
both sides ``agreed to tackle the ecological tax reform'' in the
new parliament's four-year term. Exact numbers still need to be
worked out.
	   The idea, a bugbear for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's outgoing
government, unsettles industry and many voters in this car-crazy
nation. Schroeder has said he will only allow an increase of 6
pfennigs (3.75 cents) per liter, much less than the Greens want.
Anything more would hurt the auto industry, says Schroeder, who
sits on the supervisory board at Volkswagen.
	   The Social Democrats' general secretary, Franz Muentefering,
again ruled out Friday any ``unacceptable leaps'' in gas prices.
The Social Democrats don't want too big a hike in gas taxes, he
said on German television, because ``mobility remains a
prerequisite for the growth of our industrial society.''
	   A tax cut would fulfill a major campaign pledge of the Social
Democrats. Leaders of the two parties said their plan calls for 10
billion marks (dlrs 6.2 billion) in tax relief for individuals over
four years, to be offset partly by closing loopholes for the
well-off in Germany's highly complicated tax laws.
	   A crucial part of the reform is lowering the heavy social
security contributions that companies must legally make for their
employees, which both parties see as a way to create jobs.
	   A cornerstone of the social welfare state, the non-wage costs
make workers expensive and tend to hurt Germany's competitiveness.
Under the plan, higher taxes on fossil fuels would make up for the
lost revenue.
	   Schroeder has insisted he plans no major tax increases despite a
budget gap of more than 20 billion marks (dlrs 12.5 billion) he
says he is inheriting from the outgoing government.
	   With the incoming government also stressing fiscal prudence,
that leaves uncertain the prospects for financing other campaign
pledges, such as a boost in aid to families with children.
	   Schroeder invited the Greens into his government after he ousted
Kohl in a Sept. 27 election. Coalition talks are to run through
next week, and Cabinet posts are to be announced at the end.

Muslims stage anti-government rally outside mosque

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Shouting for political reform and
holding posters that demanded ``Mahathir Quit,'' more than a
hundred Muslims rallied outside a mosque Friday in support of
ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Defying a police ban on political gatherings, the demonstrators
marched along a road near the country's top university, the
University of Malaya, after attending Friday prayers at a nearby
mosque.
	   Men with scarves tied around their faces chanted ``Allah
Akbar!'' _ a Muslim rallying cry meaning ``God is Great!'' _ and
women with full-face veils waved posters with anti-government
slogans.
	   One poster said: ``Mahathir, thanks for everything. It's
enough.''
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has ruled for 17 years,
dismissed Anwar as his deputy on Sept. 2, saying he was morally
unfit to lead. The two had differed over economic policy, and Anwar
has said Mahathir feared he posed a leadership threat.
	   Anwar has since been arrested on 10 counts of corruption and
illegal homosexual acts, and is to go on trial Nov. 2. He has
denied all the charges.
	   Support for the political dissident has swelled in recent weeks,
particularly among the country's majority Muslim population. An
opposition coalition planned a rally later Friday in the southern
state of Johor at the regional headquarters of the Islamic
opposition group, Parti Islam SeMalaysia, known as PAS.
	   The Malaysian People's Justice Movement, a fledgling coalition
of opposition parties and private groups, said it expected a
turnout of 15,000 people at the gathering, part of a nationwide
tour to demand reform.
	   The coalition has rallied a growing number of supporters in
calls for justice for Anwar and for repeal of the harsh Internal
Security Act, under which he was arrested Sept. 20.
	   On Tuesday, the group staged a rally in the eastern state of
Pahang that drew 10,000 people. Thousands of postcards addressed to
the prime minister were circulated, demanding that Mahathir hold a
general election or step down. Organizers said similar gatherings
were planned in northern states.
	   Authorities, meanwhile, revoked permission for the group to hold
a mass rally Oct. 17 at the capital's new national stadium, said
Mahfuz Omar, a chief organizer of the fledgling coalition and a top
PAS official.
	   Mahfuz said stadium officials told him Thursday the venue needed
maintenance and repairs and could not be used for the planned
rally, despite earlier permission.
	   The rally was planned to counter another one scheduled Saturday
at the same stadium by Malaysia's governing coalition, intended to
bolster support for Mahathir.
	   Police, however, banned the pro-government rally earlier this
week, citing security reasons. The ruling followed a spate of
street protests after Anwar's ouster, when thousands of people
clogged the streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur, many demanding reform
and Mahathir's resignation.
	   Mahathir, Asia's longest serving ruler, was quoted in a
Singapore newspaper Friday as saying he was prepared to retire from
politics once the nation's economy stabilized.
	   The Straits Times said in a front-page report that Mahathir told
a closed-door meeting of grassroots supporters Thursday ``that he
was prepared to step down after 17 years as prime minister of
Malaysia, once the economy stabilizes.''
	   ``They roared in disapproval and urged him to stay on,'' the
newspaper account added.

Singapore police arrest 94 in island-wide drug bust
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's Central Narcotics Bureau has
arrested 94 people in island-wide drug raids, a newspaper reported
Friday.
	   A series of simultaneous raids across the city-state Thursday
targeted addicts and drug users, said The Straits Times. It said 44
of those detained tested positive for drug use.
	   No details on the amount of drugs confiscated in the operation
were given, and officials from the bureau were unavailable for
comment Friday.
	   Thursday's operation involved more than 100 officers, and was
``a systematic way to hunt down drug absconders who have relapsed
and are likely to be pushing drugs to sustain their habits,'' Tan
Seck Kang, the bureau's deputy director, was quoted as saying.
	   In the first nine months of this year, the bureau conducted 11
such nationwide raids, in which 1,721 drug offenders were arrested,
Tan said.
	   He added that since Singapore amended its Misuse of Drugs Act in
July, introducing harsher penalties for repeat offenders, 162
hard-core addicts had been jailed and caned.
	   Under previous rules, they faced fines and further drug
rehabilitation.

Iranian foreign minister arrives in Turkey to mediate Syrian
</HEADLINE>
crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The Iranian foreign minister met with his
Turkish counterpart in Ankara Friday in a bid to seek a peaceful
resolution to a mounting crisis between Turkey and Syria over
Kurdish rebels.
	   Turkey's Parliament on Wednesday issued an ultimatum to Syria,
demanding that it expel Turkish Kurdish rebels from its territory
or ``face the consequences.'' Turkish reports suggested pinpoint
air strikes on suspected rebel bases in the Syrian controlled-Bekaa
Valley of Lebanon were possible.
	   Syria denies the accusations and Turkey's harsh rhetoric has
raised fears of a regional conflict.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi's visit came a day after
he discussed the issue with Syrian President Hafez Assad in
Damascus. Private NTV television said on Friday that Kharrazi could
be bringing a message from Assad.
	   After meeting with Assad, Kharrazi said ``expanding the crisis
would not be in the interest of the region and the Islamic world.''
	   Iran entered mediation efforts in its role as the head of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, a 55-member group that
includes Syria and Turkey. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak also
shuttled between the two countries earlier this week.
	   But Turkey accuses Iran of also turning a blind eye to the
Kurdish rebel presence on its territory along the Turkish border.
	   ``The rebels enter Iranian territory from northern Iraq and
stage cross-border attacks from there,'' Deputy Premier Bulent
Ecevit told reporters on Thursday.
	   Turkish authorities have made clear their preference for a
diplomatic solution but Premier Mesut Yilmaz said ending the
tension was up to Syria.
	   Ankara has asked Syria to extradite rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan, who resides in Damascus according to Turkish intelligence
reports. Turkey also wants Syria to put an end to its support to
the rebels, who are fighting for autonomy within Turkey.
	   The Turkish-Kurdish war has claimed some 37,000 lives since
1984.

Paris region transport strike continues for a fourth day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with strike spreading to northern France, traffic
defense around Paris, accidents, color, quote &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A transport strike severely disrupted traffic on
Paris commuter lines for a fourth day Friday despite tough new
measures to curb violence on public transport.
	   On Thursday evening, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin announced
proposals to curb violence on public transport in an effort to calm
striking train drivers who want protection from juvenile crime.
	   The strike spread Friday to northern France, where train drivers
in Lille staged a surprise walkout, tying up regional traffic and
service on the high-speed TGV.
	   In Paris, nearly all suburban traffic on both regular rail and
high speed commuter lines were virtually at a standstill Friday.
Traffic was backed up before dawn on highways leading to the city
as people left home early to try to get to work on time.
	   At the Maisons-Laffitte station west of Paris, commuters jumped
on any train headed toward the capital.
	   ``I don't know where this train is going _ as long as it gets to
Paris,'' said Alice Longeuil, a secretary.
	   Traffic jams stretched up to 20 kilometers (19 miles) outside
Paris. Two accidents snarled traffic further.
	   The train authority, the SNCF, said there would be no trains
Friday at four Paris stations _ Est, Nord, Lyon and Montparnasse,
which serve most points of entry into the capital. Several other
suburban lines also were affected by the walkout to varying
degrees.
	   The Socialist prime minister said the attitude of youths
responsible for violence on the public transport system ``is
absurd'' and ``self-destructive'' because they hurt those who serve
them _ bus drivers and metro and train conductors.
	   ``These acts will be punished,'' Jospin said in an interview on
state-run television.
	   Jospin said the penal code will be revised to deal more harshly
with violence toward transport workers. And inspectors who
currently check tickets will be able to verify identities of
passengers, Jospin said, adding they would be ``aided by police
officers.''
	   He also said justice would be swift for suspected offenders.
	   There was some relief in the capital with bus services resuming
Thursday after a two-day walkout. The city's RATP transit system
deployed two more companies of CRS elite police on their bus lines,
prompting drivers to return to work.
	   The Metro was not affected.
	   The walkout was triggered by an attack Monday on the RER C line,
in which a worker was beaten with a spray can after he tried to
stop youths from vandalizing a station. The attacks, in which
drivers are jumped by gangs of youths, often happen in poor suburbs
with high unemployment.
	   Statistics show urban violence has risen by 400 percent in the
past six years.
	   About 9 million people in the Paris area use public transit
daily.

Lawmakers take giant step toward Islamic rule in Pakistan
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani lawmakers took a giant step
Friday toward creating a new Islamic order in this economically
troubled nation of 140 million people.
	   The National Assembly, the powerful lower House of Parliament,
voted 151 to 16 to pass a constitutional amendment giving the
federal government sweeping powers to interpret and impose laws
based on interpretations of the Muslim holy book, the Koran.
	   But before the amendment can become law, it requires a
two-thirds majority in the Senate, something Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif may have difficulty acquiring.
	   While his ruling Pakistan Muslim League controls a two-thirds
majority in the lawmaking National Assembly, it does not have the
votes to pass the amendment in the Senate.
	   Some political analysts said Sharif may seek a vote in a joint
session of the two houses, where he would likely be able to muster
the required number of votes.
	   The opposition, led by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto,
warned that the government could use the amendment to overturn laws
passed by Pakistan's four provincial governments.
	   Naveed Qamar, a spokesman for Ms. Bhutto's party in Parliament,
warned that the amendment supersedes the constitution of Pakistan.
	   Asfandyar Wali Khan, a member of the Awami National Party and a
strong opponent of the amendment, said it effectively meant ``the
abrogation'' of the constitution.
	   In a surprising move, lawmakers withdrew a clause in the
amendment that promised the country's minorities that their
``personal law, religious freedom, traditions or customs ... and
status as citizens'' would be protected.
	   There was no debate on the decision to delete the clause.
	   Members of Pakistan's minority religious groups have strongly
condemned the amendment, warning that it could be used to
discriminate against non-Muslims, something the government already
promised would not happen.
	   But minority religious groups and human rights groups already
have fought strenuously to have existing Islamic laws, like a
blasphemy law, repealed.
	   Opponents of the amendment have warned that it will give
strength to militant members of radical Islamic groups in Pakistan,
who will try to force their interpretation of Islam on lawmakers.
	   Ms. Bhutto's party as well as other opposition parties have
warned that the amendment can pave the way for a strict Islamic
regime, not unlike neighboring Pakistan where Taliban religious
militia rule with an iron hand.
	   However, Information Minister Mushahid Hussein earlier said his
government was a ``liberal Muslim'' government that opposed
fundamentalism.
	   Outside Parliament on Friday representatives of women's groups
condemned the bill and waved placards saying: ``defeat this bill .
. . protect women. We have rights.''
	   Inside the grand marble legislature, Qamar said already the
government ministers have questioned the Islamic credentials of
those who oppose the bill.
	   Khan said ``we don't need any certificate to be a Muslim ...
this bill is going to put you into total confusion.''

Summit of Cambodian leaders likely as negotiations remain
</HEADLINE>
deadlocked &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Negotiations to form Cambodia's next
government stalled again Friday, and support grew for King Norodom
Sihanouk to chair a second summit of party leaders.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen's party, a narrow winner in the July 26
elections, publicized its wish Thursday for negotiations to proceed
at the highest level, calling on senior opposition party leader
Prince Norodom Ranariddh to return from Thailand.
	   The proposal was formally presented in Friday's ``working
group'' session as Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party and the
two-party opposition again failed to find any common ground. Hun
Sen's party needs outside cooperation since it did not win the
two-thirds of parliamentary seats needed to form the government
alone.
	   An opposition negotiator said the summit proposal would have to
be approved by Ranariddh _ who has stayed in Bangkok since
parliament's ceremonial opening on Sept. 24 _ but it would be
difficult to turn down if the king agreed to help break the
deadlock.
	   ``Of course if the king wishes to call us, we will
participate,'' said Prince Sisowath Sirirath, a senior official in
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party.
	   Three working group sessions since the election have yielded no
substantial progress.
	   The ruling party is eager to see a new administration installed
so the government can regain the legitimacy it lost when Hun Sen
ousted Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a violent coup last year.
	   But the opposition claims that Hun Sen's electoral victory was
achieved through fraud and intimidation. The two parties insist
that their allegations must be thoroughly investigated before
parliament holds its first official meeting.
	   Ruling party negotiator Sok An complained Friday that the
opposition, especially the party led by former Finance Minister Sam
Rainsy, has increased its demands at each working group session
rather than attempting to reach a compromise.
	   ``They did not respect the spirit of the negotiations so we will
go back to the summit,'' Sok An said.
	   The king presided at a summit last month at his Siem Reap
residence, attended by Hun Sen, Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, that led
to the convening of parliament.
	   At Hun Sen's request, Sihanouk since has delayed a planned trip
to Beijing for medical treatment. He arrived in Phnom Penh on
Monday.
	   Hun Sen's side has pushed for parliament to hold its first
official session so it can elect its officers.
	   FUNCINPEC, which holds the interim position of parliamentary
dean because it has the oldest member of the new parliament, has
argued that it should not open until a comprehensive deal is
reached.
	   A major stumbling block is the parliament's presidency, which is
coveted by both Hun Sen's party and FUNCINPEC.
	   The president of parliament controls legislative sessions and
becomes acting head of state when the king is outside the country.

World Bank's first Singapore dollar bond issue snapped up in two
</HEADLINE>
days &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The World Bank's first Singapore
dollar-denominated bond issue was snapped up just two days after
its launch, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The bank's investment arm, the International Finance Corp.,
became the first foreign institution to issue triple-A Singapore
dollar-denominated bonds, a move expected to boost Singapore's
efforts to develop its fledgling debt market.
	   Launched Monday, the three-year bonds, worth 300 million
Singapore dollars (dlrs 183 million) in denominations of 250,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 152,000), were completely sold by
Wednesday, Citicorp Investment Bank director Cynthia Teong told The
Straits Times.
	   Citicorp manages and underwrites this bond issue, which sold out
well in advance of the Oct. 28 settlement date, the deadline for
their purchase.
	   Expected to be listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore, the
bonds are triple-A rated, meaning they carry the lowest possible
risk of default.
	   Teong said the sale of the bonds was ``unusually fast,'' adding
that the customers had comprised ``over 40 institutional investors
and high net-worth individuals.''
	   ``Normally, it would take a week or two, but for this issue, it
took just two days,'' Teong said.
	   The bonds carry a coupon of 4.5 percent paid semi-annually.

Holbrooke heads back to Belgrade, rebels call cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Holbrooke comments after arrival in
Belgrade, fresh comment by Cooke; EDITS. &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
returned to Belgrade on Friday to give President Slobodan Milosevic
another chance to comply with a U.N. resolution on Kosovo or face
NATO airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke, who arrived from London where he attended a meeting
of the Contact Group, was scheduled to meet Milosevic at noon (1000
GMT) to persuade him again to halt his crackdown in Kosovo and
avoid an attack by the Atlantic alliance.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared a united NATO
stands ready to authorize bombing of the Serbs for their military
actions in Kosovo. She dispatched Holbrooke back to Belgrade to
warn Milosevic that ``time is all but gone'' for a peaceful
settlement.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 250,000
people have been driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a
crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army, which is fighting for independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by KLA ``terrorists.''
	   In an apparent bid to undercut that claim, the KLA announced a
unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo starting Friday. The move
will add to the pressure on Milosevic to reciprocate.
	   Holbrooke, who arrived in Belgrade after 3 a.m. (0100 GMT), told
Associated Press Television News about the meeting in London:
``There was unanimous support in both NATO and the Contact Group
foreign ministers, including Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov,
for the efforts that are now under way for a compliance and
verification structure, for full compliance with the U.N. Security
Council resolution.''
	   He also said that among NATO members, movement toward
authorizing the use of force continued ``in a sustained and intense
manner.''
	   ``The situation remains just as serious at it has been before,''
Holbrooke said.
	   Milosevic has refused to openly declare a cease-fire, even
though there has been no major fighting in Kosovo during the past
week and the KLA has been largely routed. He considers the Kosovo
rebels ``terrorists and bandits,'' and any cease-fire on his part
would legitimize them as a negotiating partner, one of his
associates said on condition of anonymity.
	   The Serbian and Yugoslav governments showed little sign that
they are prepared to bow to international pressure, apparently
gambling that Russian opposition to a NATO attack will persuade key
alliance members, including Germany and Italy, to block any action.
	   Milosevic's spokesman, Ivica Dacic, insisted Thursday that NATO
threats were a ``rapist act'' and that the government has met the
conditions laid down last month by the U.N. Security Council.
	   Serbia's fiery vice premier, Vojislav Seselj, was more blunt.
	   ``NATO soldiers may possibly enter our country as combatants but
they will leave it in coffins,'' Seselj said Thursday. He warned
other countries in the region not to provide any help to NATO or
``they will also be considered our enemy and would have to face the
consequences.''
	   Despite Belgrade's claims of compliance, the United States
contends that 60 percent of the troops sent to Kosovo to crush the
independence movement remain in the province, as do all but 1,000
of the 10,000 special police, some of whom are accused of
committing atrocities against civilians.
	   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook emerged from a
meeting of the six-nation Contact Group warning of ``grave
consequences'' if Yugoslavia does not end the ``humanitarian
crisis'' in Kosovo that has claimed hundreds of lives.
	   Talking to the British Broadcasting Crop radio Friday morning,
Cooke added:
	   ``We have made it perfectly plain that NATO's planning is not
for one rap over the knuckles. NATO's planning is for, if
necessary, successive, coordinated attacks which would make sure
that President Milosevic could not continue to deploy the heavy
military that he has in Kosovo.''
	   While Britain and the United States strongly back military
action against the Serbs, international support is lukewarm.
Russia, in particular, has been the most critical, warning that
NATO action would lead to further bloodshed in Kosovo.

50 Syrian workers injured after rape of 17-year-old girl
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Townspeople enraged by reports that a
17-year-old girl was raped by two foreigners attacked Syrian
laborers in a mountain town, injuring 54 and forcing the army to
intervene, security officials said Friday.
	   The attacks began after two men identified only as foreign
workers broke into a house Thursday morning in the Sunni Muslim
town of Chehim and allegedly raped the girl, said the Lebanese
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   As news of the rape spread, along with rumors that the men were
Syrian, townspeople began moving through Chehim in the afternoon,
beating Syrian workers with fists, sticks and stones. Two of the 54
workers were injured seriously.
	   The Lebanese army sent troops to restore order in the evening in
the village, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) southeast of Beirut.
	   Lebanon, with a population 3.2 million, is host to close to 1
million Syrian laborers who work mainly in construction and
agriculture. Syria also maintains 30,000 troops in Lebanon and
dominates the country's politics, but some resent their presence.
	   There were no reports of arrests in the village of 25,000. About
2,000 Syrians work there, the officials said.

Security officer killed in attack on Iranian Cultural Center
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Gunmen attacked the Iranian Cultural
Center in Punjab province Friday killing a Pakistani security guard
and wounding a second guard, the authorities said.
	   No one took immediate responsibility for the attack in Multan,
some 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of the Punjab capital of
Lahore in eastern Pakistan.
	   Police said gunmen drove past the cultural center and opened
fire with automatic rifles early Friday. One security guard died
immediately, while a second man was in critical condition in a
nearby hospital.
	   Police officers refused to speculate on a motive. But militant
Sunni Muslims have been implicated in previous attacks on Iranians.
Most Iranians are Shiite Muslims, which is a minority Islamic sect
in Pakistan.
	   The violent rivalry between Sunni and Shiite Muslims in Pakistan
involves only a small number of people in the country but police
officials say they are heavily armed.
	   Late last month Iran withdrew dozens of nonessential staff from
its embassy in the federal capital of Islamabad citing security
concerns.

Hardliner to be named foreign minister, says Israel radio
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told U.S.
and Palestinian officials that he plans to name Cabinet hawk Ariel
Sharon foreign minister, Israel radio said Friday.
	   Sharon, presently the minister for national infrastructure, is a
member of Netanyahu's ``kitchen cabinet,'' with Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordecai and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky. That body is
supposed to make key decisions about negotiations with the
Palestinians. He has consistently opposed compromise in the talks.
	   A official close to Sharon said the decision to appoint him as
foreign minister is in the hands of the prime minister, but that it
is expected to be soon.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sharon
would accept the position only if he will be in charge of
negotiations with the Palestinians for a permanent peace treaty.
	   Sharon, an ex-general in the Israeli army and a recognized war
hero, was removed from office as defense minister in 1983 by an
Israeli tribunal looking into the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
He was found indirectly responsible for a massacre of Lebanese
civilians by Christian Lebanese militiamen in two Beirut refugee
camps under Israeli control.
	   He remained a key figure in Israeli politics because of his
grass-roots support among hardliners here. His appointment as
foreign minister, which would complete his political
rehabilitation, might shore up Netanyahu's support among Israeli
hawks as he moves toward an agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Israel radio said Netanyahu told U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright of the pending appointment during her two-day
visit here this week, and also informed officials in Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority, including negotiator Ahmed Qureia.
	   Netanyahu and Arafat are to travel to Washington next week for a
summit meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who hopes to
complete an agreement over a long-delayed Israeli pullback from
part of the West Bank, clearing the way for talks on a permanent
peace treaty.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Linda McCartney's death from breast cancer earlier
this year had a ``staggering'' impact on women living in fear of
the disease, a leading cancer charity says in this week's British
Medical Journal.
	   During the week after the wife of former Beatle Paul McCartney
died, the number of daily calls to CancerBACUP doubled, said the
charity's chief executive, Jean Mossman. Calls relating to breast
cancer in particular went up 64 percent, she said.
	   ``This surge in demand shows just how powerful an effect a
celebrity's death can have on the public,'' Ms. Mossman wrote in
the medical journal. ``When Linda McCartney died, the level of
response we recorded was staggering.''
	   Many women calling the charity were in a highly anxious state,
especially those diagnosed at the same time as Mrs. McCartney who
were forced to face their own mortality, the charity said.
	   ``The result was a tremendous need for information, emotional
support and reassurance,'' Ms. Mossman and her colleagues said.

British prime minister urges stronger safety nets for the poor

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Friday
urged nations in financial turmoil to ``keep their nerve'' and hold
fast to prudent fiscal policies, while strengthening social safety
nets for the poor.
	   Addressing a group of business leaders in Hong Kong, Blair said
the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and other agencies must
help strengthen social support systems, public health and education
in countries swept by a deepening financial crisis.
	   ``People have lost their jobs, their homes, their savings
because of a crisis that certainly had nothing to do with any
failings on their part,'' he added.
	   ``We must show that globalization has more to offer the poor
than insecurity.''
	   Blair arrived in former British colony Friday for a two-day
visit, the last stop on his China tour. The visit is his first
since he attended ceremonies in July 1997 when Britain returned
Hong Kong to Chinese rule.
	   In his address, Blair reiterated that China and Britain have
entered a new era, with much of the suspicion and bitterness over
Hong Kong in the past 156 years behind them.
	   ``The chill of the period before the Hong Kong handover has been
replaced by a genuine warmth and recognition that Britain and China
can be partners in the modern world,'' he said.
	   He also reiterated Britain's commitment to the future
development of Hong Kong, and said the territory would be able to
benefit from warming Sino-British ties.
	   Although he praised Hong Kong's resilience amid the financial
crisis, Blair noted that Hong Kong ``has not been able to isolate
itself'' from the loss of confidence in global markets.
	   ``This turmoil in world markets has dramatically underscored the
interdependence of today's world economy,'' Blair said.
	   Blair quietly endorsed the Hong Kong government's support for
maintaining the 15-year-old currency peg to the U.S. dollar, saying
it ``underpinned stability and confidence.''
	   In August, the Hong Kong government came under fire when it
spent an estimated U.S. dlrs 15 billion in a stock-buying spree to
support falling share prices and keep speculators at bay.
	   ``I understand their decision. They need to safeguard the
long-term financial stability and economic success for Hong Kong,''
Blair wrote in a letter to Hong Kong newspapers.
	   Blair was scheduled to meet Friday with Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa and opposition leader Martin Lee, head of the Democratic
Party and a veteran lawmaker.

Lawmakers take giant step toward Islamic rule in Pakistan

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani lawmakers took a giant step
Friday toward creating a new Islamic order in this economically
troubled nation of 140 million people.
	   The National Assembly, the powerful lower House of Parliament,
voted 151 to 16 to pass a constitutional amendment giving the
federal government sweeping powers to interpret and impose laws
based on interpretations of the Muslim holy book, the Koran.
	   ``I congratulate the nation on the passage of the bill which
will help create a truly Islamic system,'' said Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif in a speech following the vote.
	   But before the amendment can become law, it requires a
two-thirds majority in the Senate, something Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif may have difficulty acquiring.
	   While his ruling Pakistan Muslim League controls a two-thirds
majority in the lawmaking National Assembly, it does not have the
votes to pass the amendment in the Senate.
	   Some political analysts said Sharif may seek a vote in a joint
session of the two houses, where he would likely be able to muster
the required number of votes.
	   The opposition, led by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto,
warned that the government could use the amendment to overturn laws
passed by Pakistan's four provincial governments.
	   Naveed Qamar, a spokesman for Ms. Bhutto's party in Parliament,
warned that the amendment supersedes the constitution of Pakistan.
	   Asfandyar Wali Khan, a member of the Awami National Party and a
strong opponent of the amendment, said it effectively meant ``the
abrogation'' of the constitution.
	   In a surprising move, lawmakers withdrew a clause in the
amendment that promised the country's minorities that their
``personal law, religious freedom, traditions or customs ... and
status as citizens'' would be protected.
	   There was no debate on the decision to delete the clause.
	   However, in his speech to Parliament Sharif made a promise to
members of Pakistan's minority religious groups.
	   ``I assure the religious minorities that it is my prime
responsibility to protect their rights,'' he said. ``Islam is a
religion which has always recognized the rights of minorities.''
	   But members of Pakistan's minority religious groups have
strongly condemned the amendment, warning that it could be used to
discriminate against non-Muslims, something the government already
promised would not happen.
	   Minority religious groups and human rights groups already have
fought strenuously to have existing Islamic laws, like a blasphemy
law, repealed.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing bond, late afternoon currency;

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks fell for a second day Friday as the
dollar's continuing slide against the yen darkened profit outlooks
at top exporters and dragged the benchmark average to a 13-year
low.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average tumbled 146.09 points, or 1.12 percent,
closing at 12,879.97 _ its lowest finish since December 1985.
	   On Thursday, the average had plunged 799.55 points in its
largest points fall of the year.
	   The dollar bought 117.20 yen as of late afternoon, down 5.16 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 119.05 yen overnight.
	   A weaker dollar hurts Japanese exporters by making their
products more expensive overseas and eroding the yen value of
profits earned abroad.
	   Computer giant NEC was among the most heavily traded shares,
dropping 7.4 percent as 8.3 million shares changed hands.
	   Honda Motor lost 14 percent and another auto-related exporter,
tire maker Bridgestone Corp., fell 16 percent for the day.
	   ``With foreign exchange rates so volatile, investors are staying
away from shares of exporters,'' said Setsuo Nagao, a manager at
the stock section of Tokyo Securities Co.
	   Trading was brisk, totaling an estimated 581 million shares on
the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Declines outnumbered
gains 3 to 2.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 19.00 points, or 1.93 percent, at 982.50. It
had fallen 4.34 percent the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar continued its dive against the yen as
U.S.-based hedge funds _ known for betting huge sums on world
currency movements _ scrambled to stem losses from the greenback's
slide.
	   The dollar dived briefly to a 16-month low of 111.73 yen in
overnight trading from more than 135 yen earlier this week. In
Tokyo Friday, it traded between 115.10 and 119.60 yen.
	   The drop, which began Wednesday amid reports Japan might soon
adopt new spending measures to boost its economy, caught many hedge
fund managers by surprise, traders said.
	   They had been betting the dollar would rise against the Japanese
currency. But when the dollar started to fall, the fund managers
dumped their holdings, adding momentum to the greenback's slide.
	   Japanese investors joined the stampede as they sensed hedge
funds could be in trouble.
	   ``They've begun to suspect that the damage to U.S. hedge funds
may be bigger than they imagined,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant
manager of foreign exchange at the Tokyo branch of ABM AMRO Bank.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond edged up to 0.790 percent from Thursday's finish of
0.785 percent, driving its price down to 109.08 yen from 109.13.

Holbrooke heads back to Belgrade, rebels call cease-fire

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Holbrooke comments after arrival in
Belgrade, fresh comment by Cooke; EDITS. &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
returned to Belgrade on Friday to give President Slobodan Milosevic
another chance to comply with a U.N. resolution on Kosovo or face
NATO airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke, who arrived from London where he attended a meeting
of the Contact Group, was scheduled to meet Milosevic at noon (1000
GMT) to persuade him again to halt his crackdown in Kosovo and
avoid an attack by the alliance.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared that a united
NATO stands ready to authorize bombing of the Serbs for their
military actions in Kosovo. She dispatched Holbrooke back to
Belgrade to warn Milosevic that ``time is all but gone'' for a
peaceful settlement.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and 250,000 people have been
driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb.
28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army. The KLA is
fighting for independence from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by KLA ``terrorists.''
	   In an apparent bid to undercut that claim, the KLA announced a
unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo starting Friday. The move
will add to the pressure on Milosevic to reciprocate.
	   Holbrooke, who arrived in Belgrade after 3 a.m. (0100 GMT), told
Associated Press Television News about the meeting in London:
``There was unanimous support in both NATO and the Contact Group
foreign ministers, including Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov,
for the efforts that are now under way for a compliance and
verification structure, for full compliance with the U.N. Security
Council resolution.''
	   He also said that among NATO members, movement toward
authorizing the use of force continued ``in a sustained and intense
manner.''
	   Milosevic has refused to openly declare a cease-fire, even
though there has been no major fighting in Kosovo during the past
week and the KLA has been largely routed. He considers the Kosovo
rebels ``terrorists and bandits,'' and any cease-fire on his part
would legitimize them as a negotiating partner, one of his
associates said on condition of anonymity.
	   The Serbian and Yugoslav governments showed little sign that
they are prepared to bow to international pressure, apparently
gambling that Russian opposition to a NATO attack will persuade key
alliance members, including Germany and Italy, to block any action.
	   Milosevic's spokesman, Ivica Dacic, insisted Thursday that NATO
threats were a ``rapist act'' and that the government has met the
conditions laid down last month by the U.N. Security Council.
	   Serbia's fiery vice premier, Vojislav Seselj, was more blunt.
	   ``NATO soldiers may possibly enter our country as combatants but
they will leave it in coffins,'' Seselj said Thursday. He warned
other countries in the region not to provide any help to NATO or
``they will also be considered our enemy and would have to face the
consequences.''
	   Despite Belgrade's claims of compliance, the United States
contends that 60 percent of the troops sent to Kosovo to crush the
independence movement remain in the province, as do all but 1,000
of the 10,000 special police, some of whom are accused of
committing atrocities against civilians.
	   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook emerged from a
meeting of the six-nation Contact Group warning of ``grave
consequences'' if Yugoslavia does not end the ``humanitarian
crisis'' in Kosovo that has claimed hundreds of lives.
	   Talking to the British Broadcasting Corp. radio Friday morning,
Cooke added: ``We have made it perfectly plain that NATO's planning
is not for one rap over the knuckles. NATO's planning is for, if
necessary, successive, coordinated attacks which would make sure
that President Milosevic could not continue to deploy the heavy
military that he has in Kosovo.''
	   While Britain and the United States strongly back military
action against the Serbs, international support is lukewarm.
Russia, in particular, has been the most critical, warning that
NATO action would lead to further bloodshed in Kosovo.

Sudanese army says in control of town, key road in south
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudanese forces have fended off rebel
attacks on a key town in southern Sudan and control the road
linking it to a nearby army camp, state-run Omdurman radio reported
Friday.
	   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army sustained heavy losses
in the clashes Thursday near Juba, said an army communique read on
the radio. It did not provide casualty figures for either side.
	   ``Our forces were able ... to complete the cleansing and purging
of this sector _ all of it _ by force and strong will,'' it said.
	   The SPLA has been engaged in a new offensive with government
forces in the southern province of East Equatoria since Sept. 14
and has made repeated advances around Juba in recent weeks. The
town is 1,200 kilometers (740 miles) south of Khartoum.
	   The road between Juba and the army camp at Torit was believed
vulnerable but the statement Friday said the army was in control.
	   The statement repeated government charges that the rebels were
being aided by Ugandan and Eritrean forces.
	   Uganda severed relations with Khartoum in 1995 after accusing
Sudan of harboring Ugandan rebels seeking to overthrow the
government. In turn, Sudan has accused Uganda _ along with Eritrea
and Ethiopia _ of aiding the Sudanese rebels.
	   The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 to try to win autonomy for
the south's Christians and adherents of tribal faiths from the
Muslim, Arabized north. More than 1.5 million people have died in
the fighting and in famines caused by it.

Stone throwing in tense city after Arafat backers call for clashes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Scores of Palestinians, some masked and
some twirling slingshots, threw stones and empty bottles into the
Israeli-controlled sector of divided Hebron on Friday.
	   In an apparent attempt to cool the tensions, Israeli troops
stayed in their barracks and did not immediately respond.
	   In clashes in Hebron on Thursday, a 20-year-old Palestinian was
killed by Israeli army fire, and more than a dozen people were
injured, including a freelance photographer for the Agence France
Press news agency who was in serious condition with a head injury.
	   Following the unrest, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah
movement renewed a call to activists to throw stones at Israeli
soldiers and Jewish settlers in Hebron on Friday.
	   ``Today, Friday, is a day of confrontations with the occupier,''
said a Fatah leaflet distributed in Hebron on Thursday evening.
	   Tensions in the city of 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish
settlers have been running high since Sept. 30 when an assailant,
apparently a Palestinian, threw two hand grenades at Israeli
soldiers guarding Jewish enclaves in the downtown area. Two dozen
people, including 11 Israeli soldiers, were injured.
	   In response, Israel sealed off Hebron, barring Palestinians from
entering and leaving the city. Israeli troops also clamped a
closure on the Israeli-controlled downtown area, confining 30,000
Palestinians living there to their homes.
	   The closure of the city was lifted Thursday, but the curfew
remained in effect Friday.
	   Palestinians have also be angered by the laying of a cornerstone
this week in Tel Romeida, a tiny Jewish enclave of seven mobile
homes wedged into a Palestinian neighborhood. The ceremony was
attended by Israeli Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom.
	   In response to the killing of a Tel Romeida resident last month,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to replace the trailers
with permanent building. The Fatah leaflet cited the Tel Romeida
construction plans as one of the reasons for renewed clashes.

Tokyo stocks slide for second day as dollar's plunge continues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING TO RESTORE HEADLINE &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing bond, late afternoon currency;
ADDS trader comments in 8th, 17th grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks fell for a second day Friday as the
dollar's continuing slide against the yen darkened profit outlooks
at top exporters and dragged the benchmark average to a 13-year
low.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average tumbled 146.09 points, or 1.12 percent,
closing at 12,879.97 _ its lowest finish since December 1985.
	   On Thursday, the average had plunged 799.55 points in its
largest points fall of the year.
	   The dollar bought 117.20 yen as of late afternoon, down 5.16 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 119.05 yen overnight.
	   A weaker dollar hurts Japanese exporters by making their
products more expensive overseas and eroding the yen value of
profits earned abroad.
	   Computer giant NEC was among the most heavily traded shares,
dropping 7.4 percent as 8.3 million shares changed hands.
	   Honda Motor lost 14 percent and another auto-related exporter,
tire maker Bridgestone Corp., fell 16 percent for the day.
	   ``With foreign exchange rates so volatile, investors are staying
away from shares of exporters,'' said Setsuo Nagao, a manager at
the stock section of Tokyo Securities Co.
	   Trading was brisk, totaling an estimated 581 million shares on
the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Declines outnumbered
gains 3 to 2.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 19.00 points, or 1.93 percent, at 982.50. It
had fallen 4.34 percent the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar continued its dive against the yen as
U.S.-based hedge funds _ known for betting huge sums on world
currency movements _ scrambled to stem losses from the greenback's
slide.
	   The dollar dived briefly to a 16-month low of 111.73 yen in
overnight trading from more than 135 yen earlier this week. In
Tokyo Friday, it traded between 115.10 and 119.60 yen.
	   The drop, which began Wednesday amid reports Japan might soon
adopt new spending measures to boost its economy, caught many hedge
fund managers by surprise, traders said.
	   They had been betting the dollar would rise against the Japanese
currency. But when the dollar started to fall, the fund managers
dumped their holdings, adding momentum to the greenback's slide.
	   Japanese investors joined the stampede as they sensed hedge
funds could be in trouble.
	   ``They've begun to suspect that the damage to U.S. hedge funds
may be bigger than they imagined,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant
manager of foreign exchange at the Tokyo branch of ABM AMRO Bank.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond edged up to 0.790 percent from Thursday's finish of
0.785 percent, driving its price down to 109.08 yen from 109.13.

Hard-liner to be named foreign minister, says Israel radio
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told U.S.
and Palestinian officials that he plans to name hard-liner Ariel
Sharon foreign minister, Israel radio said Friday.
	   Sharon, presently the minister for national infrastructure, is a
member of Netanyahu's ``kitchen cabinet,'' with Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordecai and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky. That body is
supposed to make key decisions about negotiations with the
Palestinians. He has consistently opposed compromise in the talks.
	   An official close to Sharon said the decision to appoint him as
foreign minister is in the hands of the prime minister, but that it
is expected to be soon.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sharon
would accept the position only if he will be in charge of
negotiations with the Palestinians for a permanent peace treaty.
	   Sharon, an ex-general in the Israeli army and a recognized war
hero, was removed from office as defense minister in 1983 by an
Israeli tribunal looking into the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
He was found indirectly responsible for a massacre of Lebanese
civilians by Christian Lebanese militiamen in two Beirut refugee
camps under Israeli control.
	   He remained a key figure in Israeli politics because of his
grass-roots support among hard-liners. His appointment as foreign
minister, which would complete his political rehabilitation, might
shore up Netanyahu's support among Israeli hawks as he moves toward
an agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Israel radio said Netanyahu told U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright of the pending appointment during her two-day
visit here this week, and also informed officials in Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority, including negotiator Ahmed Qureia.
	   Netanyahu and Arafat plan to travel to Washington next week for
a summit meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who hopes to
complete an agreement over a long-delayed Israeli pullback from
part of the West Bank, clearing the way for talks on a permanent
peace treaty.

British Cabinet minister says Clinton not fit to lead United
</HEADLINE>
States &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A member of Britain's Cabinet has broken ranks
with Prime Minister Tony Blair, saying Bill Clinton is not fit to
lead the United States for telling ``lies.''
	   Clare Short, the international development secretary known for
her outspoken views, said on a British Broadcasting Corp. TV
program Thursday night that Clinton should leave the presidency
because of the scandal surrounding his affair with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``If he had been a British prime minister, he would have gone,''
Ms. Short said. ``I'm glad to say that about our system.''
	   ``He is weakened and it's very unfortunate to have a weakened
president of the United States at a time when the world economy is
in the condition it is in,'' she said. ``I think a politician that
has done that much, told that many lies, isn't really fit to be a
leader. But the American people appear to take another view.''
	   Blair has been one of Clinton's staunchest supporters, phoning
him within hours of the publication of special prosecutor Kenneth
Starr's report on the Lewkinsky affair to offer his ``friendship
and support.''
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook moved Friday to distance the Blair
government from Ms. Short's remarks, noting she had merely been
expressing her personal views.
	   He characterized the close partnership between the United States
and Britain as ``alive and well.''

Yeltsin reaffirms opposition to NATO attack in Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin on Friday reiterated
Russia's strong objection to NATO's plans for possible airstrikes
against Yugoslavia, and he called for a peaceful settlement of the
crisis in Kosovo.
	   ``We must not allow NATO strikes,'' Yeltsin said before a
meeting with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Russian news reports
said. ``We want to achieve a political, peaceful solution without
the use of military force, and, I think, we shall succeed.''
	   Russia has condemned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, but has staunchly opposed
use of force against Yugoslavia.
	   Moscow warned that NATO action against Yugoslavia would only
lead to more bloodshed in Kosovo province.
	   Sergeyev, who has just returned from a trip to Greece, told
Yeltsin on Friday that Greek officials ``fully shared'' the Russian
view that the crisis should be settled only by political means.
	   ``If (NATO) strikes are carried out, that isn't going to be an
one-sided punishment of Yugoslavia,'' Sergeyev told reporters. ``It
will be a combat. Yugoslavia is determined to fight until the
end.''
	   Milosevic is ``ready to sit down at the negotiation table, but
so far there is nobody at the other side of the table,'' he added.
	   Russia took part in a Thursday meeting in London of the
six-nation Contact Group attempting to bring peace to Kosovo, where
conflict erupted in February.
	   Speaking after the session, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright left open ``a chance'' for a diplomatic solution, but said
that NATO stood ready to take action and Russia's objections would
not affect NATO's decision.
	   However, the Contact Group's statement only called on Milosevic
to meet United Nation resolutions, and didn't mention the threat of
military action.

UEFA stops Yugoslav clubs playing European matches at home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Two Yugoslav clubs will have to play
their home matches in UEFA competitions at neutral venues because
of the crisis in Kosovo, European soccer's governing body said
Friday.
	   Crvena Zvezda and Partizan Belgrade will play the home legs of
their UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup ties away from Yugoslavia ``due
to the current political situation'' in the country, a UEFA news
release said.
	   ``Security risks in the country have reached limits which, at
present, do no longer justify the staging of UEFA competition
matches in Yugoslavia,'' the release said.
	   The decision will apply to the UEFA Cup second round first leg
match between Crvena Zvezda and Olympique Lyonnais on Tuesday Oct.
20. The club has been asked to inform UEFA of the stadium chosen
and the kick-off time by Monday.
	   A final decision on whether to make Partizan play their Cup
Winners Cup second round second leg match against Lazio on Nov. 5
at a neutral venue will be delayed until next Thursday. This gives
UEFA the possibility of changing its decision if the security
situation in Yugoslavia improves, the release said.
	   On Monday, UEFA cited security risks as the reason for
postponing this weekend's European Championships qualifying
encounter between Yugoslavia and the Republic of Ireland.
	   And last week, England called off an exhibition match next month
at Wembley stadium against Yugoslavia because of the conflict in
Kosovo and the possibility of military intervention.

Strong quake rattles again southwestern Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Another strong earthquake shook
southwestern Greece on Friday, but there were no immediate reports
of injuries or serious damage.
	   The temblor, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.1, was the third
since Monday in the quake-prone zone near the Ionian Sea island of
Zakinthos.
	   Giorgos Vrakatos, a seismologist at the Athens Geodynamic
Institute, described the series of quakes as a ``natural
development'' in the area that do not suggest a major quake is
imminent.
	   The quake occurred at 8:12 a.m. (0512 GMT) about 305 kilometers
(182 miles) west of Athens, the Geodynamic Institute said.
	   A quake of magnitude 4 often causes slight damage and magnitude
5 can produce moderate damage.

discovered

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Looking for mass graves of
Bosnian war victims, a Bosnian exhumation team have found the
skeletons of four German soldiers, who were members of Germany's
World War II Wehrmacht, government officials said Friday.
	   Amor Masovic, the head of the Muslim Missing Persons Commission,
said the bodies had used by German army during World War II.
	   ``It was pure coincidence. We were looking for a new mass grave
... and found these bodies,'' Masovic said.
	   The bodies were found in the northwestern Sarajevo suburb of
Vogosca a few weeks ago, but investigators wanted to be sure about
the discovery.
	   ``We already informed German authorities about this case,''
Masovic said, waiting for a reply.
	   In Bosnia, thousands of missing people are still believed hidden
in as yet undiscovered mass graves.

Russian politician expresses concerns about delay in crisis plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of Russia's parliament said Friday he
was concerned that the new government had not yet offered a plan
for dealing with an economic crisis that's nearly two months old.
	   ``We are not hurrying the government, but we are a bit worried
by the delay in presenting the anti-crisis program,'' Gennady
Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as speaker of the lower house,
told Russian news agencies.
	   Russia's long-standing economic problems turned into a
full-fledged crisis on Aug. 17 when the government announced it
would allow the ruble to devalue and effectively defaulted on some
foreign debt.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has been in office since Sept.
11, but his Cabinet is still formulating an economic rescue plan.
The government has said it will be announced before Oct. 20.
	   Seleznyov spoke to reporters following discussions about the
crisis with Jacques Santer, the president of the European Union
Commission. The two men discussed ways that the European Union
could help, but no details were announced.
	   Santer also planned to meet with Primakov on Friday.
	   Russia badly needs foreign aid to pay off a mountain of debts,
but international lenders have not been willing to provide money
until they know the contents of Russia's economic program.
	   The only sign of a crisis-attacking plan from Primakov's
government so far has been a draft published by the Russian media
last week that called for a number of Soviet-style administrative
controls.
	   Primakov, however, insists he supports continued market reforms.
But he says the government must rein in the ``wild capitalism''
that has characterized the country's moves toward a market economy.

UEFA stops Yugoslav clubs playing European matches at home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Two Yugoslav clubs will have to play
their home matches in UEFA competitions at neutral venues because
of the crisis in Kosovo, European soccer's governing body said
Friday.
	   Crvena Zvezda and Partizan Belgrade will play the home legs of
their UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup ties away from Yugoslavia ``due
to the current political situation'' in the country, a UEFA news
release said.
	   ``Security risks in the country have reached limits which, at
present, do no longer justify the staging of UEFA competition
matches in Yugoslavia,'' the release said.
	   The decision will apply to the UEFA Cup second round first leg
match between Crvena Zvezda and Olympique Lyonnais on Tuesday Oct.
20. The club has been asked to inform UEFA of the stadium chosen
and the kick-off time by Monday.
	   A final decision on whether to make Partizan play their Cup
Winners Cup second round second leg match against Lazio on Nov. 5
at a neutral venue will be delayed until next Thursday. This gives
UEFA the possibility of changing its decision if the security
situation in Yugoslavia improves, the release said.
	   On Monday, UEFA cited security risks as the reason for
postponing this weekend's European Championships qualifying
encounter between Yugoslavia and the Republic of Ireland.
	   And last week, England called off an exhibition match next month
at Wembley stadium against Yugoslavia because of the conflict in
Kosovo and the possibility of military intervention.

Italian confidence vote too close to call

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The survival of Premier Romano Prodi's center-left
coalition has come down to at most a handful of deputies, making
Friday's confidence vote too close to call.
	   Italy's second-longest lasting government since World War II had
a fighting chance after a faction of hard-line Communists earlier
in the week defied their leader and decided to back Prodi, despite
strong displeasure over the proposed 1999 budget.
	   A confidence vote requires one more than half of those voting.
Because by tradition the president of the 630-member Chamber does
not vote, if all show up, 315 yes votes does the trick.
	   By most observers' counts, Prodi could count on 312 or 313 votes
by Thursday night, possibly already enough if some deputies don't
show up for illness.
	   Prodi's coalition had depended throughout its two years and five
months in office on Communist Refoundation votes for a majority in
the lower Chamber of Deputies.
	   But on Sunday, Refoundation leader Fausto Bertinotti and his
loyalists decided to stop supporting the government.
	   Then the party's second in command, Armando Cossutta, led a
split of Refoundation followers, giving Prodi a shot at winning.
	   Cossutta's leader in the Chamber, Oliviero Diliberto, indicated
in final debate Friday morning that the choice was a difficult one
made for the overall good of the country. ``It's not enough to
protest, you have to build,'' he said.
	   Bertinotti, in his final declaration, declared that his
followers would stick to their defiance of the government.
	   To woo the Communists, Prodi pledged that his government would
work to make law Refoundation's pet project -- a 35-hour work week
-- and stood back Thursday from endorsing NATO air strikes in
Yugoslavia without specific backing from the U.N. Security Council,
as Cossutta has demanded.
	   As the confidence vote approached, Prodi hoped to pick up the
extra votes he needed from former Christian Democrats.
	   The center-right opposition, led by media mogul Silvio
Berlusconi, said a Prodi win would not spare the government more
crises.
	   Winning the confidence vote would ``only put off the dramatic
question of Kosovo,'' said Rocco Buttiglione, a centrist in former
Premier Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance.
	   Parliament would have to approve any involvement by Italy in
NATO military intervention, and the opposition, tiring of bailing
out the goverment, might resent coming to Prodi's rescue again, as
it did in the past when Communists opposed sending troops into
Albanian as well as NATO's eastward enlargement.

At last, a place for the story of Scotland
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ It took 60 years, but the Scots are
finally getting the first museum celebrating the breadth of their
storied history.
	   In a new building made of golden sandstone set in Edinburgh's
historic Old Town district, visitors soon will be able to ascend
through the record of Scotland from rocks and fossils in the
basement to the 20th century five floors up.
	   ``This will be the one place in the world to find out about
Scottish history and Scottish culture, to get an overall view and
understanding,'' said Mark Jones, director of the new Museum of
Scotland.
	   The 64 million pound (dlrs 105 million) project will be opened
by Queen Elizabeth II on Nov. 30, St. Andrew's Day.
	   Rare and precious treasures will be permanently together on
display for the first time _ among them the Monymusk reliquary,
which once held the remains of St. Columba, who converted Scotland
to Christianity.
	   The 20th-century gallery features 350 objects chosen by the
Scottish people, who were asked to nominate things they felt made a
major impact on life in Scotland in this century and things that
had a personal significance.
	   Actor Sean Connery, the original James Bond, chose the
Declaration of Arbroath of 1320 and a milk bottle.
	   The Declaration asserted Scottish independence from England,
much evident now as Scots campaign for the May 6 election of their
first Parliament for 300 years. The bottle recalls Connery's first
job as a milk deliveryman.
	   A soccer fan settled for a recording of the crowd's roar at
Glasgow's Hampden Park, where Scotland's international matches are
played, and a little girl picked a scent bottle that reminded her
of her granny's perfume.
	   Queen Mother Elizabeth _ the queen's mother, and a Scot herself
_ sent a tartan sash.
	   The new museum's story starts in 1938 when government advisers
said the national collections were inadequately housed at
Edinburgh's Museum of Antiquities and recommended a new building.
	   Pleading poverty, authorities did little until 1970, when a site
was acquired. But public spending cuts stopped work for 20 years
and construction did not begin until 1994.
	   An internal bridge links the new museum to the 1860s Royal
Scottish Museum next door, which houses international collections.
An inscription between them proclaims that the old museum presents
the world to Scotland, while the new one presents Scotland to the
world.
	   The new museum _ which echoes Scottish traditions of defensive
round towers, castles and tower houses _ will be a focal point for
the Scottish disapora.
	   Scotland's population is 5.1 million, but an estimated 40
million people of Scottish descent live in the United States and
Canada and millions more in New Zealand, Australia and elsewhere in
the British Commonwealth.
	   In the political repression following the failure of the
Jacobite rebellion and a string of icy winters that devastated
crops, 70,000 Scots went overseas from the 1750s to the 1820s to
find a better life.
	   ``There's been very little in the way of a network joining Scots
abroad or a focal point,'' Jones said. ``So we will have a program
called `Scotland and the World' to build those links.''
	   The government and the national lottery paid for the building,
but the museum had to raise 7.25 million pounds (dlrs 12 million)
to fit out the exhibition areas. One-third of that came from
Americans and Canadians after an international appeal.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Alarmed by rising losses at many state-owned
companies, the governor of northeastern Liaoning province has sent
190 officials to try to put their businesses in order, the official
newspaper China Daily reported Friday.
	   Liaoning _ once a powerful industrial hub and now a rust-belt of
aging factories _ has led the sharp decline in China's state
enterprise profits. With 1,400 large and mid-size state
enterprises, it has swelling unemployment, worker protests over
unpaid salaries and pensions, and China's highest concentration of
money-losing companies.
	   According to provincial officials, in the first eight months of
1998 losses in Liaoning's state industry grew to 10.5 billion yuan
(dlrs 1.27 billion), or an average of 44 million yuan (dlrs 5.37
million) a day, the newspaper said.
	   Zhang Guoguang, Liaoning's governor, has pledged to halt the
collapse of state industry within three months, it said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mitsubishi Chemical Corp. said Friday it will set
up a joint venture in Beijing with Japanese and Chinese partners to
make and sell polypropylene compounds.
	   The joint venture aims to meet growing demand from Japanese
automakers in China, a spokesman for Mitsubishi Chemical said.
	   The joint venture will be capitalized at dlrs 350,000.
Mitsubishi Chemical will hold a stake of around 55 percent, Toyota
Tsusho Corp. will have a stake of about 5 percent and a group
company of Sinopec, China's national petrochemical corporation,
will hold the remaining 40 percent, Mitsubishi Chemical said.
	   The Chinese company will supply the raw material propylene and
Japan Polychem Corp., a Mitsubishi Chemical-affiliated synthetic
resin maker, will provide the technology, Mitsubishi Chemical said.
	   The joint venture is to start operations by the end of this
year.
	   The company, with production capacity of 2,000 tons a year, will
aim for 500 million yen (dlrs 4.3 million) in annual sales,
Mitsubishi Chemical said.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan may buy as much as 95 percent of
the dlrs 5 billion bond issue that the Thai government plans to
launch this year, the English-language newspaper The Nation
reported Friday.
	   In an exclusive interview with The Nation, Thai Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda was quoted as saying Japan would use part of
its dlrs 30 billion aid program to help crisis-stricken Asian
countries pay for this possible purchase of Thai government bonds.
	   Tarrin was in Washington, attending the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank meeting.
	   ___
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The privatization of the state
telecommunications company PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia will be
delayed until 2001 owing to unfavorable market conditions, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   The daily Indonesian Observer quoted State Enterprises Minister
Tanri Abeng as saying that ``the privatization program for the
other state companies would continue except Telkom, which is
delayed until 2001.''
	   ``Selling stakes now won't produce profit, because the price
will be low,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   The International Monetary Fund-mandated program originally set
a sales target of dlrs 1.5 billion through the privatization of 12
state-owned companies to plug the state budget deficit.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Stock Exchange of Singapore said Friday it
is working with the Taiwan stock exchange on a dual listing
program, which would allow investors in both countries to trade
stocks listed on the two bourses.
	   ``We are working with the Taiwan stock exchange on dual listings
but details have not been finalized,'' a Singapore stock exchange
spokesman said.
	   The spokesman declined to give further details but Singapore's
Business Times quoted a Taiwan news report as saying that an
agreement will be signed at the end of this year for a tie-up
effective early next year.
	   With a Taiwan stock index futures contract already trading on
the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, Singapore investors
are seen taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities created by
access to Taiwan's spot market.
	   By market capitalization, Taiwan is the third biggest stock
market in Asia after Japan and Hong Kong and is more than twice the
size of the Singapore market.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's All Nippon Airways Co. said Friday it has
applied to the Transportation Ministry to start direct
Osaka-Denpasar air service.
	   If approved, the service to Bali, Indonesia, is scheduled to
start Dec. 23 with flights twice a week, the major Japanese air
transportation company said.
	   ANA has suspended its Jakarta-Denpasar flights due to political
instability in Indonesia since August. But it is opening the direct
flight service to Bali in expectation that passenger demand will
recover now that unrest has subsided, the airline company said.

Holbrooke heads back to Belgrade, rebels call cease-fire

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
returned to Belgrade on Friday to give President Slobodan Milosevic
another chance to comply with a U.N. resolution on Kosovo or face
NATO airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke, who arrived from London where he attended a meeting
of the Contact Group, was scheduled to meet Milosevic at noon (1000
GMT) to persuade him again to halt his crackdown in Kosovo and
avoid an attack by the alliance.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared that a united
NATO stands ready to authorize bombing of the Serbs for their
military actions in Kosovo. She dispatched Holbrooke back to
Belgrade to warn Milosevic that ``time is all but gone'' for a
peaceful settlement.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and 250,000 people have been
driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb.
28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army. The KLA is
fighting for independence from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by KLA ``terrorists.''
	   In an apparent bid to undercut that claim, the KLA announced a
unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo starting Friday. The move
will add to the pressure on Milosevic to reciprocate.
	   Holbrooke, who arrived in Belgrade after 3 a.m. (0100 GMT), told
Associated Press Television News about the meeting in London:
``There was unanimous support in both NATO and the Contact Group
foreign ministers, including Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov,
for the efforts that are now under way for a compliance and
verification structure, for full compliance with the U.N. Security
Council resolution.''
	   He also said that among NATO members, movement toward
authorizing the use of force continued ``in a sustained and intense
manner.''
	   Milosevic has refused to openly declare a cease-fire, even
though there has been no major fighting in Kosovo during the past
week and the KLA has been largely routed. He considers the Kosovo
rebels ``terrorists and bandits,'' and any cease-fire on his part
would legitimize them as a negotiating partner, one of his
associates said on condition of anonymity.
	   The Serbian and Yugoslav governments showed little sign that
they are prepared to bow to international pressure, apparently
gambling that Russian opposition to a NATO attack will persuade key
alliance members, including Germany and Italy, to block any action.
	   Milosevic's spokesman, Ivica Dacic, insisted Thursday that NATO
threats were a ``rapist act'' and that the government has met the
conditions laid down last month by the U.N. Security Council.
	   Serbia's fiery vice premier, Vojislav Seselj, was more blunt.
	   ``NATO soldiers may possibly enter our country as combatants but
they will leave it in coffins,'' Seselj said Thursday. He warned
other countries in the region not to provide any help to NATO or
``they will also be considered our enemy and would have to face the
consequences.''
	   Despite Belgrade's claims of compliance, the United States
contends that 60 percent of the troops sent to Kosovo to crush the
independence movement remain in the province, as do all but 1,000
of the 10,000 special police, some of whom are accused of
committing atrocities against civilians.
	   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook emerged from a
meeting of the six-nation Contact Group warning of ``grave
consequences'' if Yugoslavia does not end the ``humanitarian
crisis'' in Kosovo that has claimed hundreds of lives.
	   Talking to the British Broadcasting Corp. radio Friday morning,
Cook added: ``We have made it perfectly plain that NATO's planning
is not for one rap over the knuckles. NATO's planning is for, if
necessary, successive, coordinated attacks which would make sure
that President Milosevic could not continue to deploy the heavy
military that he has in Kosovo.''
	   While Britain and the United States strongly back military
action against the Serbs, international support is lukewarm.
Russia, in particular, has been the most critical, warning that
NATO action would lead to further bloodshed in Kosovo.

Highest SAfrican court upholds gay rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's highest court
on Friday definitively struck down apartheid-era laws banning
homosexual sex, a gay rights activist said.
	   The constitutional court upheld a lower-court ruling in May that
the sodomy law was illegal. It also declared unconstitutional a
section of the sexual offenses act prohibiting contact between two
men at a party that had ``sexual connotations,'' said Zackie
Achmat, director of the National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian
Equality.
	   The changes in South Africa after the fall of apartheid have
extended beyond race to homosexual rights, which were fiercely
suppressed by the conservative white government.
	   The new constitution was one of the first to prevent
discrimination based on sexual orientation.
	   But anti-gay laws remained on the books, and the coalition
pressed its case in the courts because Parliament had failed to
change them, Achmat said.
	   The ruling is significant ``because it established equality for
all people irresponsive of who they are, and it says to all gay
people we have the right to live our lives the way we want to,''
Achmat said.
	   He said the ruling allowed men who were charged with criminal
sodomy since 1994, when all-race elections ended apartheid, to have
their record expunged and to sue for damages.
	   The constitutional court also explicitly stated for the first
time that ``sexual orientation'' includes homosexual, lesbian,
bisexual and transsexual, Achmat said.

Stone throwing in tense city after Arafat backers call for clashes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Scores of Palestinians, some masked and
some twirling slingshots, threw stones and empty bottles at Israeli
soldiers in Hebron on Friday.
	   Israeli troops initially did not respond, but after about an
hour began firing rubber-coated steel pellets. One Palestinian was
lightly injured.
	   In clashes in Hebron on Thursday, a 20-year-old Palestinian was
killed by Israeli army fire, and more than a dozen people were
injured, including a freelance photographer for the Agence France
Press news agency who was in serious condition with a head injury.
	   Following the unrest, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah
movement renewed a call to activists to throw stones at Israeli
soldiers and Jewish settlers in Hebron on Friday.
	   ``Today, Friday, is a day of confrontations with the occupier,''
said a Fatah leaflet distributed in Hebron on Thursday evening.
	   Tensions in the city of 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish
settlers have been running high since Sept. 30 when an assailant,
apparently a Palestinian, threw two hand grenades at Israeli
soldiers guarding Jewish enclaves in the downtown area. Two dozen
people, including 11 Israeli soldiers, were injured.
	   In response, Israel sealed off Hebron, barring Palestinians from
entering and leaving the city. Israeli troops also clamped a
closure on the Israeli-controlled downtown area, confining 30,000
Palestinians living there to their homes.
	   The closure of the city was lifted Thursday, but the curfew
remained in effect Friday.

Pro-Megawati supporters take to the streets again on Bali
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANUR, Indonesia (AP) _ In a show of defiance, thousands of
supporters of opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri paraded
through the resort island of Bali Friday, as she and her minority
party discussed strategies for general elections next year.
	   Noisy convoys of motorcycles, trucks and cars sped past hotels
and tourist shops all day and night, blaring horns and chanting
anti-government slogans.
	   Much of the island has been bedecked in red flags and banners _
the color of Megawati's Indonesian Democratic Party, which hopes to
win a national election next year under new democratic reforms.
	   Indonesian politics is often marred by violence, and thousands
of police and troops have been placed on standby in Bali. However,
no trouble has been reported, and security personnel have kept a
low profile.
	   Megawati, 51, is the daughter of Indonesia's founding president,
Sukarno, and her pro-democracy message has struck a chord with many
of its 202 million people as they struggle to live through the
worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   In a demonstration of her popular appeal, a huge number of
people from across Indonesia have traveled to Bali for the
three-day convention, which ends Saturday.
	   As the gathering began Thursday, Megawati addressed a
spectacular rally of about 50,000 adoring supporters in an open
field on the outskirts of Sanur city.
	   Her speech called for an end to endemic corruption in Indonesia
and for help for the country's growing number of poor, hit hard by
food shortages, rampant inflation and mass unemployment.
	   Many regarded the address as the start of Megawati's bold bid to
be Indonesia's next president.
	   ``I want her to be our new president. She stands up for little
people like me,'' said one supporter, who identified himself by the
single name of Arief.
	   Megawati emerged as a symbol of change several years ago when
she clashed with autocratic President Suharto by calling for
greater democracy.
	   In May, about 1,200 people died in riots on the neighboring main
island of Java, forcing Suharto to quit 32 years after he took
power from Sukarno, Megawati's father, following a bloody and
abortive coup attempt allegedly by communists.
	   In recent weeks, President B.J. Habibie, Suharto's successor and
longtime ally, also has been targeted by protests, and he has
promised to hold the parliamentary election next year.
	   Megawati's faction of the Indonesian Democratic Party hopes to
defeat Habibie with a platform of democratic change.
	   While Habibie still has the support of Indonesia's military,
Megawati is becoming more popular, riding a wave of widespread
discontent over the meltdown of the economy.
	   As the largest nation in Southeast Asia, Indonesia's stability
is considered crucial to the region.
	   The world's fourth most-populous country, it comprises 17,000
islands strategically straddling routes between the Pacific and
Indian oceans.
	   The government and military initially tried to have Megawati's
convention banned, fearing that an outbreak of unrest would tarnish
Bali's international image as a safe vacation spot.
	   ``I have not seen any indications of unrest. Megawati's
supporters have obeyed their leader's instructions to stay calm,''
said Bali's police chief, Brig. Gen. Gunawan.
	   Foreign tourists appeared unconcerned by the political action,
although some hotels asked guests to remain in resort areas.
	   Some stores even capitalized on the event by selling
pro-Megawati T-shirts and other memorabilia as souvenirs.

Kazakstan's opposition protests early presidential poll
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kazakstan's leading opposition group on Friday
protested parliament's move to hold an early presidential election
in January, calling it a plot to extend President Nursultan
Nazarbayev's term in office.
	   Parliament passed a resolution Thursday setting early
presidential elections for Jan. 10, nearly two years earlier than
envisaged by a 1995 referendum that extended Nazarbayev's term
through the end of the year 2000.
	   Lawmakers also passed constitutional amendments that would
lengthen a president's term from five to seven years. The terms of
lawmakers would also be extended.
	   In the absence of any serious rivals, Nazarbayev is expected to
easily win re-election.
	   Parliament's moves only serve to ensure Nazarbayev's hold on
power, said Galym Abilsiitov and Pyotr Svoik, who co-chair the
Azamat movement, Kazakstan's strongest opposition group.
	   They said the parliament's action amounted to ``an
unconstitutional deal between the president and the parliament to
extend their terms,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Azamat plans to either boycott the election, or support an
opposition candidate, the two men said.
	   Nazarbayev, Kazakstan's Communist Party boss during the Soviet
times, flirted with democratic reforms in the first few years after
the country's independence in 1991. But he has moved to strengthen
his grip on power and allows his opponents little room to maneuver.
	   Azamat leaders have previously complained against official
harassment. Abilsiitov spent 15 days in jail last year for
organizing an unsanctioned anti-government demonstration and Svoik
said he was beaten by security agents.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani lawmakers took a giant step
Friday toward creating a new Islamic order in this economically
troubled nation of 140 million people.
	   The National Assembly, the powerful lower House of Parliament,
voted 151 to 16 to pass a constitutional amendment giving the
federal government sweeping powers to interpret and impose laws
based on interpretations of the Muslim holy book, the Koran.
	   ``I congratulate the nation on the passage of the bill which
will help create a truly Islamic system,'' said Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif in a speech following the vote.
	   But before the amendment can become law, it requires a
two-thirds majority in the Senate, something Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif may have difficulty acquiring.
	   While his ruling Pakistan Muslim League controls a two-thirds
majority in the lawmaking National Assembly, it does not have the
votes to pass the amendment in the Senate.
	   Some political analysts said Sharif may seek a vote in a joint
session of the two houses, where he would likely be able to muster
the required number of votes.
	   The opposition, led by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto,
warned that the government could use the amendment to overturn laws
passed by Pakistan's four provincial governments.
	   Naveed Qamar, a spokesman for Ms. Bhutto's party in Parliament,
warned that the amendment supersedes the constitution of Pakistan.
	   ``It is a weapon in the hands of fundamentalists, which would be
misused against religious minorities,'' said Shahbaz Bhatti, a
leader of the Christian Liberation Front, an advocacy group for
minority Christians, who number about 2 million in Pakistan.
	   Asfandyar Wali Khan, a member of the Awami National Party and a
strong opponent of the amendment, said it effectively meant ``the
abrogation'' of the constitution.
	   In a surprising move, lawmakers withdrew a clause in the
amendment that promised the country's minorities that their
``personal law, religious freedom, traditions or customs ... and
status as citizens'' would be protected.
	   There was no debate on the decision to delete the clause.
	   However, in his speech to Parliament Sharif made a promise to
members of Pakistan's minority religious groups.
	   ``I assure the religious minorities that it is my prime
responsibility to protect their rights,'' he said. ``Islam is a
religion which has always recognized the rights of minorities.''
	   But many leaders were not convinced.
	   ``We've heard such promises for 50 years and we know that in
practice they cannot be kept ... this is a system which divides
people on basis of religion,'' said Peter Jacob, executive
secretary of the Catholic Bishops Commission for Justice and Peace.

Woman injured in controversial hostage raid dies

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A woman taken hostage by an escaped
convict last month died Friday from serious injuries suffered when
the captor's grenade exploded during a police raid.
	   Amalia Ginaki, 25, was one of three family members held hostage
Sept. 25 during a four-hour standoff. The blast caused extensive
internal injuries and forced doctors to amputate her right hip and
leg.
	   Police stormed the apartment after they mistakenly concluded the
hostage-taker's grenade was fake. The operation embarrassed police
leaders and led to government promises of a full-scale
investigation.
	   The hostage-taker, Sorin Matei, died Sept. 28 in a prison
hospital after choking on vomit while heavily sedated, according to
autopsy reports. A separate probe has been launched into the
circumstances surrounding his death.

Russian politician expresses concerns about delay in crisis plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with imports falling 45 percent in September, money
supply increasing. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of Russia's parliament said Friday he
was concerned that the new government had not yet offered a plan
for dealing with an economic crisis that's nearly two months old.
	   ``We are not hurrying the government, but we are a bit worried
by the delay in presenting the anti-crisis program,'' Gennady
Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as speaker of the lower house,
told Russian news agencies.
	   Russia's long-standing economic problems turned into a
full-fledged crisis on Aug. 17 when the government announced it
would allow the ruble to devalue and effectively defaulted on some
foreign debt.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has been in office since Sept.
11, but says that his Cabinet is still formulating an economic
rescue plan. The government has said it will be announced before
Oct. 20.
	   With the government and businesses short on cash, Russian
imports fell a dramatic 45 percent in September compared to last
year, the State Statistics Committee announced Friday.
	   Russia depends heavily on imports for many essential goods,
including food and medicine. But imports are now two to three times
more expensive than before the crisis because the Russian ruble has
gone from 6 to 16 against the U.S. dollar.
	   Prices have gone up 50 percent this year, with almost all of the
increase coming in the past two months. Inflation could hit 200
percent by the end of the year, according to government forecasts.
	   There's a widespread belief that the government will have to
print additional money to pay off its debts, and that will further
fuel inflation.
	   Russia's money supply increased 2.1 percent in the past week to
reach 174.8 billion rubles (about dlrs 11 billion), the Central
Bank said Friday.
	   Seleznyov made his comments to reporters following discussions
about the crisis with Jacques Santer, the president of the European
Union Commission. The two men discussed ways the European Union
could help, but no details were announced.
	   Russia badly needs foreign aid to pay off a mountain of debts,
but international lenders have not been willing to provide money
until they know the contents of Russia's economic program.
	   The only sign of a crisis-attacking plan from Primakov's
government so far has been a draft published by the Russian media
last week that called for a number of Soviet-style administrative
controls.
	   Primakov, however, insists he supports continued market reforms.
But he says the government must rein in the ``wild capitalism'' and
rampant corruption that has characterized the country's moves
toward a market economy.

Boat owner charged with manslaughter after U.S. divers left behind

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ The owner of a boat that left behind
two American scuba divers on a trip to the Great Barrier Reef last
year was charged with manslaughter Friday after a coroner found he
was liable for their deaths.
	   Geoffrey Ian ``Jack'' Nairn was charged with unlawfully killing
Thomas and Eileen Lonergan between Jan. 24 and Feb. 2, 1998, at a
place unknown between St. Crispins Reef and Cooktown, in Queensland
state.
	   When asked if he had anything to say, Nairn said: ``I am not
guilty of the charge.''
	   Nairn will also face separate charges of breaching state health
and workplace safety laws, the Queensland government said Friday.
	   Thomas Lonergan, 33, and his 28-year-old wife, of Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, were last seen on Jan. 25 diving from Nairn's boat Outer
Edge.
	   A huge police search failed to find the Lonergans, although some
dive equipment believed to have belonged to them was later found
washed up on beaches in north Queensland. The equipment included a
writing board used by divers to communicate underwater, bearing the
message: ``Please help us. Find us soon before we die.''
	   Handing down the findings of his inquest into the Lonergans'
fate, Coroner Noel Nunan found the couple were accidentally left
behind when the boat returned from St. Crispins Reef, 43 miles (70
kilometers) northeast of Port Douglas.
	   The inquest heard evidence that the couple could have survived
for up to seven days, but Nunan found it was more likely they died
within a few days of being left behind.
	   ``From available evidence it is not possible to say how the
couple died but probably by drowning or shark in two or three days
after accidentally being left behind,'' Nunan said.
	   Nunan dismissed suggestions made during the inquest that the
Lonergans had staged their disappearance or were involved in a
murder-suicide.
	   ``I totally reject both theories,'' he said.
	   Nunan criticized safety procedures on board the Outer Edge,
saying Nairn had failed in his responsibilities as skipper by not
checking the dive master's log and head count before turning his
boat to shore.
	   ``The skipper should be vigilant for the safety of passengers
and ensure safety measures are carried out,'' Nunan said.
	   Nunan was also critical of the 50-hour lapse between the return
of the boat and the disappearance being reported to police.
	   Nairn was visibly distressed when Nunan read out the charge in
court.
	   ``When you combine the number of mistakes and the severity of
the mistakes, I am satisfied a reasonable jury would find Mr. Nairn
guilty of manslaughter on criminal evidence,'' Nunan said. He was
released on bail.
	   Nunan made a number of recommendations to improve safety
standards for the dive industry, including appointing a mandatory
lookout and introducing a failsafe method of checking that all
divers have returned to a boat.
	   Rob Davis, the lawyer representing the families of the couple at
the inquest, said outside the court that his clients would be
relieved it was finished.
	   Eileen Lonergan's mother, Kathy Haines, welcomed the end of the
inquest, but said it had been heartbreaking.
	   ``Now we hope the government of Queensland will formulate some
laws to govern the dive industry, which is a dangerous industry
right now,'' Haines told Australia's Nine television network from
the United States.
	   The Queensland government declined to comment on safety
standards in the dive industry before Nairn's court case had been
decided.

Russian military denies plan for nuclear test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian general denied allegations that Moscow
intends to carry out a nuclear test and insisted Friday that the
military keep nuclear weapons under safe control despite limited
funding.
	   ``There are no plans to resume nuclear tests at Novaya Zemlya
testing range'' in northern Russia, said Gen. Igor Volynkin, who
heads a defense ministry department overseeing nuclear weapons.
	   Western news reports and environmentalists claimed last month
that Russia was preparing a sub-critical nuclear test on the Arctic
archipelago of Novaya Zemlya. For such a test, the amount of
radioactive plutonium in a nuclear bomb is reduced to under a
critical threshold for an explosive nuclear chain reaction.
	   Since there is no explosion, such tests are not covered by the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. But critics warned that they could
encourage such countries to conduct full-scale tests.
	   Moscow carried out it last nuclear test on Novaya Zemlya in
October 1990 when the Soviet Union still existed. It then declared
a moratorium on nuclear tests.
	   Volynkin bristled at media reports saying the cash-strapped
Russian military has been losing effective control over its nuclear
arsenal. He said the reports were designed to place ``Russian
nuclear weapons under international control.''
	   ``Russia is capable of maintaining its nuclear weapons and
ensuring their safety,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass and
Interfax news agencies.
	   Volynkin also said that Russia strictly adheres to international
obligations to destroy some kinds of tactical nuclear weapons,
including nuclear shells and landmines.
	   ``When there is an agreement with the United States on
destroying the remaining part of tactical weapons, Russia will
embark on their destruction,'' he said.

China moved 50,000 prisoners during floods, no escapes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China had to move 50,000 prisoners during
catastrophic summer floods, and not one escaped, the minister of
justice told reporters Friday.
	   ``This can be regarded as a miracle'' in the history of criminal
rehabilitation, Gao Changli was quoted as saying by the state-run
Xinhua News Agency. Gao spoke at a national conference and awards
ceremony for court officials.
	   The floods in many parts of China killed 3,004 people, according
to government statistics. Inmates at 75 prisons and 21 labor camps
had to be moved, and economic losses at prisons totaled 3 billion
yuan (dlrs 360 million), Xinhua reported.

Top U.S. envoy to deliver final message to Milosevic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Before heading into a fourth round
of talks Friday with Slobodan Milosevic, U.S. senior envoy Richard
Holbrooke reiterated that the situation remains ``extremely
serious'' and unchanged since the last time he met with the
Yugoslav president.
	   Holbrooke was expected to give Milosevic another chance, perhaps
final, to comply with a U.N. resolution on Kosovo or face NATO
airstrikes.
	   ``NATO is continuing and intensifying planning and preparations
for action and we are continuing intensifying diplomatic efforts to
see if that is going to be necessary enough,'' Holbrooke told
reporters as he left his hotel.
	   He added that the Contact Group unanimously backed his
diplomatic efforts.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared that a united
NATO stands ready to authorize bombing of the Serbs for their
military actions in Kosovo. She dispatched Holbrooke back to
Belgrade to warn Milosevic that ``time is all but gone'' for a
peaceful settlement.

Lawmakers take giant step toward Islamic rule in Pakistan

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani lawmakers took a giant step
Friday toward creating a new Islamic order in this economically
troubled nation of 140 million people.
	   The National Assembly, the powerful lower House of Parliament,
voted 151 to 16 to pass a constitutional amendment giving the
federal government sweeping powers to interpret and impose laws
based on interpretations of the Muslim holy book, the Koran.
	   ``I congratulate the nation on the passage of the bill which
will help create a truly Islamic system,'' said Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif in a speech following the vote.
	   But before the amendment can become law, it requires a
two-thirds majority in the Senate, something Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif may have difficulty acquiring.
	   While his ruling Pakistan Muslim League controls a two-thirds
majority in the lawmaking National Assembly, it does not have the
votes to pass the amendment in the Senate.
	   Some political analysts said Sharif may seek a vote in a joint
session of the two houses, where he would likely be able to muster
the required number of votes.
	   The opposition, led by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto,
warned that the government could use the amendment to overturn laws
passed by Pakistan's four provincial governments.
	   Naveed Qamar, a spokesman for Ms. Bhutto's party in Parliament,
warned that the amendment supersedes the constitution of Pakistan.
	   ``It is a weapon in the hands of fundamentalists, which would be
misused against religious minorities,'' said Shahbaz Bhatti, a
leader of the Christian Liberation Front, an advocacy group for
minority Christians, who number about 2 million in Pakistan.
	   Asfandyar Wali Khan, a member of the Awami National Party and a
strong opponent of the amendment, said it effectively meant ``the
abrogation'' of the constitution.
	   The amendment also included a clause that protects ``personal
law religous freedom, traditions or customs of non-Muslims and
their status as citizens.''
	   However, in his speech to Parliament Sharif made a promise to
members of Pakistan's minority religious groups.
	   ``I assure the religious minorities that it is my prime
responsibility to protect their rights,'' he said. ``Islam is a
religion which has always recognized the rights of minorities.''
	   But many leaders were not convinced.
	   ``We've heard such promises for 50 years and we know that in
practice they cannot be kept ... this is a system which divides
people on basis of religion,'' said Peter Jacob, executive
secretary of the Catholic Bishops Commission for Justice and Peace.
	   Opponents of the amendment have warned that it will give
strength to militant members of radical Islamic groups in Pakistan,
who will try to force their interpretation of Islam on lawmakers.
	   Ms. Bhutto's party as well as other opposition parties have
warned that the amendment can pave the way for a strict Islamic
regime, not unlike neighboring Pakistan where Taliban religious
militia rule with an iron hand.
	   However, Information Minister Mushahid Hussein earlier said his
government was a ``liberal Muslim'' government that opposed
fundamentalism.
	   Outside Parliament on Friday representatives of women's groups
condemned the bill and waved placards saying: ``defeat this bill .
. . protect women. We have rights.''
	   Inside the grand marble legislature, Qamar said already the
government ministers have questioned the Islamic credentials of
those who oppose the bill.
	   Khan said ``we don't need any certificate to be a Muslim ...
this bill is going to put you into total confusion.''

Israeli woman stabbed to death in the Jordan Valley
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with assailant shot in the legs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian stabbed to death an Israeli woman
in the West Bank on Friday before being shot and wounded by Israeli
troops, a witness and radio reports said.
	   The attack took place at an intersection outside the Jewish
settlement of Tomer in the West Bank's Jordan Valley, about 10
miles (15 kilometers) north of the Palestinian-run town of Jericho.
	   The stabbing occurred at about 11 a.m. (0900 gmt) when a
Palestinian man wielding a knife repeatedly stabbed the Israeli
woman, Moshe Zehavi, a Tomer resident, told Israel radio.
	   The woman fell to the ground, critically wounded. The assailant
remained at the scene, knife in hand, for a few moments and tried
to attack others approaching the area, Zehavi said.
	   Eventually, he ran away and was shot in the legs by members of
the paramilitary border police pursuing him.
	   Israel radio said the attacker was being interrogated.
	   The army said it knew of the incident, but would not comment
further.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the attacker belonged to a
Palestinian militant group or acted on his own.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas threatened last month to attack
Israelis in retaliation for the killing of two Hamas fugitives by
Israeli troops. However, Hamas in the past has mainly carried out
bombings in Israeli cities, not stabbings.

Kohl and Schroeder will decide on NATO, foreign minister says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl will not
make any decisions about German participation in a NATO attack on
Serbia without the agreement of the incoming government, Kohl's
foreign minister said Friday.
	   In an interview with the Munich-based Sueddeutsche Zeitung,
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel insisted that ``Germany is completely
capable of acting'' during the transition. Kohl remains in office
until Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder is sworn at the end of
October.
	   Kosovo was expected to top the agenda when Schroeder meets with
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday. Kinkel said a decision on
Germany's position regarding NATO action would be made after that
session.
	   Before leaving for Washington, Schroeder met with Kohl. And
Kinkel said he briefed Schroeder's expected foreign minister,
Greens leader Joschka Fischer, and potential defense minister,
Guenter Verheugen, on Kosovo. Both traveled to Washington with
Schroeder.
	   The incoming government is ``already completely included'' in
decisions on Kosovo, Kinkel told the newspaper. ``Nothing more will
happen that Schroeder and Fischer wouldn't be able to join in on.''
	   Clinton was expected to try to bring Germany's new leaders
around to supporting Washington's position that no new U.N.
Security Council resolution is needed for NATO action.
	   Schroeder's center-left coalition has generally argued that
acting without U.N. approval would violate international law. But
in Paris last week, Schroeder also left open that ``if the
situation modifies, we may have to take a new position.''
	   Also accompanying Schroeder in Washington is Ludger Volmer, a
representative of the leftist Greens party's anti-NATO wing. His
inclusion appeared intended to help Fischer sell whatever decision
is made in Washington to his party's left-wing, which insists on a
direct U.N. mandate before any action.
	   The rift between pragmatists and pacifists in the small party
could present the first major foreign policy challenge for
Schroeder, who has stressed he wants Germany to remain a reliable
ally.
	   While Kohl's government has already offered 14 German Tornado
fighters for any NATO strike, another Cabinet decision is required
before they can actually be deployed. That decision would then also
have to be confirmed by parliament.
	   Kinkel said the European allies were under ``enormous pressure''
from the United States to quickly decide for a military attack on
Serbia over Kosovo.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A prominent Buddhist monk has made what
some followers have interpreted as a suicide threat unless they
donate more to his fund to help pay off Thailand's national debt,
the newspaper The Nation reported Friday.
	   Phra Maha Bua Yanasampanno, 87, set a target of 336 million baht
(dlrs 8.4 million) in donations, but said so far he has received
just less than half that.
	   As a result, he said he would soon ``give up his spirit'' if the
target were not met, prompting some of his followers to fear he may
intend to take his life or withdraw from leading them.
	   Since July, the monk has made headlines for handing over 546
kilograms (1,200 pounds) of gold worth more than 200 million baht
(dlrs 5 million) and several million baht (hundreds of thousand of
dollars) in cash to Thailand's central bank.
	   The popular monk from Udon Thani, 470 kilometers (292 miles)
northeast of Bangkok, has collected donations from overseas Thais
as well as his devotees throughout the country.
	   His campaign, begun in April, was one of several launched with
the general theme of ``Thais Helping Thais'' in the face of the
country's worst economic crisis in modern times.
	   Thailand's central bank squandered nearly all its foreign
reserves last year in a failed defense of the country's currency,
the baht. The government was forced to float the baht in July 1997,
sending the region into a financial crisis that required billions
of dollars in bailouts from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Although thousands of Thais have donated money, jewelry and
other belongings in an attempt to reduce the national debt, none of
the politicians, bankers and bureaucrats who threw away the
national reserves, or failed to prevent the central bank from doing
so, have donated anything.

Allies seek to get Russia to ease opposition to airstrikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The 16 NATO allies, at a meeting at the
alliance's headquarters, sought to pressure Russia Friday into
ending its opposition to using force to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   The meeting of the NATO ambassadors with the Russian envoy to
the alliance came a day after Washington made another bid to end
the Kosovo violence peacefully though Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic airstrikes
were near.
	   The allies were searching for an adequate legal basis for such
strikes other than a new United Nations Security Council
resolution. The latter will allow Russia to veto such strikes.
	   But divisions remained within NATO on that point, too.
	   Italy has cast doubts on the assertions of NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana and Albright that no new U.N. resolution was
necessary.
	   While insisting conditions were not ripe for a military strike,
Italy's Premier Romano Prodi said any intervention must ``be
legitimated'' by the council. ``We do not believe that the chances
of a political solution have been exhausted,'' he said Thursday.
	   And in Germany, the Greens party, which is about to enter the
national government, also sounded hesitant. ``We want to keep NATO
from giving itself a mandate,'' according to Greens defense expert
Angelika Beer said.
	   Greece and Spain have also shown hesitation but appeared to have
moved to the notion that no new U.N. decision was needed for an
allied military campaign.
	   On Friday, officials said the NATO ambassadors were bound to
meet into the weekend to discuss a common ``legal basis'' for
airstrikes.
	   Albright, Solana, special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark were here Thursday to
assess chances of a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis.
	   Albright also wanted to rally all allies for the cause. ``I
believe it is time for the allies to move to the next phase of
decision-making,'' she said.
	   NATO military officials have repeatedly said the alliance it is
ready to launch an airstrike as soon as it gets the green light.
	   Albright met in London Thursday with her counterparts from
Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov gave an account of talks he
had in Belgrade with Milosevic. U.S. officials said earlier they
believed Russia would serve in an international force to verify any
settlement, if one is finally reached.

Syria wants balanced U.S. position in dispute with Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria has asked the United States to take
what it called an objective stand in its dispute with Turkey, the
official Syrian newspaper Al-Thawra reported Friday.
	   Washington should ``take a balanced and clear position toward
the provocative statements made by Turkish officials,'' it quoted
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa as telling U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Martin Indyk. The two spoke by telephone
Thursday.
	   Ankara has accused Syria of hosting and aiding Kurdish rebels
who are fighting for autonomy in Turkey. On Wednesday, Turkey
demanded that Syria expel the rebels or ``face the consequences.''
	   Syria denies the charges, but the row has sparked fears in the
region of a war. Both Egypt and Iran have embarked on efforts at
mediation.
	   On a visit Thursday to Cairo, Egypt, Indyk urged Syria to ``take
seriously'' Turkey's concerns and said they should be addressed on
an ``urgent basis.'' He called on Turkey to show restraint.

Report: accord closer for stake in Telecom's Stream
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An accord among the parties vying for a stake in
Telecom Italia SpA's digital TV platform Stream appears one step
closer, Italian newspapers reported Friday.
	   Officials at Telecom weren't immediately available for comment.
	   Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported Friday that
agreement has come on the size of the stakes.
	   The question of how much Rupert Murdoch's British Sky
Broadcasting Group PLC will own has been a sticking point.
	   According to Sole, Murdoch will accept a 20 percent stake in
Stream, considerably lower than his first request for a 40 percent
stake.
	   France's Canal Plus SA, which controls existing Italian digital
provider Telepiu, will get a 15 percent stake which may later be
turned over to Murdoch, the report said. State television RAI was
expected to get a 14 percent stake.
	   Telecom will retain 51 percent of its digital pay-TV unit
Stream. Telecom now owns 100 percent.

Israel to withhold prize from Generali president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel will withhold an award from an Italian
insurance company that has refused to release information on
Holocaust era policies, an adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Friday.
	   Bobby Brown, Netanyahu's adviser on diaspora affairs, said
Assicurazioni Generali has not complied with requests to release
information on 337,000 World War II policies. The company's
president was to receive an award at an economic conference
Wednesday for Generali's contribution to the Israeli economy.
	   Generali could still receive the award if it agrees in writing
before the conference to release the information, Brown said.
	   ``My deepest wish is to give them the prize,'' Brown said.
``I've stated what we look at as the minimum for what we need to
give the prize.''
	   Brown said Generali had not given any sign it would act before
the prime minister's ``Jubilee Business Conference'' next week.
	   Generali, Italy's largest insurer, had provided information on
the policies about six months ago to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust
memorial and research institute. The chairman of the Yad Vashem,
Avner Shalev, said last month that at least 100,000 of those
policies were taken out by Jews.
	   Under the terms of the agreement, Yad Vashem cannot publish the
information, but may only use it for its own research.
	   Generali President Antoine Bernheim is among dozens of
international business leaders are to receive the ``Jubilee Award''
on Wednesday. Generali spent dlrs 320 million in 1997 to acquire a
majority position in Midgal, an Israeli insurance company.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police have allowed jailed former
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim to meet with his wife and
children, a family aide said Friday.
	   Azizah Ismail, Anwar's wife, took their six children, aged 6 to
19, to federal police headquarters Thursday night to meet with the
country's former No. 2 leader. The aide did not say how long the
meeting lasted.
	   Since his arrest Sept. 20, Anwar's family had been allowed to
see him only once previously. Police allowed a brief private
meeting before Anwar was taken to a courtroom for one of his
pre-trial proceedings. The family made repeated pleas for another
visit.
	   Anwar, 51, was arrested under the Internal Security Act, which
allows jail without trial, after two weeks of rallies around
Malaysia, where he called for political reform and an end to Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar as his deputy and finance minister on Sept.
2, saying the one-time heir apparent was morally unfit to lead.
Anwar says he was sacked because of his rising popularity.
	   Anwar has since been charged with corruption and illegal
homosexual acts. He has pleaded innocent to all the charges and is
to stand trial beginning Nov. 2.
	   Meanwhile, Yaakob Amin, the head of Malaysia's criminal
investigation department, said police would not allow Anwar's
lawyers to meet him until they receive permission from the Attorney
General's office.
	   ``To my knowledge, Anwar's lawyers have yet to meet with the
Attorney General's office to discuss who among them should meet
Anwar,'' Yaakob was quoted as saying in the Malay-language
newspaper Utusan Melayu Friday.
	   When Anwar appeared in the High Court Monday, a judge assured
defense lawyers that any three of Anwar's eight lawyers could meet
with the jailed dissident without restriction to prepare for the
upcoming trial.
	   Except for brief meetings in court, however, Anwar's defense
team has been denied access to their client.
	   On Thursday, his lawyers filed a habeas corpus appeal in the
High Court demanding Anwar's release.
	   ``We claim that his detention is illegal and we'll prove that in
court,'' one of Anwar's lawyers, Pawancheek Marican said, adding an
early hearing date had been requested.

Seventy-five illegal immigrants arrive at British base
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Seventy-five immigrants who paid dlrs
2,000 for passage to Italy on board what authorities described as
``a floating coffin'' were dumped on the beach of a British base in
southern Cyprus, officials at the base said Friday.
	   The immigrants, including a baby born on board the boat, arrived
on the eastern Mediterranean island Thursday afternoon after
drifting at sea, a statement from the base said. The group included
10 women, 19 children and four other infants, the statement said.
	   The boat left from an unidentified Lebanese port and the
immigrants were of ``Middle East origin,'' base authorities said,
but there were no further details on their nationalities.
	   It was the second time in less than four months that a boat of
illegal immigrants has arrived in Cyprus. In June, 112 people, most
of them from Africa and the Middle East, paid about dlrs 4,000 for
passage from the Lebanese port of Tripoli to Italy.
	   They were rescued after their boat broke down off southern
Cyprus. Most have been sent back to their countries of origin.
	   The 75 people left the boat Thursday after it apparently broke
down and pulled up near the Cypriot coast. Authorities at the base
detained six other people on board the boat, the statement said.
	   ``It is no exaggeration to call this vessel a floating coffin.
It leaks badly, is mechanically unsound and would have foundered if
the weather had been any worse,'' the statement quoted Andy
Livingstone, the base's chief customs officer, as saying.
	   The statement said each person paid dlrs 2,000 for passage. It
was not immediately clear how long they were at sea or what caused
the boat to break down. The boat was towed to the base's port.
	   Cyprus usually deports illegal immigrants.

Swiss to publish names of World War II refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland will publish the names of
the 51,000 refugees it took in during World War II, the government
said Friday.
	   The names will appear on the Internet and in book form, the
ruling coalition cabinet said in a written reply to a lawmaker's
question.
	   No date was given for the publication, which the government said
would be ``useful to enrich the knowledge of Swiss history in this
period.'' Swiss data protection law will have to be altered before
it goes ahead.
	   The list of names from police files between 1939 and 1945 is
already available for historical research in a database at the
Swiss Federal Archive.
	   It also has been given to Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial
and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.
	   Full information is not yet available for the number of refugees
taken in between 1933, when Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany,
and 1939, the government said.
	   Surrounded by Germany, Nazi-occupied France and Nazi-allied
Italy, wartime Switzerland took in nearly 30,000 Jews. But it
turned away an equal number, many of them to a certain death.
	   The committee of independent historians set up to investigate
Switzerland's wartime past will publish next spring a report
investigating Switzerland's refugee policy during the period.
	   The report follows the panel's studies on Swiss gold dealings
with Nazi Germany, published in November and May.

Allies seek to get Russia to ease opposition to airstrikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO allies sought to pressure
Russia into ending its opposition to using force in Kosovo Friday.
	   The meeting of the 16 NATO ambassadors with the Russian envoy to
the alliance came a day after Washington made another bid to end
the Kosovo violence peacefully though Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic airstrikes
were near.
	   The allies were searching for an adequate legal basis for such
strikes other than a new U.N. Security Council resolution. The
latter would allow Russia to veto such strikes.
	   But divisions remained within NATO on that point, too.
	   Italy has cast doubts on the assertions of NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana and Albright that no new U.N. resolution was
necessary.
	   While insisting conditions were not ripe for a military strike,
Italy's Premier Romano Prodi said any intervention must ``be
legitimated'' by the council. ``We do not believe that the chances
of a political solution have been exhausted,'' he said Thursday.
	   And in Germany, the Greens party, which is about to enter the
national government, also sounded hesitant. ``We want to keep NATO
from giving itself a mandate,'' according to Greens defense expert
Angelika Beer said.
	   Greece and Spain have also shown hesitation but appeared to have
moved to the notion that no new U.N. decision was needed for an
allied military campaign.
	   On Friday, officials said the NATO ambassadors were bound to
meet into the weekend to discuss a common ``legal basis'' for
airstrikes.
	   NATO military officials have repeatedly said the alliance is
ready to launch an airstrike as soon as it gets the green light.

	   ANNAKA, Japan (AP) _ Akira Kawamata shot a 2-under-par 70 Friday
and took a one-stroke lead midway through the 50 million yen (dlrs
407,000) Japan PGA Senior Championship.
	   The 51-year-old Kawamata, who has yet to win on the senior tour,
shot four birdies and two bogeys for a two-round total of 3-under
141 on the 6,749-yard, par-72 Shimoakima Country Club course.
	   Haruo Yasuda also shot a 70 and shared second place at 142 with

	   Yasuda is in contention for his fourth victory on the senior
tour, while Sugihara is seeking his seventh. Both players have yet
to win this season.
	   Another stroke back at 143 were Ichiro Teramoto, Taiwan's Kuo
Chie-hsiung and Koji Nakajima.
	   A total of 67 players survived the cut at 10-over 154.
	   The winner will collect 7.5 million yen (dlrs 61,000).

<TEXT>
	   LLORET DE MAR, Spain (AP) _ Deep sadness and outbursts of anger
set the mood Friday for survivors of a pleasure boat tragedy in
which 20 French tourists drowned in a lake in northeastern Spain.
	   ``I don't really know what is going to happen now and I don't
really care,'' said Jean Loulier staring at his breakfast at the
tour group's hotel in this seaside resort.
	   Loulier, 70, like many of the 141 vacationing retirees who opted
for a boat trip around the nearby tranquil Lake Banyoles, had felt
lucky when he won a discount price vacation.
	   ``Most was free, but the excursions we paid, like the one
yesterday,'' said the widowed former schoolteacher whose female
traveling companion, who he did not identify, could not swim and
drowned.
	   The electric-powered catamaran was pulling away from its mooring
for a half hour trip over the mountain-surrounded lake, 565
kilometers (350 miles) northeast of Madrid, when its stern began to
sink. It went down fast.
	   Officials said overloading appeared the most likely cause, as
141 tickets were sold for a boat only authorized to carry 80
passengers.
	   In the provincial capital of Girona, a judge was to hear
testimony from the directors of the La Carpa firm which owns the
catamaran, while police underwater divers resumed work to bring the
craft to shore.
	   The search also continued for two people authorities believe may
have gone on the doomed excursion but have yet to be accounted for.
	   ``Just greed, greed'' said one survivor who also raged about the
lack of consideration for the tourists in the wake of the tragedy.
	   ``I had to go to a public phone box to call my daughter,'' he
said before realizing he was talking to a reporter.
	   ``Journalist!'' he shouted, and began pushing this reporter out
of the hotel and ripping her notepad into shreds.
	   But some wanted to tell the story.
	   ``It was like the Titantic, the way it went down'' said Evelyn
Bengoechea, 52. She survived by grabbing a life preserver shaped
like a ring after her husband, who could swim, pushed her out of
the boat.
	   ``I want to thank the people who helped pull us out,'' she said.
	   Michel Evielle, 50, has been driving tourist buses for 17 years.
He was drinking coffee by the lakeside when the boat began to sink.
	   ``It went down in 30 seconds,'' he said, recalling how he helped
pull out the floundering passengers.
	   ``Some of those who could swim were carrying others who
couldn't, and then others would grab onto their backs.''
	   Meanwhile, French Tourism Minister Michele Demessine visited the
21 people remaining in hospital Friday and was to meet other
survivors at their hotel.
	   Two of the injured were said to be in serious condition, but the
remainder were expected to be allowed to travel back to France on
Friday.
	   Repatriation of the corpses was also set to begin later in the
day.

Wildlife found covered in oil as pollution from sunken wreck
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INVERCARGILL, New Zealand (AP) _ Efforts intensified Friday to
protect the wilderness coast of New Zealand's isolated Stewart
Island from an oil slick as the first fouled wildlife was
discovered, authorities said.
	   The oil came from the South Korean fishing ship Dong Won 529,
which sank Thursday, two days after running aground on rocks near
the Breaksea Islands. Surging seas caused the rocks to rip a hole
in the hull. The ship's 38 crew members were evacuated.
	   Maritime Safety Authority officers said Friday that birds had
been found covered in oil from the slick, which was up to 5 miles
(8 kilometers) long and 2 miles (3 kilometers) wide, on the ocean
surface.
	   Oil also had washed up on Stewart Island, authority chief
Russell Kilvington said.
	   Penguins, thousands of muttonbirds, brown kiwis, seals and a
wide range of other bird and sea life lived in the area where the
ship sank.
	   Fog rolled around the site Friday, forcing back helicopters that
had been spraying dispersing agents on to the slick. Boats
continued to spread the oil-fighting chemicals.
	   ``While we're frustrated by the fog, what we have applied has
had quite a positive impact,'' Kilvington said.
	   ``It's certainly not a major ecological disaster at the present
time.''
	   Divers had plugged holes in the wreck's hull, and little or no
oil was now escaping, he said.
	   The Dong Won had been carrying 360 metric tons of diesel and
more than 100 metric tons of lubricating and hydraulic oil when it
went aground.
	   Kilvington said the immediate focus was on protecting the
threatened Stewart Island dotterell and other wildlife. Only 100 of
the rare birds are believed to remain in the area.
	   He said the oil had reached the high tide mark on Stewart
Island, but dispersants had succeeded in keeping most of the slick
from reaching the coast.
	   Dispersants were also being used to keep the slick from reaching
nearby Patterson Inlet, which contains mussel, salmon and oyster
farms, as well as paua (abalone) beds and crayfish fisheries.
	   Kilvington said the Korean owner of the ship would be asked to
pay for the anti-fouling operation, which had already cost hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
	   Kilvington earlier warned that the wreck could lead to New
Zealand's worst-ever shoreline pollution disaster. There has been
no serious oil leak at sea in the country.

Taliban says it won't send representative to Pakistan to meet UN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban army declined
an invitation Friday by the United Nations special envoy to come to
Pakistan to negotiate an end to the standoff between the religious
militia and neighboring Iran.
	   The U.N. envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, said he can't go to Afghanistan
citing security reasons and instead asked the Taliban to send a
representative to Pakistan.
	   ``We will not send a representative, he should come to
Afghanistan,'' said Abdul Hai Mutmayan, a spokesman for the Taliban
army reached at the militia's headquarters in southern Kandahar.
	   Mutmayan rejected U.N. security concerns saying, ``that's a lie.
It is secure in Kandahar.''
	   But Brahimi said Thursday when he arrived in Pakistan from Iran
that the U.N. has forbidden all international staff from traveling
to Afghanistan.
	   The United Nations pulled its international staff out of
Afghanistan on Aug. 21, after an Italian staffer was shot and
killed in apparent retaliation for U.S. missile strikes a day
earlier against suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan.
	   Since then the U.N. has been negotiating with the Taliban for
its return.

Sudanese rebels extend cease-fire

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sudanese rebels extended a cease-fire in
parts of southern Sudan for three more months to allow humanitarian
aid to continue to flow to their hungry countrymen.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army said the cease-fire, covering
the provinces of Bahr el-Ghazal and Western Upper Nile, would be
extended from 3 p.m. (1300 GMT) Wednesday when the current
three-month truce expires.
	   The rebels said in a statement issued in Nairobi, Kenya late
Thursday they made the unilateral decision because they were
``deeply concerned by the continuing humanitarian tragedy in Bahr
el-Ghazal and other areas.''
	   There was no immediate comment from the Sudanese government on
whether it would also extend the current cease-fire, which it has
said applies to all of southern Sudan.
	   The government canceled talks, scheduled for this week, on
renewing the cease-fire, complaining the rebels had exploited it to
shift forces to Eastern Equatoria, the scene of current fighting.
	   State-run radio said Friday Sudanese forces have fended off
rebel attacks on Juba, the second largest city under government
control in the south. The government also regained control of the
road linking it to a nearby army camp, Omdurman radio reported.
	   The SPLA sustained heavy losses in the clashes Thursday near
Juba, said an army communique read on the radio. It did not provide
casualty figures for either side.
	   ``Our forces were able ... to complete the cleansing and purging
of this sector _ all of it _ by force and strong will,'' it said.
	   The SPLA has been engaged in a new offensive with government
forces in the southern province of East Equatoria since Sept. 14
and made repeated advances around Juba in recent weeks. The town is
1,200 kilometers (740 miles) south of Khartoum.
	   The rebels, from mostly Christian and animist southern Sudanese,
have fought the Islamic-controlled government for 15 years to gain
greater autonomy.
	   The civil war often has led to famine because rebels or
government-backed militia burn or steal crops to deny food to their
enemies. About 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
famines.
	   David Fletcher, U.N. World Food Program coordinator for southern
Sudan, welcomed the rebels' extension of the cease-fire, and
expressed hope the government would follow suit.
	   ``The cease-fire helps us with access and it also avoids
population movements,'' which have worsened the famine, he said.
The famine has subsided in recent months, but is not yet over, the
United Nations has said.
	   The World Food Program and other agencies are pushing for an
expansion of the cease-fire zone.

Asian stock markets close generally mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally mixed
Friday, with the key indexes soaring in Hong Kong and Seoul, but
tumbling in Tokyo to a 13-year low.
	   The strengthening of Japan's yen currency hurt share prices in
Tokyo, while helping them elsewhere. In late afternoon, the U.S.
dollar was quoted at 117.20 yen, down 5.16 yen from late Thursday
in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 119.05 yen
overnight.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 567.28 points,
or 7.1 percent, closing at 8,506.79. On Thursday, the index had
gained 194.79 points.
	   Expectations of a short-term interest rate cut in Hong Kong led
to the sharp rise in the market, said Philip Chan, head of research
at Shenyin Wanguo Securities Ltd.
	   Brokers said investors also bought shares because of the yen's
strengthening.
	   South Korean shares also soared, with the main index surging 7.5
percent on bullish sentiment over the yen's surge against the
dollar.
	   A stronger yen will help South Korean companies gain price
competitiveness against products made by their Japanese rivals.
	   On the Seoul Stock Exchange, the Korea Composite Stock Price
Index rose 22.74 points to 327.96.
	   Tokyo stocks fell for a second day as the dollar's continuing
slide against the yen darkened profit outlooks at top exporters.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average tumbled 146.09 points, or 1.12 percent,
closing at 12,879.97 _ its lowest finish since December 1985.
	   On Thursday, the average had plunged 799.55 points in its
largest points fall of the year.
	   The dollar dived briefly to a 16-month low of 111.73 yen in
overnight trading from more than 135 yen earlier this week.
	   The drop, which began Wednesday amid reports Japan might soon
adopt new spending measures to boost its economy, caught many hedge
fund managers by surprise, traders said.
	   They had been betting the dollar would rise against the Japanese
currency. But when the dollar started to fall, the fund managers
dumped their holdings, adding momentum to the greenback's slide.
	   Indonesian share prices closed sharply higher on the back of
lower local interest rates. The key Composite Index rose 16.29
points, or 5.6 percent, to 311.960.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The market's
key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 26.06 points, or 0.37 percent,
to 6,944.17.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, with brokers
saying the local market suffered because of continued global
economic uncertainty. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 25.14 points,
or 1.4 percent, to 1,704.47.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher for the fourth straight
session in reaction to the gains posted by the yen against the
dollar. The PSE Index rose 50.95 points, or 4.0 percent, to
1,301.36.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower. The All Ordinaries
Index fell 12.0 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,491.3.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: The key Composite Index slipped 0.77 point to
372.22.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed higher as foreign fund buying in
several component stocks bolstered key indexes, dealers said. The
benchmark Straits Times Index rose 2.7 percent, or 25.69 points, to
976.65.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher. The Stock Exchange of
Thailand index rose 7.28 points, or 2.5 percent, to 292.50.

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ The Justice Ministry will release 10,000
people held in connection with the 1994 genocide whose files
contain no concrete evidence against them, Radio Rwanda said
Friday.
	   The state-run radio quoted Justice Minister Faustin Ntezilyayo
as saying prosecutors and defense ministry officials discussed the
plan Thursday.
	   The radio said 120,000 people were being held in connection with
the extremist Hutu government-organized slaughter of half a million
people, including minority Tutsis and politically moderate Tutsis.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross puts the figure at
126,000 detainees.
	   Ntezilayayo was quoted by the radio as saying that those whose
files contain only their names, date and places of birth and other
personal information would be released, but he did not say when nor
how many at a time would be set free.
	   More than 330 people have been tried in Rwanda in connection
with the genocide, and 116 have been sentenced to death. At least
22 have been executed.
	   In the aftermath of the mass killings, many people were detained
on a simple accusation. The country's legal system was in shambles
after four years of civil conflict, and many of the judges and
court officials had either fled or been killed.
	   There has been strong international pressure on Rwanda to do
something about the severe overcrowding in prisons where detainees
in pink cotton shorts and shirts are packed into small spaces with
no indication when or if they cases will ever come to trial.
	   A U.N. International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda based in
neighboring Tanzania, which is trying some of the alleged
masterminds of the genocide, has convicted one person, who has
appealed. A second person pleaded guilty.
	   The tribunal, whose harshest sentence is life in prison, is
holding 31 people in custody.

Lawmakers debate homosexual rights bill

	   PARIS (AP) _ French lawmakers opened debate Friday on a
controversial bill that would give legal status to unmarried
couples, including homosexuals _ a move opponents fear will
undermine the traditional family.
	   Rightist deputies were expected to file up to 800 amendments in
a move to trip up passage of the bill, sponsored by the Socialists
who, along with their leftist allies, dominate the 577-seat
National Assembly.
	   The Civil Solidarity Pact, or PACS, ``is not a sub-marriage, a
clone or a quasi-marriage,'' Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou told
lawmakers. ``It is not a solemn act like marriage,'' she said.
	   PACS provides fiscal and social advantages to homosexual couples
and unwed heterosexual couples.
	   It reaches the National Assembly after a decade of lobbying by
homosexual groups and heated debate over the issue.
	   Religious leaders _ Roman Catholic, Jewish and Muslim _ oppose
PACS, along with most rightist politicians and various associations
in favor of the family or against abortion.
	   They all fear such a law would diminish marriage by giving the
state's blessing to non-traditional unions.
	   Riding beneath the surface is the fear that PACS will open the
door to adoptions by homosexual couples and artificial procreation
for the benefit of homosexuals.
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin tried to reassure
opponents of the proposal in a television interview on the eve of
debate.
	   ``Marriage is an institution ... and will remain so,'' Jospin
said. ``Adoption (by homosexuals) is forbidden and will remain
so.''
	   Homosexual couples will still be forbidden to have children
through artificial procreation, Jospin said.
	   Alternative lifestyles ``should not become, via the law, social
references,'' Catholic bishops have said, calling the bill
``dangerous.''
	   The government ``has ceded to the homosexual lobby,''
conservative lawmaker Etienne Pinte said earlier.
	   Pinte, echoing other opponents, expressed fears the legislation
``will upset the equilibrium of society which for thousands of
years has been based on the family. And the family is a father and
a mother.''
	   For Jospin, the bill simply ``takes into account the evolution
of society.''
	   Today, in France, some 4.4 million heterosexual couples live
together outside marriage. The figure for homosexual couples is not
known.
	   The bill is aimed at providing fiscal, social and inheritance
benefits for those groups.
	   Among other things, it would allow those subscribing to the
Civil Solidarity Pact to file joint tax returns, diminishing the
tax burden; bequeath more money to the partner through a lightening
of the inheritance tax load; and provide all the benefits of
married people at the work place.
	   It also would allow a homosexual to benefit from his partner's
social security coverage.
	   Any two unrelated people, even friends, can enter a PACS union,
which can be ended at will, by marriage or death.

Work on Taiwan power plant moves ahead as opposition drops
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUNGLIAO, Taiwan (AP) _ With the angry protests of past years a
faint memory, Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant is nearly a
quarter complete, the state-owned Taiwan Power Co. said Friday.
	   The embattled plant is on schedule to reach full output in July
2004, adding 2,700 megawatts to Taiwan's 23,763 megawatts of
installed capacity, said Lin Chu-wan, director of the project in
coastal Kungliao township, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of
Taipei.
	   On the project site, giant backhoes load soil and shale into
trucks from a 27 meter- (89 foot)-deep hole where the plant's No. 2
reactor will sit. Massive concrete jacks sit on the beach where
they will become part of a breakwater for the plant's landing dock
and cooling water intake station.
	   Corrugated steel storehouses, offices and dormitories make up
the 22 percent of the total project completed. So far, 25.1 billion
Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 765 million) of the total 169 billion
Taiwan dollar (U.S. dlrs 5.1 billion) budget has been spent, with
the plant's two reactors yet to arrive.
	   Outside the plant, once prominent protest banners placed by
opponents from the anti-nuclear lobby and local community have been
removed or blown away by the sea winds. Angry pickets displaying
pictures of the Russian power plant disaster at Chernobyl and
victims of nuclear bombs are long gone.
	   The plant originally was conceived in 1980, but its budget was
frozen twice by the legislature, where opponents claimed reliance
on nuclear power was dangerous and unnecessary.
	   Amid sometimes violent protests by Kungliao residents and
anti-nuclear groups, the budget was restored and General Electric
of the United States awarded the reactor bid in May 1996.
	   Since then, opposition has fallen considerably as politicians
drop anti-nuclear arguments as a strategy for mobilizing supporters
_ though Taipower officials say they expect another round of
protests to accompany general elections in December.
	   Meanwhile, Kungliao's some 10,000 residents are coming to
realize the advantages of a compensation package offering them 1
percent of total energy sales from the plant annually, said Wu
Ching-tung, a former township chief.
	   ``People have calmed down, and for this area, the plant will
mean a lot,'' said Wu, seated at one of the many seafood
restaurants that line the coastal road.
	   Some disputes remain though, especially with local fishermen
over compensation for alleged damage to fish stocks. And the local
council has refused to accept compensation money paid by Taipower,
leaving the funds sitting with the township power authority.
	   Taiwan imports 96 percent of its energy needs, which Taipower
officials say will grow with the island's expanding population and
economy. Nuclear power is still the cheapest way to produce
electricity, and now furnishes 21.6 percent of the island's power,
against 59.3 percent for coal- and oil-fired power plants and 18.1
percent for hydroelectric plants, said Taipower spokesman Chen
Mu-lin.
	   In a recent statement, Premier Vincent Siew said Taiwan would
not increase the proportion of energy from nuclear power or add new
reactors before 2020.

Israeli woman killed; clashes in Hebron
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with funeral march, INCORPORATES BC-Israel-Stabbing &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Thousands of Palestinians, some
brandishing automatic weapons and chanting ``revenge,'' marched
Friday in the funeral procession of a 20-year-old man killed a day
before in clashes with Israeli troops.
	   In the West Bank's Jordan Valley, an Israeli woman was stabbed
to death by a Palestinian man outside the Jewish settlement of
Tomer. Israeli troops shot and wounded the assailant.
	   The violence overshadowed preparations by Israel and the
Palestinians for next week's Mideast summit in Washington under the
auspices of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   In Hebron, funeral services for 20-year-old Amjad Natche were
held in a small mosque overflowing with thousands of mourners. Many
laid their prayer rugs in the dust outside the mosque as Koranic
verses played over loudspeakers.
	   After noon prayers, Natche's body was carried for several miles
on a wooden pellet toward the cemetery. As the procession wound
through hilly streets, mourners chanted ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God
is Great,'' and three brandished automatic weapons.
	   One masked man, a follower of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
Fatah group who carried a mini-Uzi submachine gun, said he was
sending a warning to Israel that Palestinians were armed and ready
to rise up if Israel continued its hardline policies.
	   Several mourners, activists in the Islamic militant group Hamas,
chanted ``revenge, revenge.''
	   Natche, who belongs to one of the largest clans in Hebron, was
killed Thursday in stone-throwing clashes with Israeli soldiers.
	   Confrontations resumed Friday when several dozen Palestinians,
some masked and twirling slingshots, threw stones and emtpy bottles
at troops who fired a few rounds of rubber-coated steel pellets.
One Palestinian was injured.
	   In a leaflet, Fatah had called for ``a day of confrontations
with the occupier.''
	   Tensions in the city of 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish
settlers have been running high since Sept. 30 when an assailant,
apparently a Palestinian, threw two hand grenades at Israeli
soldiers guarding Jewish enclaves in the downtown area. Two dozen
people, including 11 Israeli soldiers, were injured.
	   In response, Israel sealed off Hebron, barring Palestinians from
entering and leaving the city. Israeli troops also clamped a
closure on the Israeli-controlled downtown area, confining 30,000
Palestinians living there to their homes.
	   The closure of the city was lifted Thursday, but the curfew
remained in effect Friday.
	   Palestinians have also be angered by the laying of a cornerstone
this week in Tel Romeida, a tiny Jewish enclave of seven mobile
homes wedged into a Palestinian neighborhood. The ceremony was
attended by Israeli Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom.
	   In response to the killing of a Tel Romeida resident last month,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to replace the trailers
with permanent building. The Fatah leaflet cited the Tel Romeida
construction plans as one of the reasons for renewed clashes.

Italy and EU reach last-minute accord on Malpensa airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ After months of haggling between Rome and Brussels,
an accord ready for signing Friday contains a compromise allowing
other EU countries' airlines to temporarily use Milan's more
convenient Linate airport.
	   Transport Minister Claudio Burlando and European Transport
Commissioner Neil Kinnock reached the agreement Thursday night.
	   The compromise allows airlines to keep 34 percent of their
flights at Linate until transport links to Malpensa are complete.
	   Malpensa is 53 kilometers (33 miles) from downtown Milan, while
Linate is just 10 kilometers (6 miles) away.
	   Airlines with fewer than 18 flights to Milan a week will be able
to maintain all flights at Linate.
	   The Commission, the EU's executive body, estimated that the
Malpensa's road and rail links will be ready by the end of the
2000.
	   Burlando's original decree, presented in February, was rejected
by the EU Commission because it was seen as violating the European
fair competition rules.
	   Under that plan, foreign airlines flying in and out of Milan
would be obliged to move next month from Linate airport to
Malpensa. Only the Italian carrier Alitalia's shuttle flights
between Rome and Milan would have been allowed to stay at Linate.
	   Nine European airlines complained that poor road and rail links
from Malpensa to downtown Milan would make their passengers switch
to Alitalia.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serb leader has threatened to send
NATO troops home ``in coffins'' if the alliance attacks to try to
halt Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo. U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke arrived in
Belgrade Friday with a message for Milosevic from U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright that ``time is all but gone'' for a
peaceful settlement. Albright declared Thursday that a united NATO
stands ready to authorize bombing of the Serbs for their military
actions in Kosovo. Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw
substantial forces from the province, where ethnic Albanians are
fighting for independence. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Scores of Palestinians, some masked and
some twirling slingshots, threw stones and empty bottles at Israeli
soldiers in Hebron on Friday. Israeli troops initially did not
respond, but after about an hour began firing rubber-coated steel
pellets. One Palestinian was lightly injured. In clashes in Hebron
on Thursday, a 20-year-old Palestinian was killed by Israeli army
fire, and more than a dozen people were injured, including a
freelance photographer for the Agence France Press news agency who
was in serious condition with a head injury. Following the unrest,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement renewed a call to
activists to throw stones at Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers
in Hebron on Friday. (ISRAEL-HEBRON)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers for Malaysia's most
prominent political dissident went to court Friday to demand his
release from indefinite detention. Lawyers for Anwar Ibrahim, the
former deputy prime minister, will argue that he is being unjustly
held, his wife, Azizah Ismail, told reporters. Anwar, 51, was
arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act, which allows
indefinite detention without trial. His arrest came after two weeks
of rallies where he called for government reform, an end to
corruption and the resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ In the toughest bargaining so far,
Germany's newly elected Social Democrats agreed with their likely
coalition partners to cut income taxes, but smothered a dispute
over how much to raise energy taxes. Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder has said that one of his top priorities is to overhaul
Germany's high taxes, which are often seen as a heavy burden on
Europe's biggest economy. His Social Democrats and the
environmentalist Greens party hope that lower taxes will bring down
double-digit unemployment. They agreed Thursday to specific plans
to cut taxes for middle-class Germans, and to a general demand by
the Greens for increases in energy taxes over the next four years.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani lawmakers took a giant step
Friday toward creating a new Islamic order in this economically
troubled nation of 140 million people. The National Assembly, the
powerful lower House of Parliament, voted 151 to 16 to pass a
constitutional amendment giving the federal government sweeping
powers to interpret and impose laws based on interpretations of the
Muslim holy book, the Koran. But before the amendment can become
law, it requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate, something
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif may have difficulty acquiring. While
his ruling Pakistan Muslim League controls a two-thirds majority in
the lawmaking National Assembly, it does not have the votes to pass
the amendment in the Senate. (PAKISTAN-ISLAMIC LAW)

South Korean leader calls for settlement with former sex slaves

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ South Korean President Kim Dae-jung called Friday
for a settlement between Japan and women forced to work as
prostitutes in Japanese military brothels during World War II.
	   The statement came as Kim wound up a trip to Tokyo aimed at
promoting a revival in ties between the two countries. Later in the
day, he went to the western city of Osaka to meet with ethnic
Koreans.
	   During Kim's visit, Japanese and South Korean officials have
stressed efforts to put to rest the animosity stemming from Tokyo's
harsh 1910-1945 colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula.
	   At a tea party at the State Guest House, Kim said settling the
accounts of the 20th century would include addressing the demands
for compensation by the so-called ``comfort women'' of World War
II.
	   ``It must be settled, for the sake of human rights and justice,
in such a manner as to be accepted by the international
community,'' Kim told about 100 dignitaries.
	   An estimated 200,000 women from Korea and other Asian nations
were forced by the Japanese army to work in wartime brothels.
	   Survivors are demanding official compensation and an apology
from the Japanese government, but Tokyo has refused direct payment,
saying the issue has already been settled through peace treaties.
	   A government-backed private fund has raised money to give to the
women, but many still say they want official, direct compensation.
	   Kim did not say whether Tokyo should pay the women or not.
	   On Friday, the Tokyo District Court rejected claims from 46
Filipino women for 20 million yen (dlrs 169,000) each in
compensation. The presiding judge said the international law under
which the plaintiffs sought damages did not permit compensation
demands by individuals, Kyodo News agency said.
	   The South Korean president, who arrived Wednesday on his first
trip to Japan since taking office, was scheduled to return to Seoul
Saturday.
	   At a farewell meeting Friday with Emperor Akihito, Kim said he
hoped the emperor could visit South Korea before the two countries
stage the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament, Kyodo News reported.
	   Kim said Thursday that it was ``unnatural'' that a Japanese
emperor has not come to South Korea, considering the countries are
neighbors and have had diplomatic relations for 33 years.
	   Kim and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Thursday signed
a ``new partnership'' pact opening up new areas of cooperation
between the two countries, including the Asian financial crisis and
stability on the Korean Peninsula.
	   The agreement also included Japan's clearest apology yet for its
35-year colonial rule of South Korea. In a departure from earlier
Japanese statements of remorse _ which some South Koreans have
considered lacking in sincerity _ the wording of Thursday's apology
was negotiated between the two sides and printed in an official
document.
	   In a speech to Japan's Parliament later Thursday, Kim said South
Korea and Japan should not forget their 1,500-year history of
exchanges just because of Japan's decades-long aggression.
	   Economics also played a key role in the summit. Japan offered
Kim a dlrs 3 billion loan package to help Seoul overcome its severe
financial downturn. Seoul is struggling to restructure its economy
under a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International Monetary
Fund.

Paris region transport strike continues for a fourth day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with strike spreading to Paris Metro, some drivers
vote to go back to work. Trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A transport strike severely disrupted traffic on
Paris commuter lines for a fourth day and the walkout spread Friday
to the city Metro despite tough new measures to curb violence on
public transport.
	   On Thursday evening, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in an effort
to calm striking train drivers who want protection from juvenile
crime announced plans for tougher punishment for those who attack
public transport personnel as well as greater surveillance.
	   For the first time this week, the strike affected the Paris
Metro, where drivers on the No. 10 line walked out after a driver
was attacked Friday morning.
	   The strike also hit northern France, where train drivers in
Lille staged a surprise walkout Friday, tying up regional traffic
and service on the high-speed TGV.
	   In Paris, nearly all suburban traffic on both regular rail and
high speed commuter lines were virtually at a standstill Friday.
Traffic was backed up before dawn on highways leading to the city
as people left home early to try to get to work on time.
	   At the Maisons-Laffitte station west of Paris, commuters jumped
on any train headed toward the capital.
	   ``I don't know where this train is going _ as long as it gets to
Paris,'' said Alice Longeuil, a secretary.
	   Traffic jams stretched up to 20 kilometers (19 miles) outside
Paris.
	   The train authority, the SNCF, said there would be no trains
Friday at four Paris stations _ Est, Nord, Lyon and Montparnasse,
which serve most points of entry into the capital. Several other
suburban lines also were affected by the walkout to varying
degrees.
	   Drivers at several stations, including Montparnasse, later voted
to end the strike.
	   Trying to defuse the conflict, the Socialist prime minister said
said the penal code will be revised to deal more harshly with
violence toward transport workers. Aided by police officers,
inspectors who currently check tickets will be able to verify
identities of passengers.
	   He also said justice would be swift for suspected offenders.
	   There was some relief in the capital with bus services resuming
Thursday after a two-day walkout. The city's RATP transit system
deployed two more companies of CRS elite police on their bus lines,
prompting drivers to return to work.
	   The walkout was triggered by an attack Monday on the RER C line,
in which a worker was beaten with a spray can after he tried to
stop youths from vandalizing a station. The attacks, in which
drivers are jumped by gangs of youths, often happen in poor suburbs
with high unemployment.
	   Statistics show urban violence has risen by 400 percent in the
past six years.
	   About 9 million people in the Paris area use public transit
daily.

Dutch tourist charged in jet ski collision that killed woman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ A Dutch tourist was charged Friday with
inadvertently causing the death of a British woman in a jet ski
collision this week off the coast of Cyprus.
	   Alfred Theodorous Post, 31, from Bolsward, Netherlands, pleaded
innocent and was released on bail of 1,000 Cyprus pounds (dlrs
2,000). The court ordered him to surrender his passport and to
present himself to the police station of the tourist resort of Ayia
Napa once a day until his Oct. 21 trial.
	   British tourist Karen White, 32, of Bitterne, England, was
killed Tuesday when a jet ski driven by Post off Ayia Napa rammed
another jet ski on which she was riding with her husband.
	   Post was remanded in custody for three days during a first court
appearance on Wednesday. Police prosecutor Ioannis Kapnoulas stated
in court then that Post was driving under the influence of alcohol.
	   But during his court appearance Friday he was only charged with
driving dangerously and causing the woman's death inadvertently.
	   If found guilty he may be sentenced to up to two years
imprisonment or a fine of 2,000 Cyprus pounds (dlrs 4,000).

Rebels, government locked in standoff over eastern air base
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to capture a
strategic government-held air base were locked in a standoff Friday
with troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila.
	   After five days of shelling Kindu and its air base, 380
kilometers (235 miles) southwest of the rebel stronghold of Goma, a
rebel commander said his troops had made little progress.
	   ``Every time we approach Kindu, the enemy is shelling us,'' said
the commander, who refused to be identified. ``We've stopped at the
outskirts of town.''
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted soldiers in Congolese
army backed up by neighboring Rwanda and opposition politicians _
see Kindu as a major prize in their two-month revolt against
Kabila, whom they accuse of mismanagement, corruption and
warmongering among Congo's 400 tribes.
	   Kabila has turned Kindu, 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of
Kalima, into a launching pad for a counter-offensive against rebel
positions in eastern Congo. There are unconfirmed reports that
Chadian and Sudanese troops are involved in the defense of Kindu.
	   The rebel commander said his men controlled a bridge over the
Elila River, 35 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of Kindu.
	   But he said the airport, 4 kilometers (2 miles) from the town,
was still in government hands and was being used to bombard rebel
positions and receive reinforcements and supplies by air.
	   There were no figures on casualties, but the commander indicated
that they were heavy on both sides.
	   In the capital, Kinshasa, the Ministry of Defense said the
Congolese Armed Forces had fought off rebel attacks and launched a
counter-offensive in the direction of Kalima.
	   Rebel aircraft flew food and ammunition into the Kalima air
strip from Goma. Rebel commanders said their 2,000 fighters were
facing a force of 5,000 at Kindu.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda _ his erstwhile allies who
installed him in power in May 1997 after an earlier eight-month
rebellion _ of sponsoring the new rebellion.
	   Both countries say they have legitimite security interests in
eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border
area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
	   Tanks, aircraft and troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia are
supporting Kabila's side. The assistance was essential in routing
an early rebel offensive in the west that had reached the outskirts
of Kinshasa in mid-August.
	   The rebellion broke out Aug. 2.
	   Chad has sent at least 1,000 troops to Congo, the cost of which
has reportedly been underwritten by Libya. Sudan denies it is
involved in the Congo fighting.
	   African diplomats have failed to arrange a cease-fire, and
Kabila, backed by stronger neighbors who have their own interests
at heart, refuses to talk to the rebels.

FIFA, UEFA likely to have out-of-competition testing as of next
</HEADLINE>
year &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUGGE, Belgium (AP) _ The world's top players will likely be
subject to unannounced out-of-competition drug tests as of next
year as an increasingly heavy schedule increases the lure of
doping, soccer's medical chief said Friday.
	   Testing will have to toughened up since ``conditions are being
created that make it extremely tough to ensure optimal treatment
with just natural means,'' said Dr. Michel D'Hooghe, the head of
FIFA's and UEFA's medical committees.
	   The world's top players are facing up to 80 matches a year,
while the medical limit is about half that, said Dr. Lars Peterson,
a FIFA medical committee member. He said 35 games ``plus or minus
five games or so'' were a medical threshold.
	   At a sports medicine congress here, officials from the FIFA
world federation presented new data that showed that the steady
increase in games is pushing the injury rate ever higher.
	   ``I worry about the development in the game which imposes
ever-more physical strain on players. The result is ever more
cartilage injuries and an ever-bigger temptation to resort to
doping,'' D'Hooghe said in an interview with The Associated Press.
	   D'Hooghe proposed the out-of-competition testing after hearing
new reports on the use of sophisticated muscle-building anabolic
steroids that leave no trace in the body by the time the
competition starts.
	   He said his proposals had been well received by both FIFA and
the UEFA European federation and he expected testing to begin next
year after official approval. Peterson has already been involved in
such testing in his native Sweden.
	   ``It's very effective. It puts a lot of pressure on every player
to stay clean. Even in the off-season they are not safe,'' said
Peterson.
	   Now random testing is left to the initiative of the authorities
and the practice is rare. When players from the French World Cup
squad were submitted to an unannounced test by authorities early
this year, it created a storm of outrage. All tests proved
negative. The team was tested again last week.
	   The soccer doping scandals started over the summer when AS Roma
coach Zdemek Zeman suggested that doping was widespread in Italy's
Serie A. Judicial investigators have followed this up.
	   Zeman ``has pointed out something which is obviously not
right,'' said Dr. Jiri Dvorak, a FIFA medical committee member.
	   There are four separate inquiries into the use of
performance-enhancing substances in Italian League soccer, and
investigators have reportedly discovered that some tests were not
complete and results of others might have been hidden.
	   Illegal practices will only get worse if the current trend to
shoehorn ever more games into an already overcrowded calendar
continues, medical officials said.
	   UEFA is considering expanding its European competitions further
in an attempt to answer the challenge of a European Super League,
which also would add more matches to the calendar for the top
teams.
	   ``Medicine has to make way for commerce, TV rights and
marketing. They are much more important than medical arguments,''
scoffed D'Hooghe.

Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally mixed
Friday, with the key indexes soaring in Hong Kong and Seoul, but
tumbling in Tokyo to a 13-year low. The strengthening of Japan's
yen currency hurt share prices in Tokyo, while helping them
elsewhere. In late afternoon, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 117.20
yen, down 5.16 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its
late New York level of 119.05 yen overnight. In Hong Kong, the
blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 567.28 points, or 7.1 percent,
closing at 8,506.79. On Thursday, the index had gained 194.79
points. Elsewhere, shares prices closed higher in Indonesia,
Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines. They closed lower in
Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia and New Zealand. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Stock of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan plunged 42 percent to an all-time low of 7 yen (6 cents)
Friday, a day after its expected merger partner suggested the deal
was dead. Shareholders rushed to sell the stock after Sumitomo
Trust and Banking Co. president Atsushi Takahashi said Thursday
that the in-house group set up to plan the merger with LTCB would
begin looking into other possible tie-ups. Long-Term Credit Bank,
one of Japan's biggest lenders, has been rumored to be on the verge
of collapse since summer. The bank, like many others in Japan, is
struggling under the weight of failed real estate loans.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Friday
urged nations in financial turmoil to ``keep their nerve'' and hold
fast to prudent fiscal policies, while strengthening social safety
nets for the poor. Addressing a group of business leaders in Hong
Kong, Blair said the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and
other agencies must help strengthen social support systems, public
health and education in countries swept by a deepening financial
crisis. Blair arrived in former British colony Friday for a two-day
visit, the last stop on his China tour. (HONG KONG-BLAIR)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of Russia's parliament said Friday he
was concerned that the new government had not yet offered a plan
for dealing with an economic crisis that's nearly two months old.
``We are not hurrying the government, but we are a bit worried by
the delay in presenting the anti-crisis program,'' Gennady
Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as speaker of the lower house,
told Russian news agencies. Russia's long-standing economic
problems turned into a full-fledged crisis on Aug. 17 when the
government announced it would allow the ruble to devalue and
effectively defaulted on some foreign debt. Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov has been in office since Sept. 11, but says that his
Cabinet is still formulating an economic rescue plan. The
government has said it will be announced before Oct. 20.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A transport strike severely disrupted traffic on
Paris commuter lines for a fourth day Friday despite tough new
measures to curb violence on public transport. On Thursday evening,
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin announced proposals to curb violence
on public transport in an effort to calm striking train drivers who
want protection from juvenile crime. The strike spread Friday to
northern France, where train drivers in Lille staged a surprise
walkout, tying up regional traffic and service on the high-speed
TGV. (FRANCE-TRANSPORT STRIKES)
	   WILLIAMSBURG, Virginia (AP) _ Many of America's top corporate
executives are expressing confidence in the ability of American
businesses to cope as stellar economic growth and soaring stock
prices give way to tougher times. As the executives gathered for a
weekend meeting of The Business Council, they clearly recognized
the economic world had changed dramatically since their last
gathering in May. ``The solid economic growth we've enjoyed over
these past few years is giving way to a softer environment,'' said
Douglas A. Warner III, chairman of J.P. Morgan and Co. Though all
of the executives expect the economy to weaken, Warner's bank is
one of the few predicting a recession _ a reduction in economic
output lasting at least six months. (US-ECONOMY-BUSINESS LEADERS)

Snake believed to have bitten boy on board plane
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Ansett Airlines grounded one of its
planes to search for a snake after a 6-year-old boy was bitten by a
deadly taipan thought to be on board, the airline said Friday.
	   Ansett spokesman Peter Young said the Australian airline was
notified Sunday that the boy had been bitten and that his mother
believed it had been on board the plane during a cross-country
flight from Melbourne to Perth the previous day.
	   He said the A-320 Airbus was searched by seven experienced snake
catchers when it landed in Adelaide on the return flight, and was
searched again by sniffer dogs and fumigated on its return to
Melbourne.
	   ``We're absolutely satisfied that there is no snake on that
aircraft,'' Young said Friday.
	   Khyl Hardy was taken to a hospital early Sunday after his mother
Melissa noticed he was shaking. She said he had been vomiting
during the 4 1/2-hour flight to Perth, but she had put it down to
motion sickness.
	   When he was taken to the Joondalup Health Center, urine tests
and a swab confirmed he had been bitten by a taipan.
	   Hardy said she believed Khyl was bitten just prior to takeoff
when he bent down to pick up a lollipop he had dropped.
	   ``He bent down to pick it up. He said he'd hurt his leg, but I
just ignored it. I just thought he was being silly and told him to
get back on the seat,'' she said.
	   ``Within a few minutes he started throwing up.''
	   She said she noticed puncture marks in Khyl's left leg when
putting him to bed later that night, but she suspected it was a
spider bite.
	   The medical center's emergency services director, Dr. Garry
Wilkes, said Khyl was treated for dehydration, but that no
anti-venom was needed.
	   He said Khyl's good recovery indicated the snake was only small.
	   Young said technical staff had removed paneling inside the plane
to look for the snake, and that the air conditioning had been
switched between hot and cold to alternate the temperature in a bid
to flush the snake out.
	   He said it was possible a passenger had brought a snake aboard.
	   Hardy said she was not seeking any compensation from Ansett,
which had offered to take Khyl on a trip to the zoo.

China warns against use of force over Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China said Friday it was intensely worried by the
threat to use force against Yugoslavia and warned that military
action would only compound the crisis over Kosovo.
	   As NATO stood ready to authorize air strikes against Yugoslavia
for its military actions in the province, Chinese Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan called for a peaceful solution.
	   ``China holds that the Kosovo issue is the internal affair of
Yugoslavia, and the threat to use force by some countries has
aroused intensive worries,'' Tang told Yugoslavia's ambassador to
China, Slobodan Unkovic.
	   China always opposes the use or threat of force in international
relations, Tang said. He indicated that China also regards force as
unnecessary, saying major fighting in Kosovo has ended and ``the
situation at large has tended to ease.''
	   ``Any military action targeting Yugoslavia will violate the
United Nations Charter and other universally acknowledged
international regulations, and will do nothing but make the
situation more complicated,'' the official Xinhua News Agency
paraphrased Tang as saying.
	   He called for a peaceful, early solution to the crisis
``respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia, and ensuring the legitimate rights and interests of
various ethnic groups in the region,'' Xinhua reported.

Air Algerie strike enters fifth day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Only 30 percent of flights took off
Friday from airports in Algeria, where air traffic has been
disrupted since Monday by a strike by Air Algerie personnel.
	   Flights to Marseille and Paris from the Algerian capital left on
time and flights from Algiers to Oran, Constantine and Hassi
Messaoud took off but with delays.
	   Most of the rest of regularly scheduled flights were canceled.
	   The strike is expected to continue at least until Sunday when
Air Algerie personnel are to vote on whether to stop or continue
the walkout.
	   The workers are protesting a restructuring plan by the Algerian
national company.

Holbrooke back in Belgrade for talks with Milosevic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with NATO ambassadors pressuring Moscow,

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
returned for new talks with Slobodan Milosevic on Friday, giving
the Yugoslav president another warning to comply with international
demands on Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.
	   While top Western officials declined to call it Milosevic's last
chance to avoid attack, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
warned in dispatching Holbrooke back to Belgrade that ``time is all
but gone'' for a peaceful settlement.
	   Divisions remained among the 16 NATO allies on the use of force,
however. Germany and Italy, among others, are reluctant to proceed
without a stronger legal basis for action. Alliance ambassadors
also sought at a meeting in Brussels on Friday to pressure Russia
into dropping its opposition to airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke, who arrived from London where he met with officials
of the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans, said Friday that
movement toward authorizing the use of force by NATO continues ``in
a sustained and intense manner.''
	   ``The situation remains just as serious at it has been before,''
he said shortly before he was to meet with Milosevic for the fourth
time in five days.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and upwards of 300,000
driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb.
28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is
fighting for independence from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by KLA ``terrorists.''
	   The international demands Holbrooke was presenting to Milosevic
are an immediate end to hostilities, a withdrawal of forces and
heavy armaments to pre-March levels, allowing unhindered work by
humanitarian organizations, cooperation with the International War
Crimes Tribunal, facilitating refugees' return to their homes, and
the start of negotiations with ethnic Albanian leaders on possible
self-rule.
	   In addition, Holbrooke was expected to press for an
international monitoring force to be allowed to oversee compliance.
	   The KLA announced a unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo
starting Friday _ a move that will add to the pressure on Milosevic
to reciprocate. There were no immediate reports on new gunfire or
shelling.
	   Milosevic has refused to openly declare a cease-fire, even
though there has been no major fighting in Kosovo during the past
week and the KLA has been largely routed. He considers the Kosovo
rebels ``terrorists and bandits,'' and any cease-fire on his part
would legitimize them as a negotiating partner, one of his
associates said on condition of anonymity.
	   The Serbian and Yugoslav governments showed little sign that
they are prepared to bow to international pressure, apparently
gambling that Russian opposition to a NATO attack will persuade key
alliance members, including Germany and Italy, to block any action.
	   Dismissing any talk of a rift within NATO, Albright said she
thinks the alliance will agree on an activation order ``in the next
few days'' that would authorize an attack.
	   On Friday, officials in Brussels said the NATO ambassadors were
bound to meet into the weekend to discuss a common ``legal basis''
for airstrikes.
	   Milosevic's spokesman, Ivica Dacic, insisted Thursday that NATO
threats were a ``rapist act'' and that the government has met the
conditions laid down last month by the U.N. Security Council,
despite U.S. contentions that a majority of its troops and special
police remain.
	   Serbia's fiery vice premier, Vojislav Seselj, was more blunt.
	   ``NATO soldiers may possibly enter our country as combatants but
they will leave it in coffins,'' Seselj said Thursday. He warned
other countries in the region not to provide any help to NATO or
``they will also be considered our enemy and would have to face the
consequences.''
	   The allies are warning that they envision not just one strike
against Yugoslavia but a series of air attacks, gradually
intensifying.
	   ``We have made it perfectly plain that NATO's planning is not
for one rap over the knuckles,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook told the British Broadcasting Corp. on Friday.
	   ``NATO's planning is for, if necessary, successive, coordinated
attacks which would make sure that President Milosevic could not
continue to deploy the heavy military that he has in Kosovo,'' he
said.

Philippine government begins preliminary talks with Marcos family
</HEADLINE>
on Swiss accounts &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government has began
preliminary talks with the family of the late dictator Ferdinand
Marcos on the sharing of dlrs 540 million from his Swiss bank
accounts, an official said Friday.
	   ``We have to start somewhere,'' presidential Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora told reporters, without elaborating.
	   President Joseph Estrada has said he wants more than 30 percent
of the money to be paid to 9,539 Filipinos who won a class action
suit in Hawaii for human rights abuses during Marcos' strongman
rule.
	   Zamora has said the Estrada government favors an out-of-court
settlement with Marcos' widow, Imelda, since 12 years of litigation
have produced little in recovering the late dictator's alleged
ill-gotten wealth.
	   A former chief government lawyer, however, asked the Supreme
Court to declare Zamora in contempt because his talks with the
Marcoses allegedly violated an order by the court in March
prohibiting the government from entering into an agreement with
Marcos' heirs.
	   Former Solicitor General Francisco Chavez said Zamora's actions
were a ``blatant and haughty display of the arrogance of power and
insolence of office.''
	   Zamora said the contempt charges would not prosper ``since there
is no agreement'' yet.
	   ``I don't think you are violating anything if you're just
talking,'' he said. ``What's wrong with talking to the Marcoses?
After all, they are citizens of this country.''
	   Zamora said the ``starting point'' in the talks to share the
Marcos Swiss accounts should be an aborted 1993 agreement under
then President Fidel Ramos that was kept secret until it was
exposed two years later. The two sides agreed at the time that the
government would receive 75 percent of the money and the Marcoses
25 percent.
	   The Presidential Commission on Good Government, the agency in
charge of recovering the Marcos wealth, said it did not implement
the agreement because the Marcoses did not disclose all their
assets.
	   There was a public outcry when it was revealed that the aborted
agreement included a dismissal of all charges against the Marcoses
and immunity from future suits.
	   The Swiss deposits, which have been transferred to an escrow
account in a Manila bank, are being claimed by the government, Mrs.
Marcos and the human rights plaintiffs, who were awarded dlrs 2
billion in damages by the court in Hawaii, where Marcos was then
living in exile.
	   The Swiss Federal Supreme Court has ruled that the money can be
released to the Philippine government if Mrs. Marcos is convicted
of criminal wrongdoing in connection with the deposits and if the
human rights victims are compensated. An out-of-court settlement
with the Marcoses could also free the funds.

Arafat wraps up visit Russian visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who has called
on Russia to play a larger role in Middle East peacemaking, held
talks with parliament leaders on Friday, wrapping up a two-day
visit.
	   Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov, who was among those who
met with Arafat, said their talks were ``interesting and mutually
beneficial.''
	   ``We discussed all problems _ Russian and Mideast _ over a cup
of tea,'' Zyuganov said at a news conference.
	   Arafat met with President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov on Thursday and invited Russia to Middle East
peace talks in Washington next week as a co-sponsor of the Mideast
peace process.
	   Yeltsin said his government might be interested in participating
in the talks, scheduled to open outside Washington on Oct. 15. But
he said Russia first wants to know the views of Israel and the
United States on the plan.
	   Russia is officially a co-sponsor of the peace process launched
by a conference in Madrid, Spain, in 1991. But the United States
has played a far greater role.
	   Arafat arrived in Moscow following talks in the Gaza Strip on
Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that raised hopes that the
stalled peace process could move ahead.
	   Arafat was headed to Finland from Russia.

Zimbabwe bowlers take four wickets by lunch in India cricket test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe fast bowlers Heath Streak,
Henry Olonga and Mpumulelo Mbangwa combined to take four India
wickets Friday morning on the third day of their cricket Test,
bringing their team back into the reckoning with 280 to Zimbabwe's
221.
	   Beginning the day on 248-6 in reply to Zimbabwe's fragile first
total, India seemed likely to build a big first innings lead.
	   Rahul Dravid, on 104 overnight, looked in fine fettle and well
set to extend his century to a big personal score.
	   But partner Robin Singh, beginning on nine, was trapped lbw to
Olonga for 15. Ajit Agarkar and Javagal Srinath both underlined
once more the weakness of the India tail by falling victim to Heath
Streak, who suddenly found line and seam after an indifferent
period yesterday.
	   Dravid, suddenly left with last man Harbhajan Singh, decided to
lash out and was brilliantly caught in the covers by Neil Johnson
off Mbangwa.
	   Just two balls after the mid-morning drinks break India were all
out adding only 32 runs to their opening score. When they might
well have expected a first innings lead of well over 100, it turned
out to be 59.
	   Zimbabwe then felt the full blast of Javagal Srinath and Ajit
Agarkar through the final 11 overs of the morning. Wishart was
dropped by Mohamad Azharuddin at second slip before scoring and his
four boundary runs were gratefully accepted as the ball flew
between wicketkeeper Nayan Mongia and first slip. Both batsmen also
felt the wind of balls flying past their heads but at least they
kept their wickets intact to the lunch break, with Zimbabwe on
17-0.

French survivors tell tale of boat tragedy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead and CLARIFIES tourists were on a discount
vacation tour &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LLORET DE MAR, Spain (AP) _ Sadness and anger were the mood
Friday for survivors of a pleasure boat tragedy in which 20 French
tourists drowned in a lake in northeastern Spain.
	   ``I don't really know what is going to happen now and I don't
really care,'' said Jean Loulier staring at his breakfast at the
tour group's hotel in this seaside resort.
	   Loulier, 70, like many of the 141 vacationing retirees who opted
for a boat trip around the nearby tranquil Lake Banyoles, had felt
lucky when he won a nearly free vacation package.
	   ``Most was free, but the excursions we paid, like the one
yesterday,'' said the widowed former schoolteacher whose female
traveling companion, who he did not identify, was a non-swimmer and
drowned.
	   The electric-powered catamaran was pulling away from its mooring
for a half hour trip over the mountain-surrounded lake, 565
kilometers (350 miles) northeast of Madrid, when its stern began to
sink. It went down fast.
	   Officials said overloading appeared the most likely cause, as
141 tickets were sold for a boat only authorized to carry 80
passengers.
	   In the provincial capital of Girona, a judge was to hear
testimony from the directors of the La Carpa firm which owns the
catamaran, while police underwater divers resumed work to bring the
craft to shore.
	   The search also continued for two people authorities believe may
have gone on the doomed excursion but have yet to be accounted for.
	   ``Just greed, greed'' said one survivor who also raged about the
lack of consideration for the tourists in the wake of the tragedy.
	   ``I had to go to a public phone box to call my daughter,'' he
said before realizing he was talking to a reporter.
	   ``Journalist!'' he shouted, and began pushing this reporter out
of the hotel and ripping her notepad into shreds.
	   But some wanted to tell the story.
	   ``It was like the Titantic, the way it went down'' said Evelyn
Bengoechea, 52. She survived by grabbing a life preserver shaped
like a ring after her husband, who could swim, pushed her out of
the boat.
	   ``I want to thank the people who helped pull us out,'' she said.
	   Michel Evielle, 50, has been driving tourist buses for 17 years.
He was drinking coffee by the lakeside when the boat began to sink.
	   ``It went down in 30 seconds,'' he said, recalling how he helped
pull out the floundering passengers.
	   ``Some of those who could swim were carrying others who
couldn't, and then others would grab onto their backs.''
	   Meanwhile, French Tourism Minister Michelle Demessine visited
the 21 people remaining in hospital Friday and was to meet other
survivors at their hotel.
	   Two of the injured were said to be in serious condition, but the
remainder were expected to be allowed to travel back to France on
Friday.
	   Repatriation of the corpses was also set to begin later in the
day.

Police arrest two in poisoning deaths of five people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Police said Friday they have arrested two
people in China in connection with the cyanide poisoning deaths
earlier this year of three women and two girls in a Hong Kong
apartment.
	   A police statement said Hong Kong and mainland Chinese police
arrested a 46-year-old man and a 32-year-old woman in the central
Chinese province of Hubei last month.
	   It said investigations showed that the man was connected to the
murder of the five people in Hong Kong and the robbery of about 1.3
million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 167,000), while the woman was
involved in harboring the suspect.
	   The five victims were found dead in July in what was then
believed to be a suicide pact. Suicide notes saying they were
unhappy with their marriages and love affairs were found in the
apartment.
	   Police said two of the women had withdrawn a total of about 1
million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 128,205) from their banks
shortly before their deaths.
	   Press reports at the time said the deaths were related to a
religious cult, but police had discounted such reports. A pair of
black scissors tied to a wok with red strings was found hanging
from a window, a symbol used by superstitious Chinese to ward off
evil spirits.
	   The three women reportedly had an interest in fengshui, or
geomancy, because such paraphernalia as the wok and a special
mirror were found in the apartment.
	   The three women were identified as divorcee Tsui Shun-kam, 40,
owner of the apartment; businesswoman Lam Chun-lai, 49, and Choi
Sau-chun, 44. The two teen-agers, Lee Ying-fai, 17, and Lee
Ying-hei, 13, were the daughters of Tsui.

<TEXT>
	   Italy's second-longest lasting government since World War II had
a fighting chance after a faction of hard-line Communists earlier
in the week defied their leader and decided to back Prodi, despite
strong displeasure over the proposed 1999 budget.
	   To win a confidence vote, a government needs one more vote than
half of those voting. By tradition the president of the 630-member
Chamber does not vote. Three deputies were absent for health
reasons and one deputy, from the opposition Forza Italia party,
showed up too late to vote. This meant that Prodi needed 313 of the
625 who voted.
	   Prodi's coalition had depended throughout its two years and five
months in office on Communist Refoundation votes for a majority in
the lower Chamber of Deputies.
	   But on Sunday, Refoundation leader Fausto Bertinotti and his
loyalists decided to stop supporting the government.
	   Then the party's second in command, Armando Cossutta, led a
split of Refoundation followers, giving Prodi a shot at winning.
	   Cossutta's leader in the Chamber, Oliviero Diliberto, indicated
in final debate Friday morning that the choice was a difficult one
made for the overall good of the country. ``It's not enough to
protest, you have to build,'' he said.
	   Bertinotti, in his final declaration, declared that his
followers would stick to their defiance of the government.
	   To woo the Communists, Prodi pledged that his government would
work to make law Refoundation's pet project -- a 35-hour work week
-- and stood back Thursday from endorsing NATO air strikes in
Yugoslavia without specific backing from the U.N. Security Council,
as Cossutta has demanded.
	   As the confidence vote approached, Prodi had hoped to pick up
the extra votes he needed from former Christian Democrats.
	   The center-right opposition, led by media mogul Silvio
Berlusconi, said a Prodi win would not spare the government more
crises.
	   Winning the confidence vote would ``only put off the dramatic
question of Kosovo,'' said Rocco Buttiglione, a centrist.
	   Parliament would have to approve any involvement by Italy in
NATO military intervention.
	   In the past, the opposition came to Prodi's rescue when
Communists opposed sending troops into Albanian as well as NATO's
eastward expansion.

Indonesia asks IMF, World Bank about possible capital controls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia is discussing ways of better
monitoring the flow of capital with the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, an official said Friday.
	   The government doesn't plan to implement capital controls now,
but getting exporters to repatriate their foreign exchange earnings
is one option it is considering, said senior economics minister
Ginandjar Kartasasmita.
	   ``In principle, the free foreign exchange regime is the most
appropriate one for Indonesia,'' Ginandjar told reporters, but the
government is looking for ways to improve ``monitoring and
reporting of foreign exchange.''
	   Ginandjar said Indonesia's finance minister and its central
banker began to discuss this issue with IMF and World Bank
officials this week during their annual meeting in Washington.
	   Seeking badly needed foreign exchange, and help in stabilizing
the rupiah currency, several government officials said earlier this
week that the government is studying a plan that would force
exporters to repatriate their hard currency.
	   Many exporters and analysts say bringing back hard currency from
overseas would theoretically help the economy, but that it would
have little effect unless the repatriation is compulsory.
	   Enforcing that rule in a country like Indonesia _ with a weak
and corruption-prone bureaucracy _ could be nearly impossible.
	   Many market traders continue to bet that the government may go
so far as closing its capital account and pegging the rupiah to the
dollar, speculation that has helped the rupiah soar this week.
	   On Friday afternoon, it was quoted at 9,100 to the dollar,
slightly weaker than 9,000 late Thursday, but much higher than the
10,800 per dollar rate early this month.

Netanyahu to name Sharon as foreign minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with radio saying Netanyahu to make announcement on
Sharon's appointment as foreign minister later Friday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel radio said Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu was to announce later Friday that he is naming Cabinet
hawk Ariel Sharon as Israel's new foreign minister.
	   Sharon met with Netanyahu on Friday morning, and after the
meeting, the prime minister convened a news conference.
	   The radio said Sharon was to begin serving as foreign minister
starting next week, and that he would keep his current portfolio,
minister for national infrastructure.
	   A official close to Sharon said the decision to appoint him as
foreign minister is in the hands of the prime minister, but that it
is expected to be soon.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sharon
would accept the position only if he will be in charge of
negotiations with the Palestinians for a permanent peace treaty.
	   Sharon is a member of Netanyahu's ``kitchen cabinet,'' with
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordecai and Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky. That body is supposed to make key decisions about
negotiations with the Palestinians. He has consistently opposed
compromise in the talks.
	   Sharon, an ex-general in the Israeli army and a recognized war
hero, was removed from office as defense minister in 1983 by an
Israeli tribunal looking into the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
He was found indirectly responsible for a massacre of Lebanese
civilians by Christian Lebanese militiamen in two Beirut refugee
camps under Israeli control.
	   He remained a key figure in Israeli politics because of his
grass-roots support among hardliners here. His appointment as
foreign minister, which would complete his political
rehabilitation, might shore up Netanyahu's support among Israeli
hawks as he moves toward an agreement with the Palestinians.

Taiwan passes bill to shrink provincial government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The legislature voted Friday to virtually
abolish the Taiwan provincial government while maintaining it in
name to avoid angering China and other critics who see the move as
a step toward the island's independence.
	   The provisions were passed 81 to 15 to complete the shrinking of
the provincial government in two years. Under&AMP; &Cx14; uding into history, we may see a
Republic of Taiwan taking its place,'' warned Feng Ting-kuo, a
lawmaker of the minority New Party, which strongly advocates
reunification with China.
	   After the Nationalists were driven from mainland China by Mao
Tse-tung's Communists in 1949, they settled in Taiwan and retained
the provincial government as a symbol that the island was still a
province of China _ of which they claimed to be the sole legitimate
government.
	   But that claim to govern China has since been dropped, and the
provincial government has been criticized as an unnecessary layer
of bureaucracy whose functions widely overlap those of the central
government.
	   Taiwan began democratic reforms a decade ago and gave up its
mission to recover China. Beijing continues to claim the island as
a breakaway province and threatens to invade it if it declares
independence.
	   Under the bill, the provincial assembly will be replaced by a
21-member advisory body appointed by the premier.
	   Of the provincial government's more than 10,000 employees, those
who choose to retire will be given an additional one year's pay in
addition to their pensions. The rest will be reassigned to other
government offices.
	   The central government will take over the provincial
government's debts and massive assets, including banks, an alcohol
and tobacco monopoly, various land holdings and a controlling stake
in a television station.
	   In an address to the provincial assembly, Governor Soong warned
that the abrupt changes without adequate transitional measures
could lead to turmoil.
	   Soong, one of the most powerful figures in the Nationalist
Party, has attacked the downsizing as a plot to destroy his power
base and ruin his political career. Soong has been at odds with
President Lee Teng-hui since the decision to downsize was reached
in late 1996.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
returned Friday for new talks with Slobodan Milosevic, giving the
Yugoslav president another warning to comply with international
demands on Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.
	   While top Western officials declined to call it Milosevic's last
chance to avoid attack, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
warned in dispatching Holbrooke back to Belgrade that ``time is all
but gone'' for a peaceful settlement.
	   Divisions remained among the 16 NATO allies on the use of force,
however. Germany and Italy, among others, are reluctant to proceed
without a stronger legal basis for action. Alliance ambassadors
also sought at a meeting in Brussels on Friday to pressure Russia
into dropping its opposition to airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke, who arrived from London where he met with officials
of the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans, said Friday that
movement toward authorizing the use of force by NATO continues ``in
a sustained and intense manner.''
	   ``The situation remains just as serious at it has been before,''
he said shortly before he was to meet with Milosevic for the fourth
time in five days.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and upwards of 300,000
driven from their homes since Feb. 28 when Milosevic launched a
crackdown against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting for independence from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by KLA ``terrorists.''
	   The international demands Holbrooke was presenting to Milosevic
are an immediate end to hostilities, a withdrawal of forces and
heavy armaments to pre-March levels, allowing unhindered work by
humanitarian organizations, cooperation with the International War
Crimes Tribunal, facilitating refugees' return to their homes, and
the start of negotiations with ethnic Albanian leaders on possible
self-rule.
	   In addition, Holbrooke was expected to press for an
international monitoring force to be allowed to oversee compliance.
	   The KLA announced a unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo
starting Friday _ a move that will add to the pressure on Milosevic
to reciprocate. There were no immediate reports on new gunfire or
shelling.
	   Milosevic has refused to openly declare a cease-fire, even
though there has been no major fighting in Kosovo during the past
week and the KLA has been largely routed. He considers the Kosovo
rebels ``terrorists and bandits,'' and any cease-fire on his part
would legitimize them as a negotiating partner, one of his
associates said on condition of anonymity.
	   The Serbian and Yugoslav governments showed little sign that
they are prepared to bow to international pressure, apparently
gambling that Russian opposition to a NATO attack will persuade key
alliance members, including Germany and Italy, to block any action.
	   Dismissing any talk of a rift within NATO, Albright said she
thinks the alliance will agree on an activation order ``in the next
few days'' that would authorize an attack.
	   On Friday, officials in Brussels said the NATO ambassadors were
bound to meet into the weekend to discuss a common ``legal basis''
for airstrikes.
	   Milosevic's spokesman, Ivica Dacic, insisted Thursday that NATO
threats were a ``rapist act'' and that the government has met the
conditions laid down last month by the U.N. Security Council,
despite U.S. contentions that a majority of its troops and special
police remain.
	   Serbia's fiery vice premier, Vojislav Seselj, was more blunt.
	   ``NATO soldiers may possibly enter our country as combatants but
they will leave it in coffins,'' Seselj said Thursday. He warned
other countries in the region not to provide any help to NATO or
``they will also be considered our enemy and would have to face the
consequences.''
	   The allies are warning that they envision not just one strike
against Yugoslavia but a series of air attacks, gradually
intensifying.
	   ``We have made it perfectly plain that NATO's planning is not
for one rap over the knuckles,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook told the British Broadcasting Corp. on Friday.
	   ``NATO's planning is for, if necessary, successive, coordinated
attacks which would make sure that President Milosevic could not
continue to deploy the heavy military that he has in Kosovo,'' he
said.

Disputes reported in duties for Germany's new foreign minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's newly elected Social Democrats
denied reports Friday that they wanted to trim the responsibilities
of the Foreign Ministry before handing it over to their likely
coalition partner, the Greens.
	   Party spokesman Michael Donnermeyer said reports that the
Finance Ministry _ expected to be headed by Social Democratic party
chairman Oskar Lafontaine _ might take over responsibility for
European affairs were ``completely fictitious.''
	   The new center-left government is expected to name Joschka
Fischer, a Greens party leader, as foreign minister. Reports this
week that he might assume a ``castrated'' office prompted an angry
response from Greens party members.
	   On Friday, newspapers reported that Fischer had received
assurances from both Lafontaine and Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder that he would take over an intact foreign ministry.
	   Social Democrats said Lafontaine might have been misunderstood
when he told German television the incoming government wanted to
give the Finance Ministry similar powers as in other European Union
countries.
	   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Lafontaine
could end up assuming some responsibilities for European and global
economic policy from the Economics Ministry, expected to be headed
by Jost Stollmann, a non-partisan computer entrepreneur.
	   Fischer was accompanying Schroeder Friday on a visit to
Washington. Party leaders have declined to comment on Cabinet
questions until after coalition talks are wrapped up next week.

Hong Kong enters semifinals of ACC trophy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Hong Kong entered the semifinals of the
Asian Cricket Council tournament Friday, defeating host Nepal by
six wickets.
	   Hong Kong will face Malaysia and favorites Bangladesh play
against the United Arab Emirates in the semifinals over the
weekend. The final is scheduled for Tuesday.
	   Batting first, Nepal struggled and was bowled out for 150 in 38
overs. Hong Kong's Mohammed Zubair captured four Nepalese wickets.
	   Hong Kong batted with aplomb and raced to victory in mere 28.1
overs, losing only four wickets. Rahul Sharma was top scorer with
41 runs off 45 balls.
	   A match for minor placings was called off after Papua New Guinea
decided to fly back home leaving the Maldives as winner.

Three ordered jailed for bilking clients with bogus bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISTOL, England (AP) _ Three men were sentenced Friday to a
total of 17 years in prison after being convicted of setting up a
fake bank in a resort town and defrauding would-be customers out of
nearly 7 million pounds (dlrs 11.9 million).
	   The fraud contributed to the collapse of firms in Europe and
Canada, with losses totaling in the millions, prosecutors said.
Some victims were financially ruined.
	   Gerhard Martens, 40, orginally from Germany, was ordered jailed
for a total of eight years after being convicted of masterminding
the scheme.
	   Fellow German Peter Tuegel, 52, was sentenced to five years and
Italian Sebastiano Saia, 50, to four years, for their convictions
on conspiracy charges.
	   In sentencing the men, Justice Gordon Langley said Martens and
Tuegel had shown ``arrogance and contempt'' for the bank's victims,
who numbered more than 100 and were based largely in Europe.
	   Prosecutors said the two Germans rented a former TSB Bank branch
in nearby Torquay as a front, named the bogus operation Bank Europe
and charged their victims advance fees for loans that were never
provided.
	   Saia was accused of posing as a commodities broker and assisting
with the scam.
	   The operation, which lasted more than two years until the men's
arrests in September 1995, had no legitimate financing, although
there was a real bank account in New York containing 183 pounds
(dlrs 310), prosecutors said.
	   Deportation proceedings have begun against all three men, and
Italian authorities say Saia still has more than five years on
outstanding prison sentences to be served in Italy.
	   The judged warned the trio they could face increases in their
sentences if he entered default orders over the confiscation of
their assets.
	   Marten had changed his plea within days of the start of the
five-month trial, admitting two conspiracy charges and one of
obtaining dlrs 40,000 by deception.
	   Tuegel and Saia were convicted in July.

Israeli woman killed; clashes in Hebron
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with funeral march; Israeli woman stabbed
to death. &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Thousands of Palestinians, some
brandishing automatic weapons and chanting ``revenge,'' marched
Friday in the funeral procession of a 20-year-old man killed in
clashes with Israeli troops.
	   In the West Bank's Jordan Valley, an Israeli woman was stabbed
to death by a Palestinian man outside the Jewish settlement of
Tomer. Israeli troops shot and wounded the assailant.
	   The violence overshadowed preparations by Israel and the
Palestinians for next week's Mideast summit in Washington under the
auspices of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   In Hebron, funeral services for 20-year-old Amjad Natche were
held in a small mosque overflowing with thousands of mourners. Many
laid their prayer rugs in the dust outside the mosque as Koranic
verses played over loudspeakers.
	   After noon prayers, Natche's body was carried for several miles
(kilometers) on a wooden pellet toward the cemetery. As the
procession wound through hilly streets, mourners chanted ``Allahu
Akbar,'' or ``God is Great,'' and three brandished automatic
weapons.
	   One masked man, a follower of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
Fatah group who carried a mini-Uzi submachine gun, said he was
sending a warning to Israel that Palestinians were armed and ready
to rise up if Israel continued its hard-line policies.
	   Several mourners, activists in the Islamic militant group Hamas,
chanted ``revenge, revenge.''
	   Natche, who belongs to one of the largest clans in Hebron, was
killed Thursday in stone-throwing clashes with Israeli soldiers.
	   Confrontations resumed Friday when several dozen Palestinians,
some masked and twirling slingshots, threw stones and empty bottles
at troops who fired a few rounds of rubber-coated steel pellets.
One Palestinian was injured.
	   In a leaflet, Fatah had called for ``a day of confrontations
with the occupier.''
	   Tensions in the city of 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish
settlers have been running high since Sept. 30 when an assailant,
apparently a Palestinian, threw two hand grenades at Israeli
soldiers guarding Jewish enclaves in the downtown area. Two dozen
people, including 11 Israeli soldiers, were injured.
	   In response, Israel sealed off Hebron, barring Palestinians from
entering and leaving the city. Israeli troops also clamped a
closure on the Israeli-controlled downtown area, confining 30,000
Palestinians living there to their homes.
	   The closure of the city was lifted Thursday, but the curfew
remained in effect Friday.
	   Palestinians have also be angered by the laying of a cornerstone
this week in Tel Romeida, a tiny Jewish enclave of seven mobile
homes wedged into a Palestinian neighborhood. The ceremony was
attended by Israeli Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom.
	   In response to the killing of a Tel Romeida resident last month,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to replace the trailers
with permanent building. The Fatah leaflet cited the Tel Romeida
construction plans as one of the reasons for renewed clashes.

British Cabinet minister says Clinton not fit to lead United

 &UR; Eds: ADDS new last graf with Blair reaction &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A member of Britain's Cabinet has broken ranks
with Prime Minister Tony Blair, saying Bill Clinton is not fit to
lead the United States for telling ``lies.''
	   Clare Short, the international development secretary known for
her outspoken views, said on a British Broadcasting Corp. TV
program Thursday night that Clinton should leave the presidency
because of the scandal surrounding his affair with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``If he had been a British prime minister, he would have gone,''
Ms. Short said. ``I'm glad to say that about our system.''
	   ``He is weakened and it's very unfortunate to have a weakened
president of the United States at a time when the world economy is
in the condition it is in,'' she said. ``I think a politician that
has done that much, told that many lies, isn't really fit to be a
leader. But the American people appear to take another view.''
	   Blair has been one of Clinton's staunchest supporters, phoning
him within hours of the publication of special prosecutor Kenneth
Starr's report on the Lewkinsky affair to offer his ``friendship
and support.''
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook moved Friday to distance the Blair
government from Ms. Short's remarks, noting she had merely been
expressing her personal views.
	   He characterized the close partnership between the United States
and Britain as ``alive and well.''
	   Blair, on an official visit to Hong Kong, brushed aside
questions about Ms. Short's remarks, saying only, ``I think I have
made my position very, very clear in relation to this issue for a
long period of time.''

Yeltsin heads to Central Asia for economic talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, who has made few foreign
trips in recent months, heads to Central Asia this weekend in hopes
of increasing cooperation with two former Soviet republics,
officials said Friday.
	   Yeltsin plans to sign a package of economic agreements during
his visits to Uzbekistan and Kazakstan on Sunday through Tuesday.
	   Despite Russia's economic crisis, Yeltsin has maintained a
low-profile since the summer and has spent much of his time at a
country residence outside Moscow. His last foreign trip was to
Britain in May, when he attended summit of the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations.
	   Yeltsin plans to meet Uzbek President Islam Karimov on Sunday
and sign agreements aimed at boosting bilateral trade, cooperation
in the oil industry, and expanding economic ties, Uzbek officials
said.
	   ``The work in all these directions is going on,'' Yeltsin said
in an interview Friday with Russian news agencies. ``But,'' he
added, ``we need to work in a more coordinated way,''
	   Yeltsin on Monday goes to Kazakstan, where he and Kazak
President Nursultan Nazarbayev are expected to sign agreements on
economic, science and technical cooperation and on combating drug
trafficking.
	   The two are also expected to discuss Russia's offer to build a
nuclear power plant in Kazakstan, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news
agencies reported.
	   Under the proposed dlrs 2 billion project, the plant would be
built near Lake Balkhash in southern Kazakstan.
	   Yeltsin and Nazarbayev are also expected to discuss the division
of oil-rich Caspian Sea floor _ an issue that has divided the five
Caspian nations for years.
	   The two presidents signed an agreement this summer to divide the
northern part of the Caspian seabed into separate Russian and Kazak
sectors. The deal recognized Kazakstan's claim to the oil near its
coast and set a precedent for future agreements.
	   Yeltsin praised the agreement Monday, and called for work on
additional agreements.
	   The three nations with oil near their coastlines _ Kazakstan,
Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan _ want the Caspian divided into
national sectors so they can claim the oil for themselves.
	   Russia and Iran, two nations with little or no oil near their
Caspian coasts, have wanted the sea's resources shared by all. But
Russia has been softening its stance recently.

Takamura leads in Takara World Invitational
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANBU, Japan (AP) _ Hiromi Takamura shot an even-par 72 Friday,
taking a one-stroke lead after two rounds in the 80 million yen
(dlrs 650,000) Takara World Invitational.
	   On a day when no golfer beat par, Takamura shot three birdies
and three bogeys. Her total of even-par 144 put her one stroke
ahead of South Korean Ku Ok-hee.
	   ``I missed quite a few short putts,'' said Takamura, who is
seeking her eighth victory overall but last won in the 1994 Toyo
Suisan Ladies. ``Besides, the greens are so slick you can hardly
keep the ball on them unless you hit it really well.''
	   American Jane Geddes, Laura Davies of England and Sweden's
Liselotte Neumann all struggled Friday and were not among the 50
players who made the cut at 9-over 153.
	   Geddes shot a 75 for 155, Davies a 76 for 157 and Neumann a 77
for 157 on the 6,226-yard (5,666-meter), par-72 Caledonian Golf
Club course.
	   Ku, winner of the Chukyo TV-Bridgeston Ladies in May, shot a 74
for 145.
	   ``I was hitting relatively well but I missed many putts today,''
said Ku, in contention for her 15th title in Japan. ``I figure that
whoever putts better will have the better chance to win.''
	   Aki Takamura and Taiwan's Cheng Mei-chi were tied for third at
146.
	   Michiko Hattori, who is leading the earnings list this season,
shot a 75 and shared fifth at 147 with overnight leader Toshimi
Kimura and Junko Yasui.
	   The four-round event offers a top prize of 14.4 million yen
(dlrs 117,000).

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke held
new talks with Slobodan Milosevic on Friday, giving the Yugoslav
president another warning to comply with international demands on
Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.
	   While top Western officials declined to call it Milosevic's last
chance to avoid attack, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
warned in dispatching Holbrooke back to Belgrade that ``time is all
but gone'' for a peaceful settlement.
	   Divisions remained among the 16 NATO allies on the use of force,
however. Germany and Italy, among others, are reluctant to proceed
without a stronger legal basis for action. Alliance ambassadors
also sought at a meeting in Brussels on Friday to pressure Russia
into dropping its opposition to airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke, who arrived from London where he met with officials
of the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans, said Friday that
movement toward authorizing the use of force by NATO continues ``in
a sustained and intense manner.''
	   ``The situation remains just as serious at it has been before,''
he said shortly before the start of his fourth meeting with
Milosevic in five days.

Medical group says NATO plans threaten aid operation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The aid agency Doctors Without Borders
on Friday warned that fears of Serb reprisal attacks would likely
force it to pull its medical teams from Kosovo if NATO launches air
strikes.
	   ``We would like to remain in Kosovo until the last minute but we
probably will pull all our people out if there are air strikes,''
said the agency's director of operations Victor Janssens.
	   He told a news conference that rather than air raids, foreign
countries should urgently deploy a ``huge, physical international
presence'' to protect Kovoso civilians.
	   Janssens said that in the short term at least, air strikes will
deprive civilians of the humanitarian support, because of worries
that Serb forces will target foreign aid workers in retaliation.
	   ``There is a large spectrum of options in between what we have
now and air strikes,'' he said.
	   He warned that tens of thousands of Kosovo civilians already
living in difficult conditions could die if they don't get shelter
for the winter.
	   ``Even if they escape the rest, nature will do its work,'' he
said.
	   Keith Ursel, a nurse returning after three months in Kosovo with
Doctors Without Borders said at least 200,000 people are displaced,
including 40,000-50,000 living rough in forests.
	   Ursel said one of the biggest problems he encountered is that
women are often forced to give birth on the move in precarious
conditions. ``These are women who are used to European medicine and
pre-natal care,'' he said.
	   Ursel cited reports of ethnic Albanian medical personal being
targeted by Serb forces, including a doctor named Lec Ukaj who, he
said, was tortured and killed by Serb troops on Sept. 25.
	   MSF has three mobile medical teams in Kosovo. Each team includes
three local doctors, three nurses and two drivers.

Yeltsin sends letter to Gadhafi on relations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin has sent a letter to
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi containing undisclosed proposals on
relations between the two countries, the Kremlin said Friday.
	   In the message, Yeltsin ``expressed a number of considerations
on the situation around Libya and prospects for bilateral
relations,'' the presidential press service said in a terse
statement released to the media.
	   The statement did not provide additional details.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed an air travel ban, an arms
embargo and diplomatic sanctions on Libya in 1992 for its refusal
to turn over two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet
over Lockerbie, Scotland. The attack killed 270 people.
	   The sanctions were tightened in 1994 to include a freeze on some
foreign assets and a ban on the sale of oil equipment.
	   Despite the sanctions, Russia and Libya have recently been
discussing a number of oil, gas, transport and communications
projects in a bid to restore their Soviet-era ties. Libya has an
outstanding debt to Russia of about dlrs 2.4 billion.
	   In the past, Yeltsin has called the U.N. sanctions unjust and
said he supports closer cooperation with the North African nation.

South African No. 2 leader appeals for AIDS action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos JOH 102, 103, 104
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Deputy President Thabo Mbeki,
in an unusual live broadcast, acknowledged on Friday that South
Africa had closed its eyes to AIDS and appealed for a nationwide
effort to fight the disease.
	   Otherwise, ``Our dreams as a people will be shattered,'' he
said.
	   Mbeki's speech was part of a major information campaign launched
Friday. Flags flew at half-staff to remember the 360,000 estimated
people who have died of the disease here. South Africans were urged
to stop and listen to the broadcast.
	   HIV infection rates have exploded in southern Africa after
ravaging other parts of the continent, and South Africa is one of
the hardest hit. The U.N. AIDS program estimates that nearly 13
percent of the adult population are HIV positive.
	   The government says 3 million people are believed to be
infected, with 1,500 new infections each day.
	   Infection rates among pregnant women in some areas reaches 30
percent.
	   The rapid spread is blamed on the legacy of apartheid, which
ignored the disease among the majority black population,
large-scale economic migration, ignorance about AIDS and the stigma
associated with it.
	   ``For too long we have closed our eyes as a nation, hoping the
truth was not so real,'' Mbeki said. ``For many years, we have
allowed (the AIDS virus) to spread, and at a rate in our country
which is one of the fastest in the world.''
	   Now, ``HIV-AIDS walks with us. It travels with us wherever we
go. ... We have experienced AIDS in the groans of wasted lives. We
have carried it in small and big coffins to many graveyards.''
	   Mbeki called on young people to abstain from sex, or at least
use a condom, and urged all South Africans to ``spread the message
of prevention.''
	   The speech was part of a new 80 million rand (dlrs 14 million)
campaign. All ministries and sectors of society -- business,
sports, entertainment -- are called on to come up with AIDS
education programs, condom distribution plans, fund-raising and the
like.
	   The approach is typical of the latest thinking in African
countries. Many opinion makers and AIDS activists say that all
parts of the government and society, not just health authorities,
need to respond with major prevention programs.
	   The best such example is Uganda, whose major public education
effort helped make it the only country in sub-Saharan Africa where
infection rates have dropped.
	   Mbeki delivered the speech at Ethembeni House, a Salvation Army
home in Johannesburg for abandoned children with HIV.
	   President Nelson Mandela was supposed to have delivered the
speech, but canceled his appointments for 10 days after suffering a
bout of exhaustion. Mbeki is widely expected to succeed Mandela
when elections are held next year.

Court to try former Surinamese rebel _ with or without him
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAARLEM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch court plans to try a former
Surinamese guerrilla leader on cocaine smuggling charges in
absentia if he doesn't show up, an official said Friday.
	   The trial of Ronnie Brunswijk, 36, has been scheduled for Dec.
10 despite fruitless attempts to extradite him and doubts that he
will come to the Netherlands on his own.
	   Brunswijk, a one-time bodyguard of former Suriname dictator Desi
Bouterse who later tried to overthrow him, faces multiple charges
of cocaine smuggling in 1996 and 1997, said spokeswoman Tina Zwiers
of the public prosecutor's office.
	   According to the Dutch daily De Telegraaf, one of the shipments
contained up to 53 kilograms (116 pounds) of cocaine.
	   Brunswijk, who allegedly enlisted carriers for the transports
from Suriname to the Netherlands, has denied all charges.
	   At the request of Dutch prosecutors, Interpol issued an arrest
warrant last summer for Brunswijk. But authorities have been unable
to secure him for trial because there is no extradition treaty
between the Netherlands and its former colony.
	   They can only hope for his voluntary surrender. Falling short of
that, the district court in the western Dutch city of Haarlem will
conduct the trial in absentia.
	   ``He knows when he needs to be here,'' Zwiers said.
	   Brunswijk led the Jungle Commandos, a group that waged a
guerrilla war against Bouterse in 1986 and 1987.
	   Bouterse, who ruled Suriname for seven years after leading a
military coup in 1980, has also been charged with drug trafficking
by Dutch prosecutors. He has not been turned over for trial.

Acclaimed Chinese director premieres new movie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Acclaimed Chinese director Chen Kaige's lavish
new movie differs in one crucial aspect from his last film: This
time, Chinese audiences should actually get to see it.
	   The director of ``Farewell My Concubine,'' which shared top
prize at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival, has frequently run into
trouble with China's government censors.
	   They banned his first movie, ``Yellow Earth,'' and his last
movie, ``Temptress Moon,'' and withheld approval from ``Farewell My
Concubine'' for a while, too.
	   But ``The First Emperor,'' Chen's moody new epic, has so far
avoided such problems. The movie premiered Thursday in Beijing's
Great Hall of the People, the cavernous parliament building where
Chinese leaders often receives foreign heads of state.
	   The movie chronicles the rise of Ying Zheng, a ruthless king who
first united China 2,200 years ago. One of the nation's most
important historical figures, he introduced centralized government
and oversaw the building of the Great Wall. He also was a tyrant
who called himself ``First Emperor'' and is said to have had
dissenting scholars buried alive.
	   ``On the one hand you must say that he was a great ruler _ he
made reunification of China possible. But on the other hand, you
know that he's a killer,'' said Chen, explaining his own mixed
feelings about his title character.
	   Chen said he chose the story for its power. Asked whether he
also hoped the censors would find it hard to fault a story based so
far back in time, Chen said: ``I had this kind of consideration.''
	   ``This film is about ancient history. There's not much in it to
ban,'' added Gong Li, the movie's leading actress.
	   Gong said she also believed the government's strict controls on
filmmaking have relaxed somewhat since Chen's 1996 ``Temptress
Moon,'' in which she also starred, was banned.
	   Chen said the censors never told him why they banned that film.
``Nobody explained to me. But I'm used to that,'' he said.
	   ``First Emperor,'' however, has already been approved and may
start showing in Chinese cinemas at the end of the year, he said.
The film will also be distributed in the United States by Sony and
in Europe by Canal Plus, possibly with a short introduction to make
its cast of characters and story more accessible to Western
audiences.
	   The two-hour, 47-minute movie cost more than dlrs 10 million,
with magnificent sets, impressive, if quirky, period costumes and
some thunderous battle scenes.
	   Nationhood, national pride and loyalty are among its themes, as
is the idea that power corrupts. But Chen declined to say whether
he intended for the movie to have any deeper political significance

Philippine stock index surges 4.1 percent as yen continues to rise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing higher against dollar &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rose sharply Friday
in their fourth straight day of gains as most regional markets
continued to respond positively to the rising Japanese yen, traders
said.
	   The yen also pulled the peso higher in heavy trading, but the
Philippine currency closed off its high for the session.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index jumped 50.95
points, or 4.1 percent, to 1,301.36, adding to Thursday's
37.66-point, or 3 percent, rise.
	   Since Tuesday, the index has gained a total of 134.82 points, or
12 percent.
	   Traders said the stronger yen eased pressure on other Asian
currencies that had been worsening the already dismal economic
outlook for the region and dragging down investor sentiment on
regional stock markets.
	   The dollar reached a low of 111.73 yen overnight in New York,
its lowest level in over a year.
	   ``The overnight yen gain was a great reprieve for Asian
financial markets,'' said Ian Kane, trader for Anscor-Hagedorn
Securities Inc.
	   Kane said the strong showing of the peso was long overdue, since
it had been outperformed by other Southeast Asian currencies such
as the Thai baht.
	   However, concern remained over the quality of third-quarter
corporate earnings, which are due toward the end of the month, Kane
said. The economic slowdown has put pressure on corporate earnings.
	   ``But such concern has more or less been discounted and this is
reflected in the stock prices,'' he said.
	   Gainers trounced decliners 73 to 22, while 34 issues were
unchanged.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 43.056 pesos for the
day, down from Thursday's 43.406 pesos. It was last traded at
43.250 pesos, its high for the day.
	   Traders said the dollar's weakness against the yen and most
other regional currencies compelled banks to sell dollars in early
trading to cut their losses on long dollar positions.
	   As the dollar fell to 42.890 pesos, however, banks and corporate
clients started buying the dollar anew, as this was considered an
extremely attractive rate.
	   A trader with a local bank said the yen's rise buoyed the peso,
but since there was no fundamental reason for the peso's strength,
it remained vulnerable.
	   The Philippine Central Bank wasn't active in the spot market. It
held its overnight borrowing and lending rates at 14 percent and 16
percent, respectively.

Queen Elizabeth II names two new trainers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England's Queen Elizabeth II has appointed two new
trainers for the royal race horses.
	   Royal horse racing manager Lord Carnarvon on Friday said Sir
Michael Stoute and Richard Hannon had agreed to handle some of the
Queen's horses.
	   Stoute and Hannon will replace Lord Huntington, who resigned as
a trainer earlier this week.
	   Stoute, a Newmarket-based trainer who was knighted in the June,
is a five-time British champion trainer.
	   The 52-year-old son of a former Barbadian police commissioner
has won every British Classic, except the St. Leger, and has
claimed international victories in the Dubai World Cup and two
Japan Cups.
	   Hannon, a two-time British trainers' championship winner, is
regarded as a prolific winner, particularly in races for
two-year-olds. He trained 182 winners in 1993 to claim the
championship.
	   The 53-year-old is based in Marlborough and has trained for Lord
Carnarvon in the past.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday
appointed Cabinet hawk Ariel Sharon as foreign minister and placed
him in charge of the negotiations with the Palestinians on a
permanent peace agreement.
	   Sharon is one of the staunchest opponents of compromise with the
Palestinians, and by letting him run the negotiations Netanyahu is
trying to silence hardliners who have threatened to topple the
government over an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   The appointment came just days before Netanyahu was to leave for
a Mideast summit in Washington where he and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat will try to conclude agreement on an Israeli pullback
from 13 percent of the West Bank. Sharon has said a 13 percent
withdrawal would endanger Israel's security.
	   Sharon will assume his new post on Tuesday and accompany
Netanyahu to the Washington summit. He will keep his current
portfolio as minister of national infrastructure for three months.
	   Netanyahu made the announcement in a news conference that was
convened after he met with Sharon on Friday morning.
	   ``Arik Sharon is the most suitable man ... for the post of
foreign minister,'' Netanyahu said. ``He has a thorough knowledge
of war and the damage it causes and of the fruits of peace.''
	   Sharon, an ex-general in the Israeli army and a recognized war
hero, was removed from office as defense minister in 1983 by an
Israeli tribunal looking into the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
He was found indirectly responsible for a massacre of Lebanese
civilians by Christian Lebanese militiamen in two Beirut refugee
camps under Israeli control.
	   He remained a key figure in Israeli politics because of his
grass-roots support among hardliners here. His appointment as
foreign minister completed his political rehabilitation.
	   Addressing Sharon's controversial past, Netanyahu said: ``We
shouldn't deal with bygones. He has a record throughout his public
life and during the past 15 years that people should be proud of.''
	   Sharon is already a member of Netanyahu's ``kitchen cabinet,''
with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordecai and Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky. That body is supposed to make key decisions about
negotiations with the Palestinians.

Italian premier loses confidence vote, will be forced to quit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: COMBINES previous; UPDATES with deputy from coalition
defecting; Berlusconi quote, INSERTS high president must decide
whether to call early elections. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left
coalition lost a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies Friday,
and he was expected to offer his resignation later in the day.
	   President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether to call
early elections or to ask Prodi or someone else to try to forge a
new majority.
	   The vote in the lower chamber of Parliament was 313 against the
confidence motion brought by the government to 312 in favor.
	   ``I'm not bitter,'' Prodi said immediately after his government
went down.
	   The swing vote came from Prodi's own coalition, a defecting
deputy from Foreign Minister Lamberto Prodi's tiny Italian Renewal
party, Italian state TV said.
	   The Communist Refoundation party, led by Fausto Bertinotti,
decided over the weekend to withdraw support for Prodi, saying the
proposed 1999 budget did not do enough to stimulate jobs,
particularly in Italy's lesser developed south, where the jobless
rate runs about double the national average of 12.5 percent.
	   Italy's second-longest lasting government since World War II had
a fighting chance after a faction of hard-line Communists earlier
in the week defied Bertinotti.
	   Prodi needed 313 votes, or half plus one of the 625 legislators
who voted.
	   Prodi's coalition had depended throughout its two years and five
months in office on Communist Refoundation votes for a majority in
the lower Chamber of Deputies.
	   Bertinotti's second in command, Armando Cossutta, led a split of
Refoundation followers, that initially appeared to Prodi a shot at
winning.
	   After Prodi lost the vote, Bertinotti declared that he would
back the government again if the proposed budget was scrapped, an
unlikely prospect in view of Italy's need to keep on with
deficit-cutting in line with the requirements of the European
Monetary Union. Bertinotti wants more funds spent on job creation.
	   To woo the Communists, Prodi pledged that his government would
work to make law Refoundation's pet project -- a 35-hour work week
-- and stood back Thursday from endorsing NATO air strikes in
Yugoslavia without specific backing from the U.N. Security Council,
as Cossutta has demanded.
	   ``Now we should go to the polls,'' said media mogul Silvio
Berlusconi, leader of the center-right opposition.
	   The opposition contended that even a win wouldn't have avoided
more crises for Prodi.
	   Winning the confidence vote would ``only put off the dramatic
question of Kosovo,'' said Rocco Buttiglione, a centrist in former
Premier Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance.
	   Parliament would have to approve any involvement by Italy in
NATO military intervention.
	   In the past, the opposition came to Prodi's rescue when
Communists opposed sending troops into Albanian as well as NATO's
eastward expansion.
	   Market watchers believe a new majority will be found to pass the
1999 budget, without the need for elections 2 1/2 years ahead of
schedule.
	   ``''Political instability will be limited in the next few days,
I think we can rule out elections,'' said Bruno Rovelli, an
economist with Citibank in Milan.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Cooking rice may be just a shade more
difficult then boiling water for many Asians, but for those who
have yet to master the art, a Thai company has come up with the
answer: ready-to-eat rice in cans.
	   The Thai-based Albatross company believes there is a market for
its product in places where people eat rice occasionally but don't
know how to cook it properly, says its managing director, Permphan
Neowsakul.
	   He said feedback has been very positive from test-marketing in
the United States. Some shipments already have been made to Europe
and the Middle East, as well.
	   The rice can be heated by placing the can in boiling water for
three minutes, or taking it out of the can and putting it in a
microwave oven. It comes in three varieties: brown, jasmine and
glutinous.
	   ``The idea behind the product is convenience, but each market
behaves differently,'' said Permphan, who came up with the idea
while living in the United States and eating American's
ready-to-eat rice products.
	   ``We are currently waiting for a canning establishment
certificate from the U.S. Department of Commerce, which would allow
the product to be distributed nationwide,'' he said.
	   So far, foreign investors, charity groups, United Nations aid
agencies and even the U.S. Navy's Pacific-based 7th Fleet have
expressed interest in ``Khun Perm'' brand canned rice, said
Permphan.
	   The company's factory has the capacity to produce 23,000 cans
per eight-hour shift, and the application of thermal-processing
technology gives each can a shelf life of two years, he said.
	   Thailand, the largest rice exporter in the world, exported 5.3
million tons of rice last year.

EU jobless rate holds steady at 10 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Unemployment in the European Union held
steady at 10 percent in August, unchanged from the previous month,
according to figures released Friday by the EU's statistics office.
	   The EU rate compares with 4.7 percent in the United States and
4.2 percent in Japan.
	   Eurostat's data showed 16.8 million citizens were out of work
across the 15-nation bloc.
	   Year-on-year figures showed a decline in the unemployment level
from 10.6 percent in August, 1997, and 10.9 in August, 1996.
	   The average jobless rate in the 11 countries adopting the euro
as their common currency on Jan. 1 was 11.1 percent, unchanged
since June.
	   Luxembourg had the lowest rate in the EU with 2.2 percent, Spain
the highest with 18.7 percent.
	   Eurostat gave the following seasonally-adjusted jobless rates
for August 1998 with August 1997 rates in brackets:
	   Luxembourg, 2.2 percent (2.6); Austria, 4.5 (4.4); Portugal, 6.2
(6.8); Sweden, 8.2 (9.6); Belgium, 8.9 (9.2); Ireland, 9 (10);
Germany, 9.6 (10.1); France, 11.9 (12.4); Finland, 11.5 (12.5);
Spain, 18.7 (20.7).
	   August 1998 figures were unavailable for Greece, Italy and the
Netherlands, Denmark and Britain.
	   Latest figures from Eurostat showed Denmark with 4.6 percent and
the Netherlands with 4.8 percent and Italy with 12.3 percent in
July; Britain with 6.2 percent in June. Eurostat gave no data for
Greece.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Thousands of Palestinians, some
shooting in the air from automatic weapons and chanting
``revenge,'' marched Friday in the funeral procession of a
20-year-old man killed a day before in clashes with Israeli troops
	   Fifteen Palestinians were injured in confrontations Friday
between stone throwers and Israeli soldiers who fired rubber
bullets.
	   In the West Bank's Jordan Valley, an Israeli woman was stabbed
to death by a Palestinian man outside the Jewish settlement of
Tomer. Israeli troops shot and wounded the assailant.
	   The violence overshadowed preparations by Israel and the
Palestinians for next week's Mideast summit in Washington under the
auspices of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   In Hebron, funeral services for 20-year-old Amjad Natche were
held in a small mosque overflowing with thousands of mourners. Many
laid their prayer rugs in the dust outside the mosque as Koranic
verses played over loudspeakers.
	   After noon prayers, Natche's body was carried for several miles
on a wooden pellet toward the cemetery. As the procession wound
through hilly streets, mourners chanted ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God
is Great,'' and three brandished automatic weapons.
	   One masked man, a follower of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
Fatah group who carried a mini-Uzi submachine gun, said he was
sending a warning to Israel that Palestinians were armed and ready
to rise up if Israel continued its hardline policies.
	   Several mourners, activists in the Islamic militant group Hamas,
chanted ``revenge, revenge.''
	   Natche, who belongs to one of the largest clans in Hebron, was
killed Thursday in stone-throwing clashes with Israeli soldiers.
	   Confrontations resumed Friday when several dozen Palestinians,
some masked and twirling slingshots, threw stones and emtpy bottles
at troops who fired a few rounds of rubber-coated steel pellets.
Fifteen Palestinians were injured.

APEC ministers open meeting on investment in new energy sources
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Vietnamese refinery project, grafs 8-10 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GINOWAN, Japan (AP) _ Energy ministers from countries along the
Pacific discussed Friday how to sustain investment in new energy
despite Asia's economic ills.
	   Officials said a major issue at the two-day Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation ministerial meeting on energy will be how to
prevent a decline in private investment in the power industry.
	   The 18 nations in Asia, the Pacific and North and South America
that make up APEC already consume more than half the world's
energy.
	   Ahead of the meeting, being held on the Japanese island of
Okinawa, business groups urged the ministers to guarantee recent
market-opening moves won't be reversed as Asian nations struggle
with rising unemployment and bankruptcies.
	   ``Ministers should ensure liberalization measures don't slow
down as a result of the (crisis in the) Asian economy, and some
prudence may be required in their implementation,'' said the Asia
Pacific Energy Research Center, an industry group.
	   The group said APEC should further eliminate barriers to
investment and competition as a way to encourage more money to flow
into new energy projects.
	   It warned that new power production will likely fail to keep up
with the Pacific region's growing appetite for energy. Consumption
will increase more than 40 percent by 2010 even with the recent
economic turmoil, it predicted.
	   Acknowledging that Vietnam badly needs foreign investment in the
power sector, Vu Van Thai, deputy director general at Vietnam's
APEC Energy Office, said his government must sort out the optimum
solution for domestic consumers. Vietnam's Ministry of Industry is
working to complete a new electricity code, including rules on
foreign investment, by the end of this year, he added.
	   Tran Ngoc Toan, vice president of the state-owned Vietnam Oil
and Gas Corp., also known as PetroVietnam, said some French and
U.S. companies are eyeing participation in Vietnam's dlrs 1.3
billion Dung Quat refinery project.
	   The Vietnamese company is expected to sign a contract soon with
Russia and welcomes other parties to join the project.
	   Previous APEC energy meetings have focused on how to build a
common regulatory framework that would allow energy and investment
to flow more freely between member countries.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Officials from Russia, Peru and Vietnam also attended as
observers.
	   At their first meeting two years ago, energy ministers agreed to
cut subsidies and price controls.

Striking airline pilots return to work in Norway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Striking airline pilots returned to work for
Norway's Braathens airline on Friday, less than two days after they
walked out in a conflict over the terms of their move to the
country's new airport.
	   The more than 300 pilots went on strike Wednesday, causing the
Norwegian airline to miss the next day's opening of the new
Gardermoen international airport, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of
Oslo.
	   The old airport, Fornebu, was on the outskirts of Oslo, and
pilots had insisted that the increased travel time to the new
airport be counted as part of their work day. That was important in
calculating their rest time between flights.
	   After all-night talks, the privately owned airline and the
pilots agreed that added travel time would be used in calculating
time off but would not be paid, Braathens said. The deal also eased
rules for pilots staying at airport hotels at company expense, and
gave more stable work schedules.
	   About 20,000 passengers a day were affected by the strike, which
grounded most of Braathens fleet. Airline spokesman Audun Tjomsland
said flight schedules would approach normal during the day Friday.

3,656 people died in China's floods, report says

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Significantly raising the toll from
summer flooding, a senior Chinese official has been quoted as
saying more than 3,656 people died, more than 20 percent higher
than the previously announced figure.
	   Niu Maosheng, vice director of China's flood control bureau,
issued the revised casualty count before 1,300 people attending a
meeting arranged by the Communist Party's Propaganda Department in
Beijing Thursday, the Shanghai-based Xinmin Evening News reported
in its Thursday editions.
	   Economic losses exceeded 248 billion yuan (dlrs 30 billion),
with more than 5.6 million houses destroyed and nearly 25.8 million
hectares (64 million acres) of land inundated, Niu was quoted as
saying.
	   More than a fifth of China's 230 million people were affected by
the flooding; the worst hit provinces were Jiangxi, Hunan and
Hubei, which lie along the Yangtze River in central China, and
Xinjiang in the northwest and Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia in
the northeast, the newspaper said.
	   The flooding, which lasted for more than two months in some
areas, was the worst in 44 years on the Yangtze River and in
decades in the northeast. But the government often appeared
reluctant to divulge damage assessments, prompting speculation that
the true number of casualties was much higher.
	   In the last official damage report, given six weeks ago after
the worst of the flooding was over, Vice Premier Wen Jiabao said
3,004 people had died, 5 million houses were destroyed and 21
million hectares (52 million acres) swamped for economic losses of
166.6 billion yuan (dlrs 20.2 billion).
	   The flooding was made worse by years of environmental neglect
and forced Chinese leaders to confront some of the costs of
breakneck economic development. The government banned logging in
the western half of Sichuan province starting Sept. 1 to stop soil
further soil erosion along the upper Yangtze and its tributaries.
	   Guangxi in the south has announced a regionwide ban on logging
as of Oct. 15, also because of widespread soil erosion, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported Friday.
	   The widespread flooding forced China to move 50,000 prisoners
out of harm's way, but not one escaped, Xinhua quoted Minister of
Justice Gao Changli as saying Friday.
	   ``This can be regarded as a miracle'' in the history of criminal
rehabilitation, Gao was quoted as saying.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday

	   The appointment came just days before Netanyahu was to leave for
a Mideast summit in Washington where he and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat will try to conclude agreement on an Israeli pullback
from 13 percent of the West Bank. Sharon has said a 13 percent
withdrawal would endanger Israel's security.
	   Sharon, an ex-general in the Israeli army and a recognized war
hero, was removed from office as defense minister in 1983 by an
Israeli tribunal looking into the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
He was found indirectly responsible for a massacre of Lebanese
civilians by Christian Lebanese militiamen in two Beirut refugee
camps under Israeli control.
	   He remained a key figure in Israeli politics because of his
grass-roots support among hard-liners here. His appointment as
foreign minister completed his political rehabilitation.
	   Netanyahu himself has been acting foreign minister since the
post was vacated in January by David Levy, a moderate who opposed
Netanyahu's hard-line negotiating strategy with the Palestinians.

Australia wins test against New Zealand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian forward Gorden Tallis
crossed for two tries Friday to lead the way in a 30-12 win over
New Zealand which leveled their three-test rugby league series.
	   The Brisbane Broncos star was voted the outstanding player in
the Australian Rugby League final two weeks ago and was in top form
again in a bruising match.
	   New Zealand won the first match 22-16 in April and will be
attempting to win a series against Australia for the first time in
45 years when the deciding game is played in Auckland next week.
	   Australia, featuring 11 new players from the squad which lost
game one, was put under plenty of pressure in the first half but
overcame it to lead 14-0 at the break. Brisbane fullback Darren
Lockyer scored a try and kicked four goals for 12 points.
	   New Zealand winger Sean Hoppe cut the margin after halftime when
he scored a stunning try with a 90-meter run to cut the margin to
14-6.
	   But when New Zealand-born Australian forward Brad Thorn charged
onto a short pass to crash over in the 54th minute and five-eighth
Kevin Walters crossed seven minutes later the test was as good as
over with Australia up 24-6.
	   New Zealand center Ruben Wiki reduced the margin to 24-10 with
12 minutes remaining before a rampaging Tallis finished off the
Kiwis in the 73rd minute to complete the scoring.
	   English referee Russell Smith, who will handle next Friday
night's series decider, delivered some controversial decisions.
Smith favored Australia 16-5 in the penalty count.
	   Scorers:
	   Australia 30 (Gorden Tallis 2, Darren Lockyer, Kevin Walters,
Brad Thorn tries; Darren Lockyer 4 goals; Andrew Johns goal) def.
New Zealand 12 (Sean Hoppe, Ruben Wiki tries, Matthew Ridge, Gene
Ngamu goals).

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke held
new talks with Slobodan Milosevic on Friday, giving the Yugoslav
president another warning to comply with international demands on
Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.
	   While top Western officials declined to call it Milosevic's last
chance to avoid attack, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
warned in dispatching Holbrooke back to Belgrade that ``time is all
but gone'' for a peaceful settlement.
	   Divisions remained among the 16 NATO allies on the use of force,
however. Germany and Italy, among others, are reluctant to proceed
without a stronger legal basis for action. Alliance ambassadors
also sought at a meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on Friday to
pressure Russia into dropping its opposition to airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke, who arrived from London where he met with officials
of the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans, said Friday that
movement toward authorizing the use of force by NATO continues ``in
a sustained and intense manner.''
	   ``The situation remains just as serious at it has been before,''
he said shortly before the start of his fourth meeting with
Milosevic in five days.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO allies and Russia jointly
urged Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the violence in
Kosovo, but Russia remained opposed to using force to end the
crisis in the Serbian province.
	   At a meeting of the NATO ambassadors with Sergei Kisliak, the
Russian envoy to the alliance, ``there remained a different
perception on the use of force,'' said a NATO official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said the allies and Russia agreed on ``the
importance that (U.S. special envoy Richard) Holbrooke has gone
back to Belgrade'' to continue his peace efforts. ``We need to give
Holbrooke some time now.''
	   Holbrooke held new talks with Milosevic Friday. The NATO
ambassadors were to meet again later Friday and, possibly, again on
Saturday and Sunday, to discuss a common ``legal basis'' for
airstrikes.
	   ``NATO and Russia expressed their full support for the ongoing
diplomatic efforts aimed at securing a political solution to the
crisis,'' The NATO ambassadors and their Russian colleague said in
a joint statement after a two-and-a-half hour meeting.
	   ``They reiterated their deep concern about the ongoing
humanitarian crisis in Kosovo and stressed the need to see
immediate, full and irreversible compliance with U.N. Security
Council resolutions.''
	   Russia held to the view NATO cannot force that compliance
through airstrikes without first getting a specific U.N. mandate.
	   The NATO official said Russia agreed with the allies that the
level of compliance by Milosevic with U.N. demands for an end to
the violence in Kosovo ``has not been enough (and) that compliance
requires a very credible verification.''
	   The NATO-Russia meeting came a day after Washington made another
bid to end the Kosovo violence peacefully though Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
airstrikes were near.
	   The allies were searching for an adequate legal basis for such
strikes other than a new United Nations Security Council
resolution. The latter will allow Russia to veto such strikes.
	   But divisions remained within NATO on that point, too. Italy
questions the assertions of NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
and Albright that no new U.N. resolution was necessary.
	   Italy's Premier Romano Prodi said Thursday any intervention must
``be legitimated'' by the council. ``We do not believe that the
chances of a political solution have been exhausted.''
	   And in Germany, the Greens party, which is about to enter the
national government, also sounded hesitant. ``We want to keep NATO
from giving itself a mandate,'' according to Greens defense expert
Angelika Beer said.
	   Greece and Spain have also shown hesitation but appeared to have
moved to the notion that no new U.N. decision was needed for an
allied military campaign.
	   Albright, Solana, special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark were here Thursday to
assess chances of a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis.
	   Albright also wanted to rally all allies for the cause. ``I
believe it is time for the allies to move to the next phase of
decision-making,'' she said.
	   NATO military officials have repeatedly said the alliance it is
ready to launch airstrikes as soon as it gets the green light.
	   Albright met in London Thursday with her counterparts from
Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia.

Netanyahu appoints Cabinet hawk Ariel Sharon as foreign minister

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 9th graf that Palestinians, sted Lebanese, killed

foreign minister,
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday
appointed Cabinet hawk Ariel Sharon as foreign minister and placed
him in charge of the negotiations with the Palestinians on a
permanent peace agreement.
	   Sharon is one of the staunchest opponents of compromise with the
Palestinians, and by letting him run the negotiations Netanyahu is
trying to silence hardliners who have threatened to topple the
government over an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Palestinian reaction was guarded. Palestinian negotiator Nabil
Shaath said the appointment was an internal Israeli matter. ``What
is important is the policy, not the personalities,'' he said.
	   The appointment came just days before Netanyahu was to leave for
a Mideast summit in Washington where he and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat will try to conclude agreement on an Israeli pullback
from 13 percent of the West Bank. Sharon has said a 13 percent
withdrawal would endanger Israel's security.
	   Sharon will assume his new post on Tuesday and accompany
Netanyahu to the Washington summit. He will keep his current
portfolio as minister of national infrastructure for three months.
	   The previous Israeli foreign minister, David Levy, resigned in
January over Netanyahu's social policies and the stalemate in
negotiations with the Palestinians. Netanyahu did not name a
replacement, but took over the portfolio himself.
	   Netanyahu announced Sharon's appointment in a news conference
Friday, after a meeting with Sharon.
	   ``Arik Sharon is the most suitable man ... for the post of
foreign minister,'' Netanyahu said. ``He has a thorough knowledge
of war and the damage it causes and of the fruits of peace.''
	   Sharon, an ex-general in the Israeli army and a recognized war
hero, was removed from office as defense minister in 1983 by an
Israeli tribunal looking into the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
	   He was found indirectly responsible for a massacre of
Palestinian civilians by Christian Lebanese militiamen in two
Beirut refugee camps under Israeli control.
	   He remained a key figure in Israeli politics because of his
grass-roots support among hardliners here. His appointment as
foreign minister completed his political rehabilitation.
	   Addressing Sharon's controversial past, Netanyahu said: ``We
shouldn't deal with bygones. He has a record throughout his public
life and during the past 15 years that people should be proud of.''
	   Sharon is already a member of Netanyahu's ``kitchen cabinet,''
with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordecai and Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky. That body is supposed to make key decisions about
negotiations with the Palestinians.

Russian imports fall 45 percent in September as crisis bites
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: RECASTS, UPDATES with additional background on Russian
imports, Primakov saying govt. hopes to restructure treasury bill
payments this month.
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The soaring cost of foreign goods caused Russian
imports to plummet 45 percent in September compared to a year
earlier as the country's recession continues to worsen, the
government announced Friday.
	   Russia depends heavily on imports for many essential goods,
including food and medicine. But imports are now two to three times
more expensive than before the crisis hit in August because the
Russian ruble has fallen from 6 to 16 against the U.S. dollar.
	   The country has not experienced any serious shortages, but the
government is planning to drop import duties on some basic foods
and medicines in a bid to limit the price increases.
	   In another development, the speaker of Russia's parliament said
he was concerned that the new government had not yet offered a plan
for dealing with an economic crisis that is nearly two months old.
	   ``We are not hurrying the government, but we are a bit worried
by the delay in presenting the anti-crisis program,'' Gennady
Seleznyov, a Communist who is as speaker of the State Duma lower
house, told Russian news agencies.
	   Russia's long-standing economic problems turned into a
full-fledged crisis Aug. 17 when the government announced it would
allow the ruble to devalue and placed a moratorium on repaying
foreign debt.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has been in office since Sept.
11, but his Cabinet is still formulating an economic rescue plan.
The government has said it will be announced before Oct. 20.
	   Primakov said Friday that the government hoped to work out a
restructuring plan by the end of the month to pay its outstanding
treasury bills. Russian and foreign investors hold treasury bills
that were worth billions of dollars before the crisis.
	   ``Everyone will be treated equally,'' said Primakov. No details
were announced, but Primakov expressed the hope that an agreement
would help restore confidence in investors who have abandoned
Russia.
	   Primakov made his comments after meeting with Jacques Santer,
the president of the European Union Commission. They discussed ways
the European Union could help Russia out of its economic morass.
	   Russia badly needs foreign aid to pay off a mountain of debts,
but international lenders have not been willing to provide money
until they know the contents of Russia's economic program.
	   The State Statistics Committee said that overall imports fell 45
percent in September compared to a year earlier, but in some
categories the decline was even more dramatic.
	   Pharmaceutical imports were down 71 percent, while milk and
sugar imports both fell more than 80 percent.
	   During Soviet times, the country's imports were limited. But
Russia was importing close to half of all its consumer goods until
the recent crisis hit.
	   Consumers are now looking for cheaper, Russian-made products,
but it's not clear whether the weak Russian economy will be able to
make up for the decline in imports.
	   Prices have gone up 50 percent this year, with almost all of the
increase coming in the past two months. Inflation could hit 200
percent by the end of the year, according to government forecasts.
	   There's a widespread belief that the government will have to
print additional money to pay off its debts, and that will further
fuel inflation.
	   Russia's money supply increased 2.1 percent in the past week to
reach 174.8 billion rubles (about dlrs 11 billion), the Central
Bank said Friday.

Slovenia advises its citizens to leave and stay out of Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Slovenia, a former Yugoslav republic,
called on its citizens Friday to leave Yugoslavia, the country that
may soon be targeted by NATO warplanes.
	   The Slovenian Foreign Ministry also recommended Slovenes not to
travel to Serbia and Montenegro, the two republics that make up
rump Yugoslavia.
	   Many countries, including the United States, issued similar
warnings earlier this week, following a deterioration in the Kosovo
crisis and stepped-up preparations of the alliance to launch
airstrikes if diplomatic efforts fail.
	   Slovenia declared independence from the former Yugoslav
federation in 1991. The small country of two million is a member of
NATO's Partnership for Peace program and is a frontrunner for NATO
membership.
	   Asked on Friday to comment on NATO plans, President Milan Kucan
only said that his country ``strongly supports'' the conclusions of
the Contact Group meeting held in London on Thursday.
	   Neighboring Croatia, which also seceded from Yugoslavia in 1991,
has not yet issued a similar warning to its citizens.
	   But the U.S. Embassy in Zagreb advised Americans earlier this
week to think twice before traveling to neighboring Yugoslavia or
Serb-held parts of Bosnia, known as Republika Srpska.
	   The embassy said its staff were taking precautions when
traveling to the regions that border Yugoslavia or Serb-controlled
Bosnia. The warning was issued following comments from Serb
officials in Yugoslavia and Bosnia, the statement said.

NATO Admiral: naval visit to Russia a ``good sign'' for relations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A NATO naval commander on Friday praised a visit
by seven alliance ships to St. Petersburg as a ``good sign'' in the
Russian-NATO relations, a news agency said.
	   The ships from the United States, Canada, Germany, Britain,
Spain, Denmark and the Netherlands arrived in Russia's
second-largest city on Thursday. They opened for three days of
public inspection Friday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The visit was ``a good sign in the relations between Russia and
NATO,'' NATO's Atlantic commander, German Rear Adm. Gottfried Hoch,
was quoted as saying.
	   Russia opposes NATO's eastward expansion, which will begin with
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, but has effectively
accepted the plan and signed a cooperation agreement with NATO. But
Moscow remains adamantly against the inclusion of former Soviet
republics in the alliance.

Russian military denies plan for nuclear test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with general saying some `experiments' are still being
carried out on Novaya Zemlya, context in new grafs 5-7. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian general denied allegations that Moscow
intends to carry out a nuclear test and insisted Friday that the
military keep nuclear weapons under safe control despite limited
funding.
	   ``There are no plans to resume nuclear tests at Novaya Zemlya
testing range'' in northern Russia, said Gen. Igor Volynkin, who
heads a defense ministry department overseeing nuclear weapons.
	   Western news reports and environmentalists claimed last month
that Russia was preparing a sub-critical nuclear test on the Arctic
archipelago of Novaya Zemlya. For such a test, the amount of
radioactive plutonium in a nuclear bomb is reduced to under a
critical threshold for an explosive nuclear chain reaction.
	   Since there is no explosion, such tests are not covered by the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). But critics warned that they
could encourage such countries to conduct full-scale nuclear tests.
	   While denying intention to resume nuclear tests, Volynkin said
that Russia continues to carry out ``various modeling experiments
and physical research'' that aren't qualified as nuclear tests
under the CTBT, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   He added that Russia might resume full-scale tests if ``any
single country opts out of the nuclear test ban (treaty).''
	   Moscow carried out its last nuclear test almost a decade ago
before the Soviet Union collapsed.
	   Volynkin bristled at media reports saying the cash-strapped
Russian military has been losing effective control over its nuclear
arsenal. He said the reports were designed to place ``Russian
nuclear weapons under international control.''
	   ``Russia is capable of maintaining its nuclear weapons and
ensuring their safety,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass and
Interfax news agencies.
	   Volynkin also said that Russia strictly adheres to international
obligations to destroy some kinds of tactical nuclear weapons,
including nuclear shells and landmines.
	   ``When there is an agreement with the United States on
destroying the remaining part of tactical weapons, Russia will
embark on their destruction,'' he said.

Nine impoverished Russians request political asylum in Norway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three Russian women with six children have
requested asylum in Norway, citing economic troubles in Russia,
news report said Friday.
	   Russia's economic crisis, which hit with full force in August,
has sent prices soaring and cost many people their jobs. With
increased travel between Russia and Norway, there are occasional
asylum request from Russians.
	   However, Norway does not accept economic refugees.
	   ``We know the situation is often difficult in Russia, but in
general the situation is such that it is not a basis for asylum or
a residence permit,'' Harald Rosendahl, an official in the
Foreigners Directorate, told the Norwegian news agency NTB.
	   The nine women and children from Russia's Urals region entered
Norway through the Arctic checkpoint of Storskog. They have been
taken to an immigration center in Trondheim for processing,
officials said.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Friday
his country's constructive partnership with China could only
benefit Hong Kong, but an opposition leader accused him of doing
too little for democracy.
	   Calling the capitalist territory's return to the communist
mainland 15 months ago a success, Blair defended the closer
relations he has engineered with China, saying Britain's trade and
investment dealings with the mainland must be allowed to thrive.
	   ``For Britain and China to be free to develop relations is in
the interest of Hong Kong,'' Blair told reporters.
	   But Martin Lee, leader of Hong Kong's major opposition
Democratic Party, accused Blair of shelving human rights and
democracy in favor of maintaining profitable trade and investment
links with the mainland.
	   ``This particular visit did not seem to produce the results we
expected,'' he said.
	   Lee noted that Hong Kong residents turned out in record numbers
in May to vote in the first legislative elections in Hong Kong
under Chinese rule. Pro-democracy candidates scored significant
victories.
	   ``It's a pity that despite the high voter turnout, no attempt
has been made to quicken pace of democracy'' in the former British
colony, Lee said.
	   Blair, however, defended China's hands-off policy toward Hong
Kong, saying China has kept its side of the bargain and honored its
commitments to Britain.
	   He added that human rights issues such as freedom and dissent
were raised in his meetings with Chinese leaders.
	   ``We recognize that for the long-term future and stability, it
is good we have a relationship that is strong (and) based on
principle,'' Blair said.
	   Blair also urged nations in financial turmoil to ``keep their
nerve'' and hold fast to prudent fiscal policies, while
strengthening social safety nets for the poor.
	   Addressing a group of business leaders earlier, Blair said the
International Monetary Fund, World Bank and other agencies must
help strengthen social support systems, public health and education
in countries swept by a deepening financial crisis.
	   ``People have lost their jobs, their homes, their savings
because of a crisis that certainly had nothing to do with any
failings on their part,'' he added.
	   ``We must show that globalization has more to offer the poor
than insecurity.''
	   Blair arrived in former British colony Friday for a two-day
visit, the last stop on his China tour. The visit is his first
since he attended ceremonies in July 1997 when Britain returned
Hong Kong to Chinese rule.
	   In his address, Blair reiterated that China and Britain have
entered a new era, with much of the suspicion and bitterness over
Hong Kong in the past 156 years behind them.
	   ``The chill of the period before the Hong Kong handover has been
replaced by a genuine warmth and recognition that Britain and China
can be partners in the modern world,'' he said.
	   Although he praised Hong Kong's resilience amid the financial
crisis, Blair noted that Hong Kong ``has not been able to isolate
itself'' from the loss of confidence in global markets.
	   ``This turmoil in world markets has dramatically underscored the
interdependence of today's world economy,'' Blair said.
	   Blair quietly endorsed the Hong Kong government's support for
maintaining the 15-year-old currency peg to the U.S. dollar, saying
it ``underpinned stability and confidence.''
	   In August, the Hong Kong government came under fire when it
spent an estimated U.S. dlrs 15 billion in a stock-buying spree to
support falling share prices and keep speculators at bay.
	   ``I understand their decision. They need to safeguard the
long-term financial stability and economic success for Hong Kong,''
Blair wrote in a letter to Hong Kong newspapers.

Greece orders Patriot missiles in boost for U.S. arms maker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece will buy the U.S.-made Patriot
missile defense system as part of a mammoth arms build up designed
to keep pace with rival Turkish forces, officials said Friday.
	   The estimated dlrs 1.2 billion contract _ the first major
decision since the five-year arms purchase plan was announced last
year _ was an important victory for the U.S. defense industry, the
main arms supplier for Greece.
	   Raytheon Corp., the makers of the Patriot system, was in close
competition with Russia's S-300 anti-aircraft missiles for the
Greek contract. Russia's defense minister, Marshal Igor Sergeyev,
visited Athens this week during a major defense industry trade
show.
	   Greece and Turkey have become increasingly important customers
for arms builders struggling with shrinking defense budgets in many
other countries. Raytheon announced Monday it will eliminate 14,000
jobs across the United States over the next two years.
	   Raytheon's aircraft division, Raytheon Aircraft Co., also
received a welcome boost from Greece: a dlrs 200 million contract
for 45 T-6A training aircraft.
	   Greek officials also announced plans to buy 33 Crotel
short-range anti-aircraft missiles by France's Thomson-CSF at a
total price tag of dlrs 685 million and 10 Canadair fire-fighting
aircraft for dlrs 440 million.
	   Greece is also in the market for new fighter jets, ships, tanks
and other weapons as part of an estimated dlrs 24 billion five-year
arms modernization program.
	   Greece claims it needs the new weapons because of a perceived
threat from neighboring NATO ally Turkey. The two countries have
nearly gone to war three times in the past 24 years.
	   Turkey is also shopping for new arms, budgeting dlrs 150 billion
over the next 25 years to upgrade its own military capabilities.
	   The Patriot missiles, primarily an anti-aircraft system, proved
largely ineffective at striking Iraqi missiles during the 1991 Gulf
War.
	   The Patriot batteries ordered by Greece should be in place by
2001, said Defense Minister Akis Tzochatzopoulos.
	   Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said the contract calls for
four Patriot batteries with the option for two more, which ``Greece
will use.'' He added that all contract prices will be negotiated.

Wasim and Haq's Test place in danger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's Muhammad Wasim and
Inzamamul Haq might be axed for the second Test after both batsmen
flopped while representing Rawalpindi on the second day of the
four-day side game against Australia Friday.
	   Selectors gave both middle-order batsmen a chance to regain
their form after Pakistan was crushed by an innings and 99 runs in
the first Test against Australia earlier this week.
	   On a wicket where young Pindi openers Muhammad Naveed and Asif
Mehmood put on a handsome century stand, Haq and Wasim made only
five and eight respectively.
	   Test batsman Ijaz Ahmed, not included in the Pakistan's first
Test line-up, made 33 with the help of three fours and a six off
Gavin Robertson as Rawalpindi finished the day at 196 for seven in
first innings. This was in reply to Australia's first innings total
of 355.
	   Azhar Mahmood was unbeaten on 13 while Shakeel Ahmed was yet to
get off the mark at draw of stumps..
	   Wasim was run out in a terrible mix-up with Haq at the stroke of
tea break. Haq followed him soon after the resumption when he
casually drove off-spinner Collin Miller straight to Michael Slater
at mid-wicket.
	   Naveed and Asif, the two Pindi youngsters, earlier defied
Australian bowlers for 40 overs. Naveed was a bit shaky earlier in
his innings, taking boundaries off medium fast Michael Kasprowicz
in the slip cordon. Mahmood, however, played with lot more
authority, hitting most of his nine boundaries through the covers
as both batsmen put on an impressive 108 runs for the first wicket.
	   Kasprowicz broke the 166-minute opening stand when he got a
lucky leg before decision of Mahmood from umpire Javed Akhtar with
the ball going a long way down the leg side. Mahmood's brilliant 51
featured nine fours and came off 126 balls.
	   Two runs later, Naveed tried to bring his half century with a
big hit but lost his stumps off the bowling of Robertson after
making a fine 48 off 134 deliveries.
	   Pindi lost five wickets in space of 59 runs although at one
stage they were strongly placed at 108 for one.
	   Earlier, Australia added another 27 runs to its overnight total
of 328 for seven before their first innings closed at 355. Azhar
Mahmood claimed the wickets of Gavin Robertson (42) and Kasprowicz
in his third over of the day to finish with four for 83 while
Jaffar Nazir (3-66) and left-arm spinner Shakeel Ahmed (3-98)
captured the remaining wickets.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ President Aleksander Kwasniewski on Friday
appointed a 54-year-old judge and penal law expert as the new head
of Poland's Supreme Court.
	   Lech Gardocki will succeed former Solidarity activist Adam
Strzembosz, who held the post since July 1990, a year after
communist rule ended in Poland. Strzembosz's term expires Oct. 16.
	   Gardocki, a professor at Warsaw University, also has been a
member of the Supreme Court's Penal Chamber. He is considered
politically independent.
	   Kwasniewski, a former communist, was expected to name a fellow
leftist or independent to succeed Strzembosz, whose roots were in
the anti-communist Solidarity movement.
	   Gardocki said Friday he intended to keep away from political
struggles in order to preserve the independence and prestige of one
of Poland's top judicial posts.
	   The Supreme Court is the nation's highest appeals court.

President urges gradual steps toward reunification with China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Days before a crucial meeting between
their top negotiators, Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui on Friday
reiterated a call for constructive dialogue with China and stressed
gradual steps toward reunification.
	   In a message released on the eve of Taiwan's National Day, Lee
urged China to ``drastically reform its political and social
systems.''
	   He also urged that China ``take a broad outlook to cultivate a
peaceful and mutually beneficial relationship'' with Taiwan.
	   ``Based on a respect for the reality of our separate rules, we
hope both sides can begin construction dialogue ... and take
gradual steps to seek reunification in the future,'' he added.
	   Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalists driven from mainland
China by Communist forces in 1949. China still claims Taiwan as a
renegade province with no right to its own foreign relations.
	   Taiwan's top negotiator with China, Koo Chen-fu, will visit the
Chinese mainland Thursday to seek a resumption of dialogue that
Beijing broke off in 1995 in anger over a Taiwanese drive for
international recognition.
	   He will meet his counterpart, Wang Daohan, in their first
get-together since the two held a watershed meeting in Singapore
five years ago to begin regular dialogue.
	   China wants to move straight into talks on political issues, but
Taiwan wants to restart negotiations on less contentious matters.
	   At a news conference, Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Government
Mainland Affairs Council, said Taiwan will persuade China to resume
the dialogue on practical matters such as Taiwanese investors'
safety on the mainland, before pushing for political talks.
	   ``We remain deeply divided on political issues, and if we start
with the more difficult issues, you can imagine what the chances of
success will be,'' Chang said.
	   ``The Koo-Wang meeting can be a starting point, and then we can
start dialogue on all other issues step by step,'' he said.
	   Earlier Friday, the government named 11 delegates who will
accompany Koo to the meeting. The delegation includes Chang
Jung-kung, a China expert of the governing Nationalist Party, and
three other members of the National Unification Council, an
advisory body.
	   The inclusion of the unification council members is viewed as an
indication Taiwan may be preparing for political dialogue that
could take place in the future.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO allies and Russia on Friday
jointly urged Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the
violence in Kosovo, but Russia remained opposed to using force to
end the crisis in the Serbian province.
	   At a meeting of the NATO ambassadors with Sergei Kisliak, the
Russian envoy to the alliance, ``there remained a different
perception on the use of force,'' said a NATO official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   Russia held to the view NATO cannot force that compliance
through airstrikes without first getting a specific U.N. mandate,
according to the official.
	   But, the official said, the allies and Russia agreed on ``the
importance that (U.S. special envoy Richard) Holbrooke has gone
back to Belgrade'' to continue his peace efforts. ``We need to give
Holbrooke some time now.''
	   Holbrooke held new talks with Milosevic Friday. The NATO
ambassadors were to meet again later Friday and, possibly, again
over the weekend, to discuss a common ``legal basis'' for
airstrikes.
	   ``NATO and Russia expressed their full support for the ongoing
diplomatic efforts aimed at securing a political solution to the
crisis,'' The NATO ambassadors and their Russian colleague said in
a joint statement after a two-and-a-half hour meeting.
	   The NATO-Russia meeting came a day after Washington made another
bid to end the Kosovo violence peacefully though U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright warned Milosevic that airstrikes were
near.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and upwards of 300,000
driven from their homes since Feb. 28 when Milosevic launched a
crackdown against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting for independence from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by KLA ``terrorists.''
	   The allies were searching for an adequate legal basis for such
strikes other than a new U.N. Security Council resolution. The
latter will allow Russia to veto such strikes.

	   The vote in the lower chamber of Parliament 313 against the
confidence motion brought by the government to 312 in favor.
	   ``I'm not bitter,'' Prodi said immediately after his government
went down.
	   The swing vote came from Prodi's own coalition, a defecting
deputy from Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's tiny Italian Renewal
party.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ The Justice Ministry will release 10,000
people held in connection with the 1994 genocide whose files
contain no concrete evidence against them, Radio Rwanda said
Friday.
	   The state-run radio quoted Justice Minister Faustin Ntezilyayo
as saying prosecutors and defense ministry officials discussed the
plan Thursday.
	   The radio said 120,000 people were being held in connection with
the extremist Hutu government-organized slaughter of half a million
people, including minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.

Croatia, Vatican sign agreement on church property
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia and the Vatican on Friday signed
an agreement obliging Croatia to return to the church all of its
property confiscated during communism and to provide financial
support for the church from the governments budget.
	   Negotiations on the accord took a long time because the property
seized by Communist authorities of former Yugoslavia _ to which
Croatia belonged until 1991 _ is substantial.
	   No concrete figures were disclosed, but Croatian independent
media reported that the Communists confiscated apartments, office
space and hundreds of millions of square meters of fields and
forests.
	   In the capital Zagreb alone, the church owned dozens of downtown
buildings, including one of the universities, ashospital and a
theater, hundreds of apartments and much real estate on which the
new residential parts of the town were built, the Croatian church's
attorney, Zvjezdana Znidarcic-Begovic, said recently.
	   In the late 1940s and in the 1950s, post-World War II Communist
authorities ``nationalized,'' or proclaimed as state property,
thousands of previously privately-owned assets. They particularly
targeted suspected members of the World War II pro-Nazi Croat
government and the church. Communists sought to suppress national
and religious feelings of all nations within the old Yugoslav
federation.
	   About 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million people are Roman
Catholics.
	   Signing the agreement, Croatia promised to return the property
to the church, or to compensate for what cannot be returned.
	   The government is also obliged to support the work of the church
with a certain amount of money, which was not immediately
disclosed.
	   Last weekend's visit of Pope John Paul II _ who beatified
Croatia's controversial World War II Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac _
likely accelerated conclusion of the accord.

Return of Ossetian refugees may be stopped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A United Nations agency threatened Friday to stop
the process of returning ethnic Ossetian refugees to their homes in
Georgia unless kidnappers release a U.N. official abducted in
January, a news agency reported.
	   Vincent Cochetel, a French aid worker who headed the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees office in North Ossetia, was seized by
three masked gunmen in his apartment in the region's capital of
Vladikavkaz.
	   North Ossetia is located in the Caucasus Mountains of southern
Russia, near breakaway Chechnya. The UNHCR has been assisting the
return of Ossetian refugees to Georgia and its breakaway region of
South Ossetia, which borders Russia.
	   Thousands fled South Ossetia early in this decade, starting from
the time it declared itself an independent republic within the
former Soviet republic in 1990.
	   ``The process of the return of refugees to their homes in South
Ossetia and Georgia became irreversible,'' Hasan Mahmut, acting
head of the UNHCR in the Northern Caucasus told the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   But he noted the UNHCR curtailed its activities in the region
after Cochetel's abduction, and may cease altogether unless he is
released, ITAR-Tass said.

Kohl to attend canonization of Edith Stein in Rome
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl will fly to
Rome this weekend to meet with the pope and attend the canonization
of Edith Stein, a German Jew who converted to become a nun and was
killed in the Holocaust.
	   Kohl was to fly to Rome on Saturday for an afternoon audience
with Pope John Paul II, Kohl's office said Friday. He will attend
Sunday's elevation of Stein to sainthood at the invitation of the
Vatican.
	   Stein's beatification in 1987 drew criticism from some Jews, who
said the Nazis sent her to the gas chamber because of her Jewish
heritage, not because she later embraced Catholicism. She became a
nun in 1933 and died at Auschwitz in 1942.

5,600 Indonesian illegal immigrants repatriated under amnesty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ About 5,600 Indonesian illegal
immigrants have been sent home under a government amnesty since
Aug. 31, a news report said Friday.
	   The amnesty ends Oct. 31. Illegal immigrants caught in the
ensuing crackdown will be fined 3,000 ringgit (dlrs 715) and
detained in holding centers until they are deported.
	   There are about 1 million foreign workers in Malaysia, and about
200,000 lack the proper permits.
	   With the deadline approaching, ``between 400 and 500 immigrants
are expected to be deported daily to Dumai in Indonesia from
Malacca port this month,'' the Bernama news agency quoted Che Mamat
Abdullah, the Malacca director of immigration, as saying.
	   During Asia's boom years, about 2 million foreign workers came
to to work in Malaysia's construction and plantation industries.
Now with rising unemployment and a sinking economy, they are no
longer welcome.
	   Most came from Indonesia. Others included Bangladeshis,
Filipinos and Nepalese.
	   Che Mamat said 823 foreigners had been detained in Malacca in
this year's first nine months for various immigration offenses.

Four rare migrating black Swans killed in France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Four rare black Swans have been killed by hunters
while migrating over France, the League for the Protection of Birds
said Friday.
	   Two of the birds, Lea and Hynek, were wearing electronic tags
and their progress southward was being monitored as part of an
international scientific study.
	   Two birds were from Czechoslovakia, one of which was identified
by a band around its leg. The fourth black swan survived its wound
but died after its wing was amputated.
	   The birds were killed in August or September.
	   The League said that the birds, who are easily recognizable by
their striking black coat of feathers, were shot deliberately.
	   There are about 30 pairs of black swans in France.
	   They spend their winters in Spain.

Lockerbie suspects ready for trial but demand guarantees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The two Libyans suspected of the 1988
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 say that they are ready to stand
trial, but insist they first receive guarantees for their safety.
	   ``We are confident of our innocence. We are ready to appear
before court because we ... have nothing to be afraid of,'' Abdel
Basset Ali al-Megrahi, one of the two suspects, told the
London-based Arab satellite channel MBC on Thursday.
	   The United States and Britain have accused al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah of the bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed
270 people. Both men are under house arrest in Libya. Their
statements were the latest hitch in their proposed trial.
	   The United States and Britain have demanded that the two men,
who they say are Libyan agents, be handed over. In an attempt to
break a nearly decade-long deadlock, the two countries agreed to an
earlier Libyan proposal the two men be tried in a third country by
a panel of Scottish judges under Scottish Law.
	   Libya has accepted the idea in principle, but Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi is demanding negotiations to ensure the safety of
the suspects and prevent their extradition from the Netherlands,
where the trial is to be held. Gadhafi wants the men, if convicted,
to serve their sentences in Libya.
	   Britain and the United States have refused to negotiate.
	   ``We are sticking to our rights,'' Fhimah said.
	   The U.S.-British proposal ``made us realize we are going to be
in danger,'' he said in the interview, the suspects' first
televised appearance in four years. ``Why don't they give us
guarantees? What's the problem with that?''
	   Al-Megrahi complained the two had already been convicted by
Western officials and journalists.
	   Libya was placed under U.N. sanctions in 1992 to force it to
hand over the defendants. The sanctions include an air embargo, an
arms ban and a partial ban on the sale of oil equipment.
	   In recent months, Gadhafi has said that venue selected for the
trial _ Camp Zeist, a Dutch air base 20 miles (32 kilometers)
southeast of Amsterdam _ would leave the suspects susceptible to
kidnapping. The U.S. Air Force used the base from 1954 to 1993.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ In a major victory for the gay
rights movement, South Africa's highest court on Friday struck down
apartheid-era laws banning homosexual sex.
	   The constitutional court upheld an earlier lower-court ruling
that the sodomy law was illegal, and said men charged or convicted
of sodomy since 1994 could demand monetary damages and erasure of
their records.
	   ``Gay men who have been persecuted for hundreds of years in this
country now have the right to (file) claims from the state,'' said
Zackie Achmat, director of the National Coalition for Gay and
Lesbian Equality, which sought the ruling. ``We welcome this
judgment as an extension of the rule of law.''
	   Gay rights have been protected since the 1994 provisional
constitution paved the way for a final document approved in 1996.
South Africa was the first country to ban discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation in its constitution.
	   But the laws that criminalized sex between men remained on the
books until Friday's court ruling.
	   Sex between women was never officially banned, but was
stigmatized by extension, the court said.
	   Under apartheid, sodomy could be punished with up to seven years
in prison. Men were not even allowed to have casual contact at
social gatherings that could be construed as homosexual behavior.
	   The former South African military practiced so-called ``aversion
therapy'' on gay men, applying electric shocks to victims while
they viewed images of naked men, a report on human rights abuses
released last year said.
	   ``Just as apartheid legislation rendered the lives of couples of
different racial groups perpetually at risk, the sodomy offense
(built) insecurity and vulnerability into the daily lives of gay
men,'' the 11-judge panel said in its ruling.
	   Panel-member Judge Albie Sachs wrote in the opinion that the
ruling should be seen ``as part of a growing acceptance of
difference in an increasingly open and pluralistic South Africa.''
	   Since the first all-race election ended apartheid in 1994,
President Nelson Mandela's government has pushed to end all forms
of discrimination.
	   The country's military protects the rights of gay and lesbian
soldiers. Earlier this year, the police were ordered to include a
lesbian partner under one of its female officer's medical
insurance.
	   Achmat said the ruling could open up possibilities for adoption
and marriage rights for gay couples.

Islamic extremists hold more protests against troubled author
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo DHA101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Nearly 1,000 Islamic extremists took to
the streets after Friday prayers to call for the death of
controversial author Taslima Nasrin.
	   The protest was intended to maintain pressure on the authorities
to find and arrest Nasrin on blasphemy charges. Conservative
Islamic groups began the campaign after the essayist and poet ended
a four-year voluntary exile to care for her ailing mother.
	   ``Hang the enemy of Islam to death,'' chanted the protesters as
they emerged from Dhaka's main Baitul Mukurram mosque wearing white
prayer caps.
	   They belonged to Islami Oikya Jote, an alliance of conservative
Islamic groups, which has offered 2,000 takas (dlrs 5,000) to
anyone who kills 36-year-old Nasrin.
	   Nasrin was targeted after a newspaper quoted her as saying in
1994 that the Koran, the Islamic holy book, should be rewritten.
She later said she was misquoted, but she openly called for changes
in strict Islamic laws to give more rights to women.
	   Nasrin has been in hiding since returning in September from
Europe and America.
	   She is on bail from charges brought by the state, but she is
wanted in a civil suit that accuses her of offending sentiments of
Muslims in her book, ``Nirbachito Column'' or Selected Columns, a
compilation of her newspaper writings.
	   ``I fear I'll be killed by the extremists if I appear in
public,'' she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview on
Thursday from her hide-out.
	   Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said the author
should surrender to court and answer the charges. Nasrin said she
was exploring the possibility of her attorneys representing her
during court hearings.
	   ``I'm definitely going to stay here until my mother dies,'' she
said in the telephone interview.

EU complains of deterioration of human rights Myanmar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Friday denounced
the ``deterioration'' of the human rights situation in Myanmar and
urged the military junta to open talks with the opposition led by
Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   In a statement, the 15 EU countries called for the immediate
release of all political prisoners and said Suu Kyi should be
allowed to travel freely around the country.
	   Suu Kyi was under house arrest between 1989 and 1995. She has
been stopped several times in recent months from leaving the
capital Rangoon to meet supporters.
	   Earlier this week, the military government said it had arrested
54 people for staging anti-government demonstrations. Hundreds of
opposition members have been detained by the government in recent
months.
	   The NLD won a landslide victory in 1990 elections, but the
military never allowed parliament to meet. Last month, Suu Kyi and
party members formed a committee to replace the parliament that was
never convened.
	   The EU said it hopes ``the Burmese authorities will respond to
this initiative by engaging in a real dialogue with those parties
which won democratic support.''
	   EU foreign ministers are expected Oct. 26 to vote to extend the
Union's sanctions against Myanmar, which include a visa ban for
government officials, the suspension of high-level government
visits, an arms embargo and the suspension of non-humanitarian aid
.
	   The EU last year also ended trade privileges enjoyed by Myanmar
under a system aimed at helping developing nations.

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Significantly raising the toll from
summer flooding, a senior Chinese official has been quoted as
saying more than 3,656 people died, more than 20 percent higher
than the previously announced figure.
	   Niu Maosheng, vice director of China's flood control bureau,
issued the revised casualty count before 1,300 people attending a
meeting arranged by the Communist Party's Propaganda Department in
Beijing Thursday, the Shanghai-based Xinmin Evening News reported
in its Thursday editions.
	   Economic losses exceeded 248 billion yuan (dlrs 30 billion),
with more than 5.6 million houses destroyed and nearly 25.8 million
hectares (64 million acres) of land inundated, Niu was quoted as
saying.
	   More than 230 million people _ a fifth of China's population _
were affected by the flooding; the worst hit provinces were
Jiangxi, Hunan and Hubei, which lie along the Yangtze River in
central China, and Xinjiang in the northwest and Heilongjiang and
Inner Mongolia in the northeast, the newspaper said.
	   The flooding, which lasted for more than two months in some
areas, was the worst in 44 years on the Yangtze River and in
decades in the northeast. But the government often appeared
reluctant to divulge damage assessments, prompting speculation that
the true number of casualties was much higher.
	   In the last official damage report, given six weeks ago after
the worst of the flooding was over, Vice Premier Wen Jiabao said
3,004 people had died, 5 million houses were destroyed and 21
million hectares (52 million acres) swamped for economic losses of
166.6 billion yuan (dlrs 20.2 billion).
	   The flooding was made worse by years of environmental neglect
and forced Chinese leaders to confront some of the costs of
breakneck economic development. The government banned logging in
the western half of Sichuan province starting Sept. 1 to stop soil
further soil erosion along the upper Yangtze and its tributaries.
	   Guangxi in the south has announced a regionwide ban on logging
as of Oct. 15, also because of widespread soil erosion, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported Friday.
	   The widespread flooding forced China to move 50,000 prisoners
out of harm's way, but not one escaped, Xinhua quoted Minister of
Justice Gao Changli as saying Friday.
	   ``This can be regarded as a miracle'' in the history of criminal
rehabilitation, Gao was quoted as saying.

Holbrooke holds new talks with Milosevic while NATO presses ahead

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with NATO allies failing to get Russia to drop its
opposition to airstrikes; edits &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke tried
to wring concessions out of a defiant Slobodan Milosevic on Friday,
holding new talks aimed at getting him to comply with international
demands on Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.
	   While top Western officials declined to call it Milosevic's last
chance to avoid attack, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
had warned in dispatching Holbrooke back to Belgrade that ``time is
all but gone'' for a peaceful settlement.
	   Divisions remained among the 16 NATO allies on the use of force,
however. Germany and Italy, among others, are reluctant to proceed
without a stronger legal basis for action.
	   Alliance ambassadors failed at a meeting in Brussels on Friday
to pressure Russia into dropping its opposition to airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke, who arrived from London where he met with officials
of the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans, said Friday that
movement toward authorizing the use of force by NATO continues ``in
a sustained and intense manner.''
	   ``The situation remains just as serious at it has been before,''
he said shortly before the start of his fourth meeting with
Milosevic in five days. There was no indication how long the talks
would last, or whether Holbrooke would stay into the weekend.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and upwards of 300,000
driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb.
28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is
fighting for independence from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by KLA ``terrorists.''
	   The international demands Holbrooke was presenting to Milosevic
are an immediate end to hostilities, a withdrawal of forces and
heavy armaments to pre-March levels, allowing unhindered work by
humanitarian organizations, cooperation with the International War
Crimes Tribunal, facilitating refugees' return to their homes, and
the start of negotiations with ethnic Albanian leaders on possible
self-rule.
	   In addition, Holbrooke was expected to press for an
international monitoring force to be allowed to oversee compliance.
	   The KLA announced a unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo
starting Friday _ a move that will add to the pressure on Milosevic
to reciprocate. There were no immediate reports on new gunfire or
shelling.
	   Milosevic has refused to openly declare a cease-fire, even
though there has been no major fighting in Kosovo during the past
week and the KLA has been largely routed. He considers the Kosovo
rebels ``terrorists and bandits,'' and any cease-fire on his part
would legitimize them as a negotiating partner, one of his
associates said on condition of anonymity.
	   The Serbian and Yugoslav governments showed little sign that
they are prepared to bow to international pressure, apparently
gambling that Russian opposition to a NATO attack will persuade key
alliance members, including Germany and Italy, to block any action.
	   Dismissing any talk of a rift within NATO, Albright said she
thinks the alliance will agree on an activation order ``in the next
few days'' that would authorize an attack.
	   On Friday, the NATO allies and Russia jointly urged Milosevic to
end the violence in Kosovo, but Russia remained opposed to using
force.
	   At a meeting of the NATO ambassadors with Sergei Kisliak, the
Russian envoy to the alliance, ``there remained a different
perception on the use of force,'' said a NATO official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The official said the allies and Russia agreed on ``the
importance that Holbrooke has gone back to Belgrade'' to continue
his peace efforts. ``We need to give Holbrooke some time now,'' the
official said.
	   The NATO ambassadors were to meet again later Friday and
possibly again on Saturday and Sunday to discuss a common ``legal
basis'' for airstrikes.
	   The allies are warning that they envision not just one strike
against Yugoslavia but a series of air attacks, gradually
intensifying.
	   ``We have made it perfectly plain that NATO's planning is not
for one rap over the knuckles,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook told the British Broadcasting Corp. on Friday.
	   ``NATO's planning is for, if necessary, successive, coordinated
attacks which would make sure that President Milosevic could not
continue to deploy the heavy military that he has in Kosovo,'' he
said.

Russian parliament criticizes government's plan to discard Mir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian parliament urged President Boris
Yeltsin on Friday to reconsider the government's plan to discard
the Mir space station next year, saying that would finish Russia as
a space power.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, demanded that the
government keep Mir in orbit until a new international space
station becomes operational.
	   The Russian Space Agency had initially planned to keep a crew on
Mir until the end of 1999, but decided to abandon it next June
because of a severe shortage of funds.
	   ``The decision to discard Mir causes bewilderment and protests
of scientists and experts throughout the world,'' a statement by
the Duma said.
	   Lawmakers said up to 100,000 Russian space workers would be left
without jobs if Mir is discarded, fomenting unrest and destroying
high-tech industries that could be a base for economic growth.

Citing financial losses, Pilot Pen gives up men's tournament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIGITTE GREENBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ With attendance and sponsorship
falling far short of game point, organizers of the Pilot Pen
International tennis tournament said Thursday the men's portion of
the event has been sold for dlrs 1.7 million (U.S.) to a promoter
in Austria.
	   Tournament chairman Butch Buchholz said in a written statement
that financial losses for the past two years left the organization
with no other option. Investors have not reaped a penny, tournament
president Mike Davies said.
	   ``Our investors felt that they did not want to put more money
into this event because it was bleeding too badly,'' Davies said.
``We did not get the numbers right. We obviously spent more money
on the event than we took in in income. You don't have to go to
Yale to know that you're on a losing ticket if that keeps
happening.''
	   For the past eight years, the tournament has served as a warm-up
to the U.S. Open. But in addition to the financial losses, the
men's event also was facing scheduling problems. The ATP Tour
planned to shuffle the dates, making it less likely to draw
big-name players.
	   The selling price will allow the tournament to pay off its
debts, which amount to less than dlrs 2 million. Davies said that
when investors came on board in 1997, they expected losses, but no
more than about dlrs 500,000.
	   The men's tournament will go to Kitzbuhel, Austria, where a clay
court event was played this year from July 27-Aug. 2.
	   The women's event, planned for Aug. 23-28, will now take center
court. Davies said putting on both a men's and women's event cost
dlrs 6 million, but that it would only cost about dlrs 2 million to
play host to the women alone.
	   Besides, the women's event drew higher attendance this year.
	   ``We are bullish about the women's event making it,'' Davies
said. ``We certainly think that the public and the community
supports women's tennis. Women's tennis is very, very hot
worldwide. There's great demand for tournaments on the women's game
right now.''

Page bid for WBA welterweight crown still in doubt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The proposed WBA welterweight bout between Andrey
Pestrayev and James Page remained in doubt Friday after a legal
challenge from a Mexican boxer who claims that he should be
fighting for the vacant belt.
	   Russian Pestrayev is the No. 1 contender for the WBA crown.
	   But after the WBA paired him with the No. 3 contender,
Pittsburg, Ca.-based Page, the No. 2, Jose Luis Lopez, mounted a
legal challenge.
	   On Tuesday, a New Jersey state judge ruled that the WBA could
not award the title to the winner of Saturday's Paris bout.
	   ``We are hopeful that the fight will go ahead as a world title
bout,'' Nathalie Cristol, a spokeswoman for the fight's organizers
told The Associated Press on Friday.
	   ``The WBA had no choice because Lopez was suspended for taking
banned drugs. Under WBA rules he will have a chance to fight for
the title within 90 days,'' Cristol said.
	   The WBA is expected to rule on the matter late Friday.
	   Whatever its decision the fight will go ahead, with Pestrayev,
the 1997 European welterweight champion, as favorite.
	   The 29-year-old from Ufa turned pro after the 1992 Olympics in
Barcelona, and Saturday's bout would likely be his last crack at a
world title.
	   Page, 27, is 21-3 and fighting for his first world title.
	   Spectators at the Paris' Bercy arena Saturday will definitely
see one world title bout, with Khalid Rahilou of France defending
his WBA super lightweight crown against Washington D.C.-fighter
Sharmba Mitchell.
	   Rahilou, 32, is a former kickboxing world champion, and defends
the title he won from American Frankie Randall in January, and
retained in July against another U.S. fighter, Marty Jakubowski.
	   Mitchell, 28, is 42-2 and fights in Don King's stable.
	   Saturday's fight will be his first shot at a world title.
	   ``I don't know a lot about Rahilou,'' Mitchell said. ``But he
has never faced a man as quick or as tough as me. Of course, I
would have preferred to confront him in the United States but my
victory over him in France will be even more valuable.''
	   Marvin Smith, his manager, said Rahilou is Mitchell's toughest
opponent to date.
	   ``Rahilou has much better movement than the fighters Sharmba has
faced before. He isn't going to just stand there and wait to get
hit,'' he told The AP.

Court to try former Surinamese rebel _ with or without him
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAARLEM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch court plans to try a former
Surinamese guerrilla leader on cocaine smuggling charges in
absentia if he doesn't show up, an official said Friday.
	   The trial of Ronnie Brunswijk, 36, has been scheduled for Dec.
10 despite fruitless attempts to extradite him and doubts that he
will come to the Netherlands on his own.
	   Brunswijk, a one-time bodyguard of former Suriname dictator Desi
Bouterse who later tried to overthrow him, faces multiple charges
of cocaine smuggling in 1996 and 1997, said spokeswoman Tina Zwiers
of the public prosecutor's office.
	   According to the Dutch daily De Telegraaf, one of the shipments
contained up to 53 kilograms (116 pounds) of cocaine.
	   Brunswijk, who allegedly enlisted carriers for the transports
from Suriname to the Netherlands, has denied all charges.
	   At the request of Dutch prosecutors, Interpol issued an arrest
warrant last summer for Brunswijk. But authorities have been unable
to secure him for trial because there is no extradition treaty
between the Netherlands and its former colony.
	   They can only hope for his voluntary surrender. Falling short of
that, the district court in the western Dutch city of Haarlem will
conduct the trial in absentia.
	   ``He knows when he needs to be here,'' Zwiers said.
	   Brunswijk led the Jungle Commandos, a group that waged a
guerrilla war against Bouterse in 1986 and 1987.
	   Bouterse, who ruled Suriname for seven years after leading a
military coup in 1980, has also been charged with drug trafficking
by Dutch prosecutors. He has not been turned over for trial.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Iran's foreign minister held talks with
Turkish officials in Ankara Friday in a bid to defuse a mounting
crisis between Turkey and Syria over Kurdish rebels.
	   Turkey issued an ultimatum to Syria this week, demanding that
Damascus expel Turkish Kurdish rebels from its territory or ``face
the consequences.''
	   Turkish reports suggested air strikes on suspected rebel bases
in the Syrian controlled-Bekaa Valley of Lebanon were possible.
	   Syria denies the accusations. Turkey's warlike rhetoric has
raised fears of a regional conflict.
	   Later on Friday, Turkey's chief of general staff, president,
prime minister and foreign minister were scheduled to meet on the
crisis.
	   Syria's Kamal Kharrazi held talks with his Turkish counterpart
Ismail Cem and President Suleyman Demirel.
	   ``If everything goes right, there may soon be a peaceful
settlement of the situation,'' Kharrazi told reporters after having
a lunch with Cem. ``But it is early to speculate on that.''
	   On Thursday, Kharrazi discussed the problem with Syrian
President Hafez Assad in Damascus.
	   Private NTV television said on Friday that Kharrazi could be
bringing a message from Assad.
	   Kharrazi said in Ankara that ``the important thing is to search
for a peaceful solution to the crisis. It is the wish of all Muslim
countries.''
	   Iran entered mediation efforts in its role as the head of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, a 55-member group that
includes Syria and Turkey. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak also
shuttled between the two countries earlier this week.
	   But Turkey has accused Iran of also turning a blind eye to the
Kurdish rebel presence on its territory along the Turkish border.
	   ``The rebels enter Iranian territory from northern Iraq and
stage cross-border attacks from there,'' Deputy Premier Bulent
Ecevit told reporters on Thursday.
	   Cem thanked Iran for its ``brotherly efforts.''
	   Turkish authorities have made clear their preference for a
diplomatic solution, but Premier Mesut Yilmaz said ending the
tension was up to Syria.
	   Relations between Syria and Turkey have always been troublesome.
Syria is concerned by Ankara's plans to build dams on the Euphrates
River _ a main source of water for Syria. The recent boost in
Israeli-Turkish military and diplomatic relations has also angered
Damascus, and several Arab countries.
	   The Turkish-Kurdish war has claimed some 37,000 lives since
1984.
	   Ankara has asked Syria to extradite rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan, who resides in Damascus according to Turkish intelligence
reports. Turkey also wants Syria to put an end to its support to
the rebels, who are fighting for autonomy within Turkey.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Thousands of Palestinians, some
shooting in the air from automatic weapons and chanting
``revenge,'' marched Friday in the funeral procession of a
20-year-old man killed a day before in clashes with Israeli troops
	   Fifteen Palestinians were injured in confrontations Friday
between stone throwers and Israeli soldiers who fired rubber
bullets.
	   In the West Bank's Jordan Valley, an Israeli woman was stabbed
to death by a Palestinian man outside the Jewish settlement of
Tomer. Israeli troops shot and wounded the assailant.
	   The violence overshadowed preparations by Israel and the
Palestinians for next week's Mideast summit in Washington under the
auspices of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   In Hebron, funeral services for 20-year-old Amjad Natche were
held in a small mosque overflowing with thousands of mourners. Many
laid their prayer rugs in the dust outside the mosque as Koranic
verses played over loudspeakers.
	   After noon prayers, Natche's body was carried for several miles
(kilometers) on a wooden pellet toward the cemetery. As the
procession wound through hilly streets, mourners chanted ``Allahu
Akbar,'' or ``God is Great,'' and three brandished automatic
weapons.
	   One masked man, a follower of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
Fatah group who carried a mini-Uzi submachine gun, said he was
sending a warning to Israel that Palestinians were armed and ready
to rise up if Israel continued its hard-line policies.
	   Several mourners, activists in the Islamic militant group Hamas,
chanted ``revenge, revenge.''
	   Natche, who belongs to one of the largest clans in Hebron, was
killed Thursday in stone-throwing clashes with Israeli soldiers.
	   Confrontations resumed Friday when several dozen Palestinians,
some masked and twirling slingshots, threw stones and empty bottles
at troops who fired a few rounds of rubber-coated steel pellets.
Fifteen Palestinians were injured.

Apologize for bombing Sudanese plant, Kuwait tells Washington
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The United States should admit that it was
wrong in bombing a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant and apologize to
Sudan, Kuwait's foreign minister was quoted Friday as saying.
	   American claims that the plant produced materials for chemical
weapons ``were not proven true,'' the minister, Sheik Sabah
al-Ahmed al-Sabah, told the London-based Al-Hayat newspaper.
	   ``It is for those who make mistakes to admit their mistakes and
present their apologies,'' he said.
	   Kuwait, a leading U.S. ally in the Gulf, signed a defense pact
with the United States after American-led forces drove Iraqi troops
out of Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Washington attacked the pharmaceutical plant in the Sudanese
capital, Khartoum, in retaliation for attacks against U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7. It said the plant
produced precursors for chemical weapons, a charge Sudan has
denied.
	   Shortly after the attack, Kuwait indirectly criticized
Washington, saying that the fight against terrorism should be waged
through international bodies like the United Nations.

Poll: Clinton popular choice for Russia's president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Forget Boris Yeltsin and Gennady Zyuganov.
Russians have a different popular choice for president: Bill
Clinton.
	   According to a poll released Friday, 27 percent of Russians said
they would vote for Clinton in the improbable event he ran for
Russia's president.
	   That would be enough to make him a leading candidate. The most
popular Russian candidates appear to have the support of about 20
percent of voters.
	   Still, 56 percent of respondents said they would vote against
Clinton, according to the poll by the Public Opinion Foundation,
cited by the Interfax news agency.
	   The poll, conducted on Sept. 26 among 1,500 people throughout
the country, did not give a margin of error.
	   In a similar poll five years ago, 20 percent said they would
vote for Clinton, and 43 percent said they would vote against him,
Interfax reported.
	   Clinton's relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky,
which received a lot of publicity in Russia, did not appear to
affect Russians' views.
	   Sixty-three percent said their opinion was not changed by the
scandal, 7 percent said their opinion of Clinton actually improved,
and 4 percent said it became worse.
	   Russia's next presidential election is set for 2,000. Leading
candidates include Zyuganov, the Communist Party leader, regional
governor Alexander Lebed, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and former
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.

Chronology of NATO Airstrikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NATO has prepared plans to strike at Yugoslav and Serbian
targets in an effort to force a pullback of government troops in
Kosovo and create conditions for refugee returns in the Serbian
province.
	   NATO airstrikes were used in Bosnia-Herzegovina, neighboring
Serbia, between early 1994 and August 1995 in attempts to force the
Bosnian Serbs to cease hostilities. A chronology:
	   Feb. 28, 1994 _ U.S. F-16 fighters shoot down four Bosnian Serb
warplanes violating a ``no-fly'' zone over central Bosnia. It is
the first military strike in NATO's 45-year history.
	   April 10, 1994 _ Two U.S. F-16s attack Bosnian Serb positions
near Gorazde, a U.N. ``safe area'' 35 miles (about 55 kilometers)
southeast of Sarajevo.
	   April 11, 1994 _ Two U.S. Marine FA-18s attack Serb positions
near Gorazde, reportedly destroying a tank. Serbs respond by
capturing all strategic points around Gorazde.
	   Aug. 5, 1994 _ Two U.S. A-10 jets destroy an aging anti-tank
weapon near Sarajevo, after Serbs seize heavy weapons from a
U.N.-guarded compound. The weapons are later returned.
	   Sept. 22, 1994 _ NATO jets attack a Serb tank near Sarajevo
after Serbs attack a French armored personnel carrier and defy U.N.
demands to remove heavy guns violating a ``no-weapons'' zone around
the city. Serbs respond by harassing peacekeepers, delaying aid
convoys, grounding helicopter flights and shutting down the aid
airlift to Sarajevo.
	   Nov. 21, 1994 _ NATO warplanes bomb the air base in Serb-held
Croatia used by Serb planes to raid the neighboring U.N. ``safe
area'' of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia.
	   Nov. 23, 1994 _ About 20 NATO planes hit at least two Serb
surface-to-air missile sites near Bihac. Serbs take dozens of U.N.
peacekeepers hostage.
	   May 25, 1995 _ NATO jets strike at Bosnian Serb ammunition depot
near the Serb stronghold of Pale outside Sarajevo, after the Serbs
refuse to return heavy weapons taken from U.N.-guarded collection
sites.
	   May 26, 1995 _ NATO jets again attack Bosnian Serb ammunition
dump near Pale. Serbs respond by taking more than 370 U.N.
peacekeepers hostage. After Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
intervenes, the hostages are released over several weeks.
	   July 11, 1995 _ NATO jets attack Bosnian Serb tanks south of
Srebrenica, a U.N. ``safe area,'' in an attempt to protect Dutch
U.N. peacekeepers and 30,000 people in the town. Bosnian Serbs
overrun the town, sending peacekeepers and refugees fleeing.
	   Aug. 30, 1995 _ Over 60 aircraft launch NATO's biggest
airstrikes against Serb targets two days after a mortar attack on
Sarajevo kills 37 people. Initial reports say the night raid
successfully knocks out Serb air defense missile sites, radar bases
and communication posts.

Yugoslav military cannot use Bosnian radars in case of airstrikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The Yugoslav military cannot
count on Bosnian Serb radar equipment as an additional early
warning system in case of eventual NATO airstrikes, because it is
under pace force control, NATO officials said Friday.
	   As NATO countries approach a decision on whether to undertake
military actions against Yugoslavia for its crackdown in the Kosovo
province, some local and international media have speculated that
radar systems controlled by Serbs in Bosnia could be used as an
additional early warning for the Yugoslav military.
	   ``All air-defense systems ... in Bosnia-Herzegovina have been
inactive since December 1995,'' said Maj. Glenn Chamberlain, a
spokesman for the NATO-led peace force in Bosnia.
	   In addition, all these systems, including radars, are strictly
controlled by the peacekeepers. Therefore, suggestions that Bosnian
Serb and Yugoslav air-defense systems are or could be linked are
incorrect, Chamberlain said.
	   The peace force in Bosnia ``will not hesitate to take any
appropriate measures to deter or prevent resumption of
hostilities,'' he said.
	   Radar and air-defense systems across the former Yugoslavia were
part of the same powerful military structure until the country
started falling apart in 1991.

Sanchez-Vicario rallies at Filderstadt; Lindsay Davenport could
</HEADLINE>
earn No. 1 ranking by end of day &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FILDERSTADT, Germany (AP) _ Spain's Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario
rallied to reach the semifinals Friday at the Porsche Grand Prix _
where Lindsay Davenport could end the day as the new world No. 1.
	   Davenport, who has been chasing Martina Hingis for months, will
end the Swiss teenager's 80-week hold on the No. ranking if she
beats France's Nathalie Tauziat in her quarterfinal match.
	   Hingis would then fall to No. 2 in next week's computer rankings
even if she beats Belgium's Dominique Van Roost in her quarterfinal
match.
	   Sanchez-Vicario, the fourth seed, was the first player to reach
the semifinals at the dlrs 450,000 after she rallied from 1-4 down
in the second set to beat Lisa Raymond of the United States, 1-6,
7-5, 6-2.
	   Raymond, ranked 16th, dominated the Spaniard with hard strokes
and by attacking the net until her forehand errors began mounting
late in the match.
	   Sanchez-Vicario completed her comeback by closing out the match
in one hour, 57 minutes when Raymond double faulted.
	   ``It didn't look very good for me at the start of the match,''
said Sanchez-Vicario. ``But I wanted to show her I don't give up.''
	   Hingis, the defending champion and top seed, will have to have
to win the tournament to stop Davenport from claiming the top
ranking, even if the American loses her match today against
Tauziat.

Lockerbie suspects ready for trial but demand guarantees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The two Libyans suspected of the 1988
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 say that they are ready to stand
trial, but insist they first receive guarantees for their safety.
	   ``We are confident of our innocence. We are ready to appear
before court because we ... have nothing to be afraid of,'' Abdel
Basset Ali al-Megrahi, one of the two suspects, told the
London-based Arab satellite channel MBC on Thursday.
	   The United States and Britain have accused al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah of the bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed
270 people. Both men are under house arrest in Libya. Their
statements were the latest hitch in their proposed trial.
	   The United States and Britain have demanded that Libya hand over
the two men, who they say are Libyan agents. In an attempt to break
a nearly decade-long deadlock, the two countries agreed to an
earlier Libyan proposal the two men be tried in a third country by
a panel of Scottish judges under Scottish Law.
	   Libya has accepted the idea in principle, but Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi is demanding negotiations to ensure the safety of
the suspects and prevent their extradition from the Netherlands,
where the trial is to be held. Gadhafi wants the men, if convicted,
to serve their sentences in Libya.
	   Britain and the United States have refused to negotiate.
	   ``We are sticking to our rights,'' Fhimah said.
	   The U.S.-British proposal ``made us realize we are going to be
in danger,'' he said in the interview, the suspects' first
televised appearance in four years. ``Why don't they give us
guarantees? What's the problem with that?''
	   Al-Megrahi complained the two had already been convicted by
Western officials and journalists.
	   Libya was placed under U.N. sanctions in 1992 to force it to
hand over the defendants. The sanctions include an air embargo, an
arms ban and a partial ban on the sale of oil equipment.
	   In recent months, Gadhafi has said that venue selected for the
trial _ Camp Zeist, a Dutch air base 20 miles (30 kilometers)
southeast of Amsterdam _ would leave the suspects susceptible to
kidnapping. The U.S. Air Force used the base from 1954 to 1993.

EU complains of deterioration of human rights Myanmar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES full name of oppositon party &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Friday denounced
the ``deterioration'' of the human rights situation in Myanmar and
urged the military junta to open talks with the opposition led by
Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   In a statement, the 15 EU countries called for the immediate
release of all political prisoners and said Suu Kyi should be
allowed to travel freely around the country.
	   Suu Kyi was under house arrest between 1989 and 1995. She has
been stopped several times in recent months from leaving the
capital Rangoon to meet supporters.
	   Earlier this week, the military government said it had arrested
54 people for staging anti-government demonstrations. Hundreds of
opposition members have been detained by the government in recent
months.
	   Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party won a landslide
victory in 1990 elections, but the military never allowed
parliament to meet. Last month, Suu Kyi and party members formed a
committee to replace the parliament that was never convened.

Izawa, three others share lead in Tokai Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIYOSHI, Japan (AP) _ Toshimitsu Izawa fired the day's best
score, a 6-under-par 66, and moved into a four-way tie for the lead
Friday after 36 holes in the 110 million yen (dlrs 894,000) Tokai
Classic.
	   Also at 5-under 139 were Yasuharu Imano, Tsuyoshi Yoneyama and
Kaname Yokoo. Imano shot a 67, Yoneyama a 69 and Yokoo a 70,
putting them one shot ahead of three other players.
	   Izawa, whose only victory on the Japan PGA Tour came in the 1995
Japan Open, sank seven birdies against one bogey on the 7,060-yard
(6,425-meter), par-72 Miyoshi Country Club course.
	   ``Last week, I had good iron shots and played well but just
couldn't put together the game because of easy errors,'' said
Izawa. ``I'm hitting it close and putting relatively well this
week.''
	   At 140 were Mamoru Osanai, Nobuhito Sato and Yasunori Ida.
Osanai turned in a 67, Sato a 68 and Ida a 69.
	   Toshiaki Odate also shot 69 and share eighth place at 141 with
Shigeki Maruyama, who shot a 71.
	   A total of 65 players survived the cut at 5-over 149.
	   The winner will collect 19.8 million yen (dlrs 161,000).

Belarusian lawmaker vows to ``punish'' NATO if it strikes on
</HEADLINE>
Yugoslavia &QL; 
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC;

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A Belarusian lawmaker threatened Friday to
``punish'' everyone who may take part in NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia, from heads of governments down to rank-and-file
soldiers.
	   The comments by Sergei Kostyan, head of the parliament's
anti-NATO group, followed Belarusian President Alexander
Lukashenko's promise to give military aid to Yugoslavia if it is
attacked by NATO.
	   Kostyan, who also leads an alliance of lawmakers from Slavic
countries, said that both groups would ``track down all those
taking part in the conflict: soldiers, commanders, politicians and
presidents.''
	   ``We will punish everyone,'' he said at a news conference.
	   When asked to elaborate, Kostyan said he meant legal punishment
through courts, not acts of terror.
	   Belarus and neighboring Russia oppose NATO airstrikes against
Serbia, which makes up most up present day Yugoslavia, and favor a
diplomatic solution to the crisis in Kosovo province. Belarus,
Russia and Serbia are all Slavic countries that also share the
Orthodox religion.
	   Kostyan also accused the West of plotting aggression against
Belarus, which has been criticized for Lukashenko's authoritarian
policies, including his crackdown on dissent and media freedom in
the former Soviet republic of 10 million people.
	   ``In Kosovo they (the West) are staging a dress rehearsal for
their action in Belarus,'' Kostyan said. ``It will be easy to find
collaborators and traitors here.''
	   Meanwhile, the Liberal Democratic Party of Belarus, a group
linked to Russian ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, said in a
statement Friday that it had started recruiting former officers to
fight alongside the Serbs in case of NATO airstrikes.

	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ With the time trials behind them,
the top riders at the World Cycling Championships now point for
this weekend's road races.
	   The elite women's race is 102.2 kilometers (64.1 miles) on
Saturday. The men race 258 kilometers (162 miles) on Sunday to
conclude the championships.
	   The women's race has time trial winner Leontien van Moorsel
looking for a double. The Dutch racer won the road race in 1991 and
1993 but took nearly three years off to battle weight problems. At
one time she was more than 30 kilos (63 pounds) above her weight in
the early 1990s and went to a clinic to reduce.
	   Defending champion Alessandra Cappellotto of Italy is the
favorite for the race.
	   Jeannie Longo, looking for her 13th world title, will challenge
along with another Frenchwoman, Catherine Marsal, third last year,
second in 1995 and winner in 1991.
	   The women race six times around the circuit. The men do 15 laps
the following day on a lap that includes a sharp but steep climb.
	   American Lance Armstrong, who won the road title in 1993, came
in fourth in Thursday's time trial and says he can be among the top
men's riders with a few laps remaining.
	   ``If I have a little luck, I'll be in the race. I have the
luxury of having won before. Sunday doesn't make make or break my
career, which takes some pressure off of me. I think i'll be there
off. I want to win,'' Armstrong said.
	   If Armstrong does win on Sunday, it will be a remarkable
comeback and complete a full circle.
	   The 27-year old Armstrong announced he had testicular cancer
just before the world championships two years ago.
	   ``In my mind, I consider myself first a cancer patient, second
an athlete,'' Armstrong said.
	   ``I think I have a good balance now. In the past I think I was
too dependent on cycling,'' Armstrong said. ``Now if they told me I
were sick again, if I relapsed, I wouldn't think about the sport at
all. I would forget it immediately.
	   ``Yes I like to ride and I love the sport, but if it all went
away, it would be all right too.''
	   After winning five years ago, Armstrong knows what it will take
to win again.
	   ``The world championships are predictable. Almost always it's
decided with 2-3 laps to go,'' Armstrong said. ``If you look back
at the past races, the last 2-3 laps are very much an individual
race.''
	   But it will be lacking top top individuals.
	   The last three Tour de France winners -- Marco Pantani, Jan
Ullrich and Bjarne Riis -- are out. The Tour de France doping
scandal also forced out last year's road champion, Laurent Brochard
and the top-ranked cyclist according to UCI ratings, Laurent
Jalabert.
	   Also, Spain's Abraham Olano, who won Thursday's time trial, is
questionable after battling a knee problem.
	   Armstrong looked realistically at the depleted world
championship field.
	   ``If I pretend that I'm the winner on Sunday and you're on the
podium, I don't think in your heart of hearts, you can say `You
beat everybody'. I don't think you can say `You beat the best.'
	   ``Especially in a year like this without Pantani, without
Ullrich, you can't say you are the truest world champion. That's
unfortunate,'' he said.
	   Among the top riders who are here, Michele Bartoli and Andrea
Tafi head the strong Italian men's team. Michael Boogerd and Leon
van Bon being motivated in front of the home Dutch crowd.
	   Also Emmanuel Magnien of France, Rolf Sorensen of Denmark and
Andrei Tchmil of Belgium are also mentioned as favorites.

Australian economy will suffer from global turmoil, government

says &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES, RECASTS with new quotes from forecaster's report and
treasurer's comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Global economic turmoil would drag
Australia's economy down next year, possibly pushing it into
recession if the Asian crisis worsens, an independent economic
forecaster warned Friday.
	   In a report released Friday on the five-year outlook for
Australian business, forecaster Access Economics stopped short of
predicting a recession, but said a period of contraction could not
be ruled out.
	   ``If a recession were to hit Australia, it would not be until
1999 and it would have to be driven by still further fumbles in
Japan and China,'' the report said. ``If Japan and China avoid a
further decline, then so will Australia.''
	   Asia posed a huge problem for Australia because six of the
country's largest export markets were already in recession, the
report said.
	   Australia would experience a ``difficult year'' in 1999, with
the strength of the domestic economy less of a shield from the
global turmoil and external negatives mounting, the report said.
	   Access forecast growth at 3.0 percent, down from a previous
forecast of 3.1 percent but higher than the Treasury's budget
forecast of 2.75 percent.
	   Asian negatives would drag Australian growth down below average,
to 2.3 percent in the fiscal year to June 30, 2000, Access
predicted.
	   Access Economics is an organization of academics and economic
professionals, independent of government, which makes forecasts on
a national and state level, and sells the work for profit.
	   Its forecasts are generally watched by the government and
markets.
	   Treasurer Peter Costello said Australia would be affected by a
slowdown in growth or a recession across the world next year.
	   ``We will be affected by the world, unquestionably,'' he told
reporters. ``The world has already clipped our growth.''
	   He said the domestic economy had been ``exceptionally strong.''

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Citing the Kosovo crisis and NATO
threats of intervention, the Serbian government on Friday put into
effect a harsh decree tightening state control over companies and
independent media.
	   The decree, announced earlier this week, broadens government
authority and envisions punishment for companies, institutions and
individuals who act contrary to the government's view of patriotic
behavior.
	   The decree specifically bans local broadcasts of news programs
in the Serbian language produced abroad _ by the Voice of America,
Radio Free Europe, France Internationale, BBC and Deutsche Welle _
and relayed here on FM by independent electronic media.
	   Authorities have branded the programs as damaging, anti-Serb
propaganda, masterminded in the West to help Serbia's ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo province to secede.
	   The decree includes strict orders to companies that produce
consumer goods, especially food, not to deliberately cause
shortages, price hikes or otherwise manipulate with the goods.
	   But the most striking part of the document concerns media.
	   ``Media outlets ... must not spread defeatism and act contrary
to national unity and to our state interests,'' read the decree
published Friday. Those who disobey will be fined or shut down.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe assailed
the moves as amounting to ``a declaration of war against the
independent media.''
	   ``The current behavior by the Belgrade government is appalling
and is very much in line with its previous decisions not to allow
certain journalists to enter the country,'' the OSCE's
representative on freedom of the media, Freimut Duve, said in a
statement in Vienna on Friday.
	   President Slobodan Milosevic, in control of the governments of
Yugoslavia and of its constituent republic, Serbia, has been trying
to suppress media critical of him and preserve the domination of
state-run media.
	   Serbian Information Minister Aleksandar Vucic, member of the
ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, has blasted independent
media at home and some foreign reporters for allegedly presenting
the Kosovo crisis with a bias in favor of ethnic Albanian
separatists.
	   Serbia's Association of Independent Electronic Media has
protested the decree as ``the gravest form of state censorship,''
but advised its members to obey to avoid ``retaliation and
lynching.''
	   The association and other Milosevic opponents appealed earlier
against NATO strikes, saying they would only aggravate the
situation and give Milosevic a pretext for even stronger crackdowns
on opponents.
	   Late Thursday, Belgrade's popular Index Radio was suddenly
evicted from premises it had rented for years from a state-run
radio. The independent station was also cut off from using a
state-owned transmitter to broadcast its program, but was looking
for an alternative to continue working.
	   Its chief editor, Nenad Cekic, said the action was apparent
retaliation to his protests with the government that the latest
decree had no legal grounds.

Lawmakers reject homosexual rights bill

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with bill killed in surprise vote &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French lawmakers on Friday, in a surprise move,
swiftly rejected a controversial bill aimed at giving legal status
to unmarried couples, including homosexuals, in another setback in
a decade-long campaign to accord rights to those groups.
	   Howls echoed through the chamber following the hand vote to
declare the bill ``inadmissible,'' meaning lawmakers would not even
consider the text, sponsored by the Socialist Party of Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   The procedure means the bill _ which opponents fear will
undermine the traditional family _ need not even be examined.
	   The so-called Civil Solidarity Pact, or PACS, had been expected
to pass in the leftist-dominated National Assembly, despite a rough
ride, including up to 800 amendments that were expected to be filed
by the right.
	   But the centrist Union for French Democracy put the motion of
``inadmissibility'' on the floor, a move used to seek
acknowledgement that a text runs counter to the Constitution. Such
a procedure is rarely adopted.
	   It passed in this case in part because numerous Socialist
deputies failed to show up.
	   Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou said the government ``is fully
disposed to do the necessary so this text is discussed as soon as
possible.''
	   Hours earlier, the minister argued in favor of the bill.
	   It ``is not a sub-marriage, a clone or a quasi-marriage,''
Guigou told lawmakers. ``It is not a solemn act like marriage,''
she said.

Chechen official: British, New Zealand hostages alive; no ransom
</HEADLINE>
demands &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ No ransom demands have been made for three Britons
and a New Zealander kidnapped in Chechnya, but investigators
believe the hostages are alive and well, a top Chechen official
said Friday.
	   The hostages' whereabouts are unknown, but investigators believe
the captors are moving them from place to place, acting security
minister Aslambek Arsayev was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   Arsayev said he expects ransom demands to be made in about two
to three weeks.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped last
weekend. They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone
company, installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of its two-year war for independence from
Russia in 1996.
	   The most high-profile captive is Russian presidential envoy
Valentin Vlasov, who was kidnapped on May 1.
	   Chechnya's security forces launched a 10-day crackdown Thursday,
seeking to capture rebel armed groups and possibly find leads to
the hostages, Arsayev said.
	   Security forces intend to conduct a particularly thorough search
in Chechnya's mountainous regions, where hostages are usually held,
he said.

Citing financial losses, Pilot Pen gives up men's tournament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to CORRECT slug. &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIGITTE GREENBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ With attendance and sponsorship
falling far short of game point, organizers of the Pilot Pen
International tennis tournament said Thursday the men's portion of
the event has been sold for dlrs 1.7 million (U.S.) to a promoter
in Austria.
	   Tournament chairman Butch Buchholz said in a written statement
that financial losses for the past two years left the organization
with no other option. Investors have not reaped a penny, tournament
president Mike Davies said.
	   ``Our investors felt that they did not want to put more money
into this event because it was bleeding too badly,'' Davies said.
``We did not get the numbers right. We obviously spent more money
on the event than we took in in income. You don't have to go to
Yale to know that you're on a losing ticket if that keeps
happening.''
	   For the past eight years, the tournament has served as a warm-up
to the U.S. Open. But in addition to the financial losses, the
men's event also was facing scheduling problems. The ATP Tour
planned to shuffle the dates, making it less likely to draw
big-name players.
	   The selling price will allow the tournament to pay off its
debts, which amount to less than dlrs 2 million. Davies said that
when investors came on board in 1997, they expected losses, but no
more than about dlrs 500,000.
	   The men's tournament will go to Kitzbuhel, Austria, where a clay
court event was played this year from July 27-Aug. 2.
	   The women's event, planned for Aug. 23-28, will now take center
court. Davies said putting on both a men's and women's event cost
dlrs 6 million, but that it would only cost about dlrs 2 million to
play host to the women alone.
	   Besides, the women's event drew higher attendance this year.
	   ``We are bullish about the women's event making it,'' Davies
said. ``We certainly think that the public and the community
supports women's tennis. Women's tennis is very, very hot
worldwide. There's great demand for tournaments on the women's game
right now.''

Sensing their chance, Germany's female politicians push for more
</HEADLINE>
power &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Emboldened by the prospect of a
center-left coalition that has generous quotas for women, female
politicians across Germany are demanding more power.
	   The Association for Social Democratic women met Friday to
coordinate their demands from their party's coalition talks with
the smaller environmental Greens party that are expected to end
next week.
	   The Social Democrats already has an official quota: 40 percent
of government and party positions are earmarked for women. Combined
with the Greens' 50 percent quota, women could expect to secure
more posts than any in the new government headed by
chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder _ theoretically anyway.
	   The outgoing Christian Democratic-led government includes just
two women among the 15 Cabinet ministers.
	   Despite their quotas, many women in the Greens and Social
Democrats fear their parties won't deliver. For many women, their
goal is simply to implement the quota in the new government.
	   ``Gerhard Schroeder owes his election victory to a great extent
to women. He owes them a new politics, and the corresponding
representation in the government,'' said the chairwoman of the
Social Democratic women's association, Karin Junker.
	   The Greens _ headed by female and male co-chairs _ are grappling
with their strictly enforced quota in discussions about future
Cabinet posts. They are likely to get three, making it impossible
for the 50-50 split provided in their bylaws. Greens leader Joschka
Fisher is considered the likely foreign minister, while another
spokesman Juergen Trittin is expected to get the environmental
ministry.
	   ``In no way are there enough women in power,'' said Marion
Boeker, speaker for the Greens on women's issues.
	   ``We want to make the political structures more friendly, less
male-oriented, with fewer meetings late at night or in a corner of
some bar,'' said Boeker. That kind of thing tends to shut out
politicians who are also mothers, she says. ``We want to bring a
different tone to politics.''
	   Women in the Social Democratic Party also are exerting their
influence. They say they will only accept a male candidate for the
national presidency, a largely ceremonial position, if a woman is
named president of the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag.
	   At least one woman has already stepped forward for the job:
Christel Hanewinckel.
	   ``It's high time to make clear to the SPD that women must get
the 40 percent quota of powerful positions that the party has said
they should,'' she told the Thueringer Allegemeine newspaper this
week.
	   The outgoing president of the Bundestag _ a woman _ is also
calling on her Christian Democrats to improve their record for
promoting female members. She's calling for a woman to succeed
outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl as head of the party.
	   ``It's overdue, and needs no further explanation,'' insisted
Rita Suessmuth.

Greece orders Patriot missiles in boost for U.S. arms maker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: FIXES typo in Crotale in 6th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece will buy the U.S.-made Patriot
missile defense system as part of a mammoth arms build up designed
to keep pace with rival Turkish forces, officials said Friday.
	   The estimated dlrs 1.2 billion contract _ the first major
decision since the five-year arms purchase plan was announced last
year _ was an important victory for the U.S. defense industry, the
main arms supplier for Greece.
	   Raytheon Corp., the makers of the Patriot system, was in close
competition with Russia's S-300 anti-aircraft missiles for the
Greek contract. Russia's defense minister, Marshal Igor Sergeyev,
visited Athens this week during a major defense industry trade
show.
	   Greece and Turkey have become increasingly important customers
for arms builders struggling with shrinking defense budgets in many
other countries. Raytheon announced Monday it will eliminate 14,000
jobs across the United States over the next two years.
	   Raytheon's aircraft division, Raytheon Aircraft Co., also
received a welcome boost from Greece: a dlrs 200 million contract
for 45 T-6A training aircraft.
	   Greek officials also announced plans to buy 33 Crotale
short-range anti-aircraft missiles by France's Thomson-CSF at a
total price tag of dlrs 685 million and 10 Canadair fire-fighting
aircraft for dlrs 440 million.

Germ-warfare talks look set to drag beyond next year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Despite a growing sense of urgency and U.S.
pressure to push forward, talks to finally give meaning to a global
ban on biological weapons could drag into the year 2000, the
chairman of the negotiations said Friday.
	   ``Compared to some expectations, it is not definite that we can
really conclude the negotiations in 1999,'' said the chairman,
Tibor Toth of Hungary.
	   He was referring to remarks by John Holum, U.S. acting
undersecretary of state for arms control, who said earlier this
week that prospects were good for an accord by the end of next
year.
	   The United States has been trying to pick up the pace of
negotiations aimed at putting teeth in the 1972 Biological Weapons
Convention.
	   Holum said the improvement is needed as soon as possible because
there is increasing danger that some rogue country will use
biologial weapons.
	   The convention, ratified by some 140 nations including Iran and
Libya, is little more than a pledge not to develop or stockpile
biological weapons without any provisions to catch or punish those
who do.
	   The negotiators, who have been meeting since 1994, are trying to
add to the pact some of the verification features of the chemical
weapons treaty, adopted after the Gulf War under the specter of
Iraq's arsenal of poison gas.
	   Among the most contentious issues is how to devise a way of
forcing countries to comply with the agreement, Toth said.
	   But negotiators seem agreed on the need for on-site inspections
where there is a suspicious outbreak of disease or a credible
allegation of possession of illegal material, he said.
	   Toth added that he expected agreement on the definition of the
biological material to be covered by the accord, although there
were still problems with the ``substantial and complicated'' issue.
	   The convention was approved during the height of the Cold War
when no one seriously thought germ warfare possible. Second
thoughts resulted from the Gulf War.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton has made a better treaty a top
priority. Chinese President Jiang Zemin joined him last June in
backing the effort.
	   The countries most often cited as having possible biological
weapons programs include Iran, Iraq, Libya and Israel.
	   Also on the list of suspected countries are Syria, North Korea,
Taiwan, Egypt, Vietnam, India, South Korea, China, Russia, Laos,
Cuba, Bulgaria and South Africa.

Aziz tells French he wants to keep talking with U.N.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ On his way back to Baghdad Friday after 10 days of
U.N. talks, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Iraq wants
to pursue its dialogue with the United Nations to resolve the
weapons inspection crisis.
	   In a meeting with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, Aziz
reported on his talks with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
during which the two sides failed to reach an agreement on resuming
spot searches of suspected weapons sites in Iraq.
	   Aziz ``reaffirmed the Iraqi desire to pursue a dialogue with the
secretary-general with the aim of beginning as quickly as
possible'' a Security Council review of Iraq's efforts to disarm
itself, said Anne Gazeau-Secret, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.
	   That review would come in exchange for Iraq's resuming
cooperation with weapons inspectors.
	   The review ``cannot take place without Iraq's annulling its Aug.
5 decision'' to stop cooperating with the inspections,
Gazeau-Secret said, reiterating the French position. ``It is an
indisputable condition for any progress.''
	   Iraq said Aug. 5 it was ending cooperation with the U.N. weapons
teams because their chief, Richard Butler, refused to certify that
Iraq had destroyed its banned weapons. The move ended spot
inspections of suspected weapons sites.
	   In their meeting Friday, Vedrine told Aziz of France's request,
made Thursday to the U.N. commission investigating Iraq's weapons,
for a meeting to determine whether nerve gas has been found on
Iraqi warheads.
	   A French official on Thursday angrily denied a published report
that experts at a French lab detected traces of the nerve gas VX on
Iraqi warheads _ and that France withheld the findings, not wanting
to undermine Baghdad's attempts to get U.N. sanctions lifted.
	   France called for the U.N. meeting to clarify the situation.
	   The U.N. Special Commission had already been planning a meeting
of weapons experts Oct. 22-23 to discuss the French results and a
similar group of tests from an American lab. Inspectors may move up
the date.
	   The French official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the French tests found no nerve gas, and that such a meeting would
show that.

Holbrooke holds new talks with Milosevic while NATO presses ahead

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke tried
to wring concessions out of a defiant Slobodan Milosevic on Friday,
holding new talks aimed at getting him to comply with international
demands on Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.
	   While top Western officials declined to call it Milosevic's last
chance to avoid attack, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
had warned in dispatching Holbrooke back to Belgrade that ``time is
all but gone'' for a peaceful settlement.
	   Divisions remained among the 16 NATO allies on the use of force,
however. Germany and Italy, among others, are reluctant to proceed
without a stronger legal basis for action.
	   Alliance ambassadors failed at a meeting in Brussels on Friday
to pressure Russia into dropping its opposition to airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke, who arrived from London where he met with officials
of the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans, said Friday that
movement toward authorizing the use of force by NATO continues ``in
a sustained and intense manner.''
	   ``The situation remains just as serious at it has been before,''
he said shortly before the start of his fourth meeting with
Milosevic in five days. There was no indication how long the talks
would last, or whether Holbrooke would stay into the weekend.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and upwards of 300,000
driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb.
28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is
fighting for independence from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by KLA ``terrorists.''
	   There was no sign he was ready for concessions.
	   The Serbian government, effectively under his control, put into
effect Friday a harsh decree tightening state control over
companies and independent media and banning the rebroadcast of
foreign news broadcasts in Serbian.
	   The decree, announced earlier this week, broadens government
authority and institutes punishment for behavior deemed
anti-patriotic.

	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenyan teachers stayed off the job for a
fifth day Friday, angered by the government's failure to give
raises promised last year when they went on strike before general
elections.
	   President Daniel arap Moi agreed to pay increases of up to 200
percent over five years, but now says the government doesn't have
enough money.
	   Education Minister Kalonzo Musyoka says if the raises agreed on
last year were put into effect, 80 percent of his ministry's
1998-99 budget of 44 billion shillings (dlrs 733 million) would go
to pay salaries.
	   In Nairobi, police patrolled the Kenya National Union of
Teachers headquarters to prevent the teachers from meeting to map
out strike strategy.
	   The strike by about 260,000 teachers has idled 7 million
students in primary and secondary school students.
	   Examinations scheduled to begin this week in some schools were
disrupted. The government has said it will deploy police to
supervise national examinations scheduled to begin Oct. 21.
	   -----
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ An outbreak of African swine fever in
Nigeria's southeastern Benin state has killed at least 60,000 pigs
and forced several farmers out of business, according to news
reports.
	   Some farmers, mostly retired civil servants, have had to pull
their children out of school since they can't pay the tuition, the
News Agency of Nigeria reported on Friday.
	   The outbreak which began in August will cost about dlrs 1.2
million to contain, Benin State authorities said.
	   After the mass slaughter and burial of the diseased pigs, the
government will help the farmers re-stock their farms with
disease-resistant animals, state veterinary authorities said
	   ----
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Illegal immigrants and foreigners
working in Sierra Leone without proper permits may be deported and
their businesses shut down beginning next week, the labor ministry
announced.
	   The warning came in a statement issued Thursday by Labor
Minister Thaimu Bangura that warned local businesses not to employ
illegal immigrants.
	   The new directives are aimed at Lebanese and Indian expatriates
who dominate the commercial and industrial sectors in this small
West African country.
	   Many Lebanese businessmen fled the country after a May 1997
military coup, but many have returned after Sierra Leone's elected
government was restored.
	   Previous governments were generally relaxed over work permits,
allowing many foreigners to work without any formal requirements.
	   -----
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The army banned flights over Uganda's two
main cities, citing threats from Sudan, a newspaper said Friday.
	   All commercial, charter and scheduled flights have been banned
over Kampala and the industrial city of Jinja, 80 kilometers (50
miles) to the east, the independent Monitor said.
	   ``There is a growing violation of our airspace ... from Sudan,''
army Cmdr. Jeje Odongo was quoted as saying. ``Any airplane that
comes within the no-fly area must consider itself a possible
target.''
	   A Sudanese warplane bombed two northern Ugandan towns on Oct. 3
in an apparent attack aimed at Sudanese refugees camped in the
area. Six Ugandans were wounded.
	   Eagle Aviation confirmed receiving a directive from Civil
Aviation Authority banning flights over Jinja and Kampala.
	   ``This was due to security reasons,'' a spokesman said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   No officials could be reached for comment.
	   Sudan last month renewed accusations that Uganda is sending
troops to support Sudanese rebels in the south in their 15-year
civil war against the Islamic-led Sudanese government.
	   Uganda broke diplomatic relations with Sudan in 1995, and blames
Sudan for sheltering and arming rebels fighting in northern Uganda.
	   -----
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ The Zambian government Thursday denied
reports that it met Congolese rebels trying to unseat President
Laurent Kabila's government, calling the items ``a deliberate
fabrication intended to tarnish Zambia's image''.
	   It said the newspaper reports that the rebel delegation met
President Frederick Chiluba and his defense chiefs with the aim of
setting up Zambian bases were ``an insinuation from the gullible
and unpatriotic local press''.
	   The government statement confirmed that a rebel delegation had
met Southern African Development Community Secretary General Kaire
Mbuende in Lusaka.
	   The 14-nation SADC has been trying for months to negotiate a
settlement in the Congolese civil war that broke out in August.
	   ----
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ A French scientist proposed better
cooperation with French islands in the Indian Ocean to improve
protection of the endangered sea turtle.
	   The sea turtle population in the Mozambique Channel _ the strip
of water along Mozambique's 2,500 kilometer (1,550 mile) coastline
_ had declined by 95 percent over the last century, said Francois
Rene on Thursday.
	   Rene belongs to a team of scientists invited by Mozambique to
research the turtle problem, the Mozambique News Agency reported.
	   Rene said better cooperation with French-speaking islands, such
as Comoros and Seychelles, could lead to better inspection and
protection policies. Mozambique maritime authorities say they do
not have the resources to patrol the coastline.
	   ``People dwelling along the coast continue consuming turtle eggs
besides capturing the adult animals,'' said Rene.

EU takes Greece to court for failing to protect turtles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS location of Greek island, possible fines &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Friday it
was taking Greece to court for failing to protect rare
Mediterranean sea turtles which lay their eggs on the island of
Zakynthos.
	   In a statement, the European Union executive body said the Greek
government had infringed EU laws on protection of natural habitats
by allowing ``disturbances due to tourist-related activities'' on
beaches favored by the turtles.
	   The Ionian island of Zakynthos lies some, 290 kilometers (181
miles) northwest of Athens.
	   In a separate case, the Commission said it was taking Greece to
the European Court of Justice for not introducing tougher penalties
for smugglers trading in rare animals and plants.
	   The Commission also said it was also lodging a complaint at the
EU high court against Germany for not setting up enough protected
areas for wild birds.
	   If the European Court finds against them, the two countries will
be told to fully implement EU rules or face fines.

Catholic church launches inquiry to distance itself from doomsday
</HEADLINE>
order &QL; 
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Catholic Church has launched an
inquiry into a renegade order that claims it receives messages
direct from the Virgin Mary, including one that the Hale-Bopp comet
was going to bring the end of the world in June this year.
	   Church spokesman Father Brian Lucas said Friday it wants to test
the claims of the Order of St. Charbel at a formal inquiry so it
can distance itself from the order and its leader, know only as Mr.
Kamm, or ``Little Pebble.''
	   The order has existed on the south coast of New South Wales
state for more than 15 years, and claims it has regularly received
personal visits from the Virgin Mary, St. Michael and St. Joseph.
	   Richard Williams, a spokesman for the order, said Friday that
the order had received direct messages from heaven including
warnings that a tidal wave will destroy villages along part of
Australia's east coast, that the world will end before the end of
1999, and that Kamm will become the next pope.
	   Williams denied an ex-member's reported claim that Kamm ordered
the digging of graves in preparation for a mass suicide.
	   Lucas said the Bishop of Wollongong, the Rev. Philip Wilson,
would establish a commission of experts in theology and canon law
to investigate the order.
	   Such an inquiry was rare and would be conducted under procedures
established by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in
Rome, he said.
	   Lucas said Wilson did not consider Kamm's visions authentic or
that the activities of the order were consistent with Catholic
practice.
	   The inquiry would allow the church to make a ``definitive
statement to Catholics and the public generally'' that church did
not support the cult.
	   The sect, which claims to have bases in four states, was the
subject of a police investigation last year into its finances and
alleged criminal law breaches. It is believed no charges were laid.
	   Williams said the order's predictions were based on personal
visits from saints.
	   ``We get public messages at least twice a month, from the Virgin
Mary or our lord or from saints that come and visit,'' Williams
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   He said the messages warned that people must atone for their
sins or they would be destroyed on Judgment Day, which would occur
sometime before the end of next year.
	   Williams confirmed that Kamm had predicted that the world would
end in June this year after a comet plunged into the sun.
	   Asked to explain why it didn't happen, Williams said: ``It's the
Hale-Bopp comet, and the Virgin Mary gave us a date but not the
year, just the day and the month.
	   ``Heaven never tells us the whole story.''
	   The 39 members of the Heaven's Gate cult committed mass suicide
in March 1997 after leader Marshall Herff Applewhite instructed his
followers to shed their earthly ``containers'' to catch a ride on a
UFO trailing the Hale-Bopp comet.

Medical group says NATO plans threaten aid operation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Doctors Without Borders will likely
pull its medical teams from Kosovo if NATO launches air strikes
because of fears of Serb reprisal attacks, the aid agency said
Friday.
	   ``We would like to remain in Kosovo until the last minute but we
probably will pull all our people out if there are air strikes,''
Victor Janssens, the agency's director of operations, told a news
conference.
	   Rather than air raids, foreign countries should urgently deploy
a ``huge, physical international presence'' to protect Kovoso
civilians, he said.
	   The group has three mobile medical teams in Kosovo. Each team
includes three local doctors, three nurses and two drivers.
	   Janssens said that in the short term at least, air strikes will
deprive civilians of humanitarian support, because of worries that
Serb forces will target foreign aid workers in retaliation.
	   Keith Ursel, a nurse returning after three months in Kosovo with
Doctors Without Borders cited reports of Serb forces targeting
ethnic Albanian medical personal.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and upwards of 300,000
driven from their homes since Feb. 28 when Yugoslavia launched a
crackdown against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting for independence from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.

Greece will not participate in NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greek forces will not participate in any
possible NATO military intervention against Yugoslavia over Kosovo,
the government said Friday.
	   ``Our decision is to not become involved by offering Greek
forces, aircraft,'' government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said. ``We
believe the use of military violence does not constitute the best
solution for dealing with the crisis.''
	   If NATO does decide in favor of military action, ``it will use
NATO installations in Greece,'' Premier Costas Simitis said after a
defense and foreign affairs council meeting.
	   ``There will not be, by Greece, any other arrangement or
facilitation,'' Simitis added.
	   Greece, like other Balkan countries, is worried that any
escalation of violence in the predominantly Albanian populated Serb
province could lead to the conflict spilling over Yugoslav borders
into neighboring countries.
	   ``We are very concerned and cautious about the effectiveness of
a choice which leads unavoidably to the undertaking of military
action,'' Reppas said.
	   But if NATO does decide in favor of airstrikes, Greece ``will
not prevent such a development by exercising its veto right,'' he
added.
	   Greek officials have repeatedly expressed the belief that a
solution to the Kosovo crisis can be found through negotiations.
	   ``Our belief is that the limits of dialogue must be exhausted,
and we believe that there are still such limits,'' Reppas said.
	   A decision on intervention may be taken over the weekend,
Simitis noted, while further discussions will be held on Monday and
Tuesday.
	   ``We hope these efforts are fruitful,'' he said.
	   But in an indication that Greece considers military intervention
to be increasingly likely, the government issued a travel advisory
warning its citizens against visiting Yugoslavia.
	   Reppas also called on Greeks living in Yugoslavia to examine
whether ``they must remain there or not, if there is not a very
special and important reason, in view of any possibility during the
next few days.''

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The aid agency Doctors Without Borders
on Friday warned that fears of Serb reprisal attacks would likely
force it to pull its medical teams from Kosovo if NATO launches air
strikes.
	   ``We would like to remain in Kosovo until the last minute but we
probably will pull all our people out if there are air strikes,''
said the agency's director of operations Victor Janssens.
	   He told a news conference that rather than air raids, foreign
countries should urgently deploy a ``huge, physical international
presence'' to protect Kovoso civilians.
	   Janssens said that in the short term at least, air strikes will
deprive civilians of the humanitarian support, because of worries
that Serb forces will target foreign aid workers in retaliation.
	   ``There is a large spectrum of options in between what we have
now and air strikes,'' he said.
	   He warned that tens of thousands of Kosovo civilians already
living in difficult conditions could die if they don't get shelter
for the winter.
	   ``Even if they escape the rest, nature will do its work,'' he
said.
	   Keith Ursel, a nurse returning after three months in Kosovo with
Doctors Without Borders said at least 200,000 people are displaced,
including 40,000-50,000 living rough in forests.
	   Ursel said one of the biggest problems he encountered is that
women are often forced to give birth on the move in precarious
conditions. ``These are women who are used to European medicine and
pre-natal care,'' he said.
	   Ursel cited reports of ethnic Albanian medical personal being
targeted by Serb forces, including a doctor named Lec Ukaj who, he
said, was tortured and killed by Serb troops on Sept. 25.
	   Doctors Without Borders has three mobile medical teams in
Kosovo. Each team includes three local doctors, three nurses and
two drivers.

EU jobless rate holds steady at 10 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Unemployment in the European Union held
steady at 10 percent in August, unchanged from the previous month,
according to figures released Friday by the EU's statistics office.
	   The EU rate compares with 4.7 percent in the United States and
4.2 percent in Japan.
	   Eurostat's data showed 16.8 million citizens were out of work
across the 15-nation bloc.
	   Year-on-year figures showed a decline in the unemployment level
from 10.6 percent in August, 1997, and 10.9 in August, 1996.
	   The average jobless rate in the 11 countries adopting the euro
as their common currency on Jan. 1 was 11.1 percent, unchanged
since June.
	   Luxembourg had the lowest rate in the EU with 2.2 percent, Spain
the highest with 18.7 percent.
	   Eurostat gave the following seasonally adjusted jobless rates
for August 1998 with August 1997 rates in brackets:
	   Luxembourg, 2.2 percent (2.6); Austria, 4.5 (4.4); Portugal, 6.2
(6.8); Sweden, 8.2 (9.6); Belgium, 8.9 (9.2); Ireland, 9 (10);
Germany, 9.6 (10.1); France, 11.9 (12.4); Finland, 11.5 (12.5);
Spain, 18.7 (20.7).
	   August 1998 figures were unavailable for Greece, Italy and the
Netherlands, Denmark and Britain.
	   Latest figures from Eurostat showed Denmark with 4.6 percent and
the Netherlands with 4.8 percent and Italy with 12.3 percent in
July; Britain with 6.2 percent in June. Eurostat gave no data for
Greece.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke tried
to wring concessions out of a defiant Slobodan Milosevic on Friday,
holding new talks aimed at getting him to comply with international
demands on Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.
	   While top Western officials declined to call it Milosevic's last
chance to avoid attack, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
had warned in dispatching Holbrooke back to Belgrade that ``time is
all but gone'' for a peaceful settlement.
	   Sources close to the talks said Holbrooke left the meeting after
three hours for ``consultations'' at the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade.

Experts: Thai government must go to court on rice trademark issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand must prove that its rice
export sales have been damaged if it hopes to get a court to stop a
U.S. company from using a disputed trademark, a U.S. lawyer and a
Thai scholar said Friday.
	   Their opinions were offered during a satellite video conference
on a Thai-U.S. rice dispute organized by the U.S. Information
Service in Bangkok.
	   The Thai government is considering asking the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office to revoke a trademark held by the Alvin,
Texas-based company RiceTec.
	   It accuses the company of using the brand name ``Jasmati'' to
purposely mislead consumers into believing that its rice is a cross
between Thai jasmine rice and the basmati variety, grown in India
and Pakistan.
	   Jasmine rice, also known as fragrant rice, is one of the top
qualities of rice available on the export market. Thailand, the
world's largest rice exporter, shipped out 5.3 million tons of rice
in 1997, of which 25 percent was jasmine rice. The United States is
one of the top three markets for Thai jasmine rice.
	   Attorney Lynn Beresford in the United States said that
``Jasmati'' is not a rice strain developed from Thai jasmine rice,
so the U.S. trademark office cannot force RiceTec to withdraw the
name.
	   ``If Thailand want the company to cancel this trademark,
Thailand has to sue in U.S. court and prove that Thai rice exports
were damaged from the company's selling of rice under the `Jasmati'
trademark,'' said Beresford, an adviser to the office of
legislative and international affairs of the U.S. patent office.
	   RiceTec says it registered the ``Jasmati'' trademark in 1993 for
a long-grain hybrid rice developed in the early 1990s and milled by
a patented process.
	   Dr. Lerson Tanasugarn, director of the Office of Intellectual
Property Policy Research of the Intellectual Property Institute of
Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University, also said Thailand has to prove
in court that U.S. consumers are being misled, and that Thai rice
sales are hurt as a result of ``unfair competition.''
	   Scott Sindelar of the U.S. Embassy's Foreign Agriculture Service
said Thai rice exports seem not to have been affected by sales of
``Jasmati' rice.
	   According to Thai Customs Department figures, Thai jasmine rice
exports to the United States in 1997 totaled 197,583 metric tons,
up from 167,553 tons in 1993, when RiceTec registered the
``Jasmati'' trademark.
	   Thailand's rice exports to the United States totaled 217,700
tons in 1997, up from 209,813 tons in 1996, according to the
customs department's figure.
	   Lerson said, however, that RiceTec is going to expand its rice
exports to others countries, and has already registered its Jasmati
trademark in Britain, posing a new potential threat to Thai rice
exports.

Portuguese central bank cuts benchmark interest rate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The Bank of Portugal, the country's
central bank, clipped its benchmark interest rate by half a point
to 4 percent Friday.
	   The move came after the central bank of neighboring Spain, with
which Portugal has close trade ties, cropped its rate by the same
amount, to 3.75 percent, on Tuesday.
	   The drop also moves Portugal closer to the 3.3 percent level it
must meet for participation in the new European single currency
being launched next year.
	   The Bank of Portugal last altered its benchmark rate on May 11
when it cut the so-called repo rate to 4.5 percent from 4.7
percent.

No links between Afghans in Kashmir and Osama bin Laden, army chief
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _Afghan volunteers are fighting in India's
troubled Kashmir, but they had no apparent link with Saudi renegade
Osama bin Laden, the army commander said Friday.
	   ``The Pakistan army is playing a major role in militancy in
Kashmir,'' General Ved Prakash Malik told reporters in Srinagar,
the summer capital of India's Jammu-Kashmir state.
	   But there was ``no linkage between Afghan militants operating in
Kashmir and Bin Laden,'' he said.
	   Malik's comments came less than a week after a British newspaper
claimed Afghanistan-based Bin Laden was mobilizing Aghan militants
to fight in Kashmir. The United States accuses Bin Laden of
financing terrorist strikes against U.S. targets around the world,
	   Islamic militants have been fighting a secessionist war in
India-controlled Kashmir since 1989 that has left more than 15,000
people dead.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars for control of Kashmir
in the past 50 years.
	   Malik accused Pakistan of arming and training Muslim
militants.''We shall not permit proxy war on our soil by the
militants.''
	   Pakistan denies India's charge and says it merely provides moral
and political support to the insurgency.
	   The army chief also said tension on the Afghanistan-Iran border
was a matter of concern for all countries in the region.

Greek alpinist missing in Himalayas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ A Greek climber was reported missing on
the slopes of Mt. Dhaulagiri in the Himalayas and another was
rescued by a helicopter Friday, the tourism ministry said.
	   Charalampos Tsoupras, 36, of Peristeri, was last seen at Camp
Three at 7,550 meters (24,915 feet) on Oct. 2 and was feared lost
in a snow storm, the ministry said.
	   A rescue helicopter picked up his colleague, Pavlos Tsiantos,
30, of Larissa, from the base camp. Tsiantos also was injured in
the snow storm.
	   The Dhaulagiri Hellenic Alpine Club of Athens decided to abandon
the expedition to 8,167 meters (26,950 feet) high Mt. Dhaulagiri,
the seventh tallest Himalayan peak.
	   Tsoupras was the first casualty of the autumn mountaineering
season that began Sept. 1 and will end next month.

APEC ministers open meeting on investment in new energy sources
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new energy forecast, grafs 8-9 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GINOWAN, Japan (AP) _ Energy ministers from countries along the
Pacific discussed Friday how to sustain investment in new energy
despite Asia's economic ills.
	   Officials said a major issue at the two-day Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation ministerial meeting on energy will be how to
prevent a decline in private investment in the power industry.
	   The 18 nations in Asia, the Pacific and North and South America
that make up APEC already consume more than half the world's
energy.
	   Ahead of the meeting, being held on the Japanese island of
Okinawa, business groups urged the ministers to guarantee recent
market-opening moves won't be reversed as Asian nations struggle
with rising unemployment and bankruptcies.
	   ``Ministers should ensure liberalization measures don't slow
down as a result of the (crisis in the) Asian economy, and some
prudence may be required in their implementation,'' said the Asia
Pacific Energy Research Center, an industry group.
	   The group said APEC should further eliminate barriers to
investment and competition as a way to encourage more money to flow
into new energy projects.
	   It warned that new power production will likely fail to keep up
with the Pacific region's growing appetite for energy. Consumption
will increase even with the recent economic turmoil, it predicted.
	   Net oil imports in APEC economies are projected to jump 65
percent by 2010 from 1995, up from a 45 percent increase in the
1980-1995 period, the group said in a new forecast later Friday.
	   Oil production is projected to increase 12 percent in 2010 from
1995, it said. The fastest growth will take place in the Oceania
region, and the U.S. share is expected to decline over the forecast
period, the group added.
	   Acknowledging that Vietnam badly needs foreign investment in the
power sector, Vu Van Thai, deputy director general at Vietnam's
APEC Energy Office, said his government must sort out the optimum
solution for domestic consumers. Vietnam's Ministry of Industry is
working to complete a new electricity code, including rules on
foreign investment, by the end of this year, he added.
	   Tran Ngoc Toan, vice president of the state-owned Vietnam Oil
and Gas Corp., also known as PetroVietnam, said some French and
U.S. companies are eyeing participation in Vietnam's dlrs 1.3
billion Dung Quat refinery project.
	   The Vietnamese company is expected to sign a contract soon with
Russia and welcomes other parties to join the project.
	   Previous APEC energy meetings have focused on how to build a
common regulatory framework that would allow energy and investment
to flow more freely between member countries.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Officials from Russia, Peru and Vietnam also attended as
observers.
	   At their first meeting two years ago, energy ministers agreed to
cut subsidies and price controls.

Vaccinations urged for Thai villagers who feasted on rabid dog
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ At least 30 people in a small village
in northeastern Thailand had to seek vaccinations after local
health officials found that a dog they had eaten had rabies, a Thai
newspaper reported Friday.
	   The officials told the newspaper Matichon that villagers in Khon
Kaen province, 390 kilometers (242 miles) northeast of Bangkok,
cooked the meat from a neighbor's dead dog.
	   The owner, meanwhile, sent the dog's head to local health
officials to discover why it had died.
	   After learning the dog was rabid, the officials rushed to the
village to urge anyone who ate its meat to report for rabies
vaccinations, the newspaper said.
	   The officials also vaccinated dogs living in the area in case
they had eaten the leftovers from what the men cooked, it reported.
	   Dog is recognized as a legitimate food among some Thais, though
it is more popular with rural people than city-dwellers.

Russia vs. France in key qualifier; England vs. Bulgaria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Russia, upset 3-2 by Ukraine last month as
qualifying for the 2000 European championship began, can't afford
to stumble again.
	   Trouble is, the opponent this time is World Cup champion France,
which was also humbled last month in a 1-1 draw with Iceland. And
Russia is nagged by injuries.
	   England will be another side trying to get out of trouble _ 2-1
losers to Sweden last month _ as 20 qualifying matches fill
Europe's soccer schedule on Saturday.
	   In Turkey, Germany unveils its new generation, and in Italy new
coach Dino Zoff is wondering when Alessandro Del Piero will score
again.
	   The pick of the 20 matches are:
	   _ Denmark vs. Wales
	   _ Italy vs. Switzerland
	   _ Turkey vs. Germany
	   _ Russia vs. France
	   _ England vs. Bulgaria
	   _ Portugal vs. Romania
	   In Group 4, new Russian coach Anatoly Byshovets has injuries to
strikers Igor Kolyvanov and Sergei Kiryakov and will probably field
Vladimir Beschastnykh and Oleg Teryokhin. Midfielders Andrei
Kanchelskis and Ilya Tsymbalar will also miss the match in Moscow's
Luzhniki stadium.
	   ``I am hoping for a positive result, our backs are to the wall
and that is why we will play to win,'' Byshovets said.
	   For France, new coach Roger Lemerre gets midfielder Emmanuel
Petit back after missing the Iceland match with illness. Defenders
Laurant Blanc and Marcel Desailly return from suspension.
	   In Group 1, Italy comes off a 2-0 win over Wales with new coach
Dino Zoff needing to replace two injured regulars against
Switzerland: goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi and forward Christian Vieri.
AC Parma's 20-year-old Gianluigi Buffon is likely to be in goal
with Alessandro Del Piero and Filippo Inzaghi teaming up front.
	   Del Piero is mired in a career-slump with only one goal in 16
games for Juventus and the national side.
	   ``Based on what they expect from me, people say that I am not at
my best,'' Del Piero said. ``It's normal that people would be
waiting for me to score, given that it has been awhile. But
physically I'm fine.''
	   Swiss coach Gilbert Gress has called up Sebastien Jeanneret to
replace Murat Yakin. Striker Marco Grassi is also out with a thigh
injury.
	   In Group 3, Germany opens its qualifying in Turkey as new coach
Erich Ribbeck fields the new generation with 14 of the 22 with 10
caps or fewer. Strikers Oliver Bierhoff and Ulf Kirsten are ready
after injury worries. Among the likely new starters are: Lars
Ricken, 22, Carsten Ramelow, 24, libero Jens Novotny, 24,
midfielder Jens Jeremies, 24.
	   Ribbeck didn't mean to start such a young side but was forced to
by injuries and withdrawals by old names like Lothar Matthaeus,
Andy Moeller, Mario Basler and Stefan Effenberg.
	   In Group 5, England is smarting from a 2-1 loss to Sweden with
coach Glenn Hoddle wondering why strikers Alan Shearer and Michael
Owen have not jelled. ``It's going to take time to get it right and
we have been working at it on the training ground,'' Hoddle said.
	   Bulgaria, beaten by Poland 3-0 last month, is a shell of the
club that took fourth in the 1992 World Cup. Coach Hristo Bonev
resigned after this year's World Cup failure and new coach Dimitar
Dimitrov this week saw another veteran _ Luboslav Penev _ drop off
the team.
	   In Group 7, Portugal is fresh from a 3-1 win over Hungary. The
Portuguese are near full strength for the Romania match with
midfielder Paulo Sousa back from injury. The only worry is at right
back where Abel Xavier will probably fill in for injured Carlos
Secretario.
	   Elsewhere, Italian defender Paolo Maldini will play his 94th
national game, putting him in a tie for second all-time behind
former goalkeeper Zoff's 112 appearances.
	   Injured goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel is likely to miss Denmark's
game in Copenhagen against Wales, his first absence in 10 years.
Mogens Krogh is likely to start. Forward Mikkel Beck is also back
with Denmark after being left off the World Cup team.

More than 20,000 young Russians dodged semi-annual military draft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 20,000 young men dodged Russia's
semi-annual military draft this spring, and another 1,000 failed to
show up to be transported to their military units, a news agency
said Friday.
	   Prosecutors launched 690 criminal cases against draft-dodgers
this year, and 100 men have been sentenced, ITAR-Tass reported,
citing Russia's main military prosecutor's office.
	   Miserable living conditions and widespread hazing in Russia's
underfunded army causes many young men to avoid the draft. The
military, anxious for conscripts, often drafts people with serious
health problems, including mental disorders.
	   About 20 soldiers were dismissed from Russia's Strategic Missile
forces as mentally unstable during the past 18 months, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   Some 4,000 of the conscripts drafted this year required medical
treatment, the report said.
	   President Boris Yeltsin wants to create a leaner, professional
army in Russia, but little progress has been made.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Asian Football Confederation
has named Hidetoshi Nakata as Player of the Month for September.
	   The Japanese soccer player scored three goals in his first three
Serie A games.
	   Nakata, the current Asian Player of the Year, has made a huge
impact since his move to Italy's Perugia during the summer from the
Japan League team Bellmare Hiratsuka, the AFC said in a statement
Friday.
	   He scored twice in his side's 4-3 loss to Juventus in his league
debut at the start of the month. Two weeks later, the 21-year-old
Nakata scored in a 2-2 draw against Lazio.
	   Dalian coach Xue Genbao, who guided his team to its fourth
Chinese league title in his first year in charge of the team, has
been chosen Coach of the Month, the statement said.

French survivors tell tale of boat tragedy

 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LLORET DE MAR, Spain (AP) _ Sadness and anger were the mood
Friday for survivors of a pleasure boat tragedy in which 20 French
tourists drowned in a lake in northeastern Spain.
	   ``I don't really know what is going to happen now and I don't
really care,'' said Jean Loulier staring at his breakfast at the
tour group's hotel in this seaside resort.
	   Loulier, 70, like many of the 141 vacationing retirees who opted
for a boat trip around the nearby tranquil Lake Banyoles, had felt
lucky when he won a nearly free vacation package.
	   ``Most was free, but the excursions we paid, like the one
yesterday,'' said the widowed former schoolteacher whose female
traveling companion, who he did not identify, was a non-swimmer and
drowned.
	   The electric-powered catamaran was pulling away from its mooring
for a half hour trip over the mountain-surrounded lake, 565
kilometers (350 miles) northeast of Madrid, when its stern began to
sink. It went down fast.
	   Officials said overloading appeared the most likely cause, as
141 tickets were sold for a boat only authorized to carry 80
passengers.
	   Two owners of the boat, including the pilot, gave secret testify
Friday at a court hearing held by an investigative judge, who
released them without filing charges. The court said the
investigation will continue.
	   Police divers worked to bring the craft to shore, while the
search continued for two people authorities believe may have gone
on the doomed excursion but have yet to be accounted for.
	   ``Just greed, greed'' said one survivor who also raged about the
lack of consideration for the tourists in the wake of the tragedy.
	   ``I had to go to a public phone box to call my daughter,'' he
said before realizing he was talking to a reporter.
	   ``Journalist!'' he shouted, and began pushing this reporter out
of the hotel and ripping her notepad into shreds.
	   But some wanted to tell the story.
	   ``It was like the Titantic, the way it went down'' said Evelyn
Bengoechea, 52. She survived by grabbing a life preserver shaped
like a ring after her husband, who could swim, pushed her out of
the boat.
	   ``I want to thank the people who helped pull us out,'' she said.
	   Michel Evielle, 50, has been driving tourist buses for 17 years.
He was drinking coffee by the lakeside when the boat began to sink.
	   ``It went down in 30 seconds,'' he said, recalling how he helped
pull out the floundering passengers.
	   ``Some of those who could swim were carrying others who
couldn't, and then others would grab onto their backs.''
	   Meanwhile, French Tourism Minister Michelle Demessine visited
the 21 people remaining in hospital Friday and was to meet other
survivors at their hotel.
	   Two of the injured were said to be in serious condition, but the
remainder were expected to be allowed to travel back to France on
Friday.
	   Repatriation of the corpses was also set to begin later in the
day.

<TEXT>
	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ Ernie Els and defending titlist
South Africa slumped to Germany and Nick Price's Zimbabwe collapsed
alarmingly to France Friday as howling gales and heavy rain swept
across St. Andrews to create upsets in the Dunhill Cup.
	   Els, who was two up at the turn, lost to Sven Struver at the
second extra hole after they each carded 4-over 76s in atrocious
conditions at the home of golf.
	   That meant Germany won 2-1 after Thomas Gogele edged David Frost
at the second extra hole and South Africa's Retief Goosen had
downed Alex Cejka by one. They also were high scoring matches with
Frost and Gogele each scoring 78 and Goosen winning his match
despite a 76.
	   Price defied the conditions with a 2-under 70 to beat Frenchman
Olivier Edmond by eight strokes. But he was playing last and the
damage had already been done with Mark McNulty returning an 81 to
lose by 10 to Jean Van de Velde and Tony Johnstone throwing away a
5-stroke lead after 12 to lose by two to Thomas Levet.
	   Johnstone was still four ahead before he went to 14 and 15 and
triple bogeyed both. He finished with a 79 after an 8-over homeward
nine of 44.
	   McNulty hit trouble between 13 and 17 with four bogeys and a
double bogey for a 9-over round which had begun with a birdie.
	   Top seed United States and second seed Australia went out in
similar conditions befor the weather changed completely. The rain
stopped and the clouds disappeared as John Daly, Tiger Woods and
Mark O'Mears all built leads over their Japanese opponents.
	   After 13, Daly was one up on Nobuo Serizawa and Woods had a
6-stroke lead over Katsumasa Miyamoto while O'Meara was 2-up on
Hiroyuki Fujita after 12.
	   Australia gained its second 3-0 victory of the championship,
outplaying South Korea after crushing Argentina on Thursday.
	   First out for Australia, Craig Parry edged Shin Yong-jin at the
first extra hole after they had tied on 75. Stuart Appleby returned

FIFA, UEFA likely to start out-of-competition testing next year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associns are being
created that make it extremely tough to ensure optimal treatment
with just natural means,'' said Dr. Michel D'Hooghe, the head of
FIFA's and UEFA's medical committees.

<TEXT>
	   The world's top players play up to 80 matches a year, while the
maximimum they should play is about half that, according to Dr.
Lars Peterson, a FIFA medical committee member.
	   He said 35 games ``plus or minus five games or so'' were a
medical threshold.
	   At a sports medicine congress in Brugge, officials from FIFA
presented new data that showed that the steady increase in games is
pushing the injury rate ever higher.
	   ``I worry about the development in the game which imposes
ever-more physical strain on players. The result is ever more
cartilage injuries and an ever-bigger temptation to resort to
doping,'' D'Hooghe said in an interview with The Associated Press.
	   D'Hooghe proposed the out-of-competition testing after hearing
new reports on the use of sophisticated muscle-building anabolic
steroids that leave no trace in the body by the time the
competition starts.
	   He said his proposals had been well received by both FIFA and
UEFA and he expected testing to begin next year after receiving
official approval. Peterson already has been involved in testing in
his native Sweden.
	   ``It's very effective. It puts a lot of pressure on every player
to stay clean. Even in the off-season they are not safe,'' Peterson
said.
	   At present, random testing is left to local authorities and the
practice is rare. When players from the French World Cup squad were
submitted to an unannounced test by authorities early this year, it
created a storm of outrage. All tests were negative. The team was
tested again last week.
	   Soccer doping scandals started over the summer when AS Roma
coach Zdemek Zeman suggested that doping was widespread in Italy's
Serie A. Judicial investigators have been investigating his claim.
	   Zeman ``has pointed out something which is obviously not
right,'' said Dr. Jiri Dvorak, a FIFA medical committee member.
	   Four separate inquiries into the use of performance-enhancing
substances in Italian League soccer are underway, and investigators
reportedly have discovered that some tests were not complete and
results of others might have been hidden.
	   Doping will only worsen if the current trend to add more games
into an already overcrowded calendar continues, medical officials
said.
	   UEFA is considering expanding its European competitions further
in an attempt to answer the challenge of a European Super League,
which also would add more matches to the season for the top teams.

Banks vows drugs crackdown; IRFU reports three positive tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Sports Minister Tony Banks on Friday
promised a crackdown on drugs cheats as the Irish Rugby Football
Union confirmed three players tested positive for banned substances
last season.
	   Banks, speaking at the launch of the annual U.K. Sports
Council's anti-doping policy, committed his government to
increasing penalties and testing procedures to wipe out drugs in
sports.
	   He said Britain needed to introduce tougher policies and to look
carefully at anti-doping around the world to ``get rid off the gray
areas.''
	   ``But what we don't need is drugs being taken off any banned
list,'' he said.
	   Also on Friday, the IRFU said three players had failed doping
tests, but one had passed a subsequent test. Although the IRFU
didn't name the players or substances, reports indicated one player
had the anabolic steroid norandrosterone in his system and another
had excessive levels of the male hormone testosterone.
	   The Irish Rugby Union has been embroiled in a drugs controversy
this week after a former international admitted in a newspaper
article that Irish rugby players had been using banned drugs for 10
years.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Friday
his country's constructive partnership with China could only
benefit Hong Kong, but an opposition leader accused him of doing
too little for democracy.
	   Calling the capitalist territory's return to the communist
mainland 15 months ago a success, Blair defended the closer
relations he has engineered with China, saying Britain's trade and
investment dealings with the mainland must be allowed to thrive.
	   ``For Britain and China to be free to develop relations is in
the interest of Hong Kong,'' Blair told reporters.
	   But Martin Lee, leader of Hong Kong's major opposition
Democratic Party, accused Blair of shelving human rights and
democracy in favor of maintaining profitable trade and investment
links with the mainland.
	   ``This particular visit did not seem to produce the results we
expected,'' he said.
	   Lee noted that Hong Kong residents turned out in record numbers
in May to vote in the first legislative elections in Hong Kong
under Chinese rule. Pro-democracy candidates scored significant
victories.
	   ``It's a pity that despite the high voter turnout, no attempt
has been made to quicken the pace of democracy'' in the former
British colony, Lee said.
	   The human rights group Amnesty International also described
Blair's visit to China as a summit of ``missed opportunities.''
	   David Bull, director of Amnesty International in Britain, said
in a statement that the lack of substance in Blair's public
statements ``failed to respect the suffering of tens of thousands
of Chinese victims of human rights abuse.''
	   Blair, however, defended China's hands-off policy toward Hong
Kong, saying China has kept its side of the bargain and honored its
commitments to Britain.
	   He added that human rights issues such as freedom and dissent
were raised in his meetings with Chinese leaders.
	   ``We recognize that for the long-term future and stability, it
is good we have a relationship that is strong (and) based on
principle,'' Blair said.
	   Blair also urged nations in financial turmoil to ``keep their
nerve'' and hold fast to prudent fiscal policies, while
strengthening social safety nets for the poor.
	   Addressing a group of business leaders earlier, Blair said the
International Monetary Fund, World Bank and other agencies must
help strengthen social support systems, public health and education
in countries swept by a deepening financial crisis.
	   ``People have lost their jobs, their homes, their savings
because of a crisis that certainly had nothing to do with any
failings on their part,'' he added.
	   ``We must show that globalization has more to offer the poor
than insecurity.''
	   Blair arrived in former British colony Friday for a two-day
visit, the last stop on his China tour. The visit is his first
since he attended ceremonies in July 1997 when Britain returned
Hong Kong to Chinese rule.
	   In his address, Blair reiterated that China and Britain have
entered a new era, with much of the suspicion and bitterness over
Hong Kong in the past 156 years behind them.
	   ``The chill of the period before the Hong Kong handover has been
replaced by a genuine warmth and recognition that Britain and China
can be partners in the modern world,'' he said.
	   Although he praised Hong Kong's resilience amid the financial
crisis, Blair noted that Hong Kong ``has not been able to isolate
itself'' from the loss of confidence in global markets.
	   ``This turmoil in world markets has dramatically underscored the
interdependence of today's world economy,'' Blair said.
	   Blair quietly endorsed the Hong Kong government's support for
maintaining the 15-year-old currency peg to the U.S. dollar, saying
it ``underpinned stability and confidence.''
	   In August, the Hong Kong government came under fire when it
spent an estimated U.S. dlrs 15 billion in a stock-buying spree to
support falling share prices and keep speculators at bay.
	   ``I understand their decision. They need to safeguard the
long-term financial stability and economic success for Hong Kong,''
Blair wrote in a letter to Hong Kong newspapers.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese F-4 jet fighter carrying two pilots
disappeared late Friday in northern Japan after losing
communication with air traffic controllers, defense officials said.
	   The Air Self-Defense Forces plane disappeared over the Pacific
Ocean just off Misawa Air Base, about 560 kilometers (350 miles)
northeast of Tokyo, said a Defense Agency spokesman, speaking on
the customary condition of anonymity.
	   Rescue helicopters were searching for the plane, which was on
its way back to Misawa after flight training in Chitose on Japan's
northern main island of Hokkaido, the official said.
	   No other details were immediately available.

Conservatives end conference with attack on Labor's economic record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) _ The opposition Conservative Party
ended its annual conference Friday with a flurry of attacks on the
government's economic record, an issue the party intends to
spotlight as it seeks to rebuild support.
	   John Redwood, the party's trade spokesman, said the 0.25 percent
interest rate cut announced by the Bank of England came too late.
	   ``It will not suddenly stop the closures or rescue
manufacturing. The damage has been done by Labor's high interest
rate and high (pound) sterling stratagem,'' Redwood said.
	   Manufacturers and labor unions have been clamoring for a
reduction in interest rates and the value of the pound, which they
blame for making British goods less competitive in foreign markets.
	   The party's deputy chairman, Peter Lilley, said in his closing
speech that Treasury chief Gordon Brown had achieved half of his
stated goal of ending the cycles of ``boom and bust.''
	   ``Congratulations on ending the boom anyway,'' Lilley said,
adding: ``Growth is down under Gordon Brown.''
	   Brown announced Tuesday that economic growth in Britain would be
lower than he had forecast, but he did not disclose the latest
projection.
	   Conservative lawmaker Francis Maude said he believed Brown's
revised growth forecast could be a full percentage point lower than
the original range of 1.75 percent to 2.25 percent.
	   If so, Maude said, that would deprive the Treasury of 13 billion
pounds (dlrs 20 billion) in tax receipts, and put 127,000 people
out of work next year.
	   Redwood called on the government to take steps to protect jobs
including:
	   _ delaying the introduction of a national minimum wage.
	   _ reducing taxes on business.
	   _ making further cuts in interest rates.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's government last year surrendered the
power to set interest rates, and gave the Bank of England
independence to do so.
	   The Conservative Party was heavily defeated in the 1997 general
election, after 18 consecutive years in government, and opinion
polls have not detected any increase in support from the low levels
of a year ago.
	   During the conference, Conservative speakers repeatedly
highlighted the economy and the state of the National Health
Service as key issues in their attack on Blair.

Late press baron's son called to court over investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A son of the late press baron Robert Maxwell must
appear before a judge this month to answer for his lack of
cooperation with a government inquiry into his father's business
affairs.
	   Kevin Maxwell, who in 1996 was acquitted of defrauding
pensioners in his father's Mirror Group Newspapers, has been
summoned to appear in court Oct. 26, the Department of Trade and
Industry said Friday.
	   The government agency sought a writ for Maxwell's ``continued
non-cooperation'' with their inquiry after long-running
negotiations about the terms under which he would provide
assistance collapsed, the Evening Standard newspaper reported.
	   The Evening Standard said Maxwell had wanted the government to
pay for his legal representation during the inquiry and had also
sought immunity from future prosecution.
	   Robert Maxwell, whose publishing empire included the Daily
Mirror _ Britain's second-largest daily newspaper in circulation _
and the New York Daily News, died mysteriously at sea in November
1991.
	   After his death, discrepancies began to emerge in his financial
empire, including the removal of 22 million pounds (dlrs 37.4
million) from the Mirror Group pension fund to finance other parts
of his business network.
	   The current investigation concerns the 500 million pound (dlrs
850 million) stock market flotation of the Mirror Group in 1991 and
the role leading firms in London played in the share offer.
	   The paper quoted Kevin Maxwell as saying, ``I have absolutely
nothing to hide, but if you have been through a criminal trial like
I have, you just don't want to go through another one.''
	   If the judge rules against Maxwell, he could face contempt of
court proceedings if he continues to refuse to be interviewed by
investigators.

Lawmakers take giant step toward Islamic rule in Pakistan

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani lawmakers on Friday took a
giant step toward creating a new Islamic order in this economically
troubled nation of 140 million people.
	   The National Assembly, the powerful lower House of Parliament,
voted 151 to 16 to pass a constitutional amendment giving the
federal government sweeping powers to interpret and impose laws
based on interpretations of the Muslim holy book, the Koran.
	   ``I congratulate the nation on the passage of the bill which
will help create a truly Islamic system,'' said Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif in a speech following the vote.
	   Sharif had pushed for the law to defuse pressure from Islamic
hard-liners that began to mount after the U.S.-led economic
sanctions were imposed on Pakistan following its nuclear test in
May. The pressure increased after the United States bombed a
suspected terrorist training base in neighboring Afghanistan in
August. Sharif's right-wing opponents accused him of collusion in
the bombing raid.
	   Human rights groups and women activists have strongly condemned
the constitutional amendment warning it would embolden militant
members of rival Islamic sects and threaten the rights of women and
minorities.
	   Pakistan is 90 percent Muslim.
	   Pakistan's army, which maintains behind-the-scenes influence on
policy, remained silent in the debate over the bill. But, sources
said, the generals were unhappy with the bill because it
concentrated more power in the government's hands and could fuel
already rampant sectarian tensions in the country.
	   Before the amendment can become law, it requires a two-thirds
majority in the Senate, something Sharif may have difficulty
acquiring. While his ruling Pakistan Muslim League controls a
two-thirds majority in the lawmaking National Assembly, it does not
have the votes to pass the amendment in the Senate.
	   Some political analysts said Sharif may seek a vote in a joint
session of the two houses, where he would likely be able to muster
the required number of votes.
	   The opposition, led by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto,
have warned that the amendment could pave the way for a strict
Islamic regime, similar to that of neighboring Afghanistan where
Taliban religious militia rule with an iron hand.
	   However, Information Minister Mushahid Hussein has said his
government was a ``liberal Muslim'' government that opposed
fundamentalism.
	   The opposition also said the amendment would supersede
Pakistan's constitution and the government could use it to overturn
laws passed by Pakistan's four provincial governments.
	   The amendment included a clause that protects ``personal law
religous freedom, traditions or customs of non-Muslims and their
status as citizens.'' And Sharif promised minority religious groups
that he would ``protect their rights.''
	   ``It is a weapon in the hands of fundamentalists, which would be
misused against religious minorities,'' said Shahbaz Bhatti, a
leader of the Christian Liberation Front, an advocacy group for
minority Christians, who number about 2 million in Pakistan.
	   Inside the grand marble legislature, Qamar said, already the
government ministers have questioned the Islamic credentials of
those who oppose the bill.
	   ``We don't need any certificate to be a Muslim ... this bill is
going to put you into total confusion,'' said Asfandyar Wali Khan,
a member of the Awami National Party and a strong opponent of the
amendment.

Diamond mine in Namibia denies cat allegations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Add a new legend to the tales of
diamond-smuggling: trained cats.
	   Namibia's largest diamond mining company NamDeb (Namibia-De
Beers) on Friday denied reports that cats have been banned from
their high-security mining operations in the Namib desert to stop
them from smuggling.
	   ``That's a ridiculous idea,'' said mine security chief Peter
Shout.
	   Namibia's courts regularly hear cases of elaborate diamond
smuggling plots, including the use of helicopters, crossbows and
homing pigeons to carry stolen gems.
	   Cats may not be yet -- but homing pigeons are banned from the
mine area, officials confirmed.
	   Illegal diamond buying is punishable by stiff fines and prison
sentences of up to 10 years.
	   NamDeb boasts some of the highest-level security known in the
mining industry, including 24-hour remote monitoring of all
diamond-mining areas. Vehicles used at the mine are also never
allowed to leave the high-security area ever again.
	   Namibia is the world's fifth-largest diamond producer,
accounting for about 8 percent of world output.

South Korean TV once considered hiring Jay Kim
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean television station said
Friday it once considered hiring U.S. Rep. Jay Kim as a TV program
host, but dropped the idea because of his legal problems.
	   ``We once talked with Mr. Kim about making him a master of
ceremonies for one of our programs. It was his hope as much as
ours,'' said Yoo Ja-hyo, a program manager at Seoul's SBS TV
station.
	   Yoo said the idea was put on hold when the station learned Kim
was on probation for accepting illegal campaign contributions.
	   Kim, the first Korean-American member of Congress, requested an
early release from probation, saying he had an offer to be host for
a live political TV talk show in South Korea.
	   On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Richard A. Paez turned down the
request after federal prosecutors argued Kim's sentence was
``already lenient.''
	   Kim pleaded guilty in August to accepting more than dlrs 250,000
in illegal campaign donations and was sentenced to one year's
probation, 200 hours of community service, a dlrs 5,000 fine and
two months of home detention. He still has five months left on his
probation.
	   SBS's Yoo said the station has never discussed details with Kim.
	   ``We are not sure a Larry King-type show will appeal here,'' he
said. ``We will decide whether to revive our plan after Kim's
probation ends.''
	   While tethered to his home and Capitol office by an electronic
ankle bracelet, Kim was defeated in his bid for a fourth term in
the Republican primary in California's 41st Congressional District,
which covers parts of Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino
counties.
	   In a three-page letter dated Sept. 9 to Paez, Kim said his
guilty plea and election defeat ``have made the prospects for other
political or politically related employment in the United States
extremely difficult at best.''
	   Kim said his job in South Korea would enable him to make
substantial payments on his debts, including more than dlrs 300,000
in legal bills and a likely monetary settlement with his wife,
June, who has filed for divorce.

French survivors tell tale of boat tragedy

<TEXT>
	   LLORET DE MAR, Spain (AP) _ Survivors of a pleasure boat tragedy
in northeastern Spain were sad and angry Friday, a day after 20
French retirees drowned when the reportedly overcrowded boat sunk
in lake.
	   ``I don't really know what is going to happen now and I don't
really care,'' said Jean Loulier staring at his breakfast at the
tour group's hotel in this seaside resort.
	   Loulier, 70, a widowed former schoolteacher, saw his female
traveling companion, who he did not identify, in the accident.
	   The lake, surrounded by mountains, became the setting for
tragedy when the electric-powered catamaran, carrying 141
vacationing retirees, pulled away from its mooring for a half-hour
trip and quickly began to sink.
	   Officials said overloading appeared the most likely cause of the
sinking. The boat was only authorized to carry 80 passengers.
	   Two owners of the boat, including the pilot, gave secret
testimony Friday at a court hearing held by an investigative judge.
The court said the investigation will continue.
	   Police divers worked to bring the craft to shore, while the
search continued for two accounted for people authorities believe
may have gone on the doomed excursion.
	   ``Just greed, greed'' said one survivor who also raged about the
lack of consideration for the tourists in the wake of the tragedy.
	   ``I had to go to a public phone box to call my daughter,'' he
said, before realizing he was talking to a reporter and erupting in
a rage.
	   But some wanted to tell the story.
	   ``It was like the Titantic, the way it went down'' said Evelyn
Bengoechea, 52. She survived by grabbing a life preserver after her
husband, who could swim, pushed her out of the boat.
	   Michel Evielle, 50, was drinking coffee by the lakeside when the
boat began to sink.
	   ``It went down in 30 seconds,'' he said.
	   ``Some of those who could swim were carrying others who
couldn't, and then others would grab onto their backs,'' he said,
recalling how he helped pull out the floundering passengers.
	   French Tourism Minister Michelle Demessine visited the 21 people
who remained hospitalized Friday and was to meet other survivors at
their hotel.
	   Two of the injured were said to be in serious condition, but the
remainder were expected to be allowed to travel back to France on
Friday.
	   Repatriation of the corpses was also set to begin later in the
day.

	   Japan's Oldest Twins Going Strong
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ At 106, Japan's oldest twins are still
going strong _ spending time together watching sumo wresting or
charming audiences on television talk shows.
	   The sisters _ Kin and Gin, or ``Gold'' and ``Silver'' _ received
106 tulip bulbs from a flower association to honor them on
Tuesday's national Respect for the Aged Day.
	   ``It's nice to be able to live this long, but the truth is that
... nobody up there wants to invite me, so I can't go,'' Gin Kanie
on Monday told Associated Press Television with a wide, wrinkled
grin.
	   The sharp-witted female twins who live in the central Japanese
city of Nagoya, 300 kilometers (190 miles) west of Tokyo, are often
cited as examples of graceful aging in a society that reveres the
elderly.
	   Graceful aging is becoming more important these days in Japan.
	   On Monday, the government announced that more than 20 million
Japanese are 65 or older _ a record high. One-quarter of the
population will be elderly by 2015, according to government
projections.
	   Kin has five surviving children and lives with her youngest son
Yukio, 67, and his family. She has 11 grandchildren and five
great-grandchildren.
	   Gin, who lives 20 minutes away, has four daughters and lives
with her youngest daughter Mineyo, 74. She has four grandchildren
and three great-grandchildren.
	   After the ceremony Monday, the pair settled down to watch some
sumo.
	   Kin said she's happiest when she's with her sister Gin.
	   ``That's what I think at least. I don't know what this person
has to say,'' Kin said, turning to Gin.
	   ``Hmm, that's a tough question,'' her sister said.
	   The two looked at each other and burst out laughing.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Use the information from the story to answer the following true
and false questions:
	   _____ 1. The people of Japan revere (respect) the older members
of their society.
	   _____ 2. Japan's elderly (aged) population will reach a record
high of 20 million by the year 2015.
	   _____ 3. To honor Japan's oldest-living twins, a flower
association sent each sister 106 tulips.
	   _____ 4. Kin and Gin are also known as ``Gold'' and ``Silver.''
	   _____ 5. During the national Respect for the Aged Day ceremony,
the female twins burst out laughing.
	   _____ 6. The article suggests that the sharp-witted
(intelligent) pair have appeared on television talk shows.
	   _____ 7. Kin lives 20 minutes away from Gin in the Japanese city
of Nagoya.
	   _____ 8. The 106-year-old women take care of their youngest
children.
	   _____ 9. Gin's daughter Mineyo is older than Kin's son Yukio.
	   _____ 10. Japan's celebrity sisters spend their spare time
wrestling.
	   _____ BONUS: It is possible that one reason the sisters are
``still going strong'' is that they are so happy being together.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke tried
to wring concessions out of a defiant Slobodan Milosevic on Friday,
holding new talks aimed at getting him to comply with international
demands on Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.
	   While top Western officials declined to call it Milosevic's last
chance to avoid attack, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
had warned in dispatching Holbrooke back to Belgrade that ``time is
all but gone'' for a peaceful settlement.
	   Sources close to the talks said Holbrooke left the meeting after
three hours for ``consultations'' at the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade.
It was not clear if the talks would resume later Friday.
	   Divisions remained among the 16 NATO allies on the use of force,
however. Germany and Italy, among others, are reluctant to proceed
without a stronger legal basis for action.
	   Alliance ambassadors failed at a meeting in Brussels, Belgium,
on Friday to pressure Russia into dropping its opposition to
airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke, who arrived from London where he met with officials
of the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans, said Friday that
movement toward authorizing the use of force by NATO continues ``in
a sustained and intense manner.''
	   ``The situation remains just as serious at it has been before,''
he said shortly before the start of his fourth meeting with
Milosevic in five days. There was no indication how long the talks
would last, or whether Holbrooke would stay into the weekend.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and upwards of 300,000
driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb.
28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is
fighting for independence from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by KLA ``terrorists.''
	   There was no sign he was ready for concessions.
	   The Serbian government, effectively under his control, put into
effect Friday a harsh decree tightening state control over
companies and independent media and banning the rebroadcast of
foreign news broadcasts in Serbian.
	   The decree, announced earlier this week, broadens government
authority and institutes punishment for behavior deemed
anti-patriotic.
	   The international demands Holbrooke was presenting to Milosevic
are an immediate end to hostilities, a withdrawal of forces and
heavy armaments to pre-March levels, allowing unhindered work by
humanitarian organizations, cooperation with the International War
Crimes Tribunal, facilitating refugees' return to their homes, and
the start of negotiations with ethnic Albanian leaders on possible
self-rule.
	   In addition, Holbrooke was expected to press for an
international monitoring force to be allowed to oversee compliance.
	   The KLA announced a unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo
starting Friday _ a move that will add to the pressure on Milosevic
to reciprocate. No new gunfire or shelling was immediately
reported.
	   Milosevic has refused to openly declare a cease-fire, even
though there has been no major fighting in Kosovo during the past
week and the KLA has been largely routed. He considers the Kosovo
rebels ``terrorists and bandits,'' and any cease-fire on his part
would legitimize them as a negotiating partner, one of his
associates said on condition of anonymity.
	   The Serbian and Yugoslav governments showed little sign that
they are prepared to bow to international pressure, apparently
gambling that Russian opposition to a NATO attack will persuade key
alliance members, including Germany and Italy, to block any action.
	   Dismissing any talk of a rift within NATO, Albright said she
thinks the alliance will agree on an activation order ``in the next
few days'' that would authorize an attack.
	   On Friday, the NATO allies and Russia jointly urged Milosevic to
end the violence in Kosovo, but Russia remained opposed to using
force. The NATO ambassadors were to meet again later Friday and
possibly again on Saturday and Sunday to discuss a common ``legal
basis'' for airstrikes.
	   The allies are warning that they envision not just one strike
against Yugoslavia but a series of air attacks, gradually
intensifying.
	   ``We have made it perfectly plain that NATO's planning is not
for one rap over the knuckles,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook told the British Broadcasting Corp. on Friday.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Iran's foreign minister held talks with
Turkish officials in Ankara Friday in a bid to defuse a mounting
crisis between Turkey and Syria over Kurdish rebels.
	   Turkey issued an ultimatum to Syria this week, demanding that
Damascus expel Turkish Kurdish rebels from its territory or ``face
the consequences.''
	   Turkish reports suggested air strikes on suspected rebel bases
in the Syrian controlled-Bekaa Valley of Lebanon were possible.
	   Syria denies the accusations. Turkey's warlike rhetoric has
raised fears of a regional conflict.
	   Later on Friday, Turkey's chief of general staff, president,
prime minister and foreign minister were scheduled to meet on the
crisis.
	   Iran's Kamal Kharrazi held talks with his Turkish counterpart

	   LLORET DE MAR, Spain (AP) _ Sadness and anger were the mood
Friday for survivors of a pleasure boat tragedy in which 20 French
tourists drowned in a lake in northeastern Spain.
	   ``I don't really know what is going to happen now and I don't
really care,'' said Jean Loulier staring at his breakfast at the
tour group's hotel in this seaside resort.
	   Loulier, 70, like many of the 141 vacationing retirees who opted
for a boat trip around the nearby tranquil Lake Banyoles, had felt
lucky when he won a nearly free vacation package.
	   ``Most was free, but the excursions we paid, like the one
yesterday,'' said the widowed former schoolteacher whose female
traveling companion, who he did not identify, was a non-swimmer and
drowned.
	   The electric-powered catamaran was pulling away from its mooring
for a half hour trip over the mountain-surrounded lake, 565
kilometers (350 miles) northeast of Madrid, when its stern began to
sink. It went down fast.
	   Officials said overloading appeared the most likely cause, as
141 tickets were sold for a boat only authorized to carry 80
passengers.
	   Two owners of the boat, including the pilot, gave secret
testimony Friday at a court hearing held by an investigative judge,
who released them without filing charges. The court said the
investigation will continue.

	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ With the time trials behind them,
the top riders at the World Cycling Championships now point for
this weekend's road races.
	   The elite women's race is 102.2 kilometers (64.1 miles) on
Saturday. The men race 258 kilometers (162 miles) on Sunday to
conclude the championships.
	   The women's race has time trial winner Leontien van Moorsel
looking for a double. The Dutch racer won the road race in 1991 and
1993 but took nearly three years off to battle weight problems. At
one time she was more than 30 kilos (63 pounds) above her weight in
the early 1990s and went to a clinic to reduce.
	   Defending champion Alessandra Cappellotto of Italy is the
favorite for the race.
	   Jeannie Longo, looking for her 13th world title, will challenge
along with another Frenchwoman, Catherine Marsal, third last year,
second in 1995 and winner in 1991.
	   The women race six times around the circuit. The men do 15 laps
the following day on a lap that includes a sharp but steep climb.
	   American Lance Armstrong, who won the road title in 1993, came
in fourth in Thursday's time trial and says he can be among the top
men's riders with a few laps remaining.
	   ``If I have a little luck, I'll be in the race. I have the
luxury of having won before. Sunday doesn't make make or break my
career, which takes some pressure off of me. I think i'll be there
off. I want to win,'' Armstrong said.
	   If Armstrong does win on Sunday, it will be a remarkable
comeback and complete a full circle.
	   The 27-year old Armstrong announced he had testicular cancer
just before the world championships two years ago.
	   ``In my mind, I consider myself first a cancer patient, second
an athlete,'' Armstrong said.
	   ``I think I have a good balance now. In the past I think I was
too dependent on cycling,'' Armstrong said. ``Now if they told me I
were sick again, if I relapsed, I wouldn't think about the sport at
all. I would forget it immediately.
	   ``Yes I like to ride and I love the sport, but if it all went
away, it would be all right too.''
	   After winning five years ago, Armstrong knows what it will take
to win again.
	   ``The world championships are predictable. Almost always it's
decided with 2-3 laps to go,'' Armstrong said. ``If you look back
at the past races, the last 2-3 laps are very much an individual
race.''
	   But it will be lacking top top individuals.
	   The last three Tour de France winners -- Marco Pantani, Jan
Ullrich and Bjarne Riis -- are out. The Tour de France doping
scandal also forced out last year's road champion, Laurent Brochard
and the top-ranked cyclist according to UCI ratings, Laurent
Jalabert.
	   Also, Spain's Abraham Olano, who won Thursday's time trial, is
questionable after battling a knee problem.
	   Armstrong looked realistically at the depleted world
championship field.
	   ``If I pretend that I'm the winner on Sunday and you're on the
podium, I don't think in your heart of hearts, you can say `You
beat everybody'. I don't think you can say `You beat the best.'
	   ``Especially in a year like this without Pantani, without
Ullrich, you can't say you are the truest world champion. that's
unfortunate,'' he said.
	   Among the top riders who are here, Michele Bartoli and Andrea
Tafi head the strong Italian men's team. Michael Boogerd and Leon
van Bon being motivated in front of the home Dutch crowd.
	   Also Emmanuel Magnien of France, Rolf Sorensen of Denmark and
Andrei Tchmil of Belgium are also mentioned as favorites.
	   Italy swept the top three places in the men's under-23 road race
over 172 kilometers (107 miles). Ivan Basso took first easily with
Rinaldo Nocentini winning the sprint for second over Danilo Di
Luca.
	   Germany's Tina Liebig won the junior women's race of 68.8
kilometers (42.8 miles). Olga Zabelinskaia of Russia was second
with Australia's Nathalie Bates and Sara Carrigan third and fourth.
	   Germany won both junior women races with Trixi Worrack taking
the time trial on Tuesday.

Report: Jewish companies shortchanged in WWII compensation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Jewish-owned businesses ransacked
by the Nazis during World War II were shortchanged by tens and
possibly hundreds of million of guilders (dollars) in postwar
compensation, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Citing a confidential report by the Netherlands State Institute
for War Documentation, Amsterdam's daily Het Parool said only 81.5
million guilders (dlrs 44 million) were paid out after the war.
	   In reality, the damage was pegged at somewhere between 150
million to 300 million guilders (dlrs 81 million to 163 million).
	   During their WWII occupation of the Netherlands, Nazi forces
shut down up to 13,000 Jewish companies. Another 2,000 businesses
were taken over by other Dutch people, mostly Nazi sympathizers,
according to Het Parool.
	   David Barnouw, spokesman for the war documentation center, said
the confidential report was part of a wide-ranging probe into the
return of Jewish assets and properties after the war.
	   He declined to elaborate, but said the investigation was
prompted by a slew of controversies pointing to bad treatment of
Dutch Jews and mismanagement of their assets after the war.
	   In a 1968 incident disclosed only last year, Dutch civil
servants auctioned off among themselves _ and at bargain prices _
jewelry and other valuables belonging to Dutch Jews who died in
Nazi concentration camps.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke tried
to wring concessions out of a defiant Slobodan Milosevic on Friday,
holding new talks aimed at getting the Yugoslav president to comply
with international demands on Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.

three hours for ``consultations'' at the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade.
	   A statement from Milosevic's office after the meeting said he
``expressed belief that the arguments, which confirm the positive
evolution of the situation in Kosovo, would prevail over
belligerent attempts and that the political process ... would
finally prevail.''
	   The statement also said that the talks would continue later
Friday.

Greece orders Patriot missiles in boost for U.S. arms maker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece will buy the U.S.-made Patriot
missile defense system as part of a large arms buildup to keep pace
with rival Turkish forces, officials said Friday.
	   Greece claims it needs the new weapons because of a perceived
threat from neighboring NATO ally Turkey. The two countries have
nearly gone to war three times in the past 24 years.
	   The estimated dlrs 1.2 billion contract _ the first major
decision since a dlrs 24 billion, five-year arms purchase plan was
announced last year _ was an important victory for the U.S. defense
industry, which is Greece's main arms supplier.
	   Greece and Turkey have become increasingly important customers
for arms builders struggling with shrinking defense budgets in
other countries.
	   Raytheon Corp., makers of the Patriot system, announced Monday
it will eliminate 14,000 jobs in the United States over the next
two years.
	   Raytheon's aircraft division, Raytheon Aircraft Co., also
received a dlrs 200 million contract for 45 T-6A training aircraft.
	   Greek officials also announced plans to buy 33 Crotel
short-range antiaircraft missiles from France's Thomson-CSF for
dlrs 685 million, and 10 Canadair fire-fighting aircraft for dlrs
440 million.
	   The Patriot missiles, primarily an antiaircraft system, proved
largely ineffective at striking Iraqi missiles during the 1991 Gulf
War.
	   Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said the contract calls for
four Patriot batteries with the option for two more, which ``Greece
will use.''
	   Turkey has budgeted dlrs 150 billion over the next 25 years to
upgrade its military.

Bosnian authorities confiscate smugglers trucks and goods
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ In one of their biggest
crackdowns on organized crime, Bosnian authorities have seized
smugglers' trucks and goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars,
officials said Friday.
	   Launched in the past three days, the operation targeted
smugglers using two northern border crossings where controls are
traditionally difficult. A key element in its success has been
smooth cooperation between the two mini-states of
Bosnia-Herzegovina _ the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Bosnian
Serb republic.
	   In the past weeks, customs officials of the two substates have
identified 150 trucks and four transport agents suspected of
bringing in goods through the Brcko and Orasje crossings without
declaring the products or paying revenues. Officials said lost
revenues on goods smuggled by this group alone amounted to about 80
million German marks (dlrs 47 million) over the past six months.
	   The German mark is equal to the recently introduced Bosnian
convertible mark.
	   Smugglers entering one half of the country commonly say the
goods are bound for the other half _ either the Serb or the
Muslim-Croat part. With no exit controls, the goods then stay in
the half of the country they entered in and are sold on the black
market.
	   Alan Jensen of the European Commission's Customs and Fiscal
Assistance Office, which assisted in the operation, said 28 trucks
were seized and 29 drivers arrested or detained.
	   Jensen assessed the value of the confiscated trucks and goods
runs in ``hundreds of millions'' of German Marks (dlrs).
	   Jensen refused to name suspects, pending the ongoing
investigation.
	   Officials said the crackdown was a serious blow against
smuggling networks existing since the start of the 1992-1995
Bosnian war.

The bad (Panthers), bad (Eagles) and bad (Redskins)
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For those who think things can't get much worse,
look at the Carolina Panthers and either the Washington Redskins or
Philadelphia Eagles.
	   The Panthers have lost all four of their games and, on
Wednesday, their quarterback pleaded out for this weekend's game at
Dallas. The Redskins and Eagles are both 0-5 and, barring an
unlikely tie, one of them will be 0-6 after Sunday's meeting in
Dallas.
	   They are the dregs of the American National Football LEague
right now.
	   No situation is worse than Carolina's. The Panthers played in
the NFC championship game less than two years ago. Now, they are
falling apart.
	   In the last two weeks, they yielded 37 points to Green Bay and
51 to Atlanta, the two worst defensive showings in their three-plus
years of existence. And now, quarterback Kerry Collins apparently
has lost his ability to function.
	   ``He may be able to come in and play, but will people respect
him as a leader? No,'' offensive lineman Frank Garcia said of
Collins.
	   Luckily for the Panthers, they have a veteran, Steve Beuerlein,
to step in. And Beuerlein, a former Cowboys quarterback, never has
had problems with his role.
	   ``You've got to stay after him,'' Dallas defensive tackle Chad
Hennings said. ``Knowing he's such a great competitor, he's not
going to lay it down if we get up on them. We've got to put
pressure on him throughout the whole game.''
	   The one thing the Panthers can do is put pressure on opposing
passers, and Dallas will be using backup Jason Garrett again. Troy
Aikman's shoulder still is not sufficiently healed for him to
return.
	   That means Garrett must pay heed to Kevin Greene, the NFL's
sacks leader with nine. Greene became the first player in NFL
history with at least two sacks in five consecutive games and has
six career sacks versus the Cowboys.
	   The Eagles and Redskins have been models of incompetence all
year, and the losing coach _ Philadelphia's Ray Rhodes or
Washington's Norv Turner _ just might lose his job before his team
can get to 0-7.
	   ``It's the Bagel Bowl, the Battle of the Bums, whatever you want
to call it,'' Redskins receiver Leslie Shepherd said. ``You lose to
a team that's 0-5, you're the worst of the worst. Hopefully we can
get the fans booing them and cheering for us.''
	   They'll have to perform a whole lot better for that to happen.
The 'Skins have allowed the most points in the league, 169, which
is 31 more than anyone else.
	   The Eagles have scored the fewest points in the league, 52.
Together, they've yielded 47 sacks.
	   This is the first matchup of 0-5 teams in NFC East history. It
is the sixth NFL meeting between teams with at least 0-5 marks (two
were between 0-6 teams). The most recent was in 1984, when
Cincinnati and Houston met with 0-5 records.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, it's Buffalo at Indianapolis, Chicago at
Arizona, Kansas City at New England, Pittsburgh at Cincinnati, San
Francisco at New Orleans, Tennessee at Baltimore, Denver at
Seattle, the New York Jets at St. Louis, San Diego at Oakland and
Atlanta at the New York Giants.
	   Monday night, it's Miami and Jacksonville.
	   Off this week are Detroit, Green Bay, Minnesota and Tampa Bay.
	   Both the Bills and Colts broke their slides last weekend,
Buffalo more impressively by holding on against the 49ers.
	   For the Bills, watching Bruce Smith run wild against San
Francisco was especially gratifying. Smith had six tackles, six
pressures and one sack in the game. On one series, he had pressures
on first and second down and then forced a fumble with a sack on
third down. The Bills recovered and kicked a field goal.
	   And it wasn't even a totally healthy Smith.
	   ``I don't think I will be back at real form until midseason.
That's what my doctor said who performed my knee surgery,'' Smith
said. ``I have a lot of faith and confidence in his opinion.
Naturally, the only one that will be able to answer that this
season will be me.''
	   In the oldest NFL rivalry, the Bears are 1-4, with a victory
over Detroit last Sunday, and the Cardinals are 2-3.
	   Two of the best rookie performers thus far have been Bears
running back Curtis Enis and Cardinals defensive end Andre
Wadsworth, both high picks in this year's draft.

Azerbaijani police beat, detain opposition rally participants
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELCHIN TEIMURKHANOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Police blocked an opposition rally
attended by about 10,000 people in central Baku on Friday and beat
several people demonstrating against upcoming presidential
elections.
	   Azerbaijan's autocratic President Geidar Aliyev is running
virtually unchallenged in Sunday's election, which the main
opposition groups have decided to boycott.
	   Many consider the election to be seriously flawed because Aliyev
has full control over the Central Election Commission, and the
state media is working full time to promote him.
	   The opposition has been rallying nearly every week to protest
the election.
	   At least 10,000 people gathered Friday on Samed Vurgun Square,
named after an Azerbaijani poet and philosopher. They planned to
march across town, but were blocked by police.
	   Witnesses said several dozen people were beaten and seized by
plainclothes police, who threw them in cars and drove them away.
	   Police refused to comment.
	   Azerbaijan is an oil-rich former Soviet republic of 7.5 million
people, located on the Caspian Sea.
	   The 75-year-old Aliyev, who was Azerbaijan's Communist Party
leader during the Soviet era, retook power in a 1993 bloodless coup
and has governed since with an iron hand.
	   He recently tried to improve his democratic credentials by
introducing Western-style election laws, abolishing media
censorship and agreeing to permit limited anti-government rallies.

Russian nuclear plants record 62 `irregularities' in 8 months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's nuclear power plants recorded 62
``irregularities'' in the first eight months of 1998, five times
more than in the same period the previous year, a news agency said
Friday.
	   Interfax did not say what constituted an ``irregularity,'' but
said that one qualified as a significant event by the International
Atomic Energy Agency's standards and two were abnormal.
	   Russia has nine nuclear plants with a total of 29 reactors. They
generated 69.55 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity between
January and August of this year, according to the state
Rosenergoatom company. It said that was 0.3 percent less than last
year.

Greece orders Patriot missiles in boost for U.S. arms maker

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece will buy the U.S.-made Patriot
missile defense system as part of a mammoth arms build up designed
to keep pace with rival Turkish forces, officials said Friday.
	   The estimated dlrs 1.2 billion contract _ the first major
decision since the five-year arms purchase plan was announced last
year _ was an important victory for the sagging U.S. defense
industry, the main arms supplier for Greece.
	   Raytheon Corp., the makers of the Patriot system, was in close
competition with Russia's S-300 anti-aircraft missiles for the
Greek contract. Russia's defense minister, Marshal Igor Sergeyev,
visited Athens this week during a major defense industry trade
show.
	   Greece and Turkey have become increasingly important customers
for arms builders struggling with shrinking defense budgets in many
other countries. Raytheon announced Monday it will eliminate 14,000
jobs across the United States over the next two years.
	   Raytheon's aircraft division, Raytheon Aircraft Co., also
received a welcome boost from Greece: a dlrs 200 million contract
for 45 T-6A training aircraft.
	   The American lobbying effort for the contract reached as high as
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Commerce Secretary
William Daley, who sent letters to Greek officials urging the
purchase of the Patriot missiles.
	   Other NATO members also raised questions about acquiring a
Russian-made system that might be difficult to integrate into the
Western alliance's defenses.
	   ``It was a major campaign that is a very important step
commercially as well as militarily in our relationship,'' Nicholas
Burns, the U.S. ambassador to Greece, told The Associated Press.
	   Greek officials also announced plans to buy 33 Crotale
short-range anti-aircraft missiles by France's Thomson-CSF at a
total price tag of dlrs 685 million and 10 Canadair fire-fighting
aircraft for dlrs 440 million.
	   Greece is also in the market for new fighter jets, ships, tanks
and other weapons as part of an estimated dlrs 24 billion five-year
arms modernization program.
	   Greece claims it needs the new weapons because of a perceived
threat from neighboring NATO ally Turkey. The two countries have
nearly gone to war three times in the past 24 years.
	   Turkey is also shopping for new arms, budgeting dlrs 150 billion
over the next 25 years to upgrade its own military capabilities.
	   The Patriot missiles, primarily an anti-aircraft system, proved
largely ineffective at striking Iraqi missiles during the 1991 Gulf
War.
	   The Patriot batteries ordered by Greece should be in place by
2001, said Defense Minister Akis Tzochatzopoulos.
	   Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said the contract calls for
four Patriot batteries with the option for two more, which ``Greece
will use.'' He added that all contract prices will be negotiated.
	   Greece is considering American F-15E and F-16 warplanes and the
Abrams main battle tank. Russian-made systems under consideration
include the SU-27 jet.
	   Tzochatzopoulos said a decision on aircraft purchases could be
made in December.

U.N. promises aid to Lesotho after rioting, looting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ The United Nations on Friday promised
medical and food aid to Lesotho after widespread looting prompted
by a South African military intervention.
	   The U.N. Development Program will also help put into effect any
agreement reached by opposition parties and the government. Both
sides have tentatively agreed to new elections in 15 to 18 months,
with disagreement remaining on who will govern until then.
	   Scores were killed after last month's intervention to end an
army mutiny and paralyzing protests by the opposition, which
charged May elections won by the Lesotho Congress for Democracy
were rigged.
	   The military action came under the auspices of the Southern
African Development Community.
	   A U.N. official here, Edward Omotoso, said the World Health
Organization would provide emergency relief at two Lesotho
hospitals and the World Food Program would channel emergency food
assistance, the South African Press Association reported.
	   The Lesotho government on Friday said 246 businesses were
destroyed in the looting, and about 2,600 people thrown out of
work.

Woman kidnapped, later freed in Antigua
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Antigua police searched Friday for
two men they say kidnapped a woman and demanded a ransom of dlrs
370,000 (EC dlrs 1 million). The woman was rescued by officers and
army troops.
	   Donna Pietracupa, 60, was abducted from her automobile as she
arrived home Wednesday night in the northern village of McKinnon's.
Pietracupa is an employee and longtime companion of prominent
French-Canadian local businessman John Beaulieu, who owns a large
supermarket near the capital city of St. John's.
	   ``They treated me very well, actually,'' Pietracupa said. ``They
offered me water and toilet facilities and did not touch me.''
	   Pietracupa said she was blindfolded throughout the ordeal. The
kidnappers demanded the ransom using her cellular telephone, police
said.
	   Using information provided by phone service provider Cable and
Wireless, police stormed a house Thursday and reportedly exchanged
several shots with two suspects who escaped.
	   Police were conducting an intensive manhunt with troops, a
helicopter and house-to-house searches.

	   SEMERAH, Malaysia (AP) _ Police broke up a crowd of more than
1,000 villagers who had gathered in a southern Malaysian town
Friday for a rally to show support for the nation's arrested
dissident leader.
	   Activists of a new coalition of opposition parties and
pro-reform groups locked arms and tried to block police from
entering the 30-minute-old meeting, but were pushed back.
	   No injuries were reported and most people dispersed without
resistance as police, armed with pistols, marched in. No arrests
were made.
	   The Malaysian People's Justice Movement, a fledgling coalition
of opposition parties and private groups, had expected a turnout of
15,000 people at the gathering, part of a nationwide tour to demand
reform.
	   The coalition, led by the Islamic Parti Islam SeMalaysia, or
PAS, has rallied a growing number of supporters in calls for
justice for Anwar Ibrahim and for repeal of the harsh Internal
Security Act, under which the former deputy prime minister was
arrested Sept. 20.
	   ``This is unfair. The authorities don't want the people to know
what is going on,'' said Mohammed Salim, 40, a local businessman
who had waited for hours to listen to speeches by opposition
leaders.
	   The villagers had gathered despite police attempts to stop them
by putting up roadblocks on the route to the PAS regional office.
	   Malaysian police have repeatedly warned they will not tolerate
any public show of sympathy for Anwar, who was fired Sept. 2 by
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Demonstrations have continued, however.
	   Earlier Friday, more than 100 students, their faces covered with
scarves or veils to avoid recognition, protested near a university
campus in the capital, shouting for political reform and holding
posters that demanded ``Mahathir Quit.''
	   One poster said: ``Mahathir, thanks for everything. It's
enough.''
	   Mahathir, who has ruled for 17 years, says Anwar was morally
unfit to lead. The two had differed over economic policy, and Anwar
has said Mahathir feared he posed a leadership threat.
	   Anwar has since been arrested on 10 counts of corruption and
illegal homosexual acts, and is to go on trial Nov. 2. He has
denied all the charges.
	   Support for the political dissident has swelled in recent weeks,
particularly among the country's majority Muslim population.
	   Police issued fresh warnings Friday asking people not to gather
in downtown Kuala Lumpur Saturday for another proposed rally or
hold mass prayers on the streets as called for by dissident groups.
	   In recent weeks, thousands of people have clogged the streets of
downtown Kuala Lumpur, many demanding reform and Mahathir's
resignation.
	   Mahathir, Asia's longest serving ruler, was quoted in a
Singapore newspaper Friday as saying he was prepared to retire from
politics once the nation's economy stabilized.
	   The Straits Times said in a front-page report that Mahathir told
a closed-door meeting of grassroots supporters Thursday ``that he
was prepared to step down after 17 years as prime minister of
Malaysia, once the economy stabilizes.''
	   ``They roared in disapproval and urged him to stay on,'' the
newspaper account added.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Imports to Russia plunged 45 percent in September
because most people can no longer afford them, not even necessities
such as medicines, milk and sugar, the government said Friday.
	   Russia depends on imports for almost 80 percent of its consumer
goods _ more than almost any other country in the world _ but the
latest economic crisis has sent prices soaring and the ruble
tumbling.
	   The country hasn't experienced any serious shortages, but store
shelves can be empty for days at a time. The government is planning
to drop or lower import duties on basic foods such as meat, butter
and grain in a bid to restock them.
	   Meanwhile, the speaker of the Russian parliament said he is
concerned that the government has not yet come up with a
comprehensive plan to deal with the economic crisis that erupted
nearly two months ago.
	   ``We are not hurrying the government, but we are a bit worried
by the delay in presenting the anti-crisis program,'' Gennady
Seleznyov, a Communist who is as speaker of the State Duma lower
house, told Russian news agencies.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has been in office since Sept.
11, but his Cabinet is still formulating an economic rescue plan.
The government has said it will be announced before Oct. 20.
	   The Kommersant business newspaper said Friday it had learned one
proposal under consideration: minting a gold coin to raise money to
pay overdue wages and pensions, as well as debts on government
bonds.
	   Kommersant said 20 metric tons (22 tons) of the Central Bank's
500 metric tons (550 tons) of gold reserves would be used in the
project to raise 5 billion rubles (dlrs 316,000).
	   The coins would have a face value of 1,000 rubles (dlrs 63.21)
and 5,000 rubles (dlrs 316) but would contain only 10 rubles (63
cents) and 100 rubles (dlrs 6.30) worth of gold respectively, the
newspaper said.
	   Primakov reiterated that the government's economic plan hinges
on whether the International Monetary Fund releases the next
installment on a dlrs 22.6 billion loan negotiated before Russia's
long-standing economic problems developed into a full-fledged
crisis in mid-August.
	   ``If we get the installment promised by the IMF, there will be
one turn of events, but if we don't get it, another, alternative
version of events will be adopted,'' he told reporters after
meeting with the president of the European Union Commission,
Jacques Santer.
	   Primakov did not say what those alternatives would be, but
Russian media have widely reported they will include printing more
money.
	   Russia badly needs foreign aid to pay off a mountain of debts,
but international lenders have not been willing to provide money
until they know the contents of Russia's economic program.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Friday the IMF told him
during meetings in Washington this week it wants the government to
actually implement the program before it will release more money,
the Interfax news agency said.
	   Meanwhile, the State Statistics Committee said Friday that
overall imports fell 45.4 percent in September compared to a year
earlier, but in some categories the decline was even more dramatic.
	   Pharmaceutical imports were down 71 percent, while milk and
sugar imports both fell more than 80 percent.

UN repeatedly asked Chile human rights questions about monitor

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A major human rights group is urging the
United Nations to remove from duty a top military observer alleged
to have committed human rights abuses during Chile's Pinochet
dictatorship.
	   In a letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Human Rights Watch
said Brig. Gen. Sergio Espinoza Davies' documented participation
``in the worst human rights abuses in his home country'' renders
him unfit to remain in charge of the U.N. military observer mission
in India and Pakistan.
	   The United Nations has known about the allegations for over a
month and has repeatedly sought clarifications from both Espinoza
and Chile, U.N. officials said.
	   Espinoza denied the charges and Chile hasn't provided the United
Nations with satisfactory information, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard
said.
	   Espinoza on Friday refused to answer reporters questions. ``I
don't talk to the press,'' his secretary in Lahore, Pakistan,
quoted Espinoza as saying.
	   While stressing that he has no proof of the charges, Eckhard
noted that the United Nations does not conduct background checks on
people volunteered by member states to participate in missions.
	   The United Nations expects ``that the people they give us will
be responsible people with clean records,'' he said. ``The
governments are supposed to know. We don't second-guess
governments.''
	   Human rights watch said in its letter that Espinoza served on at
least one Pinochet-era war tribunal that sentenced people to prison
or death after proceedings that ``violated the most fundamental
judicial guarantees of due process.''
	   The Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliations
found that judges on the tribunals had an unsatisfactory level of
basic legal knowledge and concluded that many proceedings were
simply used to justify illegal executions.
	   According to a report by the civilian government that succeeded
Pinochet's, 3,197 people were killed for political reasons after
Pinochet came to power in a 1973 coup, including 1,102 who
disappeared. Thousands more were tortured, forced into exile, or
both.
	   Pinochet relinquished most of his powers to a civilian
government in 1990. He is still a senator.

	   SEMERAH, Malaysia (AP) _ Police marched in and dispersed more
than 1,000 villagers who had gathered in a southern Malaysian town
Friday for a rally in solidarity with the nation's arrested
dissident leader.
	   Reform and opposition activists locked arms and tried to block
the police from the meeting, which was part of a nationwide tour to
demand reform, but they were pushed back.
	   No injuries or arrests were reported and most people left
without resistance when police broke up the meeting about 30
minutes after it began.
	   The Malaysian People's Justice Movement, a fledgling coalition

15,000 people at the gathering, but only about 1,000 showed up.
	   The coalition, led by the Islamic Parti Islam SeMalaysia, has

	   ``This is unfair. The authorities don't want the people to know
what is going on,'' said Mohammed Salim, 40, a local businessman
who had waited for hours to listen to speeches by opposition
leaders.
	   Anwar, 51, was arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security
Act, which allows indefinite detention without trial. His arrest
came after two weeks of rallies where he called for government
reform, an end to corruption and the resignation of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Anwar, who faces 10 counts of corruption and illegal homosexual
acts, is to go on trial Nov. 2. He has denied all the charges.
	   The villagers gathered Friday despite police attempts to prevent
them by putting up roadblocks on the route to the venue at the
regional office of the Islamic Parti Islam SeMalaysia, or PAS.

 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Russia, upset 3-2 by Ukraine last month as
qualifying for the 2000 European championship began, can't afford
to stumble again.
	   Trouble is, the opponent this time is World Cup champion France,
which was also humbled last month in a 1-1 draw with Iceland. And
Russia is nagged by injuries.
	   England will be another side trying to get out of trouble _ 2-1
losers to Sweden last month _ as 20 qualifying matches fill
Europe's soccer schedule on Saturday.
	   In Turkey, Germany unveils its new generation, and in Italy new
coach Dino Zoff is wondering when Alessandro Del Piero will score
again.
	   The pick of the 20 matches are:
	   _ Denmark vs. Wales
	   _ Italy vs. Switzerland
	   _ Turkey vs. Germany
	   _ Russia vs. France
	   _ England vs. Bulgaria
	   _ Portugal vs. Romania
	   In Group 4, new Russian coach Anatoly Byshovets has injuries to
strikers Igor Kolyvanov and Sergei Kiryakov and will probably field
Vladimir Beschastnykh and Oleg Teryokhin. Midfielders Andrei
Kanchelskis and Ilya Tsymbalar will also miss the match in Moscow's
Luzhniki stadium.
	   ``I am hoping for a positive result, our backs are to the wall
and that is why we will play to win,'' Byshovets said.
	   For France, new coach Roger Lemerre gets midfielder Emmanuel
Petit back after missing the Iceland match with illness. Defenders
Laurant Blanc and Marcel Desailly return from suspension.
	   In Group 1, Italy comes off a 2-0 win over Wales with new coach
Dino Zoff needing to replace two injured regulars against
Switzerland: goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi and forward Christian Vieri.
AC Parma's 20-year-old Gianluigi Buffon is likely to be in goal
with Alessandro Del Piero and Filippo Inzaghi teaming up front.
	   Del Piero is mired in a career-slump with only one goal in 16
games for Juventus and the national side.
	   ``Based on what they expect from me, people say that I am not at
my best,'' Del Piero said. ``It's normal that people would be
waiting for me to score, given that it has been awhile. But
physically I'm fine.''
	   Swiss coach Gilbert Gress has called up Sebastien Jeanneret to
replace Murat Yakin. Striker Marco Grassi is also out with a thigh
injury.
	   In Group 3, Germany opens its qualifying in Turkey as new coach
Erich Ribbeck fields the new generation with 14 of the 22 with 10
caps or fewer. Strikers Oliver Bierhoff and Ulf Kirsten are ready
after injury worries. Among the likely new starters are: Lars
Ricken, 22, Carsten Ramelow, 24, libero Jens Novotny, 24,
midfielder Jens Jeremies, 24.
	   Ribbeck didn't mean to start such a young side but was forced to
by injuries and withdrawals by old names like Lothar Matthaeus,
Andy Moeller, Mario Basler and Stefan Effenberg.
	   In Group 5, England is smarting from a 2-1 loss to Sweden with
coach Glenn Hoddle wondering why strikers Alan Shearer and Michael
Owen have not jelled. ``It's going to take time to get it right and
we have been working at it on the training ground,'' Hoddle said.
	   Bulgaria, beaten by Poland 3-0 last month, is a shell of the
club that took fourth in the 1994 World Cup. Coach Hristo Bonev
resigned after this year's World Cup failure and new coach Dimitar
Dimitrov this week saw another veteran _ Luboslav Penev _ drop off
the team.
	   In Group 7, Portugal is fresh from a 3-1 win over Hungary. The
Portuguese are near full strength for the Romania match with
midfielder Paulo Sousa back from injury. The only worry is at right
back where Abel Xavier will probably fill in for injured Carlos
Secretario.
	   Elsewhere, Italian defender Paolo Maldini will play his 94th
national game, putting him in a tie for second all-time behind
former goalkeeper Zoff's 112 appearances.
	   Injured goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel is likely to miss Denmark's
game in Copenhagen against Wales, his first absence in 10 years.
Mogens Krogh is likely to start. Forward Mikkel Beck is also back
with Denmark after being left off the World Cup team.

Yemen wins island dispute with Eritrea in international
</HEADLINE>
arbitration &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ An international arbitration panel on Friday
ruled in favor of Yemen in its dispute with Eritrea over three Red
Sea islands, a quarrel that had threatened a major shipping route.
	   Eritrea said it will abide by the decision.
	   The official Yemeni news agency SABA said Prime Minister Abdel
Karim al-Iryani sent a message of congratulations to President Ali
Abdullah Saleh over the decision by the International Court of
Arbitration, which is based in the Hague.
	   A court official declined to give details of the verdict.
	   In the Eritrean capital of Asmara, Yemen's acting ambassador,
Ahmed Hassan, called the decision a ``victory for Eritrea and
Yemen.''
	   ``You may lose something but you win something more important:
living together in peace as good neighbors and setting an example
for others in the region,'' he said.
	   Yemen and Eritrea both claimed the three islands, one of which,
the Greater Hanish, was captured by Eritrea in a brief battle in
December 1995. Yemen retained control of the other two islands,
Lesser Hanish and Zuqar.
	   An Eritrean government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Eritrea will now withdraw its troops from Greater
Hanish.
	   An Eritrean Foreign Ministry statement said the tribunal gave
Eritrea control of three minor islands and four islets.
	   ``This is the only civilized way of settling disputes,'' New
Eritrea, a government newspaper, said.
	   The islands, where Yemen has granted oil concessions, sit across
one of the world's major shipping lanes, 160 kilometers (100 miles)
north of the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the southern entrance to the
Red Sea.
	   Shipping security in the area is of vital importance to Saudi
Arabia, which has an oil export terminal in Yanbu further north,
and to Egypt, whose revenues from the Suez Canal linking the Red
Sea to the Mediterranean are crucial to its economy.
	   Eritrea and Yemen decided in May 1996 to have the dispute
settled by the International Court of Arbitration, a low-profile
panel of international experts. The court's decisions are legally
binding.
	   The ICA, which arbitrates behind closed door, is considered a
more discreet arena to settle disputes than the better-known
International Court of Justice, which is housed in the same Hague
building.
	   The ICA's arbitration on the Yemen-Eritrea dispute was held in
London.
	   Hassan, the acting ambassador, said the decision leaves Yemen
free to develop the islands for tourism, scuba diving, oil and
other enterprises.

On independence day, Museveni urges Ugandans to fight terrorism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ President Yoweri Museveni Friday urged
Ugandans to be vigilant in the fight against terrorism after an
alleged plot to blow up the U.S. Embassy and the bombings of
several buses later in August in which 30 people were killed.
	   ``Terrorism is a weapon of the weak and dispirited. Our
opponents have resorted to terrorism, and it is an indication that
our opponents cannot fight government by military means or by the
ballot,'' Museveni told thousands of people celebrating Uganda's
36th anniversary of independence from Britain.
	   ``I ask of each Ugandan to be at each other's keep. Report
anyone who jeopardizes security. When our opponents are desperate,
they adopt terrorism. They cannot get power democratically and
begin to strike innocent people using terrorism,'' Museveni said.
	   Meanwhile, East African defense officials stressed the
importance of security as a pre-condition to regional unity, peace
and stability at the end of a one-day meeting Thursday night in
Kampala.
	   In a joint statement, they recommended that the heads of state
of Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania meet at a summit in three weeks to
discuss the security situation in Congo where a two-month rebellion
has drawn in at least six outside countries.
	   Uganda maintains two army batallions in northeastern Congo to
flush out rebels who attack western Uganda, but Museveni says no
Ugandan troops are involved in the Congolese rebellion.
	   On Aug. 7 bombs exploded at the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 224 people, including 12
Americans.
	   Ugandan officials and FBI agents said several weeks later they
had uncovered a plot to bomb the U.S. Embassy in Kampala.

Russian post office to pay rail bill to get mail moving again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian postal service will pay its overdue
shipping bills by the end of the year to resolve a dispute that has
all but stopped mail delivery, a news agency said Friday.
	   Russian railways stopped carrying most mail Sept. 20 to protest
the State Communications Committee's failure to pay 160 million
rubles (dlrs 10.1 million) in shipping costs.
	   The dispute halted 1,000 of the country's 1,200 rail cars
carrying mail, and left many stranded and stuffed with letters and
packages.
	   Russians rely heavily on mail as their main method of
communication, especially in far-flung regions where there are few
telephones. Few Russian TV networks broadcast throughout the
country, so people also depend on newspapers delivered by mail for
news.
	   Russia's 17 railways charge the State Communications Committee,
which is responsible for the postal service, cheap rates for
delivering mail. It said it was owed about 210 million rubles (dlrs
13.2 million).
	   The post office, which is chronically in debt, says it is owed
money by the government and others.
	   The problem is part of the overall crisis in Russia where a
tangled web of non-payment of bills and wages has all but paralyzed
the economy. The government is the largest debtor, failing to pay
wages and pensions to millions of Russians or pay for goods and
services.
	   The postal service will seek bank loans to help pay its debt,
Vladimir Shelikhov, deputy chief of postal services for the State
Communications Committee, told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   It will also ask the government to consider raising postal
rates, Shelikhov said.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinians battled Israeli troops
with rocks and firebombs in the divided West Bank town of Hebron on
Friday just after burying a young Palestinian fatally shot with a
rubber bullet a day earlier.
	   Twenty Palestinians were hurt, including one who was arrested.
	   In the West Bank's Jordan Valley, meanwhile, an Israeli woman
soldier, 19-year-old Cpl. Michal Adato, was stabbed to death by a
Palestinian man outside the Jewish settlement of Tomer, where she
lived. Israeli troops shot and wounded the assailant.
	   The violence overshadowed preparations by Israel and the
Palestinians for next week's summit in Washington under the
auspices of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   In Hebron, near the tiny Jewish enclave of Tel Romeida, masked
stone-throwers torched a car and tried to roll it downhill toward
Israeli troops, who fought them off with a volley of rubber
bullets.
	   Palestinians were enraged by the announcement of plans to
enlarge Tel Romeida, a cluster of mobile homes in the heart of a
Palestinian neighborhood. An Israeli Cabinet minister, Shaul
Yahalom, attended a cornerstone-laying ceremony earlier this week.
	   The enclave was the scene of the fatal stabbing of an elderly
rabbi six weeks ago, and settlers said the expansion was in
retaliation for that.
	   Thousands of Palestinians marched through a hilly Hebron
neighborhood in a funeral procession for 20-year-old Amjad Natche,
who was shot in the head with a rubber bullet during a clash on
Thursday. He belonged to one of the largest Palestinian clans in
the city.
	   At the mosque where funeral services were held, a crowd of
hundreds spilled out into the street. Mourners formed themselves
into rows and spread prayer rugs in the dusty street as Koranic
verses rang out from the mosque's loudspeakers.
	   Carrying the body on a wooden pallet, the marchers wound through
several kilometers (miles) of hilly streets, chanting ``Allahu
Akbar!'' or ``God is great!'' Several masked marchers brandished
weapons.
	   One young man, his head wrapped in a black-and-white-checked
keffiyeh, waved a mini-Uzi submachine gun, saying the display of
weaponry was meant as a warning to Israel that the Palestinians
were armed and ready to rise up if Israel continued its hard-line
policies.
	   At the cemetery, mourners fired volleys of shots into the air
and burned Israeli and U.S. flags, screaming, ``Revenge, revenge!''
	   Afterward, scores of stone-throwers attacked Israeli troops
guarding Jewish settlements in the center of Hebron, but the
soldiers kept them at bay with rubber bullets, and the disturbances
died down after several hours.
	   For the 10th straight day, troops kept Israeli-controlled areas
of Hebron under curfew, confining 30,000 Palestinians living there
to their homes. However, a closure of the city as a whole was
lifted Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Landslides unleashed by heavy rains and
floods killed eight people in northern Iran, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported Friday.
	   The deaths occurred on Thursday in Gilan and Mazandaran
provinces where the raging waters and landslides damaged roads,
bridges, farm lands, homes and other buildings, the agency quoted
an official with the Natural Disaster Headquarters as saying.
	   He said more than 400 families were stranded in the northern
towns of Rudsar, Rezvan Shahr and Masaleh after floods cut all road
links.
	   In April, a landslide killed 55 people in a remote village in
central Iran.

German auto clubs against new coalition setting speed limits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German auto clubs were united Friday
against speed limits proposed by the incoming government's likely
junior coalition partner, the environmental Greens.
	   Three national clubs all said that limits would not improve
safety. The Greens party is proposing a limit of 130 kilometers (78
miles) an hour on the famed German autobahn to cut down on
emissions and accidents.
	   The Frankfurt-based Automobilclub von Deutschland (AvD), said
only 10 percent of the country's accidents occur on the autobahn,
and that a blanket speed limit would only increase traffic jams _
not increase safety or environmental conditions.
	   AvD said that 75 percent of Germany's 11,246 kilometers (6,987
miles) of superhighways already have speed limits, set by the
states.
	   Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil Club in Munich said a general
speed limit was unnecessary, noting that many stretches already
were posted with a 130 kilometer (78 mile) an hour limit.
	   And the Auto Club Europa in Stuttgart said it has sent a
position paper to the new government negotiators against the
limits. ``People won't stick to it anyway,'' said spokesman Rainer
Hillgaertner.

Retiring ski star to run his last race in December
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Retiring ski star Alberto Tomba will run his
very last race in December at the venue where he captured his first
World Cup victory 11 years ago.
	   Organizers announced Friday that the 31-year-old Italian skier,
who announced his official retirement from skiing last Saturday,
will compete in a giant slalom exhibition at Sestriere on Dec. 30.
	   A huge crowd was expected to pay Tomba a tribute in occasion of
his last show on skis.
	   Tomba, Italy's most successful and popular skier, won his first
World Cup race at Sestriere, in Italy's eastern Alps, in 1987.
	   Since then the man nicknamed La Bomba (the Bomb) because of his
explosive style piled up 50 World Cup wins, one overall World Cup
title, three Olympic golds and two world titles.
	   Tomba, who plans an acting debut later this year, will be
competing in the Sestriere exhibition against seven top ranking
World Cup skiers.
	   The race, in three runs, will award victory on the basis of the
combined time of the two fastest heats.

 &UR; Forensic experts find new mass grave in Bosnia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DONJA GLUMINA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Within three days,
forensic experts have found more than 170 bodies in one of the
biggest mass graves discovered in Bosnia so far, officials said
Friday.
	   ``We anticipate to find maybe one hundred more'' bodies, said
U.S. pathologist Dr. Jill Gould, a forensic pathologist from
Wichita, Kansas, and a member of the exhumation team .
	   Also on Friday, forensic investigators exhumed 25 bodies from a
mass grave in Vukovar, an eastern Croatian city formerly held by
rebel Serbs.
	   In cooperation with Physical Human Rights (PHR) and the
state-run Commission for Missing Persons in Bosnia, an exhumation
team found the new mass grave in the village of Donja Glumina,
about 35 kilometers ( 22 miles) east of Tuzla, on Serb-held
territory.
	   Experts have found civilians clothes so far, ``but we have to
open some more bags,'' said Gould.
	   The bodies were believed to be Bosnian Muslims killed at the
very beginning of the Bosnian war in 1992.
	   Amor Masovic, the head of the Commission for Missing People,
said it was believed that the remains found were of some of several
thousand people missing since 1992 from neighboring villages. He
also said that the grave was found with the help of people who
witnessed the burial by soldiers of the former Yugoslav Army.
	   One of the witnesses, a 51-year-old man of Donja Glumina
identified only by his initials R. M., said that in May 1992, he
saw trucks with bodies in bags and soldiers placing the bodies in
the prepared grave.
	   Most of the bodies discovered are in military plastic bags,
orderly placed in the mass grave.
	   About 1, 800 bodies have been dug from different mass graves in
this area, most of them believed to be victims killed after Bosnian
Serbs overran the town of Srebrenica in July 1995.
	   In Croatia, the 25 bodies were discovered in Celije, a suburb of
Vukovar near the Croatian border with Yugoslavia, some 355
kilometers (220 miles) east of Zagreb.
	   Ivan Grujic, who heads a national commission for prisoners and
missing persons, told Croatia's state-run HINA news agency that the
victims whose remains were found in Celije were killed while the
area was controlled by rebel Serbs following their rebellion
against Croatian independence in 1991.

Tough energy issues dominate weekend German coalition talks

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Social Democrats and Greens try
to crack some of the toughest nuts _ how much to raise energy
taxes, and how fast to abandon nuclear power _ when talks on
forming a new center-left government resume Sunday.
	   Both issues are vital to the environmentalist Greens, the junior
partner in the negotiations. But chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder, who campaigned promising a business-friendly approach to
politics, has already signaled he won't agree to anything that
might jeopardize economic growth.
	   After a visit to Washington on Friday dominated by foreign
policy, Schroeder heads into Sunday's talks focused on tough
domestic questions of taxes and energy policy.
	   The platforms of both parties call for shutting down Germany's
19 atomic energy plants _ a prospect that has electric companies
already threatening to sue the government for billions of marks.
	   Business leaders also warn that abandoning nuclear power would
cost jobs in research. ``I think it's almost cynical to withhold
German nuclear technology from humanity,'' said Hans-Olaf Henkel,
head of the Association of German Industry.
	   Schroeder says he wants to try to reach an agreement with the
nuclear industry to begin decommissioning atomic plants. Greens
leaders though are looking for a definite timetable _ and a quick
one.
	   Also on the agenda is attaching a figure to the energy tax
increase to promote energy conservation and finance cuts elsewhere.
The future partners agreed to the tax on Thursday.
	   The Greens argue raising taxes on oil, coal and natural gas
could create jobs in two ways: forcing industry to modernize and
seek alternatives, and by financing cuts in non-wage costs
employers must pay for government-mandated employee benefits.
	   ``It's not just a symbolic project for us, something to satisfy
the Green heart,'' Greens party co-chair Gunda Roestel told German
radio.
	   Yet industry leaders warn higher fuel costs in Germany would
make German products more expensive and hurt the export-dependent
economy.
	   ``We could end up with a crisis,'' Michael Fuchs, president of a
German wholesalers and retailers association, told German
television Friday.
	   Social Democrats insisted Schroeder would not allow a gas tax
increase of more than 6 pfennigs (3.75 cents) per liter, which is
much less than the Greens want.
	   ``Schroeder has made himself clear,'' party chairman Oskar
Lafontaine said.
	   A 6 pfennig increase raises 4.3 billion marks (dlrs 2.7
billion). But 15 billion marks (dlrs 9.4 billion) would be needed
to lower non-wage labor costs _ now at 42.3 percent of a worker's
income _ by just one percentage point.
	   The center-left coalition has said they want to get the costs
down to less than 40 percent of the average-earner's wage.
	   Roestel said other energy taxes, such as on electricity
production, were still on the negotiating table.
	   On Saturday, the Social Democrats' executive committee was to
meet Saturday to unite behind a candidate for parliamentary faction
leader. The incumbent, Rudolf Scharping, was expected to get the
nod.

Tajik warlord sentenced to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Tajikistan's Supreme Court on Friday sentenced a
rebel warlord to death for several hostage-takings and bombings in
the Central Asian country, a news agency said.
	   Bakhrom Sadirov kidnapped 23 people in December 1996 and 16
people in February 1997. In both cases, most of the hostages were
United Nations workers. All were released unharmed after the
government freed some of Sadirov's supporters.
	   Sadirov and an ally, Kiroatsho Nasyrov, were both sentenced to
death on charges of terrorism and hostage-taking, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Bakhrom Sadirov and his brother Rezvon Sadirov opposed a peace
settlement reached last year by the government and main opposition
groups in the impoverished former Soviet republic.
	   The agreement between President Emomali Rakhmonov's hard-line
government and the mainstream Muslim opposition ended the civil war
raging since 1992, but sporadic clashes with rebel commanders who
opposed the settlement have continued.
	   Bakhrom Sadirov was arrested in February 1997. His brother
Rezvon Sadirov was killed late last year in a crackdown on his
fighters by government forces.

Lake returns to Washington instead of going back to Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's
special envoy to the Horn of Africa left Ethiopia for Washington
Friday instead of returning to Eritrea as expected for a second
round of meetings on the simmeering border dispute between the two
countries.
	   Former national security adviser Anthony Lake and his
four-member team arrived in the Ethiopian capital Thursday from
Eritrea where he began the second U.S. attempt to find a peaceful
solution to the conflict that turned violent May 12.
	   Lake had arrived in Asmara, the Eritrean capital, Tuesday
afternoon for talks with Eritrean President Isias Afwerki, and he
had been expected to return after meeting Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi.
	   There was no explanation for the apparent change in plans.
	   The United States and Rwanda attempted to resolve the conflict
with a round of shuttle diplomacy in June, but the peace plan they
proposed reportedly annoyed the Eritreans, who were called on to
withdraw from disputed territory before any negotiations could
begin.
	   Eritrea has called for internationally monitored
demilitarization of three contested areas before any talks can
begin.
	   Several hundred people were killed during cross border air
strikes and shelling in early June. Both sides have been observing
a June 14 Clinton-brokered moratorium on further air strikes.
	   Eritrea, a former Italian colony annexed to Ethiopia in 1962,
fought a 30-year war with Ethiopia and gained independence in 1993.
	   The border separating the two countries was drawn up by Italy in
the early part of the century, but it has not been formally
demarcated since Eritrean independence.

EU takes Greece to court for failing to protect turtles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Friday
that it was taking Greece to court for failing to protect rare
Mediterranean sea turtles which lay their eggs on the island of
Zakynthos.
	   In a statement, the European Union executive body said the Greek
government had infringed EU laws on protection of natural habitats
by allowing ``disturbances due to tourist-related activities'' on
beaches favored by the turtles.
	   The Ionian island of Zakynthos lies some, 290 kilometers (180
miles) northwest of Athens.
	   In a separate case, the Commission said it was taking Greece to
the European Court of Justice for not introducing tougher penalties
for smugglers trading in rare animals and plants.
	   The Commission also said it was also lodging a complaint at the
EU high court against Germany for not setting up enough protected
areas for wild birds.
	   If the European Court finds against them, the two countries will
be told to fully implement EU rules or face fines.

Turkish delinquent who became political symbol faces deportation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A Turkish boy who became an election-year
symbol for Germans demanding action against ``criminal foreigners''
faced a new deportation threat Friday after being convicted of
robbery.
	   Although born and raised in Munich, the 14-year-old boy, known
as Mehmet, remains Turkish because of German citizenship laws.
	   Conservative officials in Bavaria created a nationwide stir this
summer by seeking to deport not only Mehmet, who has a long record
of juvenile delinquency, but also his law-abiding parents, who have
lived and worked in Munich for 30 years.
	   Bavarian officials charged the parents with endangering public
safety by failing to properly raise their son. Mehmet's lawyer,
pointing to September's elections, accused the government of making
a campaign issue out of a family tragedy.
	   A state court has since blocked the deportation of the parents,
but Munich officials refused to renew Mehmet's residency permit,
meaning he could theoretically be sent back to Turkey.
	   That likelihood was strengthened by Friday's conviction and
sentence to one year in prison _ his first after turning 14, the
age at which youths can be prosecuted.
	   Mehmet and three other German youths were convicted of robbery
and causing bodily harm stemming from a July 3 fight with a
19-year-old student.
	   German law allows deportation of any foreigner sentenced to a
year or more in prison.

Yeltsin heads to Central Asia for economic talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin saying joint measures regarding situation
in Afghanistan to be discussed, grafs 2, 7-9. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, who has made few foreign
trips in recent months, heads to Central Asia this weekend in hopes
of increasing cooperation with two former Soviet republics,
officials said Friday.
	   Yeltsin plans to sign a package of economic agreements and
discuss joint measures to prevent a spillover of violence from
Afghanistan during his visits to Uzbekistan and Kazakstan on Sunday
through Tuesday.
	   Despite Russia's economic crisis, Yeltsin has maintained a
low-profile since the summer and has spent much of his time at a
country residence outside Moscow. His last foreign trip was to
Britain in May, when he attended summit of the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations.
	   Yeltsin plans to meet Uzbek President Islam Karimov on Sunday
and sign agreements aimed at boosting bilateral trade, cooperation
in the oil industry, and expanding economic ties, Uzbek officials
said.
	   ``The work in all these directions is going on,'' Yeltsin said
in an interview Friday with Russian news agencies. ``But,'' he
added, ``we need to work in a more coordinated way,''
	   Yeltsin goes to Kazakstan on Monday, where he and Kazak
President Nursultan Nazarbayev are expected to sign agreements on
economic, science and technical cooperation and on combating drug
trafficking.
	   Yeltsin said he also planned to discuss the situation in
Afghanistan with his Uzbek and Kazak counterparts. Russia and the
former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear an influx of refugees
and weapons across their borders from Afghanistan, and possibly a
spillover of fighting.
	   The situation ``naturally disturbs us, and even more so,
Afghanistan's immediate neighbors,'' Yeltsin said. Uzbeksitan
shares a border with Afghanistan.
	   The talks will also touch on ``specific measures that we should
take together to neutralize the threats to safety and stability in
the region that are coming from Afghanistan,'' Yeltsin said.
	   Yeltsin and Nazarbayev are also expected to discuss Russia's
offer to build a nuclear power plant in Kazakstan, the ITAR-Tass
and Interfax news agencies reported.
	   Under the proposed dlrs 2 billion project, the plant would be
built near Lake Balkhash in southern Kazakstan.
	   Yeltsin and Nazarbayev are also expected to discuss the division
of oil-rich Caspian Sea floor _ an issue that has divided the five
Caspian countries for years.
	   The two presidents signed an agreement this summer to divide the
northern part of the Caspian seabed into separate Russian and Kazak
sectors. The deal recognized Kazakstan's claim to the oil near its
coast and set a precedent for future agreements.
	   Yeltsin praised the agreement Monday, and called for work on
additional agreements.
	   The three countries with oil near their coastlines _ Kazakstan,
Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan _ want the Caspian divided into
national sectors so they can claim the oil for themselves.
	   Russia and Iran, two countries with little or no oil near their
Caspian coasts, have wanted the sea's resources shared by all. But
Russia has been softening its stance recently.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The malaria death rate in the
country's hospitals declined from 6 percent to 4.2 percent over
four years ending in 1997, officials said Friday.
	   The improvement is due to better diagnosis and availability of
medicines, said the assistant health director, Avertino Barreto.
	   Malaria is endemic to the southern African nation.

Zurich Financial sells Eagle Star Reinsurance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Zurich Financial Services said Friday
it is selling its British-based Eagle Star Reinsurance subsidiary
to GE Capital of the United States.
	   Eagle Star Re will operate as part of GE Capital's Employers
Reinsurance Corp, Zurich announced.
	   Terms of the sale weren't made public. It excludes most business
undertaken by Eagle Star before 1993. Eagle Star Re's net assets as
of Dec. 31 totaled 232.8 million pounds.
	   Zurich Financial Services, the operating company of Zurich
Allied AG and Allied Zurich PLC, said the deal is part of a
shake-up of its London reinsurance operations, which also includes
a reorganization of Zurich Re London.
	   Zurich Re London's specialities business will be tied to Zurich
Financial Services' similar operation in the United States. Zurich
Re London's reinsurance business will be folded into similar
entities in Zurich Financial Services.
	   Discussions about a possible management buyout of Zurich Re
London were called off, Zurich said.
	   For GE Capital's Employers Reinsurance, the addition of Eagle
Star Re will boost its position in the British broker market, the
announcement said.
	   GE Capital is a subsidiary of General Electric Company of
Stamford, Connecticut in the United States.
	   One of the main activities of reinsurance businesses is insuring
insurance companies.

Saramago recalls other Portuguese writers after winning Nobel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo MAD101-102 &QL; 
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A day after winning the Nobel Prize for
literature, Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago insisted that while
he was delighted to win the award, it could just as easily have
gone to many other Portuguese writers.
	   ``I'm not the only one who deserved it'', said the first
Portuguese-language author to obtain the prestigious award. ``There
have been other Portuguse authors, like Fernando Pessoa, whose work
would justify 1,000 Nobels''
	   Speaking at a packed press coference in Madrid, Saramago joked
about how he heard he had won the prize from German air hostess at
Frankfurt airport as he waited for a flight home to Spain's Canary
Islands.
	   The news left the 75-year-old writer no choice but to leave the
airport and return to the city's book fair to meet the press and
public.
	   ``At that moment I was over the moon and returning to the book
fair the only thing I was worried about was that the whole thing
was an error,'' said Saramago.
	   Dismissing the Vatican paper's disapproval Thursday of his
achievment, Saramago, a known atheist, quipped that he was aware
that ``the Pope had been among the jury, I wouldn't have won the
prize.''
	   ``The Vatican is easily upset'', said Saramago, ``I think that
the Vatican should keep its mind on its prayers and leave people
alone''.
	   Meanwhile in Portugal, where Saramago is scheduled to arrive on
Tuesday, the delight at the Swedish Academy's award for Saramago
was reflected in the daily papers, with even the country's three
daily sports papers ample space to the event.
	   The two leading dailies, Publico and Diario de Noticias, gave
over their entire front pages to Saramago.
	   Lisbon City Hall rushed out posters saying ``Congratulations
Jose Saramago'' which were hung up around the capital during the
night.
	   Saramago was born into a poor, illiterate family in Azinhaga, a
small town near Lisbon. He never finished university but continued
to study part-time while supporting himself as a metalworker.
	   ``Nothing in my life would have led one to think I'd win the
Nobel Prize'', said Saramago. ``I wasn't born to win the Nobel. I
didn't have my own books until I was 18.''
	   His first novel, published in 1947 _ ``Terra do Pecado,'' or
``Country of Sin'' _ was a tale of peasants in moral crisis. For
the next 18 years, Saramago, a communist who opposed the 41-year
conservative dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, published only a few
travel and poetry books while he worked as a journalist.
	   He returned to fiction only after Salazar's regime was toppled
by a military uprising in 1974. Since the 1980s, his works have
been translated into more than 20 languages.
	   Regarding the future, Saramago said the book he is currently
working on will be called ``The Cavern'' and deals with a modern
version of myth of Plato and the cave.

Imports plummet, speaker fears government is dithering

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Imports to Russia plunged 45 percent in September
because most people can no longer afford them, not even necessities
such as medicines, milk and sugar, the government said Friday.
	   Russia depends on imports for almost 80 percent of its consumer
goods _ more than almost any other country in the world _ but the
latest economic crisis has sent prices soaring and the ruble
tumbling.
	   The country hasn't experienced any serious shortages, but store
shelves can be empty for days at a time. The government is planning
to drop or lower import duties on basic foods such as meat, butter
and grain in a bid to restock them.
	   Meanwhile, the speaker of the Russian parliament said he is
concerned that the government has not yet come up with a
comprehensive plan to deal with the economic crisis that erupted
nearly two months ago.
	   ``We are not hurrying the government, but we are a bit worried
by the delay in presenting the anti-crisis program,'' Gennady
Seleznyov, a Communist who is as speaker of the State Duma lower
house, told Russian news agencies.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has been in office since Sept.
11, but his Cabinet is still formulating an economic rescue plan.
The government has said it will be announced before Oct. 20.
	   The Kommersant business newspaper said Friday it had learned one
proposal under consideration: minting a gold coin to raise money to
pay overdue wages and pensions, as well as debts on government
bonds.
	   Kommersant said 20 metric tons (22 tons) of the Central Bank's
500 metric tons (550 tons) of gold reserves would be used in the
project to raise 5 billion rubles (dlrs 316 million).
	   The coins would have a face value of 1,000 rubles (dlrs 63.21)
and 5,000 rubles (dlrs 316) but would contain only 10 rubles (63
cents) and 100 rubles (dlrs 6.30) worth of gold respectively, the
newspaper said.
	   Primakov reiterated that the government's economic plan hinges
on whether the International Monetary Fund releases the next
installment on a dlrs 22.6 billion loan negotiated before Russia's
long-standing economic problems developed into a full-fledged
crisis in mid-August.
	   ``If we get the installment promised by the IMF, there will be
one turn of events, but if we don't get it, another, alternative
version of events will be adopted,'' he told reporters after
meeting with the president of the European Union Commission,
Jacques Santer.
	   Primakov did not say what those alternatives would be, but
Russian media have widely reported they will include printing more
money.
	   Russia badly needs foreign aid to pay off a mountain of debts,
but international lenders have not been willing to provide money
until they know the contents of Russia's economic program.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Friday the IMF told him
during meetings in Washington this week it wants the government to
actually implement the program before it will release more money,
the Interfax news agency said.
	   Meanwhile, the State Statistics Committee said Friday that
overall imports fell 45.4 percent in September compared to a year
earlier, but in some categories the decline was even more dramatic.
	   Pharmaceutical imports were down 71 percent, while milk and
sugar imports both fell more than 80 percent.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The president of Moldova will make a one-day visit
to neighboring Romania on Saturday to present a book he has written
to an international fair and to hold bilateral talks, a news agency

Hingis loses; Lindsay Davenport No. 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS thruout with

<TEXT>
	   FILDERSTADT, Germany (AP) _ Lindsay Davenport, ending a
months-long chase, finally claimed the No. 1 ranking in women's
tennis Friday when Martina Hingis was beaten at the Porsche Grand
Prix.
	   Hingis, who needed to win to hold off the charging American in
the computer rankings, lost a 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 quarterfinal
struggle to Belgium's rising star, Dominique Van Roost.
	   Davenport, the U.S. Open champion, will officially end the Swiss
teenager's 80-week reign at the top in the new rankings to be
released Monday.
	   Hingis, slowed by a a taped ankle from a jogging injury suffered
earlier in the week, battled back several times before Van Roost
blasted a forehand down the line to end the two hour, 18 minute
battle.
	   ``I had a lot of confidence out there. When you have nothing to
lose and the other player has a lot to lose it's easier for you,''
said Van Roost.
	   Van Roost, ranked 12th, constantly caught the 18-year-old Hingis
flatfooted or moving in the wrong direction with her disguised
strokes.
	   Davenport would have taken away Hingis' top ranking, even if the
Swiss teenager had won, if she beat France's Nathalie Tauziat in
her quarterfinal match to be played later in the day.
	   Hingis fought from behind the whole match against Van Roost, who
blitzed Venus Williams in straight sets in her previous match.
	   She trailed 1-4 in the final set, pulling even at 4-4 and then
fought off two match points with hard serves before falling to Van
Roost.
	   ``I think I played the best match of my life,'' said Van Roost,
25, who will break into the top 10 in next week's ranking.
	   Spain's Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, the fourth seed, became the
first player to reach the semifinals after she rallied from 1-4
down in the second set to beat Lisa Raymond of the United States,
1-6, 7-5, 6-2.
	   Raymond, ranked 16th, dominated the Spaniard with hard strokes
and by attacking the net until her forehand errors began mounting
late in the match.
	   Sanchez-Vicario completed her comeback by closing out the match
in one hour, 57 minutes when Raymond double faulted.
	   Hingis' top ranking had been in danger for months from the
improved Davenport and her own slipping game.
	   Last year, at this time, the Swiss player had a whopping 3,095
point lead over then No. 2 Jana Novotna in the computer rankings.
	   But after winning three of the four Grand Slam tournaments last
year and reaching the final of the fourth, the French Open, Hingis
has only captured the Australian Open to open this season.
	   Since then, she has won only three more titles while compiling a
54-10 record in singles. Once completely dominant, Hingis has been
beaten three times this season by Davenport and once each by Venus
Williams and Monica Seles.

Holbrooke holds new talks with Milosevic, while NATO presses ahead

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke tried
to wring concessions out of a defiant Slobodan Milosevic on Friday,
holding new talks aimed at getting the Yugoslav president to comply
with international demands on Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.
	   While top Western officials declined to call it Milosevic's last
chance to avoid attack, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
had warned in dispatching Holbrooke back to Belgrade that ``time is
all but gone'' for a peaceful settlement.
	   Holbrooke left the talks after three hours for consultations by
phone with Albright.
	   Milosevic, meanwhile, issued a statement that was less bellicose
than in previous days. He said he thinks the world will believe
that he has complied with demands to massively draw down troops,
making the ``belligerent attempts'' of a NATO strike unnecessary
and leading to a return of peaceful attempts to solve the crisis.
	   Momentum was still building toward military action.
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, supreme allied commander in Europe, said his
forces are moving ahead with final preparations for an attack.
Speaking in Naples, Italy, he questioned why Milosevic would want
to ``risk the ravages of armed conflict and the destruction of his
own country.''
	   Divisions remained among the 16 NATO allies on the use of force,
however. Germany and Italy, among others, are reluctant to proceed
without a stronger legal basis for action.
	   Alliance ambassadors failed at a meeting in Brussels on Friday
to pressure Russia into dropping its opposition to airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke, who arrived from London where he met with officials
of the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans, said before
Friday's talks that ``the situation remains just as serious at it
has been before.''
	   His fourth round of talks with Milosevic in five days was to
continue in the evening.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and upwards of 300,000
driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb.
28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is
fighting for independence from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by KLA ``terrorists.''
	   There was no sign he was ready for concessions.
	   The Serbian government, effectively under his control, put into
effect Friday a harsh decree tightening state control over
companies and independent media and banning the rebroadcast of
foreign news broadcasts in Serbian.
	   The decree, announced earlier this week, broadens government
authority and institutes punishment for behavior deemed
anti-patriotic.
	   The international demands Holbrooke was presenting to Milosevic
are an immediate end to hostilities, a withdrawal of forces and
heavy armaments to pre-March levels, allowing unhindered work by
humanitarian organizations, cooperation with the International War
Crimes Tribunal, facilitating refugees' return to their homes, and
the start of negotiations with ethnic Albanian leaders on possible
self-rule.
	   In addition, Holbrooke was expected to press for an
international monitoring force to be allowed to oversee compliance.
	   The KLA announced a unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo
starting Friday _ a move that will add to the pressure on Milosevic
to reciprocate. There were no immediate reports on new gunfire or
shelling.
	   Milosevic has refused to openly declare a cease-fire, even
though there has been no major fighting in Kosovo during the past
week and the KLA has been largely routed. He considers the Kosovo
rebels ``terrorists and bandits,'' and any cease-fire on his part
would legitimize them as a negotiating partner, one of his
associates said on condition of anonymity.
	   The Serbian and Yugoslav governments showed little sign that
they are prepared to bow to international pressure, apparently
gambling that Russian opposition to a NATO attack will persuade key
alliance members, including Germany and Italy, to block any action.
	   Dismissing any talk of a rift within NATO, Albright said she
thinks the alliance will agree on an activation order ``in the next
few days'' that would authorize an attack.
	   On Friday, the NATO allies and Russia jointly urged Milosevic to
end the violence in Kosovo, but Russia remained opposed to using
force.
	   A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
allies and Russia agreed that ``we need to give Holbrooke some time
now.''
	   The allies are warning that they envision not just one strike
against Yugoslavia but a series of air attacks, gradually
intensifying.
	   ``We have made it perfectly plain that NATO's planning is not
for one rap over the knuckles,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook told the British Broadcasting Corp. on Friday.

Russian parliamentary panel to reach verdict on impeaching Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A parliamentary commission seeking to impeach
President Boris Yeltsin will complete its report Monday, but it
remains unclear when any impeachment motion would be put on
parliament's agenda.
	   Supporters of the impeachment motion accuse Yeltsin of
instigating the Soviet Union's collapse, launching the botched war
in Chechnya, ruining Russia's economy and military, and sending
troops and tanks against hard-liners in the former Russian
parliament in October 1993.
	   The impeachment campaign by the Communist-led opposition began
long before the current economic crisis in Russia. But it appears
likely to fail, as have several previous efforts, in part because
the constitution gives Yeltsin an upper hand in dealing with
parliament.
	   The commission is to reach a verdict and compile a report by
Monday night, commission chairman Vadim Filimonov said Friday,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   An impeachment motion requires a two-thirds majority vote in
parliament's lower house, the State Duma.
	   If it passed there, the motion would then need to be approved by
a two-thirds majority in three other bodies: the upper house or
Federation Council, and both the Constitutional and Supreme Courts.
	   The development would be extremely unlikely, as both bodies are
largely made up of Yeltsin supporters.

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Top seeds Goran Ivanisevic and Michael
Chang continued their streak of straight-set victories Friday to
advance to the semifinals of the Shanghai Open.
	   Ivanisevic defeated Denmark's Kenneth Carlsen 6-3, 7-6 (7-2).
The Croatian will play sixth-seeded Ramon Delgado in Saturday's
semifinals. Delgado, of Paraguay, dropped a hotly contested
second-set but battled back to beat Australian Michael Tebbutt,
6-4, 6-7 (6-8), 6-3.
	   Crowd-favorite Michael Chang of the United States handily
vanquished No. 8 Todd Woodbridge of Australia 6-2, 6-2.
	   Chang faces fifth-seeded Paul Haarhuis, Netherlands, Saturday.
Haarhuis swept Australian Mark Woodforde, 7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (7-4).
	   Neither Ivanisevic or Chang has dropped a set in three rounds of
play.

 &UR; Ex-general named foreign minister, put in charge of Mideast talks
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs; changes byline
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After 15 years of disgrace and painstaking
attempts at political rehabilitation, Ariel Sharon returned to the
center of power Friday.
	   The burly ex-general and war hero with a deep distrust of the
Arabs was named Israel's new foreign minister and put in charge of
negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who once tried to keep Sharon
out of his Cabinet altogether, made the appointment reluctantly and
with his back to the wall.
	   Netanyahu is under heavy U.S. pressure to conclude a deal on a
West Bank pullback at next week's Mideast summit in Washington, but
knows that hardliners in his coalition may topple him if he does.
	   By signing up Sharon _ who until today refuses to shake
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's hand _ Netanyahu silences his
critics and assures the stability of his government. The
70-year-old Sharon is the only Cabinet hawk with enough clout to
lead or stifle a right-wing revolt.
	   ``I think that in return for the appointment, Sharon has agreed
to cooperate with Netanyahu in cutting a deal on a troop
redeployment,'' said Hanan Krystal, a political commentator for
Israel radio. ``There are no free lunches.''
	   For the portly Sharon, who has been likened to a bulldozer for
his uncompromising style of political maneuvering, the appointment
caps a slow political comeback from the dark days in 1983 when he
was forced to step down as defense minister.
	   At the time, an Israeli tribunal looking into the 1982 Israeli
invasion of Lebanon found he was indirectly responsible for a
massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees at the Beirut camps of
Sabra and Shatilla by Christian Lebanese militiamen.
	   The brilliant military tactician found himself disgraced and
forced to abandon hopes of ever becoming prime minister. Over the
next decade, he held only second-string portfolios, including
infrastructure minister in the Netanyahu government.
	   Still, even in minor posts, his impact was always felt.
	   As housing minister from 1990-1992, he presided over the biggest
construction drive in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip since Israel captured the lands in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Trying to clear his name, Sharon filed two libel suits and gave
countless lectures in which he defended his invasion of Lebanon _
widely seen here as Israel's first war of choice that needlessly
claimed the lives of hundreds of Israeli soldiers.
	   To the Palestinians, Sharon cuts an ambiguous figure.
	   He is reviled for waging for against PLO guerrillas, for Sabra
and Shatilla and for the land grab in what the Palestinians see as
their future state. However, many Palestinians also believe that
once he negotiates a deal he will keep it, unlike Netanyahu who is
not considered a man of his word.
	   Palestinian reaction was guarded Friday. ``It's up to them (the
Israelis),'' Arafat said when asked about Sharon's new role.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Sharon would now have
an opportunity to clear his name. ``We wish him ... to treat the
Palestinian Authority from his new position as a political official
and not as a killer,'' Asfour said.
	   In his first assignment as foreign minister, Sharon will
accompany Netanyahu to Thursday's summit at secluded Wye Plantation
near Washington.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton hopes several days of intensive
talks between Netanyahu and Arafat will finally produce agreement
on an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank, in
exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   If a deal is reached at Wye Plantation, Netanyahu is ready to
immediately start talks on a permanent peace agreement that would
set Israel's final borders with the Palestinians and determine the
future of Jerusalem and the Jewish settlements.
	   Netanyahu has already agreed to hand over 13 percent of the
land, with some conditions. The main argument now is over what
constitutes a good-faith Palestinian effort to prevent terror
attacks on Israelis.
	   It is not clear whether at the upcoming summit, Sharon will only
whisper in Netanyahu's ear from the sidelines or sit at the table
with Clinton and Arafat.
	   However, he quickly made it clear that he has not gone soft.
	   Israel TV quoted Sharon as saying Friday that he hasn't changed
his mind about refusing to shake Arafat's hand and that he remained
opposed to a 13 percent pullback.
	   ``My appointment will help (the government) to stand firm on the
political and security interests of Israel,'' Sharon told TV.

Guy Forget named French Davis Cup, Fed Cup captain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Guy Forget will succeed Yannick Noah as captain of
the French Davis Cup and Fed Cup tennis teams, the French Tennis
Federation (FFT) announced Friday.
	   The federation confirmed the proposal of Jean-Claude Massias,
its national technical director.
	   As a player, Forget, 33, won the Davis Cup in 1991 and 1996 and
lifted 12 titles.
	   ``Guy Forget has the unanimous confidence of French players and
is a man respected by everyone for what he accomplished during an
exemplary sports career'' said Christian Bimes, FFT president.
	   Forget's first competition as captain comes in April 1999, when
France hosts the Netherlands in the Davis Cup.

Lawyer charged with defrauding clients
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A prominent Kingston lawyer, company
director and socialite has been charged with defrauding two clients
out of dlrs 85,700.
	   Lawyer Sonia Ellen Jones, 52, was arrested Wednesday by police
fraud squad detectives on charges she agreed to sell a plot of land
for two clients, then pocketed part of the proceeds.
	   The two clients, Australian-born artist Colin Garland and
Kingston playwright Lloyd Reckord, claim they gave her the land to
sell in 1995. She told them she would invest the dlrs 200,000
(Jamaican dlrs 7 million) from the sale, according to police.
	   Garland and Reckord said they received interest payments for
some time, but that the money stopped coming in 1996.
	   Resident Magistrate Martin Gayle freed Jones on dlrs 85,700 bail
and ordered her to turn in her passport to police.

Retiring ``La Bomba'' to ski last gate in December
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Retiring world, Olympic and World Cup
champion Alberto Tomba will run his last race in December on the
hill where he captured his first World Cup victory 11 years ago.
	   Organizers announced Friday that the 31-year-old Italian, who
announced his retirement from skiing last Saturday, will compete in
a giant slalom exhibition at Sestriere on Dec. 30.
	   A huge crowd will be expected to pay tribute to Tomba in his
last time on skis.
	   Tomba, Italy's most successful and popular skier, won his first
World Cup race at Sestriere, in Italy's eastern Alps, in 1987.
	   Since then the man nicknamed La Bomba has won 50 World Cup
races, one overall World Cup title, eight discipline titles, three
Olympic gold medals and two world titles.
	   Tomba, who plans an acting debut later this year, will compete
in the Sestriere exhibition against seven top-ranked World Cup
skiers.
	   The race, in three runs, will be determined on combined time of
the two fastest heats.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Declaring that women are ``fed up''
with male-dominated government, female politicians from Germany's
victorious Social Democratic Party met Friday in Bonn to coordinate
demands for more power in the incoming government.
	   ``Today's chances must be seized today!'' said Karin Junker,
head of the Social Democrats' women's association. She called on
women to press their demands during coalition talks with the
smaller environmental Greens party that are expected to end next
week.
	   Emboldened by the prospect of a center-left coalition that has
generous quotas for women, female politicians across Germany sense
the chance to shape the agenda.
	   The Social Democrats official earmark 40 percent of government
and party positions for women. Combined with the Greens' 50 percent
quota, women could expect to secure more posts than any in the new
government headed by chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder _
theoretically anyway.

Bormio to host ''mini-Olympics'' in 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ For the first time in ski history, the World
Cup finals of five disciplines will be held in the same Alpine area
- Bormio and neighboring resorts - in March 2000.
	   The U.S. venue of Salt Lake City will host the finals of a
possibly expanded World Cup program in 2004, the newly-elected
president of the International Ski Federation (FIS) announced
Friday.
	   Gianfranco Kasper said that the ''mini Olympics,'' intended to
draw attention of ski fans and boost television audience, will be
held every four years, when neither Olympic Games nor World
Championships are scheduled.
	   Salt Lake City will host the next winter Olympics in 2002. Vail
and St. Anton will organize the world championships in 1999 and
2001.
	   Kasper said Salt Lake City organizers will rely on the Olympic
infrastructures to host the World Cup finals in 2004.
	   In March 2000, the World Cup finals of Alpine skiing, ski cross
country, Nordic combined, freestyle and snowboard will be held in
Bormio, Santa Caterina, Livigno and St. Moritz.
	   St. Moritz, which will host the nordic combined, is in Swiss
territory but less than 30 miles from Bormio, the Italian Alpine
resort north of Milan. Santa Caterina and Livigno are within 15
miles from Bormio.
	   Kasper, in Milan to attend a ski conference, said World Cup
finals of biathlon and telemark may be added to the Bormio program.
	   The tentative date for the 2000 finals was March 15-19,
organizers said.
	   So far World Cup finals of ski disciplines have been organized
in distant venues of different countries.
	   Bormio has organized the World Alpine ski Championships in 1985
and is the yearly site of a World Cup downhill.

 &UR; Yemen wins island dispute with Eritrea in international arbitration
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new grafs 7 and 8 giving brief details of
verdict. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo ASM101

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ An international arbitration panel
on Friday ruled in favor of Yemen in its dispute with Eritrea over
three Red Sea islands, a quarrel that had threatened a major
shipping route.
	   Eritrea said it will abide by the decision.
	   The official Yemeni news agency SABA said Prime Minister Abdel
Karim al-Iryani sent a message of congratulations to President Ali
Abdullah Saleh over the decision by the International Court of
Arbitration, which is based in The Hague.
	   In the Eritrean capital of Asmara, Yemen's acting ambassador,
Ahmed Hassan, called the decision a ``victory for Eritrea and
Yemen.''
	   ``You may lose something but you win something more important:
living together in peace as good neighbors and setting an example
for others in the region,'' he said.
	   Yemen and Eritrea both claimed the three islands, one of which,
the Greater Hanish, was captured by Eritrea in a brief battle in
December 1995. Yemen retained control of the other two islands,
Lesser Hanish and Zuqar.
	   The tribunal awarded Greater Hanish, Lesser Hanish and Jabal
Zuqar Island to Yemen, according to the verdict.
	   The verdict stipulated that the decision should be complied with
within 90 days.
	   An Eritrean government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Eritrea will now withdraw its troops from Greater
Hanish.
	   An Eritrean Foreign Ministry statement said the tribunal gave
Eritrea control of three minor islands and four islets.
	   ``This is the only civilized way of settling disputes,'' New
Eritrea, a government newspaper, said.
	   The islands, where Yemen has granted oil concessions, sit across
one of the world's major shipping lanes, 160 kilometers (100 miles)
north of the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the southern entrance to the
Red Sea.
	   Shipping security in the area is of vital importance to Saudi
Arabia, which has an oil export terminal in Yanbu further north,
and to Egypt, whose revenues from the Suez Canal linking the Red
Sea to the Mediterranean are crucial to its economy.
	   Eritrea and Yemen decided in May 1996 to have the dispute
settled by the International Court of Arbitration, a low-profile
panel of international experts. The court's decisions are legally
binding.
	   The ICA, which arbitrates behind closed door, is considered a
more discreet arena to settle disputes than the better-known
International Court of Justice, which is housed in the same Hague
building.
	   The ICA's arbitration on the Yemen-Eritrea dispute was held in
London.
	   Hassan, the acting ambassador, said the decision leaves Yemen
free to develop the islands for tourism, scuba diving, oil and
other enterprises.

Belarusian lawmaker vows to ``punish'' NATO if it strikes on

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A Belarusian lawmaker threatened Friday to
``punish'' everyone who takes part in NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia, from heads of governments down to rank-and-file
soldiers.
	   The comments by Sergei Kostyan, head of the parliament's
anti-NATO group, followed Belarusian President Alexander
Lukashenko's promise to give military aid to Yugoslavia if it is
attacked by NATO.
	   Kostyan, who also leads an alliance of lawmakers from Slavic
countries, said that both groups would ``track down all those
taking part in the conflict: soldiers, commanders, politicians and
presidents.''
	   ``We will punish everyone,'' he said at a news conference.
	   When asked to elaborate, Kostyan said he meant legal punishment
through courts, not acts of terror.
	   Belarus and neighboring Russia oppose NATO airstrikes against
Serbia, which makes up most up present day Yugoslavia, and favor a
diplomatic solution to the crisis in Kosovo province. Belarus,
Russia and Serbia are all Slavic countries that also share the
Orthodox religion.
	   Kostyan also accused the West of plotting aggression against
Belarus, which has been criticized for Lukashenko's authoritarian
policies, including his crackdown on dissent and media freedom in
the former Soviet republic of 10 million people.
	   ``In Kosovo they (the West) are staging a dress rehearsal for
their action in Belarus,'' Kostyan said. ``It will be easy to find
collaborators and traitors here.''
	   Lukashenko reiterated Friday his readiness to extend military
aid to Yugoslavia in an interview with the Interfax news agency.
	   Belarus has ``sufficient capabilities to provide the most modern
arms to combat both missiles and aircraft,'' Lukashenko was quoted
as saying.
	   ``In the even that the conflict does take place, we will provide
military assistance. Why? And who will be the next? Can we be the
next state?''
	   Lukashenko said airstrikes against Yugoslavia would create
``such a slaughter that the heat would spread throughout Western
Europe.''
	   ``I think there are enough sober people in Western Europe to
prevent the conflict,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, the Liberal Democratic Party of Belarus, a group
linked to Russian ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, said in a
statement Friday that it had started recruiting former officers to
fight alongside the Serbs in case of NATO airstrikes.

	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ While the top-seeded trio of Tiger
Woods, John Daly and Mark O'Meara cruised to 3-0 sweep against
Japan, Ernie Els and defending titlist South Africa slumped to
Germany at the Dunhill Cup Friday and Nick Price's Zimbabwe
collapsed against France.
	   Defying the howling gales and heavy rain sweeping across St.
Andrews in the early part of his round, Woods carded a 2-under 70
to beat Katsumasa Miyamoto by seven. After his 66 against England
Thursday, he has an 8-under total for two rounds at the home of
golf.
	   Daly made 77 but still beat Nobuo Serizawa by three and O'Meara
completed the sweep with a 5-stroke victory over Hiroyuki Fujita
after a 70.
	   The Americans will meet Sweden Saturday for a place in the
semifinal after the Swedes scored a 3-0 victory over England.
	   Els, who was two up at the turn, lost to Sven Struver at the
second extra hole after they each carded 4-over 76s in atrocious
conditions at the home of golf.
	   That meant Germany won 2-1 after Thomas Gogele edged David Frost
at the second extra hole and South Africa's Retief Goosen had
downed Alex Cejka by one. They also were high scoring matches with
Frost and Gogele each scoring 78 and Goosen winning his match
despite a 76.
	   Price defied the conditions with a 2-under 70 to beat Frenchman
Olivier Edmond by eight strokes. But he was playing last and the
damage had already been done with Mark McNulty returning an 81 to
lose by 10 to Jean Van de Velde and Tony Johnstone throwing away a
5-stroke lead after 12 to lose by two to Thomas Levet.
	   Johnstone was still four ahead before he went to 14 and 15 and
triple bogeyed both. He finished with a 79 after an 8-over homeward
nine of 44.
	   McNulty hit trouble between 13 and 17 with four bogeys and a
double bogey for a 9-over round which had begun with a birdie.
	   Australia gained its second 3-0 victory of the championship,
outplaying South Korea after crushing Argentina on Thursday.
	   First out for Australia, Craig Parry edged Shin Yong-jin at the
first extra hole after they had tied on 75. Stuart Appleby returned
a 73 to beat Kang Wook-soon by four and Steve Elkington's level par
72 beat Kim Jong-duck by five.
	   In other group games Friday, New Zealand downed Argentina 2-1,
Scotland scored a 2-1 victory over Ireland and Spain edged debutant
China 2-1 despite a 1-shot loss by Jose Maria Olazabal, who was
penalized a stroke at the ninth.

Moscow mayor: Unrest possible if economic problems not solved
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov warned Friday of popular
unrest in Russia if the government fails to solve the country's
economic troubles, a news agency said.
	   ``We are standing near a point at which society stops listening
to the authorities,'' Luzhkov told a meeting at the residence of
Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexy II.
	   ``We have arrived at a point at which society will either start
stabilization in the economic, social and spiritual spheres, or the
state will cease to exist,'' Luzhkov was quoted as saying by the
Interfax news agency.
	   Luzhkov also appealed to local authorities to support the
federal government and help it develop a long-awaited economic
program, Interfax reported.
	   Luzhkov, a powerful and popular Moscow boss, is a potential
candidate for the 2000 presidential election.

Italian premier loses confidence vote, forced to resign

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A cost-cutting government that had been Italy's
second-longest-lasting since World War II collapsed Friday,
throwing into question Italy's next phase of financial reforms and
participation in any NATO attack on Yugoslavia.
	   Premier Romano Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, center-left coalition had
held together during its drive to qualify for Europe's common
currency but lost momentum and fell apart after it reached its
goal. Communists brought about its end by withdrawing support over
Prodi's 1999 budget, saying they wanted more spending for jobs.
	   Their rebellion forced Friday's vote of confidence in the
Chamber of Deputies. Prodi lost it by a single vote, 313-312, when
a lawmaker in his own coalition defected.
	   Opposition lawmakers burst into applause. Prodi slipped away
from the presidential palace so quickly that he outpaced his
security agents and briefly found himself facing reporters alone.
``I'm not bitter,'' Prodi said.
	   He submitted his resignation to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro,
who asked him to keep leading the government for the time being.
	   Scalfaro must decide whether to call early elections _ a step
few want and few expect _ or ask Prodi or someone else to try to
form a new government.
	   Centrist leader Francesco Cossiga appealed to leading parties of
the left and right to work together to form a caretaker government
that would see Italy through tough spots ahead, including passage
of the budget.
	   ``I ask them because as the major political forces, only they
can form a government with the authority needed to face the
delicate international financial situation and the crisis in
Kosovo,'' Cossiga said.
	   A no-frills, no-thrills leader, Prodi had came to power after
Italy briefly was led by a center-right coalition headed by media
magnate Silvio Berlusconi, now the opposition leader.
	   Prodi presided over budget cuts and a temporary tax increase
needed to get Italy's economy in shape for the 1999 debut of
Europe's common currency. It qualified for the euro debut earlier
this year, impressing _ and surprising _ many fellow European Union
members with less volatile politics.
	   Prodi would have had to keep on cutting costs to stay in line
with requirements for the European Monetary Union. Communists
wanted more spending, not less.
	   To woo them going into Friday's vote, Prodi pledged that his
government would work to make law a 35-hour work week _ their pet
project.
	   He also held back from endorsing NATO airstrikes on Serbia
without specific backing from the U.N. Security Council, also a
Communist demand.
	   Italy is just across the Adriatic from Yugoslavia, and its bases
and ports could be important to any NATO attack over Yugoslavia's
treatment of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Parliament would have to
approve Italy's participation.
	   The opposition contended that even a win wouldn't have avoided
more crises for Prodi.
	   Winning the confidence vote would ``only put off the dramatic
question of Kosovo,'' said Rocco Buttiglione, a leading centrist
voice.
	   ``Now we should go to the polls,'' said Berlusconi.
	   However, analysts predicted a new majority will be found to pass
the budget, without new elections.
	   ``Political instability will be limited in the next few days,''
said Bruno Rovelli, an economist with Citibank in Milan.
	   Prodi led Italy's 55th government since World War II. He
outlasted all but Bettino Craxi, a Socialist who served 3 1/2 years
in two back-to-back stints from 1983 to 1987.

Yeltsin reaffirms opposition to NATO attack in Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with parliamentary committee saying it may recommend
breaking treaty with NATO. TRIMS pvs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin on Friday reiterated
Russia's strong objection to NATO's plans for possible airstrikes
against Yugoslavia, and called for a peaceful settlement of the
crisis in Kosovo.
	   ``We must not allow NATO strikes,'' Yeltsin said before meeting
with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Russian media said. ``We want
to achieve a political, peaceful solution without the use of
military force, and, I think, we shall succeed.''
	   Russia has condemned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, but has staunchly opposed
use of force against Yugoslavia.
	   Moscow warned that NATO action against Yugoslavia would only
lead to more bloodshed in Kosovo province.
	   Sergeyev, who has just returned from a trip to Greece, told
Yeltsin on Friday that Greek officials ``fully shared'' the Russian
view that the crisis should be settled only by political means.
	   ``If (NATO) strikes are carried out, that isn't going to be an
one-sided punishment of Yugoslavia,'' Sergeyev told reporters. ``It
will be a combat. Yugoslavia is determined to fight until the
end.''
	   Milosevic is ``ready to sit down at the negotiation table, but
so far there is nobody at the other side of the table,'' he added.
	   Meanwhile, the chairman of the Russian parliamentary defense
committee said lawmakers may recommend that ``the treaty with NATO
be abandoned'' if airstrikes are conducted.
	   Russia signed an agreement with NATO in May 1997 that sets up a
new consultative mechanism and spelled out NATO's intentions as it
expands into Central and Eastern Europe.
	   NATO views the treaty ``as a concession to us and this treaty
does not work today,'' said Roman Popkovich, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Attacking Serbia would light ``the torch of a new war,'' he
said.

Rejected homosexual rights bill to get second chance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction, bill to be reintroduced &QL;

 &UR; By ELAINE GANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Opposition lawmakers on Friday swiftly rejected a
controversial bill aimed at giving legal status to unmarried
couples, including homosexuals.
	   But the surprise maneuver to defeat the leftist majority is but
a reprieve.
	   The minister in charge of parliamentary relations, Daniel
Vaillant, announced that the bill would be reintroduced, apparently
with a few perfunctory changes, in two weeks, on Oct. 24.
	   ``This bill ... is not dead,'' Vaillant said.
	   Howls echoed through the chamber following the hand vote to
declare the bill ``inadmissible,'' meaning lawmakers would not even
consider the text, sponsored by the Socialist Party of Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   The procedure means the bill _ which opponents fear will
undermine the traditional family _ runs counter to the Constitution
and need not be examined. It passed because numerous leftist
lawmakers missed the session and could not outnumber opponents in
the vote.
	   The so-called Civil Solidarity Pact, or PACS, had been expected
to pass in the leftist-dominated National Assembly, despite a rough
ride, including up to 800 expected amendments.
	   But the centrist Union for French Democracy put the motion of
``inadmissibility'' on the floor. And it passed.
	   Justice Minister, 7th graf, 2nd Ld (eg)

Retiring ski star to run his last race in December
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to western Alps in fourth graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Retiring ski star Alberto Tomba will run his
very last race in December at the venue where he captured his first
World Cup victory 11 years ago.
	   Organizers announced Friday that the 31-year-old Italian skier,
who announced his official retirement from skiing last Saturday,
will compete in a giant slalom exhibition at Sestriere on Dec. 30.
	   A huge crowd was expected to pay Tomba a tribute in occasion of
his last show on skis.
	   Tomba, Italy's most successful and popular skier, won his first
World Cup race at Sestriere, in Italy's western Alps, in 1987.
	   Since then the man nicknamed La Bomba (the Bomb) because of his
explosive style piled up 50 World Cup wins, one overall World Cup
title, three Olympic golds and two world titles.
	   Tomba, who plans an acting debut later this year, will be
competing in the Sestriere exhibition against seven top ranking
World Cup skiers.
	   The race, in three runs, will award victory on the basis of the
combined time of the two fastest heats.

Hingis loses; Lindsay Davenport new world No. 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS details about Davenport; RECASTS throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FILDERSTADT, Germany (AP) _ Lindsay Davenport became the world's
No. 1 women's tennis player without swinging a racket Friday when
Martina Hingis was beaten at the Porsche Grand Prix.
	   Hingis needed to win to hold off the charging American in the
rankings but lost a 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 quarterfinal struggle to
Belgium's rising star, Dominique Van Roost.
	   Davenport, the U.S. Open champion, will officially end the Swiss
teenager's 80-week reign at the top in the new rankings to be
released Monday.
	   Hingis, slowed by a a taped ankle from a jogging injury suffered
earlier in the week, fought back from the brink of defeat several
times before Van Roost blasted a forehand down the line to end the
two hour, 18 minute battle.
	   Davenport, the daughter of a former U.S. Olympic volleyball
player, becomes the ninth player to be ranked No. 1 since the
computer rankings were started in 1975.
	   It highlights a remarkable year for Davenport, whose ranking
soared while she dropped 35 pounds earlier this season. She also
won her first Grand Slam in New York.
	   But Davenport isn't sure her new status as the world's
top-ranked player will bring her the same fame as predecessors like
Martina Navratilova or Chris Evert.
	   ``It's a little bit like with Pete Sampras,'' said Davenport,
22. ``He can do what he wants and people still find him boring.''
	   Davenport would have taken away Hingis' top ranking, even if the
Swiss teenager had won, if she beat France's Nathalie Tauziat in
her quarterfinal match to be played later in the day.
	   Hingis was in trouble from the start against the 12th-ranked Van
Roost, falling behind 3-0 in the first set.
	   Van Roost, who blitzed Venus Williams in straight sets in her
previous match, constantly caught the 18-year-old Hingis flatfooted
or moving in the wrong direction with her disguised strokes.
	   But Hingis came alive and fought from behind in both the final
two sets. She trailed 1-4 in the third set, then pulled even at 4-4
and fought off two match points before losing.
	   ``I think I played the best match of my life. But it's easy to
play well when you have nothing to lose and the other player has a
lot to lose,'' said Van Roost, 25, who will break into the top 10
in next week's ranking.
	   Hingis' top ranking had been in danger for months as Davenport
improved, while her own game slipped in the face of a wave of new
talented players.
	   Last year, at this time, the Swiss player had a whopping 3,095
point lead over then No. 2 Jana Novotna in the computer rankings.
	   Davenport, who turned pro in 1993, was inspired by Jennifer
Capriati capturing the Olympic single's title a year earlier.
	   Until then, the 1.98 meter (6-ft-3) had been told she was too
tall for the sport and should follow in the footsteps of her
volleyball-playing family.
	   ``I thought that was the coolest thing that could happen to
someone. I knew then, at the latest, that I had chosen the right
path,'' said Davenport, who also captured Olympic gold in 1996.
	   Spain's Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, the fourth seed, became the
first player to reach the semifinals after she rallied from 1-4
down in the second set to beat Lisa Raymond of the United States,
1-6, 7-5, 6-2.

Senate rejects changes to law on communist files
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The rightist-dominated Senate on Friday
rejected amendments proposed by the leftist president to a draft
law that would allow Poles to look into their communist-era secret
police files.
	   The bill, passed by parliament's lower chamber in September, is
part of Poland's effort to deal with its communist past. It also is
considered a way to uncover secret service collaborators in order
to bar them from top state posts.
	   Under the bill, an Institute of National Remembrance would be
set up to collect communist files from 1944-89, as well as
documents of Stalinist and Nazi crimes. The institute would make
the files available to individual victims of the totalitarian
regimes and reveal who informed on them.
	   President Aleksander Kwasniewski, an ex-communist, had suggested
that all Poles should get access to their files, not only those who
suffered persecution from the communist Security Service until
1989.
	   The president also wanted to have some influence on the
composition of a committee that will oversee the opening of the
files, but the Senate rejected his proposals.
	   Presidential aides say Kwasniewski, who has to sign any law
enacted by parliament, would reject the bill in its present form.
	   Supported by center and right-wing parties, the bill has come
under fire from Kwasniewski's ex-communist colleagues who argue
their political opponents want to use it against them.
	   Since toppling the communists, Poles have been divided on
whether old secret service files should be opened at all. Some
argue the files were falsified by the secret police and that part
of the files were destroyed when the Iron Curtain fell.
	   Others insist those collaborating with the secret police should
be made known to the public and barred from holding public office.

Kyrgyzstan to keep troops in Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kyrgyzstan will keep its troops in Tajikistan
until the middle of next year to guard against a possible spillover
of violence from neighboring Afghanistan, a news agency said
Friday.
	   Russia has a 25,000-strong force in Tajikistan, and other former
Soviet republics also keep smaller numbers in the Central Asian
country. The countries in the region are also worried about a
possible influx of refugees and weapons.
	   Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev has decided the situation is too
unstable for his troops to leave, and has ordered them to stay
through June 1999, the Interfax news agency reported.

Forensic experts find new mass grave in Bosnia

<TEXT>
	   DONJA GLUMINA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ During a three-day
period, forensic experts found more than 170 bodies in one of the
biggest mass graves discovered in Bosnia so far, officials said
Friday.
	   ``We anticipate we'll find 100 more'' bodies, said U.S.
pathologist Dr. Jill Gould, a forensic pathologist from Wichita,
Kansas, and a member of the exhumation team .
	   Also on Friday, forensic investigators exhumed 25 bodies,
dressed in civilian clothing, from a mass grave in Vukovar, an
eastern Croatian city formerly held by rebel Serbs.
	   In cooperation with Physicians For Human Rights, a Boston-based
group, and the state-run Commission for Missing Persons in Bosnia,
an exhumation team found the new mass grave in the village of Donja
Glumina, about 35 kilometers ( 22 miles) east of Tuzla, on
Serb-held territory.
	   The bodies were believed to be Bosnian Muslims killed at the
very beginning of the Bosnian war in 1992.
	   Amor Masovic, the head of the Commission for Missing People,
said it was believed that the remains found were of some of several
thousand people missing since 1992 from neighboring villages. He
also said that the grave was found with the help of people who
witnessed the burial by soldiers of the former Yugoslav Army.
	   One of the witnesses, a 51-year-old man of Donja Glumina
identified only by his initials R. M., said that in May 1992, he
saw trucks with bodies in bags and soldiers placing the bodies in
the prepared grave.
	   Most of the bodies discovered are in military plastic bags,
orderly placed in the mass grave.
	   About 1, 800 bodies have been dug from different mass graves in
this area, most of them believed to be victims killed after Bosnian
Serbs overran the town of Srebrenica in July 1995.
	   In Croatia, the 25 bodies were discovered in Celije, a suburb of
Vukovar near the Croatian border with Yugoslavia, some 355
kilometers (220 miles) east of Zagreb.
	   Ivan Grujic, who heads a national commission for prisoners and
missing persons, told Croatia's state-run HINA news agency that the
victims whose remains were found in Celije were killed while the
area was controlled by rebel Serbs following their rebellion
against Croatian independence in 1991.

Page gets go ahead to fight for WBA welterweight crown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with court clearance for bout to go ahead, ADDS weigh
in &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The WBA welterweight bout between Andrey Pestrayev
and James Page will go ahead after a Paris judge on Friday
overturned a challenge from a Mexican boxer who claimed that he
should be fighting for the vacant belt.
	   Russian Pestrayev is the No. 1 contender for the WBA crown.
	   After the WBA paired him with No. 3 contender California-based
Page, Mexico's Jose Luis Lopez, the No. 2, mounted a legal
challenge.
	   On Tuesday, a New Jersey state judge ruled that the WBA could
not award the title to the winner of Saturday's Paris bout.
	   But on Friday afternoon a Paris judge overruled that decision
and sanctioned the fight.
	   The French judge backed the WBA's claim that Lopez had been
suspended for taking banned drugs when the WBA was arranging the
contest and said that the legal challenge had been mounted too
late, Nathalie Cristol, a spokeswoman for the fight's organizers
told The Associated Press on Friday.
	   ``This fight has been planned for two months and Lopez went to
court only three days ago,'' she said. ``Any other decision would
have been a disaster for the credibility of boxing,'' she said.
	   Lopez, if he is still No. 2, will have a chance to fight for the
title within 90 days, Cristol said.
	   Pestrayev, the 1997 European welterweight champion, will start
as favorite.
	   The 29-year-old from Ufa turned pro after the 1992 Olympics in
Barcelona, and Saturday's bout would likely be his last crack at a
world title.
	   Page, 27, is 21-3 and fighting for his first world title.
	   Pestrayev and Page both weighed in at 140 pounds Friday.
	   Spectators at the Paris' Bercy arena Saturday will witness a
second world title bout, with Khalid Rahilou of France defending
his WBA super lightweight crown against Washington D.C.-fighter
Sharmba Mitchell.
	   Rahilou, 32, is a former kickboxing world champion, and defends
the title he won from American Frankie Randall in January, and
retained in July against another U.S. fighter, Marty Jakubowski.
	   Mitchell, 28, is 42-2 and fights in Don King's stable.
	   Saturday's fight will be his first shot at a world title.
	   ``I don't know a lot about Rahilou,'' Mitchell said. ``But he
has never faced a man as quick or as tough as me. Of course, I
would have preferred to confront him in the United States but my
victory over him in France will be even more valuable.''
	   Marvin Smith, his manager, said Rahilou is Mitchell's toughest
opponent to date.
	   ``Rahilou has much better movement than the fighters Sharmba has
faced before. He isn't going to just stand there and wait to get
hit,'' he told the AP.
	   Rahilou and Mitchell both weighed in at 147 pounds.

Ince given three-match international ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ England midfielder Paul Ince was given
a three-match international ban Friday when UEFA found him guilty
of showing dissent to the referee who sent him off in last month's
Euro 2000 qualifer against Sweden.
	   Ince, already serving an automatic one-match suspension for
being red-carded in England's 2-1 loss in Stockholm, was suspended
for two more games and will not be eligible for England until a
return match against Sweden in June.
	   The suspension will keep Ince out of Saturday's match against
Bulgaria at Wembley and Euro 2000 qualifiers against Luxembourg on
Wednesday and Poland in March.
	   The UEFA disciplinary committee met Thursday but did not
announce the suspension until Friday.
	   Ince was charged with making inappropriate comments to referee
Pierluigi Collina after he was shown the red card.
	   Meanwhile, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson is still
waiting to learn his fate after he was accused of criticizing
referee Stefano Braschi in United's Champions League first-round
3-3 tie with Barcelona.
	   Ferguson said the referee had ``a stinker'' after the Italian
official awarded two crucial penalties and red-carded a Manchester
United player in the Old Trafford match.
	   England's Football Association was also fined 27,000 pounds
(dlrs 45,500) when a UEFA committee ruled that English fans made
racist chants against a Swedish player and later damaged Rasunda
stadium.

	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Australia and New Zealand both
equalled the record for the largest margin of victory in an
international soccer match Thursday, scoring 21-0 routs in the
opening games of the Oceania Women's Championship.
	   Cheryl Salisbury scored five goals and nine others scored for
Australia in its rout over American Samoa, which didn't get a shot
on goal in its first-ever international.
	   The Maltidas' previous largest margin of victory was 13-0 over
Fiji in 1983.
	   Pernille Andersen scored six for New Zealand as the Kiwis ran
over Western Samoa in the other game.
	   The winner of the six-nation event qualifies for the Women's
World Cup next summer in the United States.
	   The routs equalled 21-0 victories set three times previously in
women's soccer, twice this year.
	   Canada beat Puerto Rico in the CONCACAF Women's World Cup
qualifying tournament in August and Japan clobbered Guam in the
Asian Women's Championship in December. China achieved the record
first in the 1995 Asian Women's Championship over the Philippines.
	   The largest margin of victory for a men's international is 17-0,
set when Iran beat Maldives in June last year in qualifying for the
1998 World Cup.

Home for Holocaust survivors opens in Lithuania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ As part of a German-funded
compensation program, the first in a series of retirement homes for
Holocaust survivors opened in Lithuania on Friday.
	   The center, which has 30 two-room apartments, a dining room and
a doctor's office, was paid for by a German government fund.
	   During Germany's 1941-44 occupation, over 90 percent of
Lithuania's 240,000 Jews were murdered _ one of the highest rates
in Nazi-occupied Europe.
	   Today, fewer than a thousand Holocaust survivors remain in
Lithuania.
	   After Lithuania became independent in 1991, Jewish groups began
lobbying for compensation similar to that provided by Germany to
Jews living in the West and in Israel.
	   But while many Lithuanian Jews called for direct cash payments,
Bonn refused, opting instead to spend some two million German marks
building health care facilities, like the new retirement home.
	   Some Jewish leaders in Lithuania have criticized the program,
saying many elderly Jews preferred living on their own or with
their families and so would not benefit from the compensation
package.

Kazakstan's opposition protests early presidential poll
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 4th graf to UPDATE with Nazarbayev not decided whether to
seek re-election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kazakstan's leading opposition group on Friday
protested parliament's move to hold an early presidential election
in January, calling it a plot to extend President Nursultan
Nazarbayev's term in office.
	   Parliament passed a resolution Thursday setting early
presidential elections for Jan. 10, nearly two years earlier than
envisaged by a 1995 referendum that extended Nazarbayev's term
through the end of 2000.
	   Lawmakers also passed constitutional amendments that would
lengthen a president's term from five to seven years. The terms of
lawmakers would also be extended.
	   In the absence of any serious rivals, Nazarbayev is expected to
easily win re-election. However, the Interfax news agency quoted
him as telling reporters Friday that he had not decided whether to
run again.
	   Parliament's moves only serve to ensure Nazarbayev's hold on
power, said Galym Abilsiitov and Pyotr Svoik, who co-chair the
Azamat movement, Kazakstan's strongest opposition group.
	   They said the parliament's action amounted to ``an
unconstitutional deal between the president and the parliament to
extend their terms,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Azamat plans to either boycott the election, or support an
opposition candidate, the two men said.
	   Nazarbayev, Kazakstan's Communist Party boss during the Soviet
times, flirted with democratic reforms in the first few years after
the country's independence in 1991. But he has moved to strengthen
his grip on power and allows his opponents little room to maneuver.
	   Azamat leaders have previously complained against official
harassment. Abilsiitov spent 15 days in jail last year for
organizing an unsanctioned anti-government demonstration and Svoik
said he was beaten by security agents.

Police arrest firefighter accused of paying boys for sex
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IRAKLEION, Greece (AP) _ Authorities arrested a firefighter on
suspicion of sexually abusing four boys on the Greek island of
Crete, police said Friday.
	   A police patrol arrested 39-year-old Michalis Metafakis on
Wednesday night after finding him allegedly abusing three 12- to
13-year-old boys in his car, parked in a remote spot near the town
of Rethymno.
	   The patrol became suspicious after noticing a fourth boy
dressing by the side of the road, police said.
	   According to authorities, Metafakis allegedly paid the boys
between 2,000 and 5,000 drachmas (between dlrs seven and 17) for
sexual favors.
	   Metafakis, who has been serving in the Irakleion fire service
for 18 years, is to appear before a prosecutor to be officially
charged on Saturday.

Israel to withhold prize from Generali chairman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Bernheim is Generali's chairman, sted president,
UPDATES with Generali newspaper ad &QL; 
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel will withhold an award from an Italian
insurance company that has refused to release information on
Holocaust era policies, an adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Friday.
	   Bobby Brown, Netanyahu's adviser on diaspora affairs, said
Assicurazioni Generali has not complied with requests to release
information on 337,000 World War II policies.
	   The company's chairman was to receive an award at an economic
conference Wednesday for Generali's contribution to the Israeli
economy.
	   Generali could still receive the award if it agrees in writing
before the conference to release the information, Brown said.
	   ``My deepest wish is to give them the prize,'' Brown said.
``I've stated what we look at as the minimum for what we need to
give the prize.''
	   Brown said Generali had not given any sign it would act before
the prime minister's ``Jubilee Business Conference'' next week.
	   Generali, Italy's largest insurer, had provided information on
the policies about six months ago to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust
memorial and research institute. The chairman of the Yad Vashem,
Avner Shalev, said last month that at least 100,000 of those
policies were taken out by Jews.
	   Under the terms of the agreement, Yad Vashem cannot publish the
information, but may only use it for its own research.
	   Antoine Bernheim, the Generali chairman of the board, is among
dozens of international business leaders are to receive the
``Jubilee Award'' on Wednesday.
	   Generali spent dlrs 320 million in 1997 to acquire a majority
position in Midgal, an Israeli insurance company.
	   In a large ad in Friday's edition of the Jerusalem Post
newspaper, Generali asserted the company's ``strong affinity to the
history of the Jewish people and to the state of Israel.''
	   It cited a trust fund it created for Holocaust survivors and an
information center that provides information on World War II
policies.
	   Generali also said in the ad that it had been persecuted during
World War II as a Jewish company and that Bernheim is a Holocaust
survivor whose parents perished in concentration camps.

	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Fourth-seed Andre Agassi advanced to
the semifinals of the dlrs 1 million Swiss Indoors, trampling
Sweden's Magnus Gustafsson in straight sets Friday in the round of
eight.
	   Agassi, the only seed aside from Britain's Tim Henman to avoid
early-round upsets, continued to march unhampered through the
quarterfinals, defeating Gustafsson 6-3, 6-3 in 1 hour, 17 minutes.
	   After a nine-minute first game, Agassi took control of the
match, breaking Gustafsson's second serve in the opening set with a
love game to go up 2-1.
	   Then leading 5-3 with Gustafsson serving, the American broke
again to cinch the set.
	   Agassi coninuted his dominance in the second set, breaking the
Swede's opening serve.
	   However, faced with the same situation as in the first set,
leading 15-40 at 5-2 on Gustaffson's serve, the American went on
the squander three match points, giving the Swede the game.
	   But the American, who reached the quarterfinals without dropping
a set, refused to let a second opportunity slip by, closing the
match on his next service game.
	   ``Magnus is a really tough opponent,'' said Agassi, the winner
of four tournaments this season. ``He's a veteran who knows how to
play the big points.
	   ``But my game has seen a lot of improvement and I'm feeling more
and more confident. I'm more ready to step up and take control of
the match.''
	   Gustafsson's compatriot Thomas Johansson was more successful,
the Swede defeating France's Fabrice Santoro 6-3, 6-3 in another
quarterfinal.
	   Later in the day Henman, seeded sixth, took on Germany's Nicolas
Kiefer, and home-favorite Marc Rosset faced German qualifier David
Prinosil.

British Broadcasting Corp. to increase Serbian language programming
</HEADLINE>
in response to Kosovo crisis

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The BBC said Friday it will increase its Serb
language radio broadcasts in the Balkans by 15 minutes per day in
response to the continuing crisis in the country and the decision
by Serbian authorities to ban local media from broadcasting foreign
radio programing.
	   The decision to increase its Serb language programming from
10:30 hours per week to 11:45 was a ``specific response'' to the
decision announced Wednesday by Serbian government officials to ban
independent radio stations from airing programs by organizations
such as the BBC, Voice of America, Deutsche Welle and Radio Free
Europe, the British Broadcasting Corp. said in a statement.
	   Serbian radio stations who refuse to stop broadcasting foreign
programing face prosecution. Before the ban, 33 radio stations in
Serbia were broadcasting BBC programing.
	   ``Many Serbian speakers in Kosovo and Serbia rely on BBC
broadcast for impartial, up-to-date news. We hope that this extra
program will help keep the population informed of events in their
own country and elsewhere in the world,'' said Chris Pszenicki,
European managing editor for the BBC World Service.
	   In July, the BBC also increased its Albanian language service by
15 minutes per day.

Russians protest steel-dumping charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian steelworkers protested Friday about
demands by U.S. steel companies and trade unions for anti-dumping
measures against imports of hot-rolled carbon Russian steel, a news
agency reported.
	   Leading U.S. steel companies recently accused Japan, Russia and
Brazil of dumping the steel on the U.S. market at prices
dramatically below production costs and prices at home, saying it
has caused layoffs and lower profits at American plants.
	   Twelve companies joined the United Steelworkers in petitioning
the Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission
for intervention.
	   The leader of Russia's Mining and Metallurgical Union, Mikhail
Tarasenko, said Russian steel is more expensive in the United
States than in Russia, so there are no need for trade sanctions,
Interfax reported.
	   More than 100,000 Russians would lose their jobs and the country
would lose dlrs 1 billion in revenue if steel exports fall,
Tarasenko told a news conference.
	   He called on Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton to make
an urgent deal to solve the problem.
	   Russia is the world's fourth-largest steel producer.

Rennie's 84 helps give Zimbabwe upper hand on third day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout at stumps &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Gavin Rennie's 84 steered Zimbabwe to a
second innings of 219 for two and gave it the upper hand on Friday,
the third day of its one-off test against India.
	   Rennie's near century was unbeaten before he was struck on the
temple by a Javagal Srinath bouncer he tried to hook. Rennie
retired hurt after several minutes of treatment but was expected to
resume his place on Saturday.
	   Zimbabwe started the day dismissing the final four wickets of
the Indian first innings for 32 runs and ended it with a 160-run
lead.
	   Pacers Heath Streak, Henry Olonga and Mpumulelo Mbangwa began
the Africans' day by taking the final wickets and bowling out India
for 280.
	   Rahul Dravid, who resumed his 104 for India, quickly ran out of
partners. When Harbhajan Singh came to the wicket, Dravid lashed
out and was caught in the covers trying for quick runs, finishing
his second test century at 118.
	   Rennie opened the Zimbabwe innings with Craig Wishart and faced
a hostile India attack prior to lunch. Wishart was dropped by
India's captain Mohamad Azharuddin before he had scored and went on
to make 63, caught and bowled by Anil Kumble.
	   With Rennie, he put on 138 for the first wicket as the wicket
became easy paced during the afternoon. It was the third highest
Zimbabwe opening partnership.
	   Murray Goodwin hit a bright 44 before Kumble repeated his feat
by catching him off his own bowling.
	   That left Alastair Campbell and Olonga on six and five when
stumps were drawn.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A senior U.S. trouble-shooter
pressed President Slobodan Milosevic on Friday to avoid NATO attack
by accepting international peace terms on Kosovo, and the
alliance's top general urged him to stop toying with Yugoslavia's
survival.
	   Divisions remained among the 16 NATO allies on the use of force,
despite the tough talk from Gen. Wesley Clark, the American supreme
commander of NATO. Italy and Greece, among others, are reluctant to
proceed without a mandate from the U.N. Security Council, where
Russia and China are opposed or other firm legal basis for such a
strike.
	   Still, in dispatching U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke back to
Belgrade, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned
Milosevic that ``time is all but gone'' for a peaceful settlement.
	   After the first round of talks Friday, Milosevic called NATO
threats of airstrikes ``belligerent attempts'' to solve the Kosovo
problem, adding that he favors negotiations. The talks were to
resume later in the night.
	   Clark said his forces were moving ahead with final attack
preparations. Speaking in Naples, Italy, he questioned why
Milosevic would want to ``risk the ravages of armed conflict and
the destruction of his own country.''
	   Meeting in Brussels, Belgium, NATO allies searched for broad
consensus for a strike that would allow them to proceed without the
direct blessings of the U.N. Security Council.
	   But the alliance failed in its effort to pressure Russia into
dropping its opposition to airstrikes.
	   ``We must not allow NATO strikes,'' Russian President Boris
Yeltsin was quoted as saying in Moscow Friday. ``We want to achieve
a political, peaceful solution without the use of military force,
and, I think, we shall succeed.''
	   Greek forces will not participate in any possible NATO military
intervention against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, the government said
Friday. But Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said a decision on
intervention may nonetheless be taken as early as this weekend.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have
been driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown
Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting to wrest Kosovo province from Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by Kosovo Liberation Army ``terrorists.''
	   Holbrooke arrived from London, where he met with officials of
the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans. He said that movement
toward authorizing the use of force by NATO continues ``in a
sustained and intense manner.''
	   ``The situation remains just as serious at it has been before,''
he said shortly before the start of his fourth meeting with
Milosevic in five days.
	   In Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital, cafes were full, with
people appearing to make the most of what could be the last few
days of relative peace.
	   ``I am not afraid,'' said Jehona Xhaferi, 25, an ethnic
Albanian. ``Maybe that's crazy, but I see it as the finishing phase
of everything,'' she said, alluding to the months of Kosovo
turmoil.
	   The international demands Holbrooke was presenting to Milosevic
included an immediate end to hostilities and a withdrawal of forces
and heavy armaments to levels before March, before the government
crackdown on Kosovo started.
	   In addition, Holbrooke was expected to press for an
international monitoring force to be allowed to oversee compliance.
	   The KLA announced a unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo
starting today, a move that will add to the pressure on Milosevic
to reciprocate.
	   But Serbian media reported at least five KLA breaches of their
cease-fire Friday. They said Serbian police and ethnic Albanians
loyal to the Serbian government were attacked, but there were no
injuries.
	   The KLA said it was government troops who were on the offensive.
In a statement read on state television in neighboring Albania, the
rebels claimed villages were being attacked west of Pristina, but
added that their troops continued to respect the unilateral
cease-fire.
	   The Serbian and Yugoslav governments showed little sign that
they were prepared to bow to international pressure.
	   Citing the Kosovo crisis and NATO threats of intervention, the
Serbian government Friday put into effect a harsh decree tightening
state control over companies and independent media.
	   The decree broadens government authority and envisions
punishment for companies, institutions and individuals who act
contrary to the government's view of patriotic behavior.

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Retiring world, Olympic and World Cup
champion Alberto Tomba will run his last race in December on the
hill where he captured his first World Cup victory 11 years ago.
	   Organizers announced Friday that the 31-year-old Italian, who
announced his retirement from skiing last Saturday, will compete in
a giant slalom exhibition at Sestriere on Dec. 30.
	   A huge crowd will be expected to pay tribute to Tomba in his
last time on skis.
	   Tomba, Italy's most successful and popular skier, won his first
World Cup race at Sestriere, in Italy's western Alps, in 1987.
	   Since then the man nicknamed La Bomba has won 50 World Cup
races, one overall World Cup title, eight discipline titles, three
Olympic gold medals and two world titles.
	   Tomba, who plans an acting debut later this year, will compete
in the Sestriere exhibition against seven top-ranked World Cup
skiers.
	   The race, in three runs, will be determined on combined time of
the two fastest heats.

Unbeaten Americans, Swedes meet for place in last four
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara
maintained their mastery of the Old Course at the Dunhill Cup
Friday as the United States set up a showdown with Sweden for a
place in the last four.
	   On the day Tony Johnstone totaled 15 at two holes to toss away a
4-stroke lead during Zimbabwe's upset loss to France, Woods
followed up his opening day 66 at the home of golf with a 2-under
70. That beat Japan's Katsuma Miyamoto by seven in conditions that
started out a howling wind and driving rain and ended bright
sunshine.
	   O'Meara, who carded 67 in Thursday's match against England, also
had a 70 to score a 5-shot victory over Hiroyuki Fujita despite the
changing conditions.
	   ``The true Old Course came out,'' O'Meara said. ``We had all
four seasons _ wind, rain, the cold, the sun came out and more
wind.
	   ``You can play the first five or six holes in one type of
weather and within 15-20 minutes it can change.''
	   With John Daly making it two wins in a row to take his personal
Dunhill Cup record to 7-1, the Americans have scored two sweeps in
their search for a semifinal place.
	   So have the Swedes.
	   Mathias Gronberg came back from three down with two to play to
beat Lee Westwood in a playoff and then Per Ulrik Johansson and
Patrik Sjoland both carded 70s to beat David Carter and Peter Baker
by three.
	   In Saturday's final group matches, Daly, a British Open titlist
here in 1995 having also helped the United States win the Dunhill
Cup in two years earlier, once again goes out first against
Johansson. Woods faces Gronberg and O'Meara plays last against
Sjoland.
	   ``Mark said do you want to keep the same rotation as the first
two rounds and it's been good so far,'' said Daly. ``Mark's the
captain and I do what he tells me.''
	   Scotland and Spain also meet Saturday while tied for first place
in Group 2.
	   The Scots downed Ireland 2-1 with Colin Montgomerie, a surprise
loser on Thursday's to China's Zhang Lian-wei, the only player in
the match not over par.
	   Montgomerie's 72 gave him a 6-stroke victory over Paul McGinley
while Gary Orr edged Padraig Harrington by one. Darren Clarke
gained Ireland's sole victory with a 73 and 2-stroke victory over
Andrew Coltart.
	   Spain downed China 2-1 despite Jose Maria Olazabal's 1-stroke
loss to Wu Xiang-bing. The Spaniard was penalized a stroke for
accidentally dropping his marker onto his ball on the green.
	   Zimbabwe, seeded three, meets South Africa for a place in the
semifinal even though both suffered upset losses Friday.
	   Ernie Els, who was two up at the turn, lost to Sven Struver at
the second extra hole after they each carded 4-over 76s in the
atrocious conditions.
	   That meant Germany won 2-1 after Thomas Gogele edged David Frost
at the second extra hole and South Africa's Retief Goosen had
downed Alex Cejka by one. They also were high scoring matches with
Frost and Gogele each scoring 78 and Goosen winning his match
despite a 76.
	   Zimbabwe's Nick Price scored a 2-under 70 to beat Frenchman
Olivier Edmond by eight strokes. But Mark McNulty returned an 81 to
lose by 10 to Jean Van de Velde and Johnstone threw a 5-stroke lead
after 12 to lose by two to Thomas Levet.
	   Johnstone was still four ahead before he went to 14 and 15 and
triple bogeyed both. He finished with a 79 after an 8-over homeward
nine of 44.
	   After scoring its second 3-0 victory, this time over South
Korea, Australia can afford to lose 2-1 to New Zealand Saturday and
still qualify.
	   Craig Parry edged Shin Yong-jin at the first extra hole after
they had tied on 75. Stuart Appleby returned a 73 to beat Kang
Wook-soon by four and Steve Elkington's level par 72 beat Kim
Jong-duck by five.
	   New Zealand gained a 2-1 victory over Argentina helped by the
disqualification of Eduardo Romero at the 17th. Romero arrived at
the green to find his ball was out of bounds and, already five
behind, he decided to concede the match rather than go back and
play another ball.
	   Frank Nobilo, who has been on New Zealand's Dunhill Cup team
since the competition started in 1985, carded a 71 to clinch New
Zealand's victory by beating Angel Cabrera by six.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow's mayor offered visiting Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat practical help Friday in cleaning the West Bank city
of Bethlehem, while other officials offered political support for
the Middle East peace process.
	   Mayor Yuri Luzhkov offered Arafat several garbage disposal and
other trucks to make Bethlehem ``cleaner and more attractive'' for
the 2,000th Christmas, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. Arafat
invited Luzhkov to attend the celebrations.
	   Arafat was in Russia for a two-day visit before leaving Friday
night for Helsinki, Finland. He urged Russia to play a larger role
in Middle East peacemaking.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Russia supported the creation
of a Palestinian state, but noted it ``cannot contradict Israel's
national interests, especially in the sphere of security,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Ivanov said he hoped that ``with good will and reciprocity, the
Palestinians and Israelis will be able to resolve their problems
and enter into serious and constructive talks to define the final
status of Palestinian territories.''
	   Arafat arrived in Moscow following talks in the Gaza Strip on
Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that raised hopes that the
stalled peace process could move ahead.
	   They agreed to hold a new round of talks outside Washington next
week. Arafat invited Russian President Boris Yeltsin to take part.
	   Russia is officially a co-sponsor of the peace process launched
by a conference in Madrid, Spain, in 1991. But the United States
has played a far greater role.
	   Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov, who was among those who
met with Arafat, said their talks were ``interesting and mutually
beneficial.''
	   ``We discussed all problems _ Russian and Mideast _ over a cup
of tea,'' Zyuganov said at a news conference.

Monica's elderly Israeli relative ashamed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - ``I switched on the television and heard the
name Lewinsky. ... and I was flabbergasted,'' said 82 year-old Hava
Cohen, a distant relative of Monica Lewinsky.
	   Hava, who lives in Galilee, northern Israel, is the sister of
Lewinsky's grandmother Suzie, 87, a resident of San Fransisco.
	   ``I ask you, is this an honor to the family?'' Cohen said in an
interview published Tuesday.
	   Until Monica's affair with President Clinton exploded on the
front pages the entire family were very proud of her because she
was working in the White House, Cohen told the daily Yediot
Ahronot.
	   ``My sister tells me Monica is a very friendly girl, and I asked
if maybe she wasn't a bit too friendly,'' Cohen said.
	   Hava and Suzie were both born in Hamburg. Suzie and her husband
got out of Nazi Germany in 1940 and settled in El Salvador. Later
they moved to the United states. Hava emigrated from Germany to
British Mandatory Palestine in 1932.
	   ``My sister was very proud of her grand-daughter. Now she says
it's just as well her poor husband is no longer alive,'' Cohen
said.

Saramago recalls other Portuguese writers after winning Nobel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo MAD101-102 &QL; 
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A day after winning the Nobel Prize for
literature, Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago was all modesty,
insisting many other Portuguese writers were just as deserving.
	   ``There have been other Portuguese authors, like Fernando
Pessoa, whose work would justify 1,000 Nobels,'' Saramago, the
first Portuguese-language author to win the award, told a packed
news conference in Madrid.
	   Saramago, 75, was told he won the big prize Thursday as he
waited for his flight home to Spain's Canary Islands from the
Frankfurt book fair. He immediately headed back to the fair.
	   ``At that moment I was over the moon, and returning to the book
fair the only thing I was worried about was that the whole thing
was an error,'' said Saramago.
	   The Vatican was less than thrilled, and its official newspaper
dismissed the outspoken atheist as ``antireligious,''
``anticlerical'' and an ``old-school communist.''
	   Saramago didn't seem to care.
	   ``I think that the Vatican should keep its mind on its prayers
and leave people alone,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile the Portuguese were delighted with the award. Even the
country's three daily sports papers touted it.
	   Lisbon City Hall rushed out congratulatory posters and hung them
throughout the capital during the night.
	   Saramago was born into a poor, illiterate family in Azinhaga, a
small town near Lisbon. He never finished university but continued
to study part-time while supporting himself as a metalworker.
	   ``I wasn't born to win the Nobel. I didn't have my own books
until I was 18,'' he said.
	   His first novel, published in 1947 _ ``Terra do Pecado,'' or
``Country of Sin'' _ was a tale of peasants in moral crisis. For
the next 18 years, Saramago, a communist who opposed the 41-year
conservative dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, published only a few
travel and poetry books while he worked as a journalist.
	   He returned to fiction only after Salazar's regime was toppled
by a military uprising in 1974. Since the 1980s, his works have
been translated into more than 20 languages.

original source of allegations coming from widow of slain socialist
leader. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A human rights group is urging the United
Nations to remove from duty a top military observer alleged to have
committed human rights abuses during Chile's Pinochet dictatorship.
	   While not naming Brig. Gen. Sergio Espinoza Davies, Chile's army
on Friday defended the work of the war councils on which Espinoza
served. The councils issued a number of death sentences against
leftists during Augusto Pinochet's military regime.
	   In a letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Human Rights Watch
said Espinoza's documented participation on the tribunals and ``in
the worst human rights abuses in his home country'' renders him
unfit to remain in charge of the U.N. military observer mission in
India and Pakistan.
	   The United Nations has known about the allegations for over a
month, after the widow of socialist leader Freddy Taverna, executed
on Oct. 30, 1973, sent Annan a copy of his death sentence. Jenny
Arancibia said her husband was sentenced by a tribunal on which
Espinoza was a member.
	   Since then, the United Nations has repeatedly sought
clarifications from Espinoza and Chile. Espinoza denied the charges
and Chile hasn't provided a satisfactory official response, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said. The United Nations was waiting for
such a response before taking any action.
	   The Chilean army on Friday re-released a communique dated Sept.
4, after the presence of Espinoza on the tribunal first triggered
criticism from human rights groups.
	   The communique said the councils worked in accordance with
Chile's military justice code, which dates from 1925. It added that
officers ordered to sit on the councils had to obey because ``that
was a military obligation.''
	   Espinoza on Friday refused to answer reporters questions. ``I
don't talk to the press,'' his secretary in Lahore, Pakistan,
quoted Espinoza as saying.
	   While stressing that he has no proof of the charges, Eckhard
noted that the United Nations does not conduct background checks on
people volunteered by member states to participate in missions.
	   The United Nations expects ``that the people they give us will
be responsible people with clean records,'' he said. ``The
governments are supposed to know. We don't second-guess
governments.''
	   Human Rights Watch said in its letter that Espinoza served on at
least one Pinochet-era war tribunal that sentenced people to prison
or death after proceedings that ``violated the most fundamental
judicial guarantees of due process.''
	   The Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliations
found that judges on the tribunals had an unsatisfactory level of
basic legal knowledge and concluded that many proceedings were
simply used to justify illegal executions, the organization said.
	   According to a report by the civilian government that succeeded
Pinochet's, 3,197 people were killed for political reasons after
Pinochet came to power in a 1973 coup, including 1,102 who
disappeared. Thousands more were tortured, forced into exile, or
both.
	   Pinochet relinquished most of his powers to a civilian
government in 1990. He is still a senator.

Afghanistan rejects U.N. talks offer in Iran standoff
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Taliban say Iranian troops attack
villages, killing two villagers, destroy six villages, more
details. ADDS byline. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's ruling Taliban army on
Friday rejected an invitation from a U.N. envoy to negotiate an end
to a border standoff with neighboring Iran.
	   U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi issued the call for talks in
neighboring Pakistan to try to ease tensions created by a massive
troop deployment along the border that separates Iran and
Afghanistan.
	   Iran has amassed more than 200,000 soldiers along it border,
while the Taliban has sent an estimated 10,000 troops.
	   Brahimi said reports of clashes on the border add a fresh sense
of urgency for a peaceful settlement.
	   The latest report came Friday from the Taliban-run radio
claiming two Afghan villagers were killed when Iranian soldiers
attacked six different villages. The radio said Iranian border
troops used machine guns and rockets during Thursday's assault on
the villages.
	   The claim could not be independently confirmed, but it follows a
similar accusation by Tehran Television, which accused the Taliban
of attacking its soldiers on the border.
	   The radio did not say whether the Taliban retaliated to the
Iranian attack.
	   The standoff began after Iran accused the Taliban in the deaths
of eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in August. Iran
demanded an apology but the Taliban refused, calling the Iranian
diplomats ``conspirators.''
	   Brahimi asked the Taliban to send a representative to Pakistan
for talks, saying the United Nations has forbidden all its
international staff from traveling to Afghanistan because of safety
concerns.
	   But the Taliban refused. ``He should come to Afghanistan,'' said
Abdul Hai Mutmayan, a spokesman for the Taliban army reached at the
militia's headquarters in southern Kandahar. ``It is secure in
Kandahar.''
	   The Taliban religious militia, which controls 90 percent of the
country and is made up largely of Sunni Muslims, has accused Iran's
Shiite clerical regime of arming and financing its northern-based
opposition, which includes the country's minority Shiite Muslims.
	   The world organization pulled its foreign staff out of
Afghanistan on Aug. 21, after an Italian worker was shot and killed
in apparent retaliation for U.S. missile strikes a day earlier
against suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan.
	   Also Friday, the Taliban released 156 prisoners who were
captured during heavy fighting in July and August against an
opposition alliance based in northern Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban eventually drove its opponents from vast swaths of
northern Afghanistan capturing the stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif in
August.

Greece will not participate in NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead, CLARIFIES use of NATO bases in Greece not
definite, minor editing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greek forces would not participate in any
possible NATO military intervention against Yugoslavia, but would
allow the Western alliance to use its bases in Greece, the
government said Friday.
	   ``Our decision is to not become involved by offering Greek
forces, aircraft,'' government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said. ``We
believe the use of military violence does not constitute the best
solution for dealing with the crisis.''
	   If NATO does decide in favor of military action, it will be able
to use its installations in Greece, Premier Costas Simitis said
after a defense and foreign affairs council meeting.
	   ``There will not be, by Greece, any other arrangement or
facilitation,'' Simitis added.
	   Although it disagrees with airstrikes, Greece ``will not prevent
such a development by exercising its veto right'' in NATO, Reppas
explained.
	   A decision on intervention may be taken over the weekend,
Simitis noted, while further discussions will be held on Monday and
Tuesday.
	   ``We hope these efforts are fruitful,'' he said.
	   Like other Balkan countries, Greece is worried that any
escalation of violence in the predominantly Albanian populated Serb
province could lead to the conflict spilling over Yugoslav borders
into neighboring countries.
	   ``We are very concerned and cautious about the effectiveness of
a choice which leads unavoidably to the undertaking of military
action,'' Reppas said.
	   Greek officials have repeatedly expressed the belief that a
solution to the Kosovo crisis can be found through negotiations.
	   ``Our belief is that the limits of dialogue must be exhausted,
and we believe that there are still such limits,'' Reppas said.
	   But in an indication that Greece considers military intervention
to be increasingly likely, the government issued a travel advisory
warning its citizens against visiting Yugoslavia.
	   Reppas also called on Greeks living in Yugoslavia to examine
whether ``they must remain there or not, if there is not a very
special and important reason, in view of any possibility during the
next few days.''

Nobel Prize amounts smaller, in dollar terms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Not that there's ever a bad time to get
a Nobel Prize, but this year isn't the greatest _ at least in terms
of money.
	   Although the prize amount for 1998's awards is the largest ever
at 7.6 million kronor, the Swedish currency has been on a slide and
the amount works out to dlrs 978,000 compared with last year's dlrs
1 million.
	   One prize has been awarded so far this year. Portugals' Jose
Saramago won the literature award Thursday. Prizes for medicine,
physics and chemistry, economics and peace will be announced next
week.
	   The best year for winners who wanted to spend their winnings in
dollars was 1996, when the prize amount of 7.4 million kronor
translated into dlrs 1.12 million.
	   It's also been a tough year for the Nobel Foundation, the body
in charge of the investments that fund the prize. The business
newspaper Dagens Industri reported that the foundation's net assets
have grown by only 2 percent this year, compared with 20 percent
the previous year.
	   ``It's been a tough year for everybody since mid-July,'' the
newspaper quoted foundation finances director Aake Alteus as
saying.
	   When world markets started shaking in July, the foundation
started reducing equity investments, moving more into cash and
bonds, Alteus said according to the newspaper. It is not clear
whether the disappointing investment performance will affect next
year's prize amount.

Home for Holocaust survivors opens in Lithuania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ As part of a German-funded
compensation program, the first in a series of retirement homes for
Holocaust survivors opened Friday in Lithuania.
	   The center, which has 30 two-room apartments, a dining room and
a doctor's office, was paid for by a German government fund.
	   During Germany's 1941-44 occupation, more than 90 percent of
Lithuania's 240,000 Jews were killed _ one of the highest rates in
Nazi-occupied Europe.
	   Today, fewer than a thousand Holocaust survivors remain in
Lithuania.
	   After Lithuania became independent in 1991, Jewish groups began
lobbying for compensation similar to that provided by Germany to
Jews living in the West and in Israel.
	   But while many Lithuanian Jews called for direct cash payments,
Bonn refused, opting instead to spend about 2 million German marks
(dlrs 1.2 million) building health care facilities, like the new
retirement home.
	   Some Jewish leaders in Lithuania have criticized the program,
saying many elderly Jews prefer living on their own or with their
families and so would not benefit from the compensation package.

Arafat says success of peace summit depends on Israelis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Incorporates material from BC-Russia-Arafat &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat warned
Friday that the Middle East will be thrown into confusion if the
peace process fails, and said that success of next week's talks in
Washington depends on Israel.
	   ``The most important thing is that if we do not do our best, all
of us, to protect ... the peace process, then confusion will happen
in the whole area of the Middle East,'' Arafat told reporters on a
short visit to Helsinki.
	   ``We have to wait and see how the Israelis will react to the
American initiatives which have been declared and which we have
accepted,'' he said.
	   Arafat arrived in Finland after talks with President Boris
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow, where he
invited Russia to the U.S.-sponsored meeting next week as a
co-sponsor of the Mideast peace process.
	   Yeltsin said his government might be interested in participating
in the talks, scheduled to open outside Washington on Oct. 15. But
he said Russia first wants to know the views of Israel and the
United States on the plan.
	   Russia is officially a co-sponsor of the peace process launched
by a conference in Madrid, Spain, in 1991. But the United States
has played a far greater role.
	   Reacting to the appointment of Ariel Sharon as the new Israeli
foreign minister, who has been placed in charge of the negotiations
with the Palestinians, he said, ``It's up to them (the Israelis).''
	   Arafat met with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari before he was
scheduled to fly to Oslo, Norway.

Newspaper apologizes for decade-old `Lebanon connection' reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A major Swiss newspaper Friday
apologized to a Swiss-Lebanese businessman for a decade-old series
of stories on the ``Lebanon connection'' that suggested his company
was involved in laundering drug money from the United States.
	   The case, which also involved allegations by U.S. officials, was
linked to a scandal that forced the resignation of the first woman
member of the Swiss cabinet, then Justice Minister and Vice
President Elisabeth Kopp.
	   The statement printed Friday by the daily Tages-Anzeiger
resulted from an out-of-court settlement with Mohammed Shakarchi
over a series of stories in 1988 and 1989.
	   It said it now has no reason to believe Shakarchi was involved
in money laundering and hadn't wanted to imply any knowing links to
Turkish or Italian arms and drug syndicates.
	   ``The TA apologizes for the report of July 21, 1989, including a
cartoon, to the extent that these contributed to any damage to
personal reputation, particularly as they suggested that Mr.
Shakarchi or Shakarchi Trading Ltd. were involved in money
laundering.''
	   The U.S. Embassy in Bern said in a Feb. 24, 1989, statement that
the possible role of the company was revealed during the ``largest
drug-money-laundering investigation ever conducted by U.S. law
enforcement agencies,'' code-named ``Operation Polar Cap.''
	   But a statement from Shakarchi's lawyer Friday said the U.S.
prosecutor in New York was forced to drop the case almost
immediately in 1989 because it was ``based on false information.''
	   The lawyer said Swiss media widely reported the initial U.S.
investigation, but ignored the fact that it was dropped.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Bern said Friday it was unable to comment
because its archives didn't go back that far.
	   Kopp resigned in 1989 after admitting that she had tipped her
husband off that the company, of which he was vice president, might
come under scrutiny by Swiss authorities.
	   Hans W. Kopp resigned from the company the day he received a
phone call from his wife urging him to cut his ties with the firm.
	   Shakarchi's lawyer, who asked that his name be withheld because
of professional principles, said the reporting ``was absolutely
devastating'' to his client.
	   The lawyer acknowledged that Shakarchi had had business dealings
with two brothers who were money couriers between the Middle East
and Switzerland, Barkev and Jean Magharian, accused by U.S.
officials of taking drug dollars from the United States to
Switzerland.
	   But he said Shakarchi broke off the dealings with the brothers
in 1987.
	   No charges were ever filed against Shakarchi.

Pope urges clemency for illegal immigrants in 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Friday urged a world
amnesty for illegal immigrants for 2000, denouncing what he said
was growing xenophobia.
	   ``Almost everywhere today there is a tendency to close the
frontiers and return to rigorous controls,'' he told participants
at a world congress on the issue at the Vatican. ``Migration is
spoken of more than before and always in more alarmist tones.''
	   He urged nations of the world to pay attention to the factors
pushing migration: internal conflicts, war, unequal distribution of
resources ``incoherent'' farm policy and ``irrational''
industrialization, among others.
	   Granting amnesty to a large part of the world's illegal
immigrants would be an appropriate way to mark the Roman Catholic
Church's 2000 Jubilee, he said.
	   ``The simple denunciation of racism and xenophobia is not
enough,'' the pontiff said.

Saramago recalls other Portuguese writers after winning Nobel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and TIGHTENS throughout &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photo MAD101-102 &QL; 
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A day after winning the Nobel Prize for
literature, Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago was all modesty,
insisting many other Portuguese writers were just as deserving.
	   ``There have been other Portuguese authors, like Fernando
Pessoa, whose work would justify 1,000 Nobels,'' Saramago, the
first Portuguese-language author to win the award, told a packed
news conference in Madrid.
	   Saramago, 75, was told he won the big prize Thursday as he
waited for his flight home to Spain's Canary Islands from the
Frankfurt book fair. He immediately headed back to the fair.
	   ``At that moment I was over the moon, and returning to the book
fair the only thing I was worried about was that the whole thing
was an error,'' said Saramago.
	   The Vatican was less than thrilled, and its official newspaper
dismissed the outspoken atheist as ``antireligious,''
``anticlerical'' and an ``old-school communist.''
	   Saramago didn't seem to care.
	   ``I think that the Vatican should keep its mind on its prayers
and leave people alone,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile the Portuguese were delighted with the award. Even the
country's three daily sports papers touted it.
	   Lisbon City Hall rushed out congratulatory posters and hung them
throughout the capital during the night.
	   Saramago was born into a poor, illiterate family in Azinhaga, a
small town near Lisbon. He never finished university but continued
to study part-time while supporting himself as a metalworker.
	   ``I wasn't born to win the Nobel. I didn't have my own books
until I was 18,'' he said.
	   His first novel, published in 1947 _ ``Terra do Pecado,'' or
``Country of Sin'' _ was a tale of peasants in moral crisis. For
the next 18 years, Saramago, a communist who opposed the 41-year
conservative dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, published only a few
travel and poetry books while he worked as a journalist.
	   He returned to fiction only after Salazar's regime was toppled
by a military uprising in 1974. Since the 1980s, his works have
been translated into more than 20 languages.

Italy and EU reach last-minute accord on Malpensa airport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with accord signed, comments from
Kinnock, Burlando &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ After months of haggling, Italy and the European
Union signed a compromise accord Friday that lets other EU
countries' airlines use Milan's more convenient Linate airport _
for the time being.
	   Transport Minister Claudio Burlando and European Transport
Commissioner Neil Kinnock reached the agreement Thursday night.
	   ``It would seem the Italian government has come a long way in
achieving arrangements that comply with the law,'' Kinnock said in
statement in Brussels.
	   ``The new rules will ensure effective competition and they will
work in favor of passengers,'' he said.
	   The compromise allows airlines to keep 34 percent of their
flights at Linate until transport links to Malpensa are complete.
	   Malpensa is 53 kilometers (33 miles) from downtown Milan, while
Linate is just 10 kilometers (six miles) away.
	   Under a last-minute provision added Friday just before Burlando
signed the agreement in Rome, airlines were granted a broad
flexibility in deciding which flights to keep at Linate.
	   ``But the most important thing is that the percentage of flights
kept at Linate doesn't change,'' Burlando was quoted by the ANSA
news agency as saying.
	   Burlando said that 6 million travelers are expected to stay at
Linate, compared to 8.5 million to be transferred to Malpensa.
	   Airlines with fewer than 18 flights to Milan a week will be able
to maintain all flights at Linate.
	   The European Commission, the EU's executive body, estimated that
the Malpensa's road and rail links will be ready by the end of the
2000.
	   Burlando's original decree, presented in February, was rejected
by the EU Commission because it was seen as violating European fair
competition rules.
	   Under that plan, foreign airlines flying in and out of Milan
would be obliged to move next month from Linate airport to
Malpensa. Only the Italian carrier Alitalia's shuttle flights
between Rome and Milan would have been allowed to stay at Linate.
	   Nine European airlines complained that poor road and rail links
from Malpensa to downtown Milan would make their passengers switch
to Alitalia.
	   On Friday morning, trading in Alitalia shares was suspended due
to excessive gains. Traders said the accord was behind the share
move.

French survivors tell tale of boat tragedy

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with boat being refloated in 9th graf; ADDS that some
50 have returned home &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LLORET DE MAR, Spain (AP) _ Survivors of a pleasure boat that
sank in a lake in northeastern Spain killing 20 French retirees
were sad and angry Friday as they recalled the tragedy.
	   ``I don't really know what is going to happen now and I don't
really care,'' said Jean Loulier staring at his breakfast at the
tour group's hotel in this seaside resort.
	   Loulier, 70, like many of the 141 vacationing retirees who opted
for a boat trip around the nearby tranquil Lake Banyoles on
Thursday, had felt lucky when he won a nearly free vacation
package.
	   ``Most was free, but the excursions we paid, like the one
yesterday,'' said the widowed former schoolteacher whose female
traveling companion, who he did not identify, was a non-swimmer and
drowned.
	   The electric-powered catamaran was pulling away from its mooring
for a half hour trip over the mountain-surrounded lake, 565
kilometers (350 miles) northeast of Madrid, when its stern began to
sink. It went down fast.
	   Officials said overloading appeared the most likely cause, as
141 tickets were sold for a boat only authorized to carry 80
passengers.
	   Authorities, meanwhile, were still unable to account for two
people they believe may have gone on the doomed excursion.
	   Two owners of the boat, including the pilot, gave secret
testimony Friday before an investigative judge, who released them
without filing charges. The court said the investigation would
continue.
	   Police divers refloated the craft and initial investigations
showed the boat was in tact and had suffered no leaks that might
explain the sinking.
	   ``It looks like water may have got through air ventilation tubes
which may have become immersed due to overloading,'' provincial
fire chief Antoni Guell told reporters.
	   ``Just greed, greed'' said another survivor who also raged about
the lack of consideration for the tourists in the wake of the
tragedy.
	   ``I had to go to a public phone box to call my daughter,'' he
said before realizing he was talking to a reporter.
	   ``Journalist!'' he shouted, and began pushing this reporter out
of the hotel and ripping her notepad into shreds.
	   But some wanted to tell the story.
	   ``It was like the Titantic, the way it went down'' said Evelyn
Bengoechea, 52. She survived by grabbing a life preserver shaped
like a ring after her husband, who could swim, pushed her out of
the boat.
	   ``I want to thank the people who helped pull us out,'' she said.
	   Michel Evielle, 50, has been driving tourist buses for 17 years.
He was drinking coffee by the lakeside when the boat began to sink.
	   ``It went down in 30 seconds,'' he said, recalling how he helped
pull out the floundering passengers.
	   ``Some of those who could swim were carrying others who
couldn't, and then others would grab onto their backs.''
	   Meanwhile, French Tourism Minister Michelle Demessine visited
the 21 people remaining in hospital. Some 50 of the tourists flew
back to France later Friday.
	   Repatriation of the corpses was also set to begin later in the
day.

Israel to withhold prize from Generali chairman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel will withhold an award from an Italian
insurance company that has refused to release information on
Holocaust era policies, an adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Friday.
	   Bobby Brown, Netanyahu's adviser on diaspora affairs, said
Assicurazioni Generali has not complied with requests to release
information on 337,000 World War II policies.
	   The company's chairman was to receive an award at an economic
conference Wednesday for Generali's contribution to the Israeli
economy.
	   Generali could still receive the award if it agrees in writing
before the conference to release the information, Brown said.
	   ``My deepest wish is to give them the prize,'' Brown said.
``I've stated what we look at as the minimum for what we need to
give the prize.''
	   Generali, Italy's largest insurer, had provided information on
the policies about six months ago to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust
memorial and research institute. The chairman of the Yad Vashem,
Avner Shalev, said last month that at least 100,000 of those
policies were taken out by Jews.
	   Under the terms of the agreement, Yad Vashem cannot publish the
information, but may only use it for its own research.
	   In a large ad in Friday's edition of the Jerusalem Post
newspaper, Generali asserted the company's ``strong affinity to the
history of the Jewish people and to the state of Israel.''
	   It cited a trust fund it created for Holocaust survivors and an
information center that provides information on World War II
policies.

Paris region transport strikes ease after fourth day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with more than 50 percent of Paris train depots voting
to resume work, strike ending in Lille, trims. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A crippling transport strike appeared to be easing
late Friday, with rail officials saying workers at more than half
of the capital's train depots had decided to resume work.
	   The stoppage, in its fourth day Friday, caused havoc in the
Paris region and in northern France, where transit workers were
protesting a spate of violent attacks on colleagues by passengers.
	   Commuters were again left stranded as nearly all suburban
traffic on both regular rail and high speed commuter lines remained
at a virtual standstill. The walkout also spread to parts of the
city Metro for the first time.
	   Traffic jams outside Paris stretched up to 20 kilometers (19
miles).
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin announced plans Thursday for
tougher punishment for those who attack public transport personnel
as well as greater surveillance.
	   That, together with a greater police presence on bus and train
lines, prompted many workers to end the strike Friday.
	   Rail officials said more than half of Paris' train depots had
agreed to return to work either immediately or on Saturday.
	   Services at Montparnasse station in southern Paris were almost
back to normal early evening.
	   In Lille, northern France, train drivers staged a surprise
walkout, tying up regional traffic and service on the high-speed
TGV.
	   But after meeting with strikers, rail officials said services
would be back to normal Saturday. The Lille drivers were protesting
an assault on a ticket inspector who was kicked in the stomach by a
ticketless passenger.
	   Workers on the No. 10 line of the Metro also walked out after a
driver was attacked in the morning.
	   Trying to defuse the conflict, Jospin, a Socialist, said the
penal code will be revised to deal more harshly with violence
toward transport workers. Aided by police officers, inspectors who
check tickets will be able to verify identities of passengers.
	   He also said justice would be swift for suspected offenders.
	   The walkout was triggered by an attack Monday on a Paris train
line in which a worker was beaten with a spray can after he tried
to stop youths from vandalizing a station.
	   Bus services resumed Thursday after a two-day walkout ended when
authorities put elite police units on bus lines.
	   The attacks often happen in poor suburbs with high unemployment.
Statistics show urban violence has risen by 400 percent in the past
six years. About 9 million people in the Paris area use public
transit daily.

Newspaper apologizes for decade-old `Lebanon connection' reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A major Swiss newspaper apologized
Friday to a Swiss-Lebanese businessman for a decade-old series of
stories on the ``Lebanon connection'' that suggested his company
was involved in laundering drug money from the United States.
	   The case, which also involved allegations by U.S. officials, was
linked to a scandal that forced the resignation of the first female
member of the Swiss cabinet, then Justice Minister and Vice
President Elisabeth Kopp.
	   The statement printed Friday by the daily Tages-Anzeiger
resulted from an out-of-court settlement with Mohammed Shakarchi
over a series of stories in 1988 and 1989.
	   It said it now has no reason to believe Shakarchi was involved
in money laundering and hadn't wanted to imply any knowing links to
Turkish or Italian arms and drug syndicates.
	   ``The TA apologizes for the report of July 21, 1989, including a
cartoon, to the extent that these contributed to any damage to
personal reputation, particularly as they suggested that Mr.
Shakarchi or Shakarchi Trading Ltd. were involved in money
laundering.''
	   The U.S. Embassy in Bern said in a Feb. 24, 1989, statement that
the possible role of the company was revealed during the ``largest
drug-money-laundering investigation ever conducted by U.S. law
enforcement agencies,'' code-named ``Operation Polar Cap.''
	   But a statement from Shakarchi's lawyer Friday said the U.S.
prosecutor in New York was forced to drop the case almost
immediately in 1989 because it was ``based on false information.''
	   The lawyer said Swiss media widely reported the initial U.S.
investigation but ignored the fact that it was dropped.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Bern said Friday it was unable to comment
because its archives didn't go back that far.
	   Kopp resigned in 1989 after admitting that she had tipped her
husband off that the company, of which he was vice president, might
come under scrutiny by Swiss authorities.
	   Hans W. Kopp resigned from the company the day he received a
phone call from his wife urging him to cut his ties with the firm.
	   Shakarchi's lawyer, who asked that his name be withheld because
of professional principles, said the reporting ``was absolutely
devastating'' to his client.
	   The lawyer acknowledged that Shakarchi had had business dealings
with two brothers who were money couriers between the Middle East
and Switzerland, Barkev and Jean Magharian, accused by U.S.
officials of taking drug dollars from the United States to
Switzerland.
	   But he said Shakarchi broke off the dealings with the brothers
in 1987.
	   No charges were ever filed against Shakarchi.

Report: Taliban frees five Iranians after 15 months
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Afghanistan-UN &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement on
Friday released five Iranians who claimed they were ``brutally
tortured'' during 15 months in captivity, Iranian radio reported.
	   The five, who ran businesses in Afghanistan, were captured
during the Taliban militia's sweep of the western part of the
country. The Islamic fighters, who ousted a rival Islamic
government in Kabul, now controls some 90 percent of Afghanistan.
	   The state-run Iran radio said the five Iranians who returned
home ``after spending 15 months in captivity, revealed that they
had been brutally tortured ... during their incarceration.''
	   It did not elaborate and the report could not be independently
confirmed.
	   Still, the report is likely to add to simmering border tensions
between the two sides over the killing of eight Iranian diplomats
and a journalist by Taliban fighters in August.
	   Iran says its its troops repulsed a Taliban mortar and machine
gun attack on its northeastern border in Khorasan province on
Thursday. The Taliban denied any fighting occurred.
	   Iran's Shiite government and the mostly Sunni Taliban are
deadlocked over how to resolve their row: the Afghans have rejected
Iran's demands that they apologize for killing its citizens and
hand over the culprits for trial in Tehran.
	   On Friday, the Taliban refused to send a representative to
neighboring Pakistan for negotiations with a U.N. envoy to end the
border standoff. The Taliban wants the envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, to
come to Afghanistan, which the U.N. forbids because of security
concerns.
	   Iran, which says its patience is running short, has massed more
than 200,000 troops on its eastern border with Afghanistan in a
face off with an estimated 10,000 Taliban troops.
	   Iranian troops conducted several large-scale military exercises
during the past few weeks.

Hingis loses; Lindsay Davenport new world No. 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS Davenport WINNING, QUOTES from HINGIS and Davenport,
CORRECTS to eighth No.1 instead of ninth, RECASTS throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FILDERSTADT, Germany (AP) _ Lindsay Davenport, almost unbeatable
recently, finally claimed the world No. 1 ranking Friday when
Martina Hingis lost at the Porsche Grand Prix.
	   Hingis needed to win against Belgium's Dominique Van Roost to
stop the charging American from ending her 80-week reign at the top
of the rankings.
	   But slowed by an ankle injury, the Swiss teenager lost a 3-6,
7-6 (7-4), 6-4 quarterfinal struggle to Van Roost.
	   Davenport would have claimed No. 1 anyhow a few hours later when
she won her own quarterfinal match against France's seventh-seeded
Nathalie Tauziat 7-6 (7-1), 7-5.
	   ``I've dreamed of being the best once ever since I was a little
kid,'' said a jubilant Davenport, 22.
	   Hingis fought back from the brink of defeat several times,
falling behind in all three sets, before Van Roost blasted a
forehand down the line to end the two hour, 18 minute battle.
	   ``It's no drama that I'll be the No. 2 for a little while. It's
good for the motivation,'' said Hingis. ``But at the moment,
Lindsay is simply the better player. She belongs at No. 1.''
	   Hingis could regain her top position next week at Zurich, but
the ankle may stop her from playing. After the second set she was
treated courtside for the injury.
	   ``I don't know if I can play or not, but certainly I should
think about taking a long break anyhow,'' said Hingis.
	   Davenport, the daughter of a former U.S. Olympic volleyball
player, becomes the eighth player to be ranked No. 1 since the
computer rankings were started in 1975.
	   Hingis' position had been in danger for months with Davenport on
a hot streak since Wimbledon in early July, having captured four
titles and losing just twice.
	   Last year, at this time, the Swiss player had a whopping 3,095
point lead over then No. 2 Jana Novotna in the computer rankings.
	   Hingis swept three Grand Slam events last season, but this year
claimed only the Australian Open in January. Since then, the once
dominant Swiss player has won just four tournaments while posting a
54-10 record and losing three times to Davenport.
	   The top ranking highlights a remarkable year for Davenport,
whose ranking soared while she dropped 35 pounds earlier this
season. She also won her first Grand Slam in New York.
	   Hingis had held the top spot since March 31, 1997, taking over
from Steffi Graf, who was the No. 1 for a total of 377 weeks.
	   Hingis, knowing she had to win to hold her ranking, was in
trouble from the start against the 12th-ranked Van Roost. In just
12 minutes she was down 0-3 in the first set.
	   Van Roost, who blitzed Venus Williams in straight sets in her
previous match, constantly caught the 18-year-old Hingis
flatfooted, disguising the direction of her strokes until the last
second.
	   Hingis also struggled with her ankle.
	   ``Even when the ball was just a few feet (a meter) away, when I
was moving the wrong direction, I couldn't turn around,'' said
Hingis.
	   But Hingis rallied in both the final two sets, including
fighting back from 1-4 down in the third. She also fought off two
match points before losing.
	   ``I think I played the best match of my life. But when you have
nothing to lose and the other player has a lot to lose, it's
easier,'' said Van Roost, 25, who will break into the top 10 in
next week's ranking.
	   Davenport, who turned pro in 1993, was inspired by Jennifer
Capriati capturing the Olympic singles' title a year earlier.
	   ``I thought that was the coolest thing that could happen to
someone. I knew then, at the latest, that I had chosen the right
path,'' said Davenport, who also captured Olympic gold in 1996.
	   Spain's Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, the fourth seed, became the
first player to reach the semifinals after she rallied from 1-4
down in the second set to beat Lisa Raymond of the United States,
1-6, 7-5, 6-2.

Pakistan apologizes for killing an Indian border guard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Pakistan on Friday apologized for firing
on Indian border guards in northwestern India, killing one of them,
a paramilitary officer said.
	   The commander of Pakistan Rangers sent a written apology about
Thursday's incident on the India-Pakistan border in Rajasthan
state, Press Trust of India news agency quoted Bakshish Singh,
inspector-general of India's Border Security Force, as saying.
	   Pakistan had no immediate comment.
	   Indian and Pakistani security forces routinely exchange gunfire
on their disputed border in Kashmir. But tension mounted after
Thursday's firing incident in Barmer sector in Rajasthan state, 750
kilometers (470 miles) southwest of New Delhi.
	   Pakistani securitymen fired gunshots on the Indian patrol,
killing one border guard and wounding another, Singh said.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Helen Suzman, for decades the
lone white voice against apartheid in Parliament, resigned Friday
from the South African Human Rights Commission, citing her age and
differences with the current government.
	   ``I fundamentally disagree with some things that the government
is doing,'' Suzman , 80, told SABC radio on Friday. ``And I am too
old and too cynical. They need someone younger and more
motivated.''
	   She said she disagrees with President Nelson Mandela's
government's employment equity law passed earlier this year that
forces businesses with more than 50 employees to hire more blacks
and women or face heavy fines.
	   The law will ``have a bad effect on international investment''
and deprive companies of the flexibility they need to survive
market forces, Suzman said.

UN to be in contact with new Angola party, but still wants UNITA

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Angola's efforts to prevent a U.N. envoy
from meeting the leader of the former rebel group UNITA contravene
the U.N. mandate to oversee the country's 1994 peace accord,
according to a report Friday by the U.N. chief.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the Angola government had
warned the representative, Issa Diallo, that they would cease all
contacts with him if he met with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
	   A planned Sept. 21 meeting did not occur because the government
said it could not ensure Diallo's safety in travelling to Savimbi's
headquarters.
	   The Angolan government has ceased contact with Savimbi, accusing
him of reneging on the 1994 peace accord that ended a 2-decade-old
civil war. The accord has been crumbling recently with renewed
fighting and the government's decision to negotiate only with a
group of UNITA dissidents who split with Savimbi.
	   Angola and the leaders of the Southern Africa Development
Community have urged the United Nations recognize the dissidents in
lieu of Savimbi.
	   Although it principally blames Savimbi for stalling
implementation of the accord, the United Nations will not recognize
the dissident group, arguing that Savimbi is the legitimate partner
and noting that he still controls land and armed troops.
	   Diallo has nonetheless met with the UNITA dissidents, ``who
conveyed to him their determination to assist in the
implementation'' of the peace accords, the report said.
	   Annan instructed Diallo ``to maintain contacts with all
concerned, old parties and new, in an attempt to give peace a
chance,'' it said.
	   Annan specifically called on Angola to allow Diallo to meet with
Savimbi. ``The government should facilitate this contact, which
would help to establish UNITA's real intentions.''
	   UNITA fought a civil war against the government for nearly two
decades after Angola won independence from Portugal in 1975. The
1994 accord ended the fighting, but the United Nations says UNITA
has resisted implementing it, particularly by refusing to hand over
four key territories and demobilize its troops.
	   The dissidents, who have formed a group called the UNITA
Renovation Committee, support peace and national reconciliation,
Angola's vice-minister for foreign relations, Joao Bernardo
Miranda, said last week in an address to the U.N. General Assembly.
	   The Security Council has urged the government reconsider its
decision to sever contact with Savimbi.

Bruised Brazil finally feeling like a winner
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ After taking a beating in the
global market maelstrom, Brazil at last feels like a winner.
	   A simple communique on Thursday that the International Monetary
Fund supports Brazil's economic policy was enough to boost the Sao
Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, and quash
expectations of a currency devaluation.
	   On closer look, the rush of optimism might seem hasty. After a
week of talks in Washington, D.C., Brazil emerged without any money
or even an agreement with the Fund.
	   But the IMF's endorsement should bring the government some badly
needed credibility, at least until it reveals its proposal for
reducing the budget deficit this month.
	   If the Fund likes the proposal, it could come through with a
loan package worth some dlrs 30 billion, with funds from other
public and private lenders. It's a big ``if,'' but Brazilians as
usual looked on the bright side.
	   ``Fund gives green light to unprecedented accord with the
country,'' trumpeted the headline Friday in Gazeta Mercantil,
Brazil's top financial daily.
	   The first problem to fix is the budget deficit, now at more than
70 billion reals, upwards of dlrs 60 billion _ a staggering 7.3
percent of gross domestic product.
	   The size of the hole raised doubts that Brazil could get
financing to cover it. And with the crisis in Asia and Russia,
money dried up and uncertainty turned to panic.
	   In August and September, investors withdrew some dlrs 30 billion
from the country. Brazil's once-comfortable cash reserves plunged
to about dlrs 47 billion, and the outflow continues at the pace of
about dlrs 400 million a day.
	   While President Fernando Henrique Cardoso warned that tough
austerity measures were needed, he seemed reluctant to take them
before national elections on Oct. 4.
	   But voters overwhelmingly re-elected him on the first ballot,
and the 67-year-old sociologist promised to have a remedy ready by
Oct. 20.
	   It surely will be bitter. Brazil promised the IMF it will come
up with a combination of more taxes and reduced spending that adds
up to about 25 billion reals, or dlrs 21 billion, a year.
	   Cardoso says he doesn't want to tax salaried workers or the
producing sector. He has suggested raising a tax on financial
operations and levying one on large fortunes, but it's not clear if
it will be enough.
	   Meanwhile, spending cuts could mean less money for already
dilapidated public schools and hospitals, as well as higher
unemployment. Most private economists see a recession coming.
	   ``1999 will be a difficult year,'' Finance Minister Pedro Malan
told Brazilian reporters in Washington.
	   But it could have been worse. The IMF agreed with Brazil that
there need not be a currency devaluation, which proved so
disastrous in Russia and Asia. It was a victory for Cardoso and the
Plano Real, his 1994 economic blueprint that eliminated four-digit
inflation.

Italian premier loses confidence vote, forced to resign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: LEADS with 5 grafs to ADD believed to be first lost vote of
confidence since war. Picks up 6th graf prv, `He quickly ...' &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A cost-cutting government that had been Italy's
second-longest-lasting since World War II collapsed Friday,
throwing into question Italy's next phase of financial reforms and
participation in any NATO attack on Yugoslavia.
	   Premier Romano Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, center-left coalition had
held together during its drive to qualify for Europe's common
currency but lost momentum and fell apart after it reached its goal
earlier this year. Communists brought about its end by withdrawing
support over Prodi's 1999 budget, saying they wanted more spending
for jobs.
	   Their rebellion forced Friday's vote of confidence in the
Chamber of Deputies. Prodi lost it by a single vote, 313-312, with
the surprise defection of a lawmaker in his own coalition.
	   Opposition lawmakers roared their approval at the tally and
burst into applause. Prodi slipped away from the presidential
palace so quickly that he outpaced his security agents and briefly
found himself facing reporters alone.
	   ``I'm not bitter,'' said Prodi, whose government was believed to
be Italy's first postwar government to lose a vote of confidence.
	   He quickly submitted his resignation to President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, who asked him to keep leading the government for the time
being.
	   Scalfaro must decide whether to call early elections _ a step
few want and few expect _ or ask Prodi or someone else to try to
form a new government.
	   Centrist leader Francesco Cossiga appealed to leading parties of
the left and right to work together to form a caretaker government
that would see Italy through tough spots ahead, including passage
of the budget.
	   ``I ask them because as the major political forces, only they
can form a government with the authority needed to face the
delicate international financial situation and the crisis in
Kosovo,'' Cossiga said.
	   A no-frills, no-thrills leader, Prodi had came to power after
Italy briefly was led by a center-right coalition headed by media
magnate Silvio Berlusconi, now the opposition leader.
	   Prodi presided over budget cuts and a temporary tax increase
needed to get Italy's economy in shape for the 1999 debut of
Europe's common currency. It qualified for the euro debut earlier
this year, impressing _ and surprising _ many fellow European Union
members with less volatile politics.
	   Prodi would have had to keep on cutting costs to stay in line
with requirements for the European Monetary Union. Communists
wanted more spending, not less.
	   To woo them going into Friday's vote, Prodi pledged that his
government would work to make law a 35-hour work week _ their pet
project.
	   He also held back from endorsing NATO airstrikes on Serbia
without specific backing from the U.N. Security Council, also a
Communist demand.
	   Italy is just across the Adriatic from Yugoslavia, and its bases
and ports could be important to any NATO attack over Yugoslavia's
treatment of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Parliament would have to
approve Italy's participation.
	   The opposition contended that even a win wouldn't have avoided
more crises for Prodi.
	   Winning the confidence vote would ``only put off the dramatic
question of Kosovo,'' said Rocco Buttiglione, a leading centrist
voice.
	   ``Now we should go to the polls,'' said Berlusconi.
	   However, analysts predicted a new majority will be found to pass
the budget, without new elections.
	   ``Political instability will be limited in the next few days,''
said Bruno Rovelli, an economist with Citibank in Milan.
	   Prodi led Italy's 55th government since World War II. He
outlasted all but Bettino Craxi, a Socialist who served 3 1/2 years
in two back-to-back stints from 1983 to 1987.

Swiss Ulrich leads the driving event provisional standings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Werner Ulrich of Switzerland on Friday moved atop
the provisional standings of the driving event at the 1998 World
Equestrian Games in Rome.
	   After the marathon, Germany's Michael Freund, the 1994 World
Champion at The Hague, Netherlands, placed second, while Tomas
Eriksson of Sweden finished third.
	   The driving test is the only equestrian discipline where horses
are not ridden. Instead, riders drive a carriage which has to pass
three tests, dressage, marathon and obstacles.
	   Combined with the dressage test from Wednesday and Thursday,
Ulrich totaled 141.20 penalty points, very close to Freund's 142.12
and Eriksson's 142.28.
	   The top U.S. rider was Tucker Johnson, who was 8th with 151.48
penalties, followed by James Fairclough, 19th, with 169.52, and Sam
Groenewoud, 22nd, with 175.84 penalties.
	   The driving event, both in the individual and team competition,
ends on Saturday with its final test, the obstacles.
	   On the teams' sides, The Netherlands led the standings, while
Germany was second ahead of Sweden. The United States was sixh.
	   At the last World Games in 1996 in Waregen, Belgium, Germany won
the silver medal behind Belgium and ahead of Britain.
	   The driving event was held in Pratoni del Vivaro, 50 kilometers
(30 miles) southeast of Rome, at a track inaugurated during the
Rome 1960 Olympic Games.
	   Also on Saturday, the individual show-jumping event continues
with the 25 best riders competing for the final's four spots.

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Fourth-seed Andre Agassi advanced to
the semifinals of the dlrs 1 million Swiss Indoors, trampling
Sweden's Magnus Gustafsson in straight sets Friday in the round of
eight.
	   Agassi, the only seed aside from Britain's Tim Henman to avoid
early round upsets, continued to march unhampered through the
quarterfinals, defeating Gustafsson 6-3, 6-3 in 1 hour, 17 minutes.
	   After a nine-minute first game, Agassi took control of the
match, breaking Gustafsson's second serve in the opening set with a
game at love to go up 2-1.
	   Then leading 5-3 with Gustafsson serving, the American broke
again to cinch the set.
	   Agassi coninuted his dominance in the second set, breaking the
Swede's opening serve.
	   However, faced with the same situation as in the first set,
leading 15-40 at 5-2, the American squandered three match points,
giving the Swede the game.
	   But the American, who reached the quarterfinals without dropping
a set, refused to let a second opportunity slip by, closing the
match on his next service game.
	   ``Magnus is a really tough opponent,'' said Agassi, the winner
of four tournaments this season. ``He's a veteran who knows how to
play the big points.
	   ``But my game has seen a lot of improvement and I'm feeling more
and more confident. I'm more ready to step up and take control of
the match.''
	   Gustafsson's compatriot Thomas Johansson was more successful,
the Swede defeating France's Fabrice Santoro 6-3, 6-3 in another
quarterfinal.
	   Later in the day Henman, seeded sixth, took on Germany's Nicolas
Kiefer, and home-favorite Marc Rosset faced German qualifier David
Prinosil.

	   UDINE, Italy (AP) _ Italy's defender Gianluca Pessotto pulled a
right thigh muscle during the final warmup and will be unable to
play Sarturday's Euro 2000 qualifying against Switzerland, team
officials said Friday.
	   Coach Dino Zoff was expected to field Fiorentina's veteran
Moreno Torricelli in place of Pessotto, who plays with Juventus of
Turin.
	   The newly appointed Italian coach, who debuted with a 2-0
victory in the European qualifier against Wales, will also have to
do without injured striker Christian Vieri and veteran forward
Roberto Baggio.
	   Zoff was expected to start Juventus forwards Alessandro Del

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Iran joined Middle East efforts to mediate
a Turkish-Syrian dispute over Kurdish rebels, expressing hope
Friday that a feared war between the two neighbors could be
averted.
	   Following Egypt's try at shuttle diplomacy earlier this week,
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi flew in from the Syrian
capital of Damascus for talks with Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
	   Turkey issued an ultimatum to Syria this week, demanding that it
expel Kurdish rebels from its territory or ``face the
consequences.''
	   Turkish news media have suggested airstrikes on suspected rebel
bases in the Syrian controlled-Bekaa Valley of Lebanon were
possible.
	   Syria denies the accusations. Turkey's warlike rhetoric has
raised fears of a regional conflict.
	   ``If everything goes right, there may soon be a peaceful
settlement of the situation,'' Kharrazi said after the talks. ``But
it is early to speculate on that.''
	   Iran entered mediation efforts as the head of the Organization
of the Islamic Conference, a 55-member group that includes Syria
and Turkey. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak shuttled between the
two countries earlier this week.
	   ``The important thing is to search for a peaceful solution to
the crisis. It is the wish of all Muslim countries,'' Kharrazi
said.
	   In a meeting on the crisis, Turkey's military and civilian
leaders decided to try harder to explain Ankara's position to
Middle Eastern leaders, independent NTV television reported.
	   Turkey has been fighting the accusation that its sudden outcry
against Damascus was prompted by its recent strengthening of ties
with Israel.
	   ``Everybody is asking, ``Why now?'' Cem, the foreign minister,
told the English-language Turkish Daily News. He said the Turkish
people had shown patience for years, but now ``had come to the
point of explosion.''
	   The conflict between Turkey's army and autonomy-seeking Kurds in
Turkey's southeast has killed 37,000 since 1984.
	   Syria has asked the United States, a close ally of Ankara, to
take an objective stand on the dispute, the official Syrian
newspaper Al-Thawra said Friday.
	   Washington should ``take a balanced and clear position toward
the provocative statements made by Turkish officials,'' it quoted
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa as telling U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Martin Indyk.
	   On a visit Thursday to Cairo, Indyk urged Syria to ``take
seriously'' Turkey's concerns.
	   Turkey has asked Syria to extradite rebel leaders alleged to be
living in Damascus.

	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ American Andre Agassi and Britain's
Tim Henman were the only seeded-players to book places in the
semifinals of the dlrs 1 million Swiss Indoors, each posting solid
wins in Friday's quarterfinals.
	   Left untouched by the early round massacre, which saw world No.
1 Pete Sampras and world No. 2 Patrick Rafter crash out,
fourth-seed Agassi marched through to the quarterfinals unhampered
before trampling Sweden's Magnus Gustafsson 6-3, 6-3.
	   While sixth-seed Henman went to three sets in both opening
rounds, the Briton needed just two sets to dispose of Nicolas
Kiefer in the quarterfinals, defeating the German 6-3, 6-4.
	   After a nine-minute first game, Agassi took control of his
quarterfinal, breaking Gustafsson's second serve with a love game
to go up 2-1.
	   Then leading 5-3 with Gustafsson serving, the American broke
again to clinch the set.
	   Agassi continued his dominance in the second, breaking the
Swede's opening serve.
	   However, faced with a similar situation as in the first set,
leading 15-40 at 5-2 on Gustaffson's serve, the American went on
the squander three match points, giving the Swede the game.
	   But the American, who reached the quarterfinals without dropping
a set, refused to let a second opportunity slip by, closing the
match on his next service game.
	   ``Magnus is a really tough opponent,'' said Agassi, the winner
of four tournaments this season. ``He's a veteran who knows how to
play the big points.
	   ``But my game has seen a lot of improvement and I'm feeling more
and more confident. I'm more ready to step up and take control of
the match.''
	   Henman was similarly dominant in his quarterfinal.
	   Leading 4-3 on Kiefer's serve, Henman broke then held to quickly
take the first set.
	   In the second set, the Briton again grabbed the advantage,
breaking to take a 3-2 lead.
	   Henman then simply held serve, sealing the match with a pair of
aces, extending his winning streak to 10 consecutive wins.
	   ``I have no complaints,'' said the 24-year-old Henman, who
reached the top 10 in the ATP rankings this season for the first
time in his career. ``I served extremely well and put pressure on
my opponent, which was the key to the match.''
	   In Saturday's semifinals, Henman will meet Thomas Johansson of
Sweden, who defeated France's Fabrice Santoro 6-3, 6-3 in his
quarterfinal.
	   Later in the day home-favorite Marc Rosset played German
qualifier David Prinosil in the last quarterfinal.

US mediators present reworked Kosovo plan to both sides
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Amid increased American pressure on
on Serbia to end the Kosovo bloodshed, U.S. diplomats are also
pushing for acceptance of a reworked political plan on giving
Albanians there some self rule, sources said Friday.
	   The U.S.-drafted reworked plan reportedly has been presented to
both Serbian government and ethnic Albanian politicians in Kosovo
but neither side has publicly reacted, said the sources, ethnic
Albanians close to the negotiations, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The revised plan appears to have taken some Albanian demands
into consideration, like stripping the Serbian and Yugoslav
governments of any say over local Kosovo policy decisions.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke was meeting Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic for the fourth time in five days Friday to
convince him to end the conflict or face NATO strikes.
	   The sources said the draft would give the majority Albanian
province of Serbia its own parliament and government, an acting
president and an ombudsman _ presumably a foreigner _ in charge
implementing the plan. Kosovo police, now Serbs in the tens of
thousands, would be reduced to no more than 2,500 _ most of them
Albanians _ and be headed by an ethnic Albanian with a Serb deputy.
	   The reworked version of the plan gives the Serbian and Yugoslav
government no say in the work of the local Kosovo authorities. Only
international issues would be controlled by the federal government.
Kosovo would also have its own judicial system.
	   Army units would be deployed only at the borders of the
province.
	   It was not clear whether the two sides would agree to the plan.
Milosevic rose to power a decade ago by revoking the province's
autonomy, citing alleged harassment of Serbs by majority ethnic
Albanians.

Bormio to host ''mini-Olympics'' in 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ For the first time, all five World Cup ski
circuits will stage their finals at the same Alpine area _ Bormio
and neighboring resorts _ in March 2000.
	   The U.S. venue of Salt Lake City will host the finals of a
possibly expanded World Cup program in 2004, the newly elected
president of the International Ski Federation (FIS) announced
Friday.
	   Gianfranco Kasper said that the ``mini Olympics'' _ including
Alpine, cross-country, Nordic combined, freestyle and snowboard _
will be held every four years when neither the Olympic Games nor
World Championships are scheduled.
	   The purpose is to draw attention of ski fans and boost
television audiences.
	   Salt Lake City will host the next winter Olympics in 2002. Vail
and St. Anton will organize the World Championships in 1999 and
2001.
	   Kasper said Salt Lake City organizers will rely on the Olympic
infrastructures to host the World Cup finals in 2004.
	   In March 2000, the encompassing World Cup finals will be held in
Bormio, Santa Caterina, Livigno and St. Moritz.
	   St. Moritz, which will host the Nordic combined, is in Swiss
territory but less than 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Bormio, the
Italian Alpine resort north of Milan. Santa Caterina and Livigno
are within 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Bormio.
	   Kasper, in Milan to attend a ski conference, said World Cup
finals of biathlon and telemark may be added to the Bormio program.
	   The tentative date for the 2000 finals is March 15-19,
organizers said.
	   Until now, the difference World Cup circuits all have organized
their own finals.
	   Bormio staged the World Alpine Championships in 1985 and is the
yearly site of a World Cup downhill.

Commonwealth calls for the lifting of sanctions against Nigeria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARA BELLABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Commonwealth ministers called on member nations
Friday to begin lifting sanctions against Nigeria as a reward for
its promise to return to civilian rule next year.
	   But Nigeria may not fully rejoin the Commonwealth, the 54-nation
association of Britain and its former colonies, until the ministers
are assured that Nigeria's Feb. 27 presidential elections succeed
in creating a democratic government, said Commonwealth
Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku.
	   Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth in 1995.
	   ``We want to give you encouragement to continue along the
correct path you now have chosen,'' Anyaoku said to Ignatius
Olisemeka, the foreign minister of Nigeria who attended the
eight-nation meeting of Commonwealth ministers in London.
	   Nigeria's new government, led by Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, has
moved quickly to end the country's international pariah status.
Abubakar came to power in early June following dictator Gen. Sani
Abacha's sudden death by a heart attack.
	   Abubakar has freed political prisoners, welcomed in foreign
envoys, invited exiles to return and committed his military
government to elections next year.
	   In return, Abubakar has continually appealed for the
international community to recognize the changes and lift economic
sanctions.
	   The U.S. has said it is willing to give military aid to Nigeria
if Abubakar follows through on his pledge to hand over power after
the election.
	   Britain also has said that it expects the 15-nation European
Union, which imposed an arms sale ban, a sports boycott and blocks
on some development aid in November 1995, to lift all embargoes
soon, except on arms.
	   Most of the sanctions against Nigeria were imposed after
Abacha's regime hanged nine dissidents, including playwright Ken
Saro-Wiwa.
	   By calling for Commonwealth nations to begin lifting sanctions,
the committee said they were ``recognizing the progress made by
Nigeria so far.''
	   Olisemeka said he was pleased by the committee's recommendations
and assured them, ``we know where we are now.''
	   The committee is made up of three of Nigeria's fellow African
nations _ South Africa, Zimbabwe and Ghana _ as well as Britain,
Canada, Malaysia, Jamaica and New Zealand.

Southern air base increasing security in case of Yugoslav

retaliation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A military base in southern Italy is stepping up
security for fear of Yugoslav retaliation for any NATO strikes, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   Italy is just across the Adriatic from Yugoslavia; Italians have
yet to say whether they would take part in a proposed NATO attack
over Yugoslavia's treatment of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   Italy's military has flown in warplanes from bases elsewhere in
the country to boost its strength at the base at Bari, on the
Adriatic Coast, Milan's Il Giornale daily reported.
	   The military drew up defense plans for the base Thursday, the
newspaper said. The base also is running drills to prepare for any
enemy attack, Il Giornale said.
	   ``These are the normal security procedures that are adopted in
these cases,'' the paper quoted Col. Mirko Zuliani as saying.

Human rights group urges removal of Chilean from U.N. job
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to RECAST. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations is awaiting
clarification from Chile on allegations that a top military officer
working for a U.N. mission committed human rights abuses during the
Pinochet dictatorship.
	   Based on what the government says, the United Nations would
decide whether or not to ask that Chile remove Brig. Gen. Sergio
Espinoza Davies as chief of the U.N. Military Observer Group in
India and Pakistan, spokesman Fred Eckhard said Friday.
	   Human Rights Watch is urging his removal, saying in a letter to
the U.N. chief that Espinoza's documented participation ``in the
worst human rights abuses in his home country'' renders him unfit
to lead the U.N. group that patrols the tense Kashmir province.
	   Espinoza, then a captain, was a member of at least one of
Chile's notorious war councils, which issued a number of death
sentences against leftists after Augusto Pinochet staged a military
coup in 1973, Human Rights Watch said.
	   Chile's National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation later
found that judges on the tribunals had an unsatisfactory level of
basic legal knowledge and concluded that many proceedings were used
to justify otherwise illegal executions, the organization said.
	   Espinoza on Friday refused to answer reporters' questions about
the charges. ``I don't talk to the press,'' his secretary in
Lahore, Pakistan, quoted Espinoza as saying.
	   According to a report by the civilian government that succeeded
Pinochet, 3,197 people were killed for political reasons after
Pinochet came to power, including 1,102 who disappeared. Thousands
more were tortured, forced into exile, or both.
	   Pinochet relinquished most of his powers to a civilian
government in 1990. He is still a senator.
	   The United Nations has known about the Espinoza allegations for
over a month, after the widow of socialist leader Freddy Taverna,
executed on Oct. 30, 1973, sent Secretary-General Kofi Annan a copy
of his death sentence. Jenny Arancibia said her husband was
sentenced by a tribunal on which Espinoza was a member.
	   Since then, the United Nations has repeatedly sought
clarifications from Espinoza and Chile. Espinoza denied the charges
and Chile hasn't provided a satisfactory official response, Eckhard
said.
	   The United Nations was waiting for such a response before taking
any action. Several calls to the Chilean U.N. mission were not
returned Friday.
	   While stressing that he has no proof of the charges, Eckhard
noted that the United Nations doesn't conduct background checks on
people offered by member states to participate in missions.
	   ``We don't second-guess governments,'' Eckhard said. ``We expect
governments to give us honorable, reputable people to serve in
peacekeeping missions, and most of the time they do.''
	   While not defending Espinoza by name, the Chilean army on Friday
re-released a communique defending the war councils on which he
served.
	   Criticism of Espinoza was aimed at ``damaging the image of the
institution (the army) and of the officers in an unfair manner,
since all they did was to carry on their duties,'' said the
communique, dated Sept. 4 after the first allegations began to
surface.
	   The councils, the communique said, worked in accordance with
Chile's military justice code, which dates from 1925. Officers
ordered to sit on the councils had to obey because ``that was a
military obligation,'' it said.

airstrikes
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with NATO ambassadors working to finalize details of
air-strike plan, agree legal basis. TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO allies and Russia on Friday urged
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the violence in
Kosovo, but Russia remained opposed to NATO's plan to try to end
the crisis with air strikes.
	   At a meeting of NATO ambassadors with Sergei Kisliak, the
Russian envoy to the alliance, ``there remained a different
perception on the use of force,'' said a NATO official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said the allies and Russia agreed on ``the
importance that (U.S. special envoy Richard) Holbrooke has gone
back to Belgrade'' to continue his peace efforts. ``We need to give
Holbrooke some time now.''
	   Holbrooke held new talks with Milosevic on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the NATO ambassadors were to meet through the weekend
to finalize details of the planned air strikes against Serbia,
including targeting and rules of engagement.
	   They will also seek to find consensus on the ``legal basis'' for
raids, an issue about which NATO officials expected agreement soon.
The United States and Britain say NATO needs no authorization from
the United Nations to launch air raids, but other European allies
have doubts.
	   If agreement is found, and Holbrookes' mission to Belgrade
fails, NATO officials say the next step will be approval of an
``activation order'' which would authorize the allied military to
launch an air strike within days.
	   However, NATO officials acknowledged the political situation in
two leading European allies - Germany and Italy, could delay that
decision until next week. The Italian government collapsed Friday
and Germany is negotiating to form a new government after last
month's election.
	   After a two-and-a-half hour meeting, the NATO ambassadors and
their Russian colleague issued a joint-statement that expressed
``full support for the ongoing diplomatic efforts aimed at securing
a political solution to the crisis ... and stressed the need to see
immediate, full and irreversible compliance with U.N. Security
Council resolutions.''
	   NATO officials said Russia agreed with the allies that
Milosevic' compliance with U.N. demands to end the violence ``has
not been enough.''

	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ American Andre Agassi and Britain's
Tim Henman were the only seeded-players to book places in the
semifinals of the dlrs 1 million Swiss Indoors, each posting solid
wins in Friday's quarterfinals.
	   Left untouched by the early round massacre, which saw world No.
1 Pete Sampras and world No. 2 Patrick Rafter crash out,
fourth-seed Agassi marched through to the quarterfinals unhampered
before trampling Sweden's Magnus Gustafsson 6-3, 6-3.
	   While sixth-seed Henman went to three sets in both opening
rounds, the Briton needed just two sets to dispose of Nicolas
Kiefer in the quarterfinals, defeating the German 6-3, 6-4.
	   After a nine-minute first game, Agassi took control of his
quarterfinal, breaking Gustafsson's second serve with a love game
to go up 2-1.
	   Then leading 5-3 with Gustafsson serving, the American broke
again to clinch the set.
	   Agassi continued his dominance in the second, breaking the
Swede's opening serve.
	   However, faced with a similar situation as in the first set,
leading 15-40 at 5-2 on Gustaffson's serve, the American went on
the squander three match points, giving the Swede the game.
	   But the American, who reached the quarterfinals without dropping
a set, refused to let a second opportunity slip by, closing the
match on his next service game.
	   ``Magnus is a really tough opponent,'' said Agassi, the winner
of four tournaments this season. ``He's a veteran who knows how to
play the big points.
	   ``But my game has seen a lot of improvement and I'm feeling more
and more confident. I'm more ready to step up and take control of
the match.''
	   Agassi will face home favorite Marc Rosset in the semifinal,
after the Swiss player won his semifinal match 6-3, 7-6 (7-2)
against German qualifier David Prinosil.
	   ``The people in Switzerland are going to hate me if I beat three
Swiss,'' joked Agassi, who defeated Swiss players Roger Federer and
Ivo Heuberger in the first two rounds. ``But when Rosset is on,
he's hard to beat.
	   ``He's is a big guy with big serves, and he's not scared to take
risks.''
	   Henman was similarly serving big and taking risks in his
quarterfinal match against Kiefer.
	   Leading 4-3 on Kiefer's serve, Henman broke then held to quickly
take the first set.
	   In the second set, the Briton again grabbed the advantage,
breaking to take a 3-2 lead.
	   Henman then simply held serve, sealing the match with a pair of
aces, extending his winning streak to 10 consecutive wins.
	   ``I have no complaints,'' said the 24-year-old Henman, who
reached the top 10 in the ATP rankings this season for the first
time in his career. ``I served extremely well and put pressure on
my opponent, which was the key to the match.''
	   In Saturday's semifinals, Henman will meet Thomas Johansson of
Sweden, who defeated France's Fabrice Santoro 6-3, 6-3 in his
quarterfinal.
	   Later in the day home-favorite Marc Rosset played German
qualifier David Prinosil in the last quarterfinal.

Germany's Bau foils Italy and Romania

<TEXT>
	   LA CHAUX-DE-FONDS, Switzerland (AP) _ Germany's Sabine Bau won
the women's foil title Friday at the world fencing championships,
marking the first time in nine years that neither an Italian or
Romanian has lifted the crown.
	   Bau, runner-up at last year's worlds, defeated Russia's Svetlana
Bojko 14-8 in the gold medal final, to become the fifth German
woman in history to claim the title, and the first since Anja
Fichtel-Mauritz won in 1990.
	   Failing to defend her crown, two time world champion and Olympic
gold medalist Giovanna Trillini of Italy was forced to settle for
bronze, which she shared with compatriot Valentina Vezzali.
	   Also a world champion in 1991 and Olympic titlist in 1992, it
was widely expected that Trillini would be in the fight over gold
with Vezzali.
	   Instead the World Cup leader went out in the semifinals, after a
narrow 15-13 loss to Bojko.
	   Bau, silver medallist at the Seoul Olympics in 1988, defeated
Vezzali 15-9 in the semifinal to book her place in the gold-medal
duel.
	   Poland won the men's team foil title, defeating titlist France
45-40 in the gold-medal showdown.
	   The Polish team, which included individual bronze medallist
Piotr Kiepikowski, edged Cuba 4Qt-mk/FX|B? &QR; } &LR; iA{Rko#L{c)i

silver, while
South Korea bested Cuba for the bronze medal.	   Competition continues Saturday with the men's team sabre and

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The models in stiletto heels marched down
the runway to a techno beat, while laser rays highlighted the
pretty clothes of the latest Versace collection.
	   The clothes, presented Friday night, still had the Versace sexy
edge, but they were softer and more delicate than in past seasons.
Pretty slip gowns, a loosely fitted jacket, slits that hint rather
than holler and quiet pastel shades all combined to create a good
spring 1999 feeling.
	   A year after her brother Gianni was killed by a gunman outside
his Miami Beach mansion, Donatella, who took up the label's
designing torch, says she feels ``relaxed, if not happy''.
	   The clothes reflect this mood. Aside from the more off-the body
shapes, the outfits are more about Donatella's love for fabric
experimentation than shock styles.
	   In her years working beside her brother, Donatella was always
searching for new fabrics. This round she mingles silk with
cashmere and steel, punctures cowhide, and combines canvas and
organza to create a basket weave effect.
	   There are plenty of short styles in the new collection, from the
silk-and-steel pleated skirts, to the linen and stretch net cotton
gauze high-collared mini dresses, but they are demure rather than
daring.
	   Footwear remains ultrahigh. The models had a hard time
negotiating the fast-paced runway in their 6-inch stiletto sandals.
But Donatella, whose fiery personality detracts from her small
stature, is rarely caught without them.
	   Delicate floral prints, and wisps of pastel shades along with
yellow, aquamarine pink and turquoise lend to the upbeat mood of
the collection.
	   Gianfranco Ferre plans to mark his 20 years as a designer with a
big bash in his new glass-encased digs near Milan's trendy Brera
area Friday night. His latest spring-summer show presented Thursday
was a self ode to his talent.
	   The bearded and rotund architect-turned-designer went to fashion
town.
	   To mark his passion for leather he sent out models in aggressive
short black numbers, with soaring hemlines, mean slits and bold
metal studs. To herald his love of transparency he offered a
fishnet jumpsuit clinging to a nude body, covered by nothing more
than a stiff band around the hips.
	   To sing the praises of his structured fashion he created ball
gowns in shimmery, copper-colored velvet and taffeta, worthy of the
most sumptuous 19th-century ball. Interspersed throughout the
collection was the famous white Ferre shirt, with stiff collar,
wide cuff, and extra long tails.
	   Earlier Thursday, the inventive Dolce and Gabbana duo produced a
colorful show dedicated to the seaside.
	   Fabric treated with laser beams created wavelike effects on
slithering evening gowns and shimmering tube dresses worn with tiny
cashmere shrugs, while rubberized silk was hand painted with a
school of sardines or golden palm trees.
	   The favorite summer shades were green and blue made to sparkle
like the sun dancing off the water.
	   The nine-day ``Moda Milanese'' preview presentations for the
spring-summer 1999 end Saturday with the Giorgio Armani collection.

Arafat says success of peace summit depends on Israelis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with news conference &QL; 
 &UR; By MATTI HUUHTANEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat warned
Friday that the Middle East will be thrown into confusion if the
peace process fails, and said that the success of next week's talks
in Washington depends on Israel.
	   ``The most important thing is that if we do not do our best, all
of us, to protect ... the peace process, then confusion will happen
in the whole area of the Middle East,'' Arafat told reporters on a
short visit to Helsinki.
	   ``We have to wait and see how the Israelis will react to the
American initiatives which have been declared and which we have
accepted,'' he said.
	   Arafat said he had the right to declare an independent state for
the Palestinians next year but stopped short of saying he would do
so.
	   ``According to the (Mideast peace) agreement I have the right to
declare the independence of a Palestinian state at the end of the
five years of the interim agreement,'' Arafat said.
	   ``And, no doubt, on the fourth of next May '99 we have the right
to declare our independent state,'' he added, but declined to
comment further.
	   Arafat arrived in Finland after talks with President Boris
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow, where he
invited Russia to the U.S.-sponsored meeting next week as a
co-sponsor of the Mideast peace process.
	   Yeltsin said his government might be interested in participating
in the talks, scheduled to open outside Washington on Oct. 15. But
he said Russia first wants to know the views of Israel and the
United States on the plan.
	   Russia is officially a co-sponsor of the peace process launched
by a conference in Madrid, Spain, in 1991. But the United States
has played a far greater role.
	   Arafat declined to say whether Israel and the United States
would welcome a more active Russian role, but he said he had also
invited the European Union and ``Arab countries, including Egypt,''
to the talks.
	   Reacting to the appointment of Ariel Sharon as the new Israeli
foreign minister, who has been placed in charge of the negotiations
with the Palestinians, he said, ``It's up to them (the Israelis).''
	   ``This is a pure interior Israeli affair. We don't interfere,''
Arafat said, adding that he would be prepared to shake hands with
Sharon in Washington if the feeling was mutual.
	   Arafat met with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari before he
left for Oslo, Norway.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Apartheid-era laws banning
homosexual relations were struck down on Friday by South Africa's
highest court, which ruled men convicted of sodomy since 1994 could
demand monetary damages and have their criminal records cleared.
	   The constitutional court's decision formalized guarantees
granted in 1994, when white minority rule ended and a provisional
constitution banned discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation, race or gender.
	   The National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality said
Friday's ruling could open up adoption, marriage and other rights
for homosexuals.
	   ``The court has said that lesbians and gay men ... have a right
to equality and dignity and privacy,'' said Zackie Achmat, the
group's director.
	   South Africa was the first country to ban discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation in its constitution. But the laws that
criminalized sex between men remained on the books.
	   Sex between women was never officially banned, but was
symbolically stigmatized by the old laws, the court said.
	   Under apartheid, sodomy could be punished with up to seven years
in prison. Men were not even allowed to have casual contact at
social gatherings that could be construed as homosexual behavior.
	   The former South African military practiced so-called ``aversion
therapy'' on gay men, applying electric shocks to victims while
they viewed images of naked men, a report on human rights abuses
said last year.
	   ``Just as apartheid legislation rendered the lives of couples of
different racial groups perpetually at risk, the sodomy offense
(built) insecurity and vulnerability into the daily lives of gay
men,'' the 11-judge panel said in its ruling.
	   Panel-member Judge Albie Sachs wrote in the opinion that the
ruling should be seen ``as part of a growing acceptance of
difference in an increasingly open and pluralistic South Africa.''
	   Since apartheid ended, President Nelson Mandela's government has
pushed to end all forms of discrimination.
	   The country's military protects the rights of gay and lesbian
soldiers. Earlier this year, the police were ordered to include a
lesbian partner under a female officer's medical insurance.

Lawmakers take giant step toward Islamic rule in Pakistan

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani lawmakers on Friday gave
the government sweeping powers to impose laws based on its
interpretation of the Muslim holy book, the Koran, a giant step
toward creating a new Islamic order.
	   With opposition politicians chanting ``shame, shame,'' the
National Assembly voted 151 to 16 to pass the constitutional
amendment _ drawing widespread criticism from human rights groups
and accusations of political power plays from the opposition.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had promised a new Islamic order for
Pakistan, but some said the amendment was more an attempt to
consolidate his power. He also was trying to defuse pressure from
Islamic hard-liners that mounted after U.S.-led economic sanctions
were imposed on Pakistan for its nuclear testing in May.
	   ``I congratulate the nation on the passage of the bill, which
will help create a truly Islamic system,'' Sharif said after the
vote.
	   Under the amendment, the government would be ``obliged'' to
enforce prayers five times a day and collect annual tithings. The
amendment also says that it would override the ``constitution, any
law or judgement of any court.''
	   The opposition, led by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, has
warned that the amendment could pave the way for a strict Islamic
regime similar to that of neighboring Afghanistan, where the
Taliban religious militia rule with an iron hand.
	   Information Minister Mushahid Hussein, however, has said the
government was a ``liberal Muslim'' government that opposed
fundamentalism.
	   Pakistan's army, which maintains behind-the-scenes influence on
policy, has remained silent about the bill. But sources said the
generals were unhappy because it concentrated more power in the
government's hands and could fuel already rampant sectarian
tensions.
	   To become law, the amendment requires a two-thirds majority in
the Senate _ something Sharif may have difficulty acquiring. While
his ruling Pakistan Muslim League controls a two-thirds majority in
the National Assembly, it does not have the Senate votes to pass
the amendment.
	   Some political analysts said Sharif may seek a vote in a joint
session of the two houses, where he would likely be able to muster
the required votes. It is unlikely Sharif could force a vote before
next week.
	   Human rights groups and women's activists have strongly
condemned the amendment, warning that it would embolden militant
members of rival Islamic sects and threaten the rights of women and
minorities.
	   Lawyer Asma Jehangir, a champion of Pakistan's minority
religious groups, accused Sharif of pushing through the amendment
``for their limited power-hungry purposes'' and warned that it
wronged Islam and threatened the country's fragile democracy.
	   The opposition also said the amendment effectively supersedes
Pakistan's constitution and the government could use it to overturn
laws passed by Pakistan's four provincial governments.
	   Sharif promised to protect the rights of Pakistan's minority
religious groups, barely 5 percent of the country's 140 million
people.
	   ``Islam is a religion which has always recognized the rights of
minorities,'' he said.
	   The amendment includes a clause that protects ``personal law
religious freedom, traditions or customs of non-Muslims and their
status as citizens.''
	   But minority religious groups were unconvinced.
	   ``It is a weapon in the hands of fundamentalists, which would be
misused against religious minorities,'' said Shahbaz Bhatti, a
leader of the Christian Liberation Front, an advocacy group for
minority Christians, who number about 2 million in Pakistan.
	   Naveed Qamar, a spokesman for Ms. Bhutto's party in Parliament,
said government ministers have already questioned the Islamic
credentials of those who oppose the bill.
	   ``We don't need any certificate to be a Muslim ... this bill is
going to put you into total confusion,'' said Asfandyar Wali Khan,
a member of the Awami National Party and a strong opponent of the
amendment.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A senior U.S. trouble-shooter
pressed President Slobodan Milosevic on Friday to avoid NATO attack
by accepting international peace terms on Kosovo, and the
alliance's top general urged him to stop toying with Yugoslavia's
survival.
	   Divisions remained among the 16 NATO allies on the use of force,
despite the tough talk from Gen. Wesley Clark, the American supreme
commander of NATO. Italy and Greece, among others, are reluctant to
proceed without a mandate from the U.N. Security Council, where
Russia and China are opposed or other firm legal basis for such a
strike.
	   Still, in dispatching U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke back to
Belgrade, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned
Milosevic that ``time is all but gone'' for a peaceful settlement.
	   After the first round of talks Friday, Milosevic called NATO
threats of airstrikes ``belligerent attempts'' to solve the Kosovo

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A senior U.S. trouble-shooter
pressed President Slobodan Milosevic on Friday to avoid NATO attack
by accepting international peace terms on Kosovo, and the
alliance's top general urged him to stop toying with Yugoslavia's
survival.
	   Divisions remained among the 16 NATO allies on the use of force,
despite the tough talk from Gen. Wesley Clark, the American supreme
commander of NATO.
	   Italy and Greece, among others, are reluctant to proceed without
a mandate from the U.N. Security Council, where Russia and China
are opposed or seeking a legal basis for such a strike.
	   Still, in dispatching U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke back to
Belgrade, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned
Milosevic that ``time is all but gone'' for a peaceful settlement.
	   After the first round of talks Friday, Milosevic called NATO
threats of airstrikes ``belligerent attempts'' to solve the Kosovo
problem, adding that he favors negotiations. The talks resumed
later in the night.
	   Clark said his forces were moving ahead with final attack
preparations. Speaking in Naples, Italy, he questioned why
Milosevic would want to ``risk the ravages of armed conflict and
the destruction of his own country.''
	   Meeting in Brussels, Belgium, NATO allies searched for consensus
for a strike that would allow them to proceed without the direct
blessings of the U.N. Security Council.
	   But the alliance failed in its effort to pressure Russia into
dropping its opposition to airstrikes.
	   ``We must not allow NATO strikes,'' Russian President Boris
Yeltsin was quoted as saying in Moscow Friday. ``We want to achieve
a political, peaceful solution without the use of military force,
and, I think, we shall succeed.''
	   Greek forces will not participate in any possible NATO military
intervention against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, the government said
Friday. But Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said a decision on
intervention may nonetheless be taken as early as this weekend.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have
been driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown
Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting to wrest Kosovo province from Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by Kosovo Liberation Army ``terrorists.''
	   Holbrooke arrived from London, where he met with officials of
the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans. He said that movement
toward authorizing the use of force by NATO continues ``in a
sustained and intense manner.''
	   ``The situation remains just as serious at it has been before,''
he said shortly before the start of his fourth meeting with
Milosevic in five days.
	   In Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital, cafes were full, with
people appearing to make the most of what could be the last few
days of relative peace.
	   ``I am not afraid,'' said Jehona Xhaferi, 25, an ethnic
Albanian. ``Maybe that's crazy, but I see it as the finishing phase
of everything,'' she said, alluding to the months of Kosovo
turmoil.
	   The international demands Holbrooke was presenting to Milosevic
included an immediate end to hostilities and a withdrawal of forces
and heavy armaments to levels before March, before the government
crackdown on Kosovo started.
	   In addition, Holbrooke was expected to press for an
international monitoring force to be allowed to oversee compliance.
	   The KLA announced a unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo
starting today, a move that will add to the pressure on Milosevic
to reciprocate.
	   But Serbian media reported at least five KLA breaches of their
cease-fire Friday. They said Serbian police and ethnic Albanians
loyal to the Serbian government were attacked, but there were no
injuries.
	   The KLA said it was government troops who were on the offensive.
In a statement read on state television in neighboring Albania, the
rebels claimed villages were being attacked west of Pristina, but
added that their troops continued to respect the unilateral
cease-fire.
	   The Serbian and Yugoslav governments showed little sign that
they were prepared to bow to international pressure.
	   Citing the Kosovo crisis and NATO threats of intervention, the
Serbian government Friday put into effect a harsh decree tightening
state control over companies and independent media.
	   The decree broadens government authority and envisions
punishment for companies, institutions and individuals who act
contrary to the government's view of patriotic behavior.

Guatemalan foreign minister critizes Swiss challenge of drug
</HEADLINE>
sentences

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemala's foreign minister criticized
Friday a complaint by Switzerland over the conviction and
sentencing of three Swiss men on drug trafficking charges.
	   Guatemala ``does not accept that rulings by its justice courts
are questioned,'' Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein Barillas said.
``In no way can we accept that a foreign government puts into doubt
the action of one of the powers of state, such as the Supreme Court
of Justice.''
	   Swiss officials have criticized last month's convictions in the
so-called ``German Connection'' case, which involved dlrs 100
million in shipments of cocaine sent from Guatemala to Europe
hidden in containers and ornamental plants.
	   A court in Puerto Barrios ordered former Nestle executive
Andreas Haenggi Wyndler, 60, to serve 12 years in prison and pay a
fine of dlrs 77,000. His son, Nicholas Haenggi Chalandrian, 22, was
sentenced to 20 years and fined dlrs 155,000, as was Swiss citizen
Silvio Giovanoli, 30.
	   A German and a Guatemalan also were sentenced in the case.
	   The Swiss Foreign Ministry called the sentences ``extremely hard
and disproportionate'' and officials asserted that parts of the
proceedings ``didn't meet legal requirements.''
	   Swiss officials said Wednesday that they had lodged a protest
with Stein, but the foreign minister said Friday he had yet to
receive it.

	   LA CHAUX-DE-FONDS, Switzerland (AP) _ Germany's Sabine Bau won
the women's foil title Friday at the world fencing championships,
marking the first time in nine years that neither an Italian or
Romanian has lifted the crown.
	   Bau, runner-up at last year's worlds, defeated Russia's Svetlana
Bojko 14-8 in the gold medal final, to become the fifth German
woman in history to claim the title, and the first since Anja
Fichtel-Mauritz won in 1990.
	   Failing to defend her crown, two time world champion and Olympic
gold medalist Giovanna Trillini of Italy was forced to settle for
bronze, which she shared with compatriot Valentina Vezzali.
	   Also a world champion in 1991 and Olympic titlist in 1992, it
was widely expected that Trillini would be in the fight over gold
with Vezzali.
	   Instead the World Cup leader went out in the semifinals, after a
narrow 15-13 loss to Bojko.
	   Bau, silver medalist at the Seoul Olympics in 1988, defeated
Vezzali 15-9 in the semifinal to book her place in the gold-medal
duel.
	   Poland won the men's team foil title, defeating titlist France
45-40 in the gold-medal showdown. France went home with silver,
while South Korea bested Cuba for the bronze.
	   Competition continues Saturday with the men's team sabre and
teams epee finals.

Bruised Brazil finally feeling like a winner
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro stock exchanges
closing higher. EDITS. &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ After taking a beating in the
global market maelstrom, Brazil at last feels like a winner.
	   A simple communique on Thursday that the International Monetary
Fund supports Brazil's economic policy was enough to boost the Sao
Paulo Stock Exchange _ Latin America's largest _ and quash fears of
a currency devaluation.
	   On closer look, the rush of optimism might seem hasty: After a
week of talks in Washington, Brazil emerged without any money or
even an agreement with the Fund.
	   But the IMF's endorsement should bring the government some badly
needed credibility. And if the Fund likes Brazil's proposal next
month to reduce the budget deficit, the IMF could come through with
a loan package worth about dlrs 30 billion, with money from other
public and private lenders.
	   It's a big ``if,'' but Brazilians as usual looked on the bright
side.
	   Brazil's top financial daily Gazeta Mercantil on Friday
trumpeted the news with a headline reading, ``Fund gives green
light to unprecedented accord with the country.''
	   The optimistic mood sent Sao Paulo's Bovespa stock exchange up
5.7 percent Friday and the smaller Rio de Janeiro stock exchange
closed 4.9 percent higher.
	   In the past few months, investors watched the economic crises in
Asia and Russia, and feared that Brazil might be the next to fall.
	   The size of Brazil's budget deficit _ more than dlrs 60 billion
and a staggering 7.3 percent of gross domestic product _ raised
doubts that it could get financing. Because of the global economic
turmoil, money dried up, and uncertainty turned to panic.
	   In August and September, investors withdrew about dlrs 30
billion from the country. Brazil's once-comfortable cash reserves
plunged to about dlrs 47 billion, and the outflow continues at the
pace of about dlrs 400 million a day.
	   While President Fernando Henrique Cardoso warned that tough
austerity measures were needed, he was reluctant to take them
before national elections on Oct. 4. Voters overwhelmingly
re-elected him on the first ballot, and the 67-year-old sociologist
promised to have a remedy ready by Oct. 20.
	   It surely will be bitter. Brazil promised the IMF it will come
up with a combination of more taxes and reduced spending that adds
up to about dlrs 21 billion a year.
	   Cardoso says he doesn't want to tax salaried workers or the
manufacturing sector. He has suggested raising a tax on financial
operations and levying one on large fortunes, but it's not clear if
that will be enough.
	   Meanwhile, spending cuts could mean less money for already
dilapidated public schools and hospitals, as well as higher
unemployment. Most private economists see a recession coming.
	   ``1999 will be a difficult year,'' Finance Minister Pedro Malan
told Brazilian reporters in Washington.
	   But it could have been worse. The IMF agreed with Brazil that
there need not be a currency devaluation, which proved so
disastrous in Russia and Asia.

Sudanese army says it's in control of key town, road in south
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Sudanese army spokesman reporting
recapture of garrison town &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudanese forces have recaptured a
strategic garrison town that was in rebel hands since last month,
the army spokesman said Friday.
	   The army has ``destroyed these (rebel) forces'' in the town of
Liria, the spokesman, Lt. Gen. Abdul-Rahman Sirul-Khatim, told
reporters.
	   Liria is a major garrison 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of
Juba, the capital of East Equatoria province and the biggest city
in southern Sudan.
	   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army has been engaged in a
new offensive with government forces in East Equatoria since Sept.
14 and has made repeated advances around Juba in recent weeks. The
town is 1,200 kilometers (740 miles) south of Khartoum.
	   The government had issued strong denials when the rebel
announced last month that they had captured Liria and two smaller
army outposts. Claims and counter-claims by the army and rebels are
impossible to confirm independently given the remote location of
the battle areas.
	   Earlier Friday, an army statement broadcast by state-run
Omdurman radio said that Sudanese forces fended off rebel attacks
on Juba and took control of the road leading to an army camp at
Torit.
	   The SPLA sustained heavy losses in the clashes Thursday, said
the statement. It did not provide casualty figures for either side.
	   ``Our forces were able ... to complete the cleansing and purging
of this sector _ all of it _ by force and strong will,'' it said.
	   The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 to win autonomy for the
south's Christians and adherents of tribal faiths from the Muslim,
Arabized north. More than 1.5 million people have died in the
fighting and in famines caused by it.
	   The army statement repeated government charges that the rebels
were being aided by Ugandan and Eritrean forces.
	   Sirul-Khatim, the army spokesman, said Sudanese forces have not
taken any Ugandan prisoners but they have ``Ugandan tanks and
armored vehicles that are a proof of the Ugandan intervention.''
	   His comments, reported by the Middle East News Agency, were
monitored in Cairo, Egypt.
	   Uganda severed relations with Khartoum in 1995 after accusing
Sudan of harboring Ugandan rebels seeking to overthrow the
government. In turn, Sudan has accused Uganda _ along with Eritrea
and Ethiopia _ of aiding the Sudanese rebels.

Arafat says success of peace summit depends on Israelis

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat warned
Friday that the Middle East will be thrown into confusion if the
peace process fails, and said the success of next week's talks in
Washington depends on Israel.
	   ``The most important thing is that if we do not do our best, all
of us, to protect ... the peace process, then confusion will happen
in the whole area of the Middle East,'' Arafat told reporters on a
short visit to Helsinki.
	   ``We have to wait and see how the Israelis will react to the
American initiatives which have been declared and which we have
accepted,'' he said.
	   Arafat said he had the right to declare an independent state for
the Palestinians next year but stopped short of saying he would do
so.
	   ``According to the (Mideast peace) agreement I have the right to
declare the independence of a Palestinian state at the end of the
five years of the interim agreement,'' Arafat said.
	   ``And, no doubt, on the fourth of next May '99, we have the
right to declare our independent state,'' he added, but declined to
comment further.
	   Arafat arrived in Finland after talks with President Boris
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow, where he
invited Russia to the U.S.-sponsored meeting next week as a
co-sponsor of the Mideast peace process.
	   Yeltsin said his government might be interested in participating
in the talks, scheduled to open outside Washington on Oct. 15. But
he said Russia first wants to know the views of Israel and the
United States on the plan.
	   Russia is officially a co-sponsor of the peace process launched
by a conference in Madrid, Spain, in 1991. But the United States
has played a far greater role.
	   Arafat declined to say whether Israel and the United States
would welcome a more active Russian role, but he said he had also
invited the European Union and ``Arab countries, including Egypt,''
to the talks.
	   Reacting to the appointment of Ariel Sharon as the new Israeli
foreign minister, who has been placed in charge of negotiations
with the Palestinians, he said, ``It's up to them (the Israelis).''
	   ``This is a pure interior Israeli affair. We don't interfere,''
Arafat said, adding that he would be prepared to shake hands with
Sharon in Washington.
	   Arafat met with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari before he
left for Oslo, Norway.

Jospin says Clinton-Lewinsky saga could harm U.S. image
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Friday the Monica
Lewinsky scandal and an impeachment inquiry against President Bill
Clinton could harm the image of the United States.
	   ``It's rather difficult to understand what happened, why the
leader of the main power in the world who has the leading
responsibility is exposed as he is,'' Jospin said in response to a
question during an interview in Paris with CNN International.
	   ``We are not sure it's good for the image of the United
States,'' Jospin added. ``I must say so frankly, without
interfering in the affair.''
	   Jospin, who spoke in English during the 30-minute interview,
said discussion of Clinton's troubles frequently cropped up in the
French leader's talks with other European leaders.
	   The Socialist leader also fielded questions from international
callers on topics ranging from the French economy to France's role
in international affairs.
	   Asked his views on the unrest in Kosovo, Jospin said France was
concerned about the suffering of refugees with winter approaching.
	   ``I have to say to (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic that
the situation in Kosovo is unacceptable and will not be accepted,''
he said.
	   Jospin also referred to France's anti-immigrant National Front
party, saying it was ``a pity'' such a party existed in the
country.
	   The National Front, led by Jean-Marie Le Pen and which has also
been accused of anti-Semitism, has won around 15 percent in recent
elections. It blames immigrants, especially ones from Africa, for
current high unemployment.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Henman, Rosset victories; Agassi quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ A confident Andre Agassi continued his
dominant play Friday, advancing to the semifinals of the Swiss
Indoors by trampling Sweden's Magnus Gustafsson in straight sets.
	   Agassi, the only seeded player aside from Britain's Tim Henman
to avoid early-round upsets, needed only 77 minutes to crush
Gustafsson 6-3, 6-3.
	   Gustafsson's compatriot Thomas Johansson was more successful,
the Swede defeating Frenchman Fabrice Santoro 6-3, 6-3 in another
quarterfinal.
	   After a nine-minute first game, Agassi took control of the
match, breaking Gustafsson's second serve in the opening set with a
love game to go up 2-1. Then, leading 5-3 with Gustafsson serving,
the American broke again to close out the set.
	   Agassi continued his dominance in the second set, breaking the
Swede's opening serve. However, leading 15-40 at 5-2 on
Gustafsson's serve, the American squandered three match points,
giving the Swede the game.
	   But Agassi, who has yet to drop a set in the tournament, closed
out the match on his next service game.
	   ``Magnus is a really tough opponent,'' said Agassi, the winner
of four tournaments this season. ``He's a veteran who knows how to
play the big points.
	   ``But my game has seen a lot of improvement and I'm feeling more
and more confident. I'm more ready to step up and take control of
the match.''
	   Henman defeated Germany's Nicolas Kiefer 6-3, 6-4 and
Switzerland's Marc Rosset downed German qualifier David Prinosil
6-3, 7-6 (7-2).
	   In the semifinals, Agassi will face Rosset and Henman will play
Johansson.
	   ``The people in Switzerland are going to hate me if I beat three
Swiss,'' joked Agassi, who defeated Swiss players Roger Federer and
Ivo Heuberger in the first two rounds. ``But when Rosset is on,
he's hard to beat.
	   ``He's is a big guy with big serves, and he's not scared to take
risks.''

Young man and woman jailed for up to 15 years for sex murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOBIGNY, France (AP) _ A court on Friday sentenced a young man
and woman to 12 and 15 years in jail respectively for stabbing a
teenage boy to death during a sexual encounter.
	   The killers, identified as Veronique Herbert, 20, and
19-year-old Sebastien, lured the victim, 16-year-old Abdeladim, to
a house before killing him. He suffered 39 stab wounds.
	   The prosecution said the murder was fueled by the pair's
obsession with violence after watching Oliver Stone's 1994 movie
``Natural Born Killers.''
	   On the night of March 2, 1996, while Herbert and Abdeladim
became intimate, Sebastien took two knives from a drawer and
stabbed him in the neck, after asking the woman's permission, the
prosecution said.
	   Then, in what the prosecution's dossier likened to a ``horror
film,'' the young woman ordered Sebastien to ``finish him off,''
while she plunged the second knife into the victim's stomach.
	   The pair, in panic, then buried the victim outside the house.
	   Herbert and Sebastien confessed to the crime. The prosecution
had asked for 18 years for Herbert and 15 years for Sebastien.
	   Before the end of the week-long trial, which was held behind
closed doors, both suspects apologized to the families of the
victims.
	   The murder sparked a heated debate on the effects on viewers,
and particularly minors, of televised violence. The Oliver Stone
film follows a young couple on a killing spree, and the ensuing
media attention.
	   According to the prosecution, Herbert, described by
psychiatrists as a ``calm, serious, good student'' had told friends
she and Sebastian planned to commit a murder. Plastic sacks and a
metal saw were bought in advance.
	   Police found the couple in the Cantal region of central France
three days later.
	   The court did not release the surnames of Sebastien and
Abdeladim since they were minors at the time of the murder.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Apartheid-era laws banning
homosexual relations were struck down on Friday by South Africa's
highest court, which ruled men convicted of sodomy since 1994 could
demand monetary damages and have their criminal records cleared.
	   The constitutional court's decision formalized guarantees
granted in 1994, when white minority rule ended and a provisional
constitution banned discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation, race or gender.
	   The National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality said
Friday's ruling could open up adoption, marriage and other rights
for homosexuals.
	   ``The court has said that lesbians and gay men ... have a right
to equality and dignity and privacy,'' said Zackie Achmat, the
group's director.
	   South Africa was the first country to ban discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation in its constitution. But the laws that
criminalized sex between men remained on the books.
	   Sex between women was never officially banned, but was
symbolically stigmatized by the old laws, the court said.
	   Under apartheid, sodomy could be punished with up to seven years
in prison. Men were not even allowed to have casual contact at
social gatherings that could be construed as homosexual behavior.
	   The former South African military practiced so-called ``aversion
therapy'' on gay men, applying electric shocks to victims while
they viewed images of naked men, a report on human rights abuses
said last year.
	   ``Just as apartheid legislation rendered the lives of couples of
different racial groups perpetually at risk, the sodomy offense
(built) insecurity and vulnerability into the daily lives of gay
men,'' the 11-judge panel said in its ruling.
	   Panel-member Judge Albie Sachs wrote in the opinion that the
ruling should be seen ``as part of a growing acceptance of
difference in an increasingly open and pluralistic South Africa.''
	   Since apartheid ended, President Nelson Mandela's government has
pushed to end all forms of discrimination.
	   The country's military protects the rights of gay and lesbian
soldiers. Earlier this year, the police were ordered to include a
lesbian partner under a female officer's medical insurance.

Human rights group urges removal of Chilean from U.N. job
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A human rights group has called on the
United Nations to remove a Chilean military officer from his job as
chief of a U.N. mission, alleging he committed human rights abuses
during the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship.
	   The United Nations is awaiting Chile's response to the
accusations against Brig. Gen. Sergio Espinoza Davies before
deciding what, if any, action to take, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard
said Friday.
	   In a letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, New York-based
Human Rights Watch said Espinoza's documented participation ``in
the worst human rights abuses in his home country'' makes him unfit
to remain in charge of the U.N. military observer mission in India
and Pakistan.
	   The United Nations has known about the allegations for more than
a month and has repeatedly sought clarifications from both Espinoza
and Chile, U.N. officials said Friday.
	   Espinoza has denied the accusations and Chile hasn't provided
the United Nations with a satisfactory response, Eckhard said.
	   Espinoza refused Friday to answer reporters' questions. ``I
don't talk to the press,'' his secretary in Lahore, Pakistan,
quoted Espinoza as saying.
	   While stressing that he has no proof of the allegations, Eckhard
noted that the United Nations doesn't conduct background checks on
people volunteered by member-states to participate in missions.
	   The United Nations expects ``that the people they give us will
be responsible people, with clean records,'' he said. ``The
governments are supposed to know. We don't second-guess
governments.''
	   Human Rights Watch said in its letter that after Pinochet's 1973
coup, Espinoza served on at least one war tribunal that sentenced
people to prison or death after proceedings that ``violated the
most fundamental judicial guarantees of due process.''
	   The Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation
found that judges on the tribunals had an unsatisfactory level of
basic legal knowledge and concluded that many proceedings were
simply used to justify illegal executions.
	   According to a report by the civilian government that succeeded
Pinochet, 3,197 people were killed for political reasons during his
dictatorship, including 1,102 who disappeared after Pinochet's
security agents detained them. Thousands more were tortured, forced
into exile, or both.
	   Pinochet relinquished most of his powers to a civilian
government in 1990. He is still a senator.
	   The United Nations has known about the Espinoza allegations
since the widow of Chilean socialist leader Freddy Taverna,
executed on Oct. 30, 1973, sent Annan a copy of his death sentence
more than a month ago. Jenny Arancibia said Espinoza was a member
of the tribunal that handed down the death sentence.
	   While not defending Espinoza by name, the Chilean army released
a statement defending the war councils on which he served.
	   It said the councils worked in accordance with Chile's military
justice code, and that officers named to the councils were under
``military obligation'' to adhere to the code's directives.
	   Criticism of Espinoza was aimed at ``damaging the image of the
(military) institution and of its officers in an unfair manner,
since all they did was to carry on their duties,'' the statement
said.

Italian premier loses confidence vote, forced to resign

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's second-longest lasting government since
World War II collapsed Friday, throwing into question a new phase
of financial reforms and participation in any NATO attack on
Yugoslavia.
	   Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition had held together
during its drive to cut costs and qualify for Europe's common
currency. But it lost momentum and fell apart after it reached its
goal.
	   Communists caused its end after 2{ years in power by withdrawing
support over Prodi's 1999 budget, saying they wanted more spending
for jobs.
	   Their rebellion forced Friday's vote of confidence in the
Chamber of Deputies. Prodi lost it by a single vote, 313-312, when
a lawmaker in his coalition defected.
	   Opposition lawmakers burst into applause after the vote. Prodi
slipped away from the presidential palace so quickly that he
outpaced his security agents and briefly found himself facing
reporters alone. ``I'm not bitter,'' he said.
	   He submitted his resignation to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro,
who asked him to lead the governmentfor the time being.
	   Scalfaro must decide whether to call early elections, a step few
want and few expect, or ask Prodi or someone else to try to form a
new government.
	   Centrist leader Francesco Cossiga appealed to leading parties of
the left and right to form a caretaker government that would see
Italy through tough spots ahead, including passage of the budget.
	   ``I ask them because as the major political forces, only they
can form a government with the authority needed to face the
delicate international financial situation and the crisis in
Kosovo,'' Cossiga said.
	   A no-frills, no-thrills leader, Prodi came to power after Italy
briefly was led by a center-right coalition headed by media magnate
Silvio Berlusconi, now the opposition leader.
	   Prodi presided over budget cuts and a temporary tax increase
needed to get Italy's economy in shape for the 1999 debut of
Europe's common currency. It qualified for the euro debut earlier
this year, impressing and surprising many fellow European Union
nations with less volatile politics.
	   Prodi would have had to keep cutting costs to stay in line with
requirements for the European Monetary Union. Communists wanted
more spending, not less.
	   In an attempt to woo them before Friday's vote, Prodi pledged
that his government would work to make law a 35-hour work week,
their pet project.
	   He also held back from endorsing NATO airstrikes on Serbia
without specific backing from the U.N. Security Council, another
Communist demand.
	   Italy is across the Adriatic from Yugoslavia, and its bases and
ports could be important to any NATO attack over Yugoslavia's
treatment of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Parliament would have to
approve Italy's participation.
	   The opposition said even a win wouldn't have avoided more crises
for Prodi.
	   Winning the confidence vote would ``only put off the dramatic
question of Kosovo,'' said Rocco Buttiglione of Berlusconi's
Freedom Alliance.
	   ``Now we should go to the polls,'' Berlusconi said.
	   However, analysts predicted a new majority will be found to pass
the budget without new elections.
	   ``Political instability will be limited in the next few days,''
said Bruno Rovelli, an economist with Citibank in Milan.
	   Prodi led Italy's 55th government since World War II. He
outlasted all but Bettino Craxi, a Socialist who served 3{ years in
two, back-to-back stints from 1983 to 1987.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ An international arbitration panel
ruled Friday in favor of Yemen in its dispute with Eritrea over
three Red Sea islands, a quarrel that had threatened a major
shipping route.
	   Eritrea said it will abide by the decision.
	   In the Eritrean capital of Asmara, Yemen's acting ambassador,
Ahmed Hassan, called the decision by the International Court of
Arbitration a ``victory for Eritrea and Yemen.''
	   ``You may lose something but you win something more important:
living together in peace as good neighbors and setting an example
for others in the region,'' he said.
	   Yemen and Eritrea both claimed the three islands, one of which,
the Greater Hanish, was captured by Eritrea in a brief battle in
December 1995. Yemen retained control of the other two, Lesser
Hanish and Zuqar.
	   The tribunal awarded all three major islands to Yemen and
stipulated that the decision should be complied with within 90
days.
	   An Eritrean government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Eritrea will withdraw its troops from Greater
Hanish.
	   An Eritrean Foreign Ministry statement said the tribunal gave
Eritrea control of three minor islands and four islets. ``This is
the only civilized way of settling disputes,'' New Eritrea, a
government newspaper, said after the ruling.
	   Hassan said the decision leaves Yemen free to develop the
islands for tourism, scuba diving, oil and other enterprises.
	   The islands, where Yemen has granted oil concessions, sit across
one of the world's major shipping lanes, 100 miles north of the Bab
el-Mandeb strait at the southern entrance to the Red Sea.
	   Shipping security in the area is of vital importance to Saudi
Arabia, which has an oil export terminal in Yanbu further north,
and to Egypt, whose revenues from the Suez Canal linking the Red
Sea to the Mediterranean are crucial to its economy.
	   Eritrea and Yemen decided in 1996 to have the dispute settled by
the International Court of Arbitration, a low-profile panel of
international experts that is based in The Hague. The court's
decisions are legally binding.
	   The ICA, which arbitrates behind closed doors, is considered a
more discreet way to settle disputes than the better-known
International Court of Justice, which is housed in the same
building.

Pensioner takes case of government sex discrimination to European
</HEADLINE>
Court of Justice

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A retired pensioner was Friday given permission to
take his legal claim that the government is discriminating against
men to the European Court of Justice.
	   John Taylor, 63, says that the government is breaking a European
Union directive on social security equality because women in
Britain between the ages of 60 and 65 are able to claim state help
to pay for winter fuel costs, while men can't claim the allowance
until they are 65. That's because the allowance can only be claimed
after the age at which Britons can claim the state pension: 60 for
women, 65 for men.
	   ``I am one of 1.2 million men aged 60 to 65 in the UK, the
majority of whom are unemployed and but for their age would receive
state pensions, winter fuel payments and travel concessions,'' said
Taylor. ``I am challenging the government here and now to end a
clear injustice and make winter fuel payments to all over 60s,''
Taylor said.
	   In the High Court on Friday, judge Scott Baker referred the case
to the European Court of Justice, saying that it raised issues of
EU law. A government attorney told the court that it was
appropriate for the case to be sent to the European Court of
Justice.
	   Last winter the government paid out about 200 million pounds
(dlrs 320 million) to poorer pensioners on winter fuel payments. If
the European Court finds in Taylor's favor, the government has
estimated it will cost about 20 million pounds (dlrs 32 million). A
judgement is expected within two years.

Former coup leader heading presidential polls tries to reassure
</HEADLINE>
investors

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela's leading presidential
candidate, a former coup leader who for months has scared investors
with perceived anti-business rhetoric, on Friday called for fiscal
discipline and a vibrant private sector to help reduce the
country's dependence on oil.
	   In an apparent attempt to calm investor fears, former Lt. Col.
Hugo Chavez quoted extensively from a speech by British Prime
Minister Tony Blair urging a ``third way'' between communism and
capitalism.
	   The candidate, who is barred from entering the United States
because of his failed 1992 attempt to overthrow Venezuela's
government, said in an address to diplomats and business executives
that he will welcome foreign investors in a revamped economy that
``puts people first.''
	   ``There will be respect for private property,'' he vowed.
``Nobody is going to expropriate anything from anyone.''
	   A survey late last month by the firm Datanalysis said 41.6
percent of Venezuelan voters support Chavez in the Dec. 6
presidential election, compared to 31.3 percent for his nearest
rival, Yale-trained economist Henrique Salas Romer. The poll had a
margin of error of 2.83 percent.
	   Chavez's 2 1/2 hour speech, peppered with references to Abraham
Lincoln, Aristotle, Simon Bolivar, John Kenneth Galbraith, Rene
Descartes and Jesus, was a far cry from previous appearances in
which he condemned the free market and promised to ``fry'' the
heads of opponents.
	   Still, Chavez criticized what he called ``savage neoliberalism''
that ``does not address the necessities of the human being.''
	   He said he planned to ``humanize'' Venezuela's economy by
investing heavily in housing, education and health care, as well as
promoting huge private investments in railroads, ports and tourist
facilities. He said he would improve tax collection, maintain a
tight monetary policy and respect contracts signed with foreign oil
companies.
	   The candidate, who just months ago called for a partial
moratorium on payments of Venezuela's dlrs 22 billion public
foreign debt, declared: ``We will honor the debt.''
	   In recent months, Venezuela's oil-based economy has fallen into
recession because of low international petroleum prices and what
some analysts call the ``Chavez effect:'' investors fleeing for
fear that Chavez will turn back the clock on free-market reforms.
	   Referring to the Chavez effect, the candidate said: ``They have
tried to sell this idea and some people have bought it because they
are incapable of seeing the depth of our economic troubles.''
	   Despite his conciliatory remarks, Chavez defended the 1992 coup
attempt and insisted he is a democrat.
	   ``What we have in Venezuela is not a democracy,'' he said. ``How
can it be a democracy when 80 percent of the people live in poverty
on a land with so much wealth?''

French survivors tell tale of boat tragedy

<TEXT>
	   LLORET DE MAR, Spain (AP) _ Survivors of a pleasure boat that
sank in a lake in northeastern Spain killing 20 French retirees
were sad and angry Friday as they recalled the tragedy.
	   ``I don't really know what is going to happen now and I don't
really care,'' said Jean Loulier staring at his breakfast at the
tour group's hotel in this seaside resort.
	   Loulier, 70, like many of the 141 vacationing retirees who opted
for a boat trip around the nearby tranquil Lake Banyoles on
Thursday, had felt lucky when he won a nearly free vacation
package.
	   ``Most was free, but the excursions we paid, like the one
yesterday,'' said the widowed former schoolteacher whose female
traveling companion, who he did not identify, was a non-swimmer and
drowned.
	   The electric-powered catamaran was pulling away from its mooring
for a half hour trip over the mountain-surrounded lake, 565
kilometers (350 miles) northeast of Madrid, when its stern began to
sink. It went down fast.
	   Officials said overloading appeared the most likely cause, as
141 tickets were sold for a boat only authorized to carry 80
passengers.
	   Authorities, meanwhile, were still unable to account for two
people they believe may have gone on the doomed excursion.
	   Two owners of the boat, including the pilot, gave secret
testimony Friday before an investigative judge, who released them
without filing charges. The court said the investigation would
continue.
	   Police divers refloated the craft and initial investigations
showed the boat was in tact and had suffered no leaks that might
explain the sinking.
	   ``It looks like water may have got through air ventilation tubes
which may have become immersed due to overloading,'' provincial
fire chief Antoni Guell told reporters.
	   ``Just greed, greed'' said another survivor who also raged about
the lack of consideration for the tourists in the wake of the
tragedy.
	   ``I had to go to a public phone box to call my daughter,'' he
said before realizing he was talking to a reporter.
	   ``Journalist!'' he shouted, and began pushing this reporter out
of the hotel and ripping her notepad into shreds.
	   But some wanted to tell the story.
	   ``It was like the Titantic, the way it went down'' said Evelyn
Bengoechea, 52. She survived by grabbing a life preserver shaped
like a ring after her husband, who could swim, pushed her out of
the boat.
	   ``I want to thank the people who helped pull us out,'' she said.
	   Michel Evielle, 50, has been driving tourist buses for 17 years.
He was drinking coffee by the lakeside when the boat began to sink.
	   ``It went down in 30 seconds,'' he said, recalling how he helped
pull out the floundering passengers.
	   ``Some of those who could swim were carrying others who
couldn't, and then others would grab onto their backs.''
	   Meanwhile, French Tourism Minister Michelle Demessine visited
the 21 people remaining in hospital. Some 50 of the tourists flew
back to France later Friday.
	   Repatriation of the corpses was also set to begin later in the
day.

Pressure is on Khannouchi in Chicago Marathon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Khalid Khannouchi was just another elite runner
when he lined up for the Chicago Marathon last year. Sure, he had
won races with some pretty flashy times, but this was his first
marathon and he could hardly be considered a favorite.
	   Then Khannouchi went out and stunned the running world, winning
the Chicago Marathon in 2 hours, 7 minutes, 10 seconds. At the
time, it was the fourth-fastest time in the marathon, and it's
still the fastest time for a North American marathon.
	   ``It's a lot of pressure,'' Khannouchi said of defending his
title Sunday. ``Everybody is watching you run. The whole country is
going to be watching Chicago this year because of what I did last
year.''
	   The Chicago Marathon has always had a reputation for being a
fast course _ Joan Benoit Samuelson set the American women's record
here in 1985 _ but Khannouchi's record-setting victory brought new
interest to the race.
	   Many of the world's top marathoners are competing Sunday,
including two-time Boston Marathon champion Moses Tanui of Kenya
and Elijah Lagat of Kenya, the 1997 Berlin Marathon winner. For
just the fourth time in history, four sub-2:08 runners _
Khannouchi, Tanui, Lagat and Gert Thys of South Africa, who
finished third in this year's Boston Marathon _ will race
head-to-head.
	   The top American is Jerry Lawson, whose 2:09:35 last year was
only 48 seconds off the American record.
	   The women's field includes two-time Chicago winner Marian
Sutton, 1996 Olympian Irina Bogacheva, Elana Meyer, who set a world
record at the Kyoto Half-Marathon, and Colleen De Reuck, who set
two world records in shorter distances earlier this year,
	   ``It's going to make it good because you're going to have good
competition, but it's going to be tough,'' said Khannouchi, a
Moroccan who now lives in Ossining New York. ``If you want to win,
you really have to press hard.''
	   For Thys, the Chicago Marathon is a chance to improve on his
surprising third-place finish in Boston. After several poor
finishes at the end of 1997, he rebounded with a 2:07:52 at Boston,
the fastest third-place finish ever in a marathon.
	   And Thys thinks he can better that. He went to Boston with only
three weeks of training after a knee injury forced him to sit out
two weeks.
	   ``I'm well prepared for this,'' he said. ``I need a fast time. I
ran fast in Boston, and I want to improve my time.''
	   With so much speed, the top group is likely to go out fast. Last
year, Khannouchi took the lead for good last year at the 23rd mile
and finished more than a minute ahead of runner-up Fred Kiprop of
Kenya.
	   Most runners are expecting a similar pace this year, especially
if the weather cooperates.
	   ``It's going to be a small group in front,'' Thys predicted.
``When you go to a race, you have to expect anything. If there is a
fast pace, you have to be ready for it.''
	   Khannouchi thinks he is. Though he's run fewer races this year,
he's posting better times than in 1997. Of his 13 races, he's won
10, finished second once and third in the other two.
	   Besides, this is his lucky city.
	   ``It's where my career took off. I love this place,'' he said.
``I cried after I crossed the finish line last year. It was a
dream. I'd been working hard to run, and when I won, my dream came
true. I was so, so happy.''

<TEXT>
	   DAYTONA BEACH, Florida (AP) _ The list of qualifiers for next
year's LPGA Tour looks a lot like this year's money list _ a lot of
international players at the top.
	   Shani Waugh of Australia made three straight birdies on Friday
and closed with a 4-under-par 68 to share medalist honors with
Canadian A.J. Eathorne in the final round of qualifying school on
the LPGA International Course.
	   Eathorne, who graduated from New Mexico State and won twice on
the Futures Tour this summer, had a 71 to join Waugh at 11-under
277. Each earned dlrs 2,750.
	   With 24 full-exempt cards at stake, five international players
finished in the top seven spots. Karen Lunn of Australia had a 69
to finish in fourth at 280. Another stroke back was Akiko
Fukushima, the leading money winner in Japan the past two seasons
and its most popular female player. Marnie McGuire of New Zealand
was seventh at 6-under 282.
	   Asa Gottmo of Sweden won the last card with a birdie on the
second sudden-death playoff hole. In all, nine international
players earned full exemptions for next year.
	   The top American qualifier was Marianne Morris of Middletown,
Ohio. She started the final round in the lead at 12-under 204, but
struggled to a 74 and finished third.
	   Foreign players have dominated the LPGA Tour in recent years,
and four of the top five players leading the money list are from
outside the United States, led by Annika Sorenstam and South Korean
rookie Se Ri Pak. Pak was the co-medalist at Q-school last year.
	   Of the top 10 qualifiers Friday, only Eathorne and Fukushima
will be rookies next year; the others failed to finish in the top
90 on the money list.
	   Waugh didn't have a top 20 in any tournament this year until she
tied for ninth at the Betsy King Classic two weeks ago. She started
the final round of Q-school in good shape, but a bogey on the
second hole made her wonder if her nerves would hold.
	   ``Then I birdied three in a row'' starting on No. 5, she said.
``Once I did that, it was a walk in the park.''
	   It wasn't like that for everybody. Marisa Baena of Colombia, who
won the 1997 NCAA title at Arizona, got rattled after pulling her
tee shot into the hazard at No. 8 for a double bogey. She finished
with a 78 and tied for 58th.
	   ``It was tough out there, a different kind of pressure than I'm
used to,'' Baena said.
	   Baena and 42 others earned conditional cards, meaning they can
play only tournaments that have spots available.
	   Kelli Kuehne will be in that group, but only because she
finished 124th on the money list this year. The two-time U.S.
Amateur champion, who signed a contract with Nike even before she
tied for fifth at Q-school last year, didn't even make the cut this
time after rounds of 74-78-76.
	   ``I just had a rough couple of days,'' Kuehne said Thursday as
tears welled in her eyes. ``I came here expecting to play well. I
don't have any excuses.''

Global conference says privacy crucial for growth of on-line
</HEADLINE>
commerce &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Senior officials from 29 industrialized nations
ended a conference on electronic commerce Friday agreeing that
privacy is crucial for on-line transactions, but lacking a
consensus on how to achieve it.
	   The three-day conference of ministers from member nations of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development was aimed at
finding ways to promote electronic commerce on a global basis.
	   One of the biggest obstacles to faster growth of the activity is
consumer doubt about the security of financial transactions on the
Internet.
	   While many consumer groups favor government-imposed privacy
regulations, some countries, most notably the United States,
believe the industry should regulate itself.
	   The European Union is enacting privacy legislation that would
prevent transfer of personal information to countries that don't
have similar legislation.
	   A broad declaration adopted at the conference that affirmed
their commitment to protecting on-line privacy, but with detailed
proposals, leaves the door open for countries to choose the way
they want to go.
	   Canadian Industry Minister John Manley said the declaration will
be helpful, even if it doesn't provide specific guidelines.
	   ``We've encouraged the adoption of privacy policies, whether
implemented by legal, self-regulatory, administrative or
technological means,'' he said at a news conference.

Anti-censorship group urges support for independent media in
</HEADLINE>
Yugoslavia

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Governments should support independent media
outlets in Yugoslavia in the face of increasingly harsh censorship
by authorities there, an international organization against
censorship said Friday.
	   The London-based group, Article 19, listed actions by the
Yugoslav government which it said were pressurizing journalists in
the country, and said that actions by the government contravened
its obligation to uphold human rights agreed under the Geneva
Convention.
	   ``It is vital that all possible steps are taken to safeguard
those sectors of civil society, including the independent media and
human rights defenders, who may become targets for reprisal should
the international powers decide to take military action,'' the
group wrote in an open letter to European Union foreign ministers,
the United Nations Security Council, member of the six-nation
Contact group and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe,
	   Control over the media has been one of the key elements of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's decade-long rule. However,
Milosevic so far has failed to fully silence the independent media.
	   On Wednesday Serbian government officials ordered independent
media to stop broadcasting foreign media programs, a move described
by the Association of Independent Electronic Media, an umbrella
organization for most local radio and television stations in
Serbia, as ``the gravest form of state censorship and direct
meddling in editorial policies.''
	   Article 19 said in the letter that journalists and media outlets
were being verbally attacked which increased the likelihood that
some could become the targets of physical attack.

Ugandans train to protect their villages from rebel raids
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUNDIBUGYO, Uganda (AP) _ Ten new civil guards, lips pursed in
determination, fingers flying, dismantled and reassembled their
assault weapons Friday in less than 30 seconds.
	   Thousands cheered, knowing their neighbors' newly gained weapons
expertise one day may save their lives from rebels who stream down
from the dark green peaks of the Rwenzori Mountains to raid their
villages.
	   On Friday, the mountains provided a serene backdrop to the
ceremony for 300 graduates of a training course to protect area
villages. The ceremony was held on Uganda's independence day,
celebrated for the first time after three years when gathering in
public was too dangerous.
	   The civil guards protect towns and villages in western Uganda
from rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces, a mixture of
disgruntled soldiers of former Ugandan regimes and Islamic
militants called Tabliqs. The ADF has no coherent program, but
holds progress hostage in western Uganda.
	   The Ugandan army has deployed two batallions across the border
in eastern Congo in an attempt to destroy the rebel bases.
	   ``The government is committed to solving this problem,''
Bilimumasa Mulindwa, a representative of President Yoweri Museveni,
told the crowd. ``That's why we are in the Congo. ... There's no
shortcut to peace, and that is the way forward for Uganda.''
	   Officials say security has improved, but anxious residents
disagree.
	   More than 8,000 formerly self-sufficient farmers now live with
their families in poverty in camps around Bundibugyo after fear of
rebel attacks forced them from their homes.
	   Progress and development in this fertile region have ground to a
halt. Only those who can afford generators have electricity. The
only road into and out of Bundibugyo is rocky when dry and
impassable when it rains.
	   ``People are nervous,'' said Regional District Commissioner
Edward Masika. ``They are always alert, on the lookout for
rebels.''
	   On Wednesday, soldiers coming down the mountainside on a patrol
caused panic in one village. ``People went around to warn their
friends. Some had started packing,'' he said.
	   When rebels first moved into the area in 1996, they killed
civilians, stole their possessions and carried off children and
teen-agers, forcing many of them to become fighters.
	   After the army wiped out several ADF bases in Congo, putting the
rebels on the run and giving some villagers the confidence to
return home, rebel tactics changed.
	   They chopped off the ears of an entire family in Mirambi
village.
	   ``It was to teach the people not to go back to their villages,''
said Anthony Baguma, a teacher who left Mirambi two years ago.
Baguma said rebels sliced off another man's nose and ears.
	   Further raids have sent more people packing.
	   At Union Camp, an abandoned agricultural union headquarters,
2,850 people crowd inside makeshift huts. Plastic sheeting to cover
the thatch roofs is in short supply, and relief food is almost
gone, said camp chairman Azerubabere Busimba.
	   Few villages along the Rwenzori chain on the western edge of
Africa's Great Rift Valley remain untouched by rebel atrocities.
	   On June 8, the ADF attacked the Katchwamba Technical School
outside Fort Portal, 30 miles east of Bundibugyo, abducting 74
students and burning alive 80 more who had barricaded themselves in
their dormitories.
	   Milton Natukunda, 22, was one of those taken. He said he
survived on half a piece of cassava root a day, watched a friend
die of ulcers and others be slaughtered. Finally, on Sept. 25, he
escaped.
	   ``I witnessed everything,'' he said. ``I am a different person
now. My mind is not settled.''

Filmmaker finds remains of possible pre-Columbian city in
</HEADLINE>
Nicaragua &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ A Costa Rican filmmaker said Friday he
has found the remains of what could be a pre-Columbian city of the
Chibcha culture along the Nicaraguan coast.
	   Jose Cortez presented videos of his findings to Nicaraguan
President Arnoldo Aleman and the nation's media.
	   The remains consist of two igloo-shaped stone formations found
in an autonomous Caribbean zone in southern Nicaragua, near the
natural reserve of Seapaz-Indio Maiz.
	   ``The findings could constitute an important geological
formation, the outskirts of a lost city, or funeral mounds of great
importance and richness,'' Cortez said.
	   Clemente Guido, head of Nicaragua's cultural institute, said
only Nicaraguan archeologists authorized by the institute will have
access to the remains.
	   Defense Minister Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said the zone has been
cordoned off by the army to prevent plundering.
	   The Chibchas were a wandering tribe, but lived primarily in a
group of small, autocratically ruled states in the east Colombian
Andes at the time of the Spanish conquest.

Cuban health officials say AIDS on rise, encourage safer sex
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuban health officials say that the number of
people testing positive for the HIV virus that causes AIDS has
grown on the island over the past two years and are calling on
citizens to practice safer sex.
	   Manuel Santin, national director of epidemiology for the Public
Health Ministry, was quoted in Thursday's edition of the communist
daily Granma as saying that 547 people have died from AIDS in Cuba
since it was first detected on the island in 1986.
	   Since then, 2,040 people have tested HIV positive, said the
story, which appeared on Granma's web site. Of those infected, 768
have developed AIDS, it said.
	   Santin did not provide specific numbers on the growth of HIV
cases over the past two years.
	   Santin said that about two-thirds of those infected in Cuba are
male homosexuals, but emphasized that people of both sexes and of
all sexual orientations are equally susceptible to infection.
	   ``It is important that each citizen assume the responsibility
for their sexual behavior,'' he said.
	   The Cuban government has launched a campaign to encourage people
to use condoms. Santin said that condoms are more readily available
than during the economic crisis that began with the collapse of the
former Soviet Union at the beginning of the decade.
	   Although the number of cases is growing, Cuba still has among
the lowest AIDS rates in the world.
	   In the early years, the growth of the disease was kept in check
largely by a policy of keeping HIV-positive patients in perpetual
quarantine. The government ended that policy four years ago and
started allowing patients considered to be ``responsible'' to live
at home or continue to live at government sanitariums and go home
to visit relatives on weekends.
	   Though there has been no talk of reinstating the policy, Cuban
medical specialists offer no apologies for it.
	   Instead, they credit the policy for Cuba's low AIDS rate at a
time when many fear that a growing number of tourists could spread
the virus on the island.

Freeman says she was sexually abused as a child
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ World 400-meter sprint champion Cathy
Freeman revealed Saturday that she was sexually abused as a child,
saying she made the matter public to help others.
	   When Freeman was an 11-year-old, a man known to her family
entered her bedroom and sexually assaulted her, The Australian
newspaper reported.
	   The admission will appear in her biography, ``A Journey Just
Begun,'' to be released next week, the paper said.
	   ``I'm strong enough to deal with it now, but because I said
nothing then he could have gone on and done it to other girls,''
Freeman was quoted as saying in the book.
	   ``So speaking out isn't just for me, it's to help other girls
out there, and young boys too. The lesson is, if it happens to you,
don't be afraid, you're not to blame, tell your parents. And
parents should get help for their children so it minimizes the
mental damage.
	   ``Sadly we do have men like him out there, but staying silent
doesn't help.''
	   Freeman became Australia's first Aboriginal track and field
world champion when she won the 400m at the Athens world
championships last year. She said she suspected such abuses
happened as often in indigenous families as in non-indigenous, but
believed less attention was paid to indigenous cases.

Barbados beats United States in Red Stripe competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Barbados moved closer to the semifinals
of the Red Stripe Cricket Bowl one-day tournament with an emphatic
10-wicket win over the United States at Jamaica's Alpart Sports
Club.
	   The Bajans went to 159 without loss, overhauling the American
team's 158 for eight total in just 37.5 overs. Captain Philo
Wallace, as he did in Thursday's game against The Leewards, led
from the front with 104. Sherwin Campbell gave good support with a
patient 53.
	   The Bajans are well-placed to take one of the two semi-final
spots in Zone Two. With wins over the Leewards and the US, they
lead the zone with six points. The Americans, losing their third
straight match, have no chance of advancing.
	   Jamaica and the Leewards, both on three points, meet Saturday at
Sabina Park in a key match.
	   The American team put in an improved performance by batting
through their 50 overs for the first time in three matches. Rohan
Alexander also scored his team's first half-century of the
tournament, a solid 58.
	   But the American score proved inadequate as Wallace smashed his
way to three figures off 127 deliveries, striking one six and 10
deliveries.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke held
``serious discussions'' with Yugoslavia's president until past
midnight Saturday and said he would travel later in the day to
Kosovo's capital to consult ethnic Albanians in hopes of resolving
the crisis without NATO airstrikes.
	   Following more than six hours of talks with President Slobodan
Milosevic, Holbrooke told reporters he would go the Pristina for a
meeting with the chief ethnic Albanian political leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, before returning to Belgrade later in the day.
	   Holbrooke refused to characterize his talks with Milosevic,
except to say: ``There are serious discussions and the situation is
serious.'' Holbrooke is expected to remain in Yugoslavia as long as
there remains a possibility of convincing Milosevic to accept
international terms for ending the seven-month conflict in the
majority Albanian province.
	   In dispatching Holbrooke back to the Yugoslav capital on
Thursday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned Milosevic
that ``time is all but gone'' for a peaceful settlement.
	   Her words were echoed Friday by NATO's American supreme
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, who said his forces were moving ahead
with final preparations for airstrikes.
	   Speaking in Naples, Italy, Clark questioned why Milosevic would
want to ``risk the ravages of armed conflict and the destruction of
his own country.''
	   Despite the general's tough talk, NATO remained divided about
the legality and effectiveness of using force against the Serbs.
	   Italy and Greece, among others, are reluctant to proceed without
a mandate from the U.N. Security Council, where Russia and China
are opposed.
	   Meeting in Brussels, Belgium, NATO allies searched for broad
consensus for a strike that would allow them to proceed without the
direct blessings of the Security Council.
	   But the alliance failed in its effort to pressure Russia into
dropping its opposition to airstrikes.
	   ``We must not allow NATO strikes,'' Russian President Boris
Yeltsin was quoted as saying in Moscow Friday. ``We want to achieve
a political, peaceful solution without the use of military force
and, I think, we shall succeed.''
	   The chairman of the Russian parliamentary defense committee said
lawmakers may respond to any use of force by recommending Russia
abandon its treaty with NATO.
	   Russia signed an agreement with NATO in May 1997 that sets up a
new consultative mechanism and spelled out NATO's intentions as it
expands into central and eastern Europe.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have
been driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown
Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting to wrest Kosovo province from Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by Kosovo Liberation Army ``terrorists.''
	   After the first round of talks Friday, he called NATO threats of
airstrikes ``belligerent attempts'' to solve the Kosovo problem,
adding that he favors negotiations.
	   Holbrooke arrived from London, where he met with officials of
the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans. He said that movement
toward authorizing the use of force by NATO continues ``in a
sustained and intense manner.''
	   ``The situation remains just as serious at it has been before,''
he said shortly before the start of his fourth meeting with
Milosevic in five days.
	   In Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital, cafes were full, with
people appearing to make the most of what could be the last few
days of relative peace.
	   ``I am not afraid,'' said Jehona Xhaferi, 25, an ethnic
Albanian. ``Maybe that's crazy, but I see it as the finishing phase
of everything,'' she said, alluding to the months of Kosovo
turmoil.
	   The international demands Holbrooke was presenting to Milosevic
included an immediate end to hostilities and a withdrawal of forces
and heavy armaments to levels before March, before the government
crackdown on Kosovo started.
	   In addition, Holbrooke was expected to press for an
international monitoring force to be allowed to oversee compliance.
State Department spokesman James Foley said Holbrooke described
discussions so far as ``very intense and tough going.''
	   The KLA announced a unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo
starting Friday, a move that will add to the pressure on Milosevic
to reciprocate.
	   But Serbian media reported at least five KLA breaches of their
cease-fire Friday. They said Serbian police and ethnic Albanians
loyal to the Serbian government were attacked, but there were no
casualties.
	   The KLA said it was government troops who were on the offensive.
In a statement read on state television in neighboring Albania, the
rebels claimed villages were being attacked west of Pristina, but
added that their troops continued to respect the unilateral
cease-fire.
	   The claims of renewed skirmishes could not be independently
verified. Foley said Friday that there had been no new reports of
fighting in Kosovo. But he said the absence of fighting did not
mean peace.
	   ``While there has been no shooting in the past 24 hours, neither
has there been any measurable change in the Serbian deployment of
army troops in the field,'' he said. ``A large police presence also
remains on major roads and highways.
	   The Serbian and Yugoslav governments showed little sign that
they were prepared to bow to international pressure.
	   Citing the Kosovo crisis and NATO threats of intervention, the
Serbian government Friday put into effect a harsh decree tightening
state control over companies and independent media.
	   The decree broadens government authority and envisions
punishment for companies, institutions and individuals who act
contrary to the government's view of patriotic behavior.

Leader John Morgan seeking first North American title

<TEXT>
	   NAPA, California (AP) _ John Morgan, seeking his first North
American title in a three-decade career that has included victories
in Europe and Africa, shot a 5-under-par 67 Friday for the
first-round lead of the Transamerica seniors tournament.
	   Morgan used a run of three straight birdies starting at No. 11
at the Silverado Country Club to take a one-shot lead over eight
golfers.
	   Morgan, an Englishman who played for 25 years on the European
tour, has won tournaments in places such as Nigeria, Sierra Leone
and Cyprus. He said a win this weekend would be ``the highlight of
my career.''
	   ``Winning a tournament over here would be bigger than those
others because of the quality of players and quality of courses
here,'' he said.
	   Morgan, whose best finish on the Senior PGA Tour this season has
been two fourth-place ties, had a bogey on the first hole but then
made six birdies. He is playing full time on the senior tour this
year, which has made it tough to get home.
	   In fact, he bought a house in England last winter and hasn't
even had a chance to unpack.
	   ``The grass is probably about a foot high now,'' he said. ``I'm
missing out on tidying up at home. But I'm happier playing here.''
	   Among the seven golfers tied for second was Ray Carrasco, who
was the unlikely early leader of the 54-hole tournament. Carrasco,
a teaching pro from Irvine, said he was excited to be the center of
attention for the first time.
	   ``It's nice getting used to the ambiance of the cameras,'' said
Carrasco, who qualified for the PGA Tour in 1974 at Silverado.
``This is my first time in the press room in my career.''
	   The others at 68 were Leonard Thompson, John Bland, John
Schroeder, Jim Ferree, Gary McCord, Dick McClean and Steve Veriato.
	   Among those struggling in the opening round was Chi Chi
Rodriguez, who had an 11 after going into the water on the par-3
15th hole. Rodriguez, who went into the water, needed four shots to
get his ball back on dry land _ and incurred a two-stroke penalty
for hitting the water on his backswing on one of those shots.
	   ``I went into the water and thought I was Moses,'' he said. ``I
turned out to be Lloyd Bridges. I went on a sea hunt.''
	   Defending champion Dave Eichelberger shot a 72 in the first
round.

Duval takes lead by himself after second-round 67

<TEXT>
	   WILLIAMSBURG, Virginia (AP) _ David Duval, much more relaxed and
self-assured than the player who won here last year, shot a
4-under-par 67 Friday to take a one-shot lead after two rounds of
the Michelob Championship.
	   Once most notable as the player who didn't win with seven
runner-up finishes before his playoff triumph last year, Duval has
won a tour-high six times in the past year and become a constant
contender.
	   In 20 events this season, he's finished in the top 10 10 times.
	   ``When you've done well and won some golf tournaments, it's a
lot easier to go out and play like I have these two days,'' said
Duval, who was at 10-under 132. He won last year with a 13-under
total.
	   ``I think the main thing is I've gotten a little easier going
because I've proven that I could win. I don't have that burden. I
don't have it being asked every week, so I don't have to worry
about it.''
	   First-round co-leader Phil Tataurangi and Frank Lickliter, who
started the day one shot back, were tied for second at 133.
Lickliter and Brian Claar both got to 10 under, but Lickliter
bogeyed No. 18 and Claar made a triple bogey on the par-4 finishing
hole on the River Course at Kingsmill.
	   ``I just picked the wrong time to hit a low snap hook,'' said
Claar, whose tee shot landed in the pond to the left of the closing
fairway.
	   ``It's like taking a no-hitter into the ninth and losing.''
	   Claar is one of five players three shots back and tied for
fourth. Others in the group are Kirk Triplett, Gary Hallberg,
Bradley Hughes and Steve Pate.
	   Lickliter tried to go at the stick on No. 18, but hit his 4-iron
approach into the deep rough, left himself about a 10-foot
(3-meter) par putt and missed.
	   ``I made bogey trying to make birdie,'' he said.
	   Tataurangi, who shot a 68, stands 165th on the earnings list and
needs a pay day of around dlrs 70,000 in one of the three remaining
events to retain his tour card. He said it's hard to play without
thinking about that, too.
	   ``I've been thinking about it all year, really,'' the New
Zealander said of the exemption that goes to the top 125 on the
tour's money list. ``If you haven't got exempt status and haven't
gotten your money up early in the year, it's certainly on your
mind. You have to go out and play and play well.''
	   Duval never had to worry about his card. He finished 10th and
11th in prize money his first two years, but knows pressure from
the questioning that dogged him everywhere until he finally got
that first career victory.
	   ``It's been a lot harder for him because of the position he's
in,'' Duval said of Tataurangi. ``There's a lot more riding on it.
I don't know if he finished at nine under or 10, but what he shot
was better than what I shot.''

Pak takes lead at Tournament of Champions

<TEXT>
	   OPELIKA, Alabama (AP) _ Rookie sensation Se Ri Pak, despite
making her first bogey in over 100 holes, shot a 3-under-par 69
Friday and took a two-stroke lead over Helen Alfredsson, Kelly
Robbins and defending champion Annika Sorenstam in the LPGA
Tournament of Champions.
	   Pak, whose four wins this year include two major tournaments,
was at 7-under 137 for two trips around the Lakes Course at Grand
National.
	   Pak overtook Robbins after the first-round leader double bogeyed
and bogeyed Nos. 3 and 4 to drop to three under. Robbins got back
to five under after nine holes but couldn't make up any ground
after that and finished with a 73.
	   Sorenstam, who has also won four times this year, and
Alfredsson, a two-time winner this season, each had a second-round
70.
	   Pak, who had four birdies in her round Friday, bogeyed No. 10,
ending a string of 103 holes without going over par.
	   Johnson, seeking her first win of the year, went to the 18th tee
one shot off the lead double bogeyed the hole for a 70, dropping
into a tie at 140 with Sherri Steinhauer, who had a 70, and Juli
Inkster, who had a 73.
	   The 18th hole shook up the leaderboard as none of the 13 players
under par birdied the par-4 with three bogeys to go with Johnson's
double.

Padres keep their wits despite surprising NLCS lead
</HEADLINE>

	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ The San Diego Padres aren't giddy just because
they've outpitched the Atlanta Braves and taken a stunning 2-0 lead
in the National League championship series.
	   Confident, yes, especially since those wins were on the road and
they're back home for a weekend bash at Qualcomm Stadium, expected
to be rocking with more than 60,000 fans for Games 3 and 4 on
Saturday and Sunday.
	   Guarded, though, because these still are the same Braves who won
106 games in the regular season and still have Greg Maddux (18-9)
and left-hander Denny Neagle (16-11) to go in their vaunted
starting rotation.
	   ``They're too good,'' Tony Gwynn said at the Padres'
sun-splashed workout Friday afternoon. ``You know that you have to
fight for whatever it is you want. We want to go to the World
Series. We want to win the World Series. That was our goal coming
in.
	   ``We won the first two games of this series, but you have to
keep your wits about you. I'm sure they've been down 0-2 before.
That's not going to faze them.''
	   The Braves of the '90s have faced a 2-0 deficit just once, in
the 1991 World Series which they lost to Minnesota in seven. They
trailed St. Louis 3-1 in the 1996 NLCS and rallied to win.
	   Just two teams have rallied from a 2-0 deficit and won the NLCS,
including Gwynn's Padres in 1984 against the Chicago Cubs to reach
their only World Series.
	   But no team has won an NLCS after losing the first two games at
home.
	   ``We can't feel good about being 0-2, but we have the type of
club and pitching that we could easily reel off four in a row,''
Atlanta manager Bobby Cox said after Kevin Brown pitched yet
another gem in the NLCS against Atlanta, winning 3-0 Thursday night
with a three-hit complete game.
	   Brown also beat the Braves twice last year while with the
Florida Marlins.
	   The Braves didn't work out Friday. They flew to San Diego and
arrived too late before the field was converted for a Hawaii-San
Diego State football game.
	   Maddux gets the start Saturday, a week after he beat the Chicago
Cubs 6-2 to close out a first-round sweep. The Padres counter with
left-hander Sterling Hitchcock, who was brilliant in striking out
11 Houston Astros in six innings Sunday and outdueling Randy
Johnson as the Padres finished their division series in four games
with a 6-1 win.
	   John Smoltz and Tom Glavine pitched well for Atlanta in the
first two games, but San Diego's Andy Ashby and Brown pitched even
better. San Diego's team ERA is 0.95 after two games, compared to
Atlanta's 2.84.
	   Maddux lost his only start against the Padres this year, 5-1 at
San Diego on Aug. 12. He won his next two starts, but then went 0-3
with two no-decisions in his next five starts before winning his
final outing of the season.
	   A key matchup Saturday will be Gwynn versus Maddux. Gwynn has
hit .455 lifetime against the four-time Cy Young Award winner.
	   ``The challenge with him starts with the guys in front of him,''
Maddux said. ``That's half the battle in pitching to Tony is
getting the guys out in front of him. He handles the bat as well as
anybody probably has.''

U.S. envoy presses Milosevic as NATO strikes loom

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke held
``serious discussions'' with Yugoslavia's president overnight, and
said he would travel later in the day to Kosovo's capital to
consult ethnic Albanians in hopes of solving the crisis without
NATO airstrikes.
	   Following more than six hours of talks with President Slobodan
Milosevic that lasted until early Saturday morning, Holbrooke told
reporters he would meet chief ethnic Albanian political leader,
Ibrahim Rugova, in Pristina before returning to Belgrade later in
the day.
	   Holbrooke would not characterize his talks with Milosevic,
except to say: ``There are serious discussions and the situation is
serious.'' Holbrooke is expected to remain in Yugoslavia as long as
there remains a possibility of convincing Milosevic to accept
international terms for ending the seven-month conflict in the
majority Albanian province.
	   In dispatching Holbrooke back to the Yugoslav capital on
Thursday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned Milosevic
that ``time is all but gone'' for a peaceful settlement.
	   Her words were echoed Friday by NATO's American supreme
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, who said his forces were moving ahead
with final preparations for airstrikes.
	   Speaking in Naples, Italy, Clark questioned why Milosevic would
want to ``risk the ravages of armed conflict and the destruction of
his own country.''
	   Despite the general's tough talk, NATO remained divided about
the legality and effectiveness of using force against the Serbs.
	   Italy and Greece, among others, are reluctant to proceed without
a mandate from the U.N. Security Council. Among the Security
Council members, Russia and China are opposed to strikes.
	   Meeting in Brussels, Belgium, NATO allies searched for broad
consensus for a strike that would allow them to proceed without the
direct blessings of the Security Council.
	   But the alliance failed in its effort to pressure Russia into
dropping its opposition to airstrikes.
	   ``We must not allow NATO strikes,'' Russian President Boris
Yeltsin was quoted as saying in Moscow Friday. ``We want to achieve
a political, peaceful solution without the use of military force
and, I think, we shall succeed.''
	   The chairman of the Russian parliamentary defense committee said
lawmakers may respond to any use of force by recommending Russia
abandon its treaty with NATO.
	   Russia signed an agreement with NATO in May 1997 that sets up a
new consultative mechanism and spelled out NATO's intentions as it
expands into central and eastern Europe.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands driven
from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb. 28
against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is
fighting to wrest Kosovo province from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, saying they are needed to prevent new attacks by
Kosovo Liberation Army ``terrorists.''
	   After the first round of talks Friday, he called NATO threats of
airstrikes ``belligerent attempts'' to solve the Kosovo problem,
adding that he favors negotiations.
	   Holbrooke arrived from London, where he met with officials of
the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans. He said that movement
toward authorizing the use of force by NATO continues ``in a
sustained and intense manner.''
	   ``The situation remains just as serious at it has been before,''
he said shortly before the start of his fourth meeting with
Milosevic in five days.
	   In Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital, cafes were full, with
people appearing to make the most of what could be the last few
days of relative peace.
	   ``I am not afraid,'' said Jehona Xhaferi, 25, an ethnic
Albanian. ``Maybe that's crazy, but I see it as the finishing phase
of everything,'' she said, alluding to the months of Kosovo
turmoil.
	   The international demands Holbrooke was presenting to Milosevic
included an immediate end to hostilities and a withdrawal of forces
and heavy armaments to levels before March, before the government
crackdown on Kosovo started.
	   In addition, Holbrooke was expected to press for an
international monitoring force to be allowed to oversee compliance.
State Department spokesman James Foley said Holbrooke described
discussions so far as ``very intense and tough going.''
	   The KLA announced a unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo
starting Friday, a move that will add to the pressure on Milosevic
to reciprocate.
	   But Serbian media reported at least five KLA breaches of their
cease-fire Friday. They said Serbian police and ethnic Albanians
loyal to the Serbian government were attacked, but there were no
casualties.
	   The KLA said it was government troops who were on the offensive.
In a statement read on state television in neighboring Albania, the
rebels claimed villages were being attacked west of Pristina, but
added that their troops continued to respect the unilateral
cease-fire.
	   The claims of renewed skirmishes could not be independently
verified. Foley said Friday that there had been no new reports of
fighting in Kosovo. But he said the absence of fighting did not
mean peace.
	   ``While there has been no shooting in the past 24 hours, neither
has there been any measurable change in the Serbian deployment of
army troops in the field,'' he said. ``A large police presence also
remains on major roads and highways.
	   The Serbian and Yugoslav governments showed little sign that
they were prepared to bow to international pressure.
	   Citing the Kosovo crisis and NATO threats of intervention, the
Serbian government Friday put into effect a harsh decree tightening
state control over companies and independent media.
	   The decree broadens government authority and envisions
punishment for companies, institutions and individuals who act
contrary to the government's view of patriotic behavior.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A senior U.S. trouble-shooter
pressed President Slobodan Milosevic on Friday to avoid NATO attack
by accepting international peace terms on Kosovo, and the
alliance's top general urged him to stop toying with Yugoslavia's
survival. Divisions remained among the 16 NATO allies on the use of
force, despite the tough talk from Gen. Wesley Clark, the American
supreme commander of NATO. Italy and Greece, among others, are
reluctant to proceed without a mandate from the U.N. Security
Council, where Russia and China are opposed or seeking a legal
basis for such a strike. Still, in dispatching U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke back to Belgrade, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright warned Milosevic that ``time is all but gone'' for a
peaceful settlement. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's second-longest lasting government since
World War II collapsed Friday, throwing into question a new phase
of financial reforms and participation in any NATO attack on
Yugoslavia. Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition had held
together during its drive to cut costs and qualify for Europe's
common currency. But it lost momentum and fell apart after it
reached its goal. Communists caused its end after 2{ years in power
by withdrawing support over Prodi's 1999 budget, saying they wanted
more spending for jobs. Their rebellion forced Friday's vote of
confidence in the Chamber of Deputies. Prodi lost it by a single
vote, 313-312, when a lawmaker in his coalition defected.
(ITALY-POLITICS)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After 15 years of disgrace and painstaking
attempts at political rehabilitation, Ariel Sharon returned to the
center of power Friday. The burly ex-general and war hero with a
deep distrust of the Arabs was named Israel's new foreign minister
and put in charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with the
Palestinians. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who once tried to
keep Sharon out of his Cabinet altogether, made the appointment
reluctantly and with his back to the wall. Netanyahu is under heavy
U.S. pressure to conclude a deal on a West Bank pullback at next
week's Mideast summit in Washington, but knows that hard-liners in
his coalition may topple him if he does.
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A human rights group has called on the
United Nations to remove a Chilean military officer from his job as
chief of a U.N. mission, alleging he committed human rights abuses
during the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship. The United Nations is
awaiting Chile's response to the accusations against Brig. Gen.
Sergio Espinoza Davies before deciding what, if any, action to
take, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Friday. In a letter to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, New York-based Human Rights Watch
said Espinoza's documented participation ``in the worst human
rights abuses in his home country'' makes him unfit to remain in
charge of the U.N. military observer mission in India and Pakistan.
(UN-CHILE)
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Apartheid-era laws banning
homosexual relations were struck down on Friday by South Africa's
highest court, which ruled men convicted of sodomy since 1994 could
demand monetary damages and have their criminal records cleared.
The constitutional court's decision formalized guarantees granted
in 1994, when white minority rule ended and a provisional
constitution banned discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation, race or gender. The National Coalition for Gay and
Lesbian Equality said Friday's ruling could open up adoption,
marriage and other rights for homosexuals. ``The court has said
that lesbians and gay men ... have a right to equality and dignity
and privacy,'' said Zackie Achmat, the group's director. (SOUTH

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip stocks surged higher Friday as
Thursday's powerful rebound reassured investors that the summer's
lows will hold as a bottom for the market even with a troubling
economic backdrop. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 167.61
points _ or by 2.2 percent _ to 7,899.52, pushing into positive
territory for the week and just shy of this year's starting point,
7,908.25. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The dollar slid further Friday against the
Japanese yen, capping a week that saw the U.S. currency suffer its
worst declines against the Japanese currency in a quarter century.
The stunning fall in the value of the dollar _ off nearly 14
percent for the week as a whole _ was fueled largely by panicky
hedge funds moving to dump dollars in uncertain markets. Analysts
said it also reflected expectations of greater efforts by Japan to
heal its critically ill economy, the world's second largest, and
the gloomier outlook for the American economy. The dollar was
trading at 116.95 yen late Friday, down from 119.05 late Thursday.
(US-DOLLAR)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Unemployment in the European Union held
steady at 10 percent in August, unchanged from the previous month,
according to figures released Friday by the EU's statistics office.
The EU rate compares with 4.7 percent in the United States and 4.2
percent in Japan. Eurostat's data showed 16.8 million citizens were
out of work across the 15-nation bloc. Year-on-year figures showed
a decline in the unemployment level from 10.6 percent in August,
1997, and 10.9 in August, 1996. The average jobless rate in the 11
countries adopting the euro as their common currency on Jan. 1 was
11.1 percent, unchanged since June. Luxembourg had the lowest rate
in the EU with 2.2 percent, Spain the highest with 18.7 percent.
(EU-UNEMPLOYMENT)
	   PARIS (AP) _ A crippling transport strike appeared to be easing
late Friday, with rail officials saying workers at more than half
of the capital's train depots had decided to resume work. The
stoppage, in its fourth day Friday, caused havoc in the Paris
region and in northern France, where transit workers were
protesting a spate of violent attacks on colleagues by passengers.
Commuters were again left stranded as nearly all suburban traffic
on both regular rail and high speed commuter lines remained at a
virtual standstill. The walkout also spread to parts of the city
Metro for the first time. Traffic jams outside Paris stretched up
to 20 kilometers (19 miles). (FRANCE-TRANSPORT STRIKE)
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Trade officials from the United States and Canada
are planning a series of meetings in the coming weeks to resolve a
dispute over agriculture exports. Agreement on a work plan was
reached Thursday during a closed-door meeting in Montreal. The
talks had an element of urgency to them because cross-border
tensions had been heightened recently by delays and tough
inspections of Canadian livestock and grain shipments in South
Dakota and other Western states. Jay Ziegler, a spokesman for U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, said Friday the two sides
held ``very detailed and open discussions'' about the contentious
issues and agreed to meet again as early as next week.
(CANADA-US-TRADE DISPUTE)
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Zurich Financial Services said Friday
it is selling its British-based Eagle Star Reinsurance subsidiary
to GE Capital of the United States. Eagle Star Re will operate as
part of GE Capital's Employers Reinsurance Corp, Zurich announced.
Terms of the sale weren't made public. It excludes most business
undertaken by Eagle Star before 1993. Eagle Star Re's net assets as
of Dec. 31 totaled 232.8 million pounds. Zurich Financial Services,
the operating company of Zurich Allied AG and Allied Zurich PLC,
said the deal is part of a shake-up of its London reinsurance
operations, which also includes a reorganization of Zurich Re
London. (SWITZERLAND-INSURANCE)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A federal judge agreed to delay the start of
the U.S. government's antitrust trial with Microsoft Corp. four
days until Oct. 19. Adding to the roster of witnesses from
high-tech rivals, the government says it will call key executives
from Apple Computer Co. and Sun Microsystems Inc. to testify
against Microsoft at its antitrust trial. The government wants to
use testimony from Apple and Sun to show that Microsoft engaged in
a pattern of illegal activities, not just specifically to
distribute more of its Internet browser software, but also
generally to protect its lucrative Windows operating system.

	   LOS ROQUES, Venezuela (AP) _ The streets are sand. Boys play
baseball with driftwood for bats. The only two vehicles are a
garbage truck and a water truck.
	   Life is slow and simple on Los Roques archipelago, but as the
world discovers what has been one of the best-kept secrets of the
Caribbean, the pace may be picking up.
	   Thousands of tourists from Canada, Germany, Italy, the United
States and other countries are arriving, captivated by the pristine
chain of 42 islands surrounded by coral reefs and 300 other tiny
islets and sand cays.
	   ``It doesn't look real,'' marveled my sister Allison during my
family's recent trip.
	   The sea is shades of turquoise, aqua and emerald. The white sand
is powder soft.
	   With a snorkeling mask, the underwater world came alive in
spectacular fashion.
	   Black angel fish with yellow stripes, rainbow-colored parrot
fish and yellowtail snappers swarmed in the crystalline water.
Propelled by flippers and arms at your side, you get the sensation
that you've become part of the sea yourself.
	   At one point, though, our ecstasy was abruptly interrupted when
we met a 5-foot (1.5-meter) barracuda. The razor-toothed beast
brushed by ourtour guide and sent us swimming for shore.
	   Los Roques (The Rocks), 95 miles (150 kilometers) off
Venezuela's coast, boasts 280 species of exotic fish such as puffy
porcupine fish, royal blue angelfish, moray eels, sting rays, manta
rays and black-tip sharks.
	   It also has all 87 species of coral found in the Caribbean Sea,
including gonia, brain and fire. The skies are filled with 92
species of birds: frigates, brown boobies, scarlet ibises.
	   Most of Los Roques remains unspoiled, thanks to its remoteness
and the fact the desalination plant that provides fresh water on El
Gran Roque, the only permanent settlement, was barely pumping until
a recent overhaul.
	   A few years ago, only a few of the 240 dwellings served as
family-run guest houses, called ``posadas.'' Today, there are 50.
On nearby Madrizqui Island, Venezuela's richest families own a
dozen vacation houses.
	   While tourism officials are happy more visitors are flocking to
the islands (58,000 last year), environmentalists warn an onslaught
could be disastrous.
	   Coral reefs are the so-called rain forests of the sea because of
the high number of species they harbor and help breed. Yet, merely
touching a reef can kill that spot by destroying a vital filmy
plant that covers the surface and gives off the coral's distinctive
bright colors.
	   ``In very little time you can destroy a colony that took a
thousand years to develop,'' says parks service head Miguel Matany.
Tourists have killed many of the world's most heavily visited coral
reefs.
	   Venezuela wants to avoid that fate. In 1972 it declared Los
Roques a national park, making the 50,000-acre (20,200-hectare)
zone one of the Caribbean's largest marine preserves. The decree
prohibited new building and limited the number of islands tourists
can visit.
	   Officials say the high cost of traveling to Los Roques should
help keep down the number of visitors. The government also plans to
create environmental education programs and more than triple the
number of park guards to 35.
	   Environmentalists worry that Venezuela's notoriously
disorganized government won't follow through.
	   Most tourists get to Los Roques by taking a half-hour flight
from Caracas or popular Margarita Island. There is no airport; just
an airstrip and a check-in booth.
	   Fishermen will take you out to the other islands on their
colorful wooden boats, which they beach on El Gran Roque near
hungry pelicans dive-bombing for fish in the shallows. Or you can
sail aboard one of the 55-foot (17-meter) catamarans run by tour
companies.
	   Anglers may want to spend the day bonefishing, considered among
the best in the world.
	   Over at Dos Mosquises Sur Island, marine biologists can tell you
about their project to save the islands' endangered marine turtles,
which lumber ashore to lay their eggs.
	   Visitors often cap off the day by taking a sunset hike up a hill
on El Gran Roque to an old lighthouse the Dutch built of coral,
conch shells and stones. Once there, they relish the breathtaking
view of the islands and anchored sailboats.
	   From that vantage point it's easy to see why Christopher
Columbus, stopping off at Los Roques five centuries ago, declared
them ``Heaven on Earth.''

	    &UR; IF YOU GO ...
	   GETTING THERE: The easiest way to travel to Los Roques is to
sign up with a tour group that will fly you to the main island,
sail you to the smaller ones on a catamaran, feed you, give you a
bed and then fly you back to Caracas or Margarita Island.
	   The best-known agency, Aereotuy Tourism Company, charges dlrs
141 (81,000 bolivars) for a daylong tour, leaving at 8:30 a.m. and
returning at 6 p.m. A two-day/one-night package runs dlrs 360
(207,000 bolivars) per person for a double room in a top-rate
``posada'' or guest house during the high season. Rates are
slightly lower in the off-season, for triple rooms and for
``standard'' posadas.
	   The tour includes bilingual guides (English, Dutch, German,
Italian, Portuguese), three meals a day, snorkeling equipment and
kayaking.
	   LODGING: More independent travelers may want to book only the
flight ( dlrs 110 or 63,000 bolivars) and find their own posada.
The most luxurious one is the Macanao Lodge, which charges dlrs 250
(144,000 bolivars) for two days and one night, not including
airfare.
	   Other leading posadas include Arrecife (Coral Reef), the Malibu,
and Piano and Papaya.
	   Rates at the most simple posadas on the island are as low as
dlrs 30 (17,000 bolivars) a day, breakfast and dinner included. All
posadas are licensed by the government.
	   CAMPING: The cheapest way to travel is to camp out on one of the
islands. Permission must be obtained from the national parks
service (Inparques) and you'll have to bring all supplies.
	   DIVING: Companies such as Aereotuy also run scuba diving tours
at dlrs 85 (49,000 bolivars) per person a day, including equipment.
	   WEDDINGS: One company, Air Mundo, even arranges weddings on the
island. Depending on the number of guests, the ceremony can be
performed on a boat.

	   ROCKVILLE, Indiana (AP) _ If the bridges of Madison County in
Iowa were made famous by a novel and a movie, the 32 covered
bridges in this Indiana county have millions of fans of their own.
	   The Parke County bridges are magnets for a festival that has
been drawing up to 2 million visitors each year for the past four
decades, much to the surprise of even festival organizers.
	   No other county in the country has as many carefully preserved
covered bridges, relics of an era gone by, the local residents like
to boast.
	   ``I think the main reason Parke County kept its covered bridges
is we couldn't afford to replace them,'' says Anne Lynk, director
of the Parke County Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``We had to
make do with what we had.''
	   Madison County, Iowa, has only six, but those inspired the title
of Robert James Waller's best-selling romance novel, ``The Bridges
of Madison County'' and the hit movie starring Clint Eastwood and
Meryl Streep.
	   The Parke County Covered Bridge Festival, which this year runs
from Oct. 9-18, features food, crafts and entertainment, as well as
tours of the bridges.
	   Lynk, who is also executive secretary of Parke County Inc., the
nonprofit foundation which sponsors the festival, estimates there
will be up to 2 million visitors over the 10 days of the festival.
	   Many of the visitors are day-trippers from nearby areas such as
Indianapolis, about an hour away, or Chicago, about two hours away,
she says.
	   Bus tours of the bridges are conducted from Rockville's
1883-vintage railroad depot, led by guides in 19th-century
costumes.
	   There's the 1886-vintage Sim Smith Bridge, which once carried
the main road from Rockville west to Montezuma over Leatherwood
Creek. Locals say it's haunted by the sound of a horse and buggy
crossing its wooden planks.
	   Narrows Bridge in Turkey Run State Park is a favorite
springboard for teens diving into Sugar Creek below.
	   Along with the bridges, the festival's events help preserve the
traditions of the farming communities which dot Parke County.
	   One tradition is the in-home housing program, which dates back
to when the county had no hotels. Residents turn their homes into
``inns'' and host festival visitors for dlrs 5 a night.
	   ``It's a tradition that has grown over the years,'' Lynk says.
	   The tiny town of Tangier is famous for its ``buried beef''
sandwiches, made from meat slow-roasted underground over hot coals
and sold to benefit the town's park and Little League fields.
	   That tradition wouldn't survive if not for the festival, said
Dave Grimes, a retired teacher who coordinates the roasting of the
600 pounds (270 kilos) of beef each year.
	   ``It's too much work. It takes too many volunteers to do it any
other time.''

It's not just leaves they are looking for

<TEXT>
	   BURLINGTON, Vermont (AP) _ Tour buses crawl through New England
this time of year. They wind around tiny town squares and lumber up
mountain roads.
	   RV drivers enraptured by the color stop their rigs in the middle
of the road, pop out and snap pictures.
	   A luxury train with domed cars worms its way across the hilly
countryside, packed with people staring at trees.
	   This season called autumn in the rest of the world goes by a
different name here: fall foliage season. And fall foliage
translates into big business in the Northeast.
	   This fall, in New Hampshire alone, more than 6 1-2 million
tourists are expected to spend dlrs 800 million. Vermont estimates
6 million will spend dlrs 500 million.
	   For years, Vermont did nothing to lure the tourists, says Tom
Altemus, the state's commissioner of tourism and marketing. ``The
attitude has always been that fall took care of itself.''
	   The temperature drops, the chlorophyll breaks down, the yellows,
the reds and the oranges take center stage and, as sure as birds
fly south, the tourists flock north.
	   Kit Anderson asked why.
	   Why do they come? Who started this thing called foliage season
and when?
	   Anderson, a cultural geographer who studies the interaction
between people and landscape, started looking for answers. She dug
into state archives and read old newspapers. She quizzed native
Vermonters and interviewed tourists over church dinners at foliage
festivals.
	   She divided ``leaf-peepers'' into four categories, drew some
conclusions about their collective psyche, and presented her
theories at the American Association of Geographers' annual meeting
in Boston earlier this year.
	   ``It's not just the leaves,'' she says.
	   Other experts agree. People don't come just because it's pretty.
People looking at leaves also are looking for stability, a sense of
security and a place where people and nature live in harmony.
	   ``It's the leaves, it's the white steeple, it's the little
village tucked in among the hills,'' says Anderson, 47, who teaches
ethnobotany at the University of Vermont and natural history of
Vermont at Trinity College, both in Burlington. ``All those sights,
sounds and images mix to create a magnet she calls ``the Vermont
mystique.''
	   Steeples imply sacredness, she says. Villages in valleys suggest
small communities where people care about each other and live close
to the land.
	   No one came to Vermont to look at leaves 100 years ago because
there weren't any trees.
	   Settlers who had arrived in the 1800s cleared the forests to
farm. The forests grew back with fewer beech and coniferous trees
and more maples, which are famous for producing spectacular reds.
	   ``It's our living here that has actually created much of what is
so beautiful now,'' Anderson says.
	   Lots of people come to see the reds, or so they think.
	   ``Color is a very physical thing,'' says Charles A. Riley II of
New York City. ``Color excites us mentally and physically by
vibration, the vibration of wavelengths, the movement of the eye
from the reds to the yellows to the greens.''
	   Riley wrote a book called, ``Color Codes: Modern Theories of
Color in Philosophy, Painting and Architecture, Literature, Music,
and Psychology.''
	   Different cultures attach different meanings to color, Riley
says, but gold, orange and red appeal to all people.
	   ``It really is like bees to the blossom as they come up to see
the peak foliage because those are the colors that any psychologist
would say are the colors that excite,'' Riley says.
	   New York psychiatrist Dr. David Yamins says leaves show people a
sense of order. Autumn follows summer, just like it is supposed to,
and such order offers people security, stability and a sense of
control over life.
	   Brian Barry, an associate professor of psychology and sociology
at the Rochester Institute of Technology, notes that many of New
England's tourists are older people.
	   ``My own sense is that as people age, they get more aware or
more sensitized to life having cycles,'' he says.
	   Despite the frailties and problems that come with old age, Barry
says, ``fall and winter would remind us that there is beauty to be
had.''
	   Theories aside, Barry says, the appeal boils down to aesthetics.
``If there was change and it wasn't beautiful, I don't think people
would be going to it.''
	   Tourists experience foliage differently based on how they get
around the state, Anderson says. She divided them into four
categories: those who travel by bus, those who travel by car, the
hikers and bikers and the Vermonters.
	   Bus tourists, she concludes don't get too close to nature.
``They've got to go to places with bathrooms, first of all,'' she
says.
	   She watched a tour stop at Rock of Ages granite quarry in Barre.
``The bus pulls up, everybody piles out, they go in and shop,''
Anderson said. They drank hot cider and toured the quarry and then
got back on the bus when they were told.
	   ``They weren't sure where, exactly, they'd been or where they
were going,'' Anderson says.
	   At a Montpelier farm that caters to tourists, they watched a
film about making maple syrup _ a spring ritual.
	   ``It makes me think of when I was in Louisiana and they had
these little fake Mardi Gras parades inside the stadium for
visitors,'' she said. ``It's like packaging. It's like a Disney
version of it because they're mixing seasons.''

	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ The rain poured, a gale blew and
finally St. Andrews was bathed in blinding sunshine out of a near
cloudless sky.
	   The Old Course wore all its colors to try and put some of the
biggest names in golf off their game but Tiger Woods and Mark
O'Meara refused to submit.
	   Starting their rounds wrapped in three layers including
waterproofs, they carded 2-under rounds of 70 to win their Dunhill
Cup matches Friday, walking up the 18th fairway in sweaters and
shielding their eyes from the sun.
	   Woods, the world's top ranked player, and O'Meara, winner of
this year's Masters and British Open titles, basked in a 3-0
victory over Japan after a similar beating of England.
	   For Woods, who triumphed over Katsuma Miyamoto by seven, it
followed a 66 against England on Thursday. He has made only one
bogey in 36 holes. O'Meara, who had carded 67 against the English,
outplayed Hiroyuki Fujita by five.
	   They received a little help too from John Daly who is compiling
a remarkable record at the home of golf.
	   Daly, who won the British Open here in 1995, downed Nobuo
Serizawa by three shots for his second win of this championship and
now has a 7-1 record in Dunhill Cup play. He helped the U.S. win
the title in '93.
	   O'Meara, who has played the Dunhill Cup four times and knows the
Old Course well, wasn't put off by the changeable conditions.
	   ``The true Old Course came out,'' he said. ``We had all four
seasons _ wind, rain, the cold, the sun came out and more wind.
	   ``You can play the first five or six holes in one type of
weather and within 15-20 minutes it can change.''
	   The American trio faced their toughest opponent yet Saturday
when they lined up against Sweden, another team with a perfect
record.
	   Daly went out against Per Ulrik Johansson. Woods faced Mathias
Gronberg and O'Meara played last against Patric Sjoland.
	   Scotland, led by Colin Montgomerie, met Jose Maria Olazabal's
Spain, South Africa, with Ernie Els on the lineup, met Zimbabwe and
Nick Price, while Australia, another team with a perfect record,
could afford to lose 2-1 New Zealand and advance to the last four.
	   Both the semifinal and final are on Sunday.

Boitano gets his chance to work with skating's future

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ For years, figure skater Brian Boitano has
wanted to work with kids in his hometown. There was just one
problem: San Francisco didn't have a year-round ice rink.
	   Now it does.
	   So the 1988 Olympic gold medalist has joined with San
Francisco's Unified School District and the city's new downtown ice
rink for ``Brian Boitano's Youth Skate'' a non-profit organization
that will introduce school children to ice skating.
	   ``This isn't just great for the kids, it's great for me,''
Boitano exclaimed. ``I've finally got an ice rink in my hometown.''
	   Boitano has moved comfortably into the role of skating
ambassador. Although he still participates in professional
competitions, he is quickly becoming one of the sport's grand
masters _ in a class that includes Scott Hamilton and Peggy
Fleming.
	   Hamilton and Fleming, both cancer survivors, have thrown their
efforts behind fighting the disease. Boitano, meanwhile, has turned
his energy to skating's future.
	   ``It's a time in his life where he has had a lot of success with
his career, both as an amateur and a professional, and I really
think it's important to him to pass some of that on,'' said
Boitano's longtime coach and manager, Linda Leaver.
	   Small, temporary ice rinks grace the city during the holiday
season, but budding San Francisco skaters typically have had to
commute for lessons and ice time. The sparkling rink means a whole
new potential talent pool, Boitano said.
	   ``There's so much talent out there,'' he said. ``There are so
many kids who would be great skaters if they just had a chance. In
San Francisco, many kids never had the chance.''
	   Boitano was fortunate. He grew up south of San Francisco in
Sunnyvale, where he impressed Leaver as a kid during a Saturday
morning skating lesson.
	   With Leaver, Boitano went on to win four national championships
and two world championships. But he captured the public's
imagination in the 1988 Olympics when he edged Canadian Brian Orser
in the so-called Battle of the Brians.
	   ``When I was a kid I thought that anything was possible,'' he
said, watching a small group of skaters circle the ice. ``That's
what's so great about this. The kids believe that they can do
anything.''
	   The program is so typical of Boitano, Leaver said.
	   ``He has lists of ideas,'' she said. ``He had some time to relax
recently and he just came up with more things he wants to do.''
	   Like skater Kristi Yamaguchi _ who founded the Always Dream
Foundation _ Boitano has eagerly lent his name and time to
children's causes. He is a spokesman and trustee for the Starlight
Foundation, which grants the wishes of seriously ill children. He
also is one of the founding members of the national Safe Kids
Campaign Entertainment Alliance.
	   With huge windows looking out on the San Francisco's distinctive
skyline, ``The Rooftop'' skating facility sits above the Yerba
Buena Gardens. The grand opening of the National Hockey
League-sized rink is scheduled for Oct. 17.
	   A few events already have been staged there, including a
trial-run of the Youth Skate program, and the taping of Boitano's
Skate Against Hate, a benefit performance for the program.
	   Skate Against Hate, which also features such stars as Nancy
Kerrigan, Surya Bonaly and Rudy Galindo, will be televised Nov. 19
on the USA Network. The modern, rock 'n' roll-themed performance is
produced by Boitano's company, White Canvas Productions.
	   ``I really wanted to do something that had a message, something
significant for kids,'' he said.
	   During practices for the show, Boitano was able to host about 35
children from Horace Mann Middle School for a question-and-answer
session. He signed autographs and passed out T-shirts emblazoned
with the program's hip logo.
	   Later, he ventured out on the ice with several of them. He
skated slowly backwards, pulling the string of wobbly children. One
shouted ``Go faster! Go faster!''
	   Boitano, as well as other guest skaters and coaches, will work
with students once a month during the school year. Leaver, who has
been at Boitano's side for more than 25 years, said she also plans
to help out.

Sailors chase the winds to New Zealand in America's Cup tryout

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ It's an unusually still morning on the San
Francisco Bay, certainly not windy enough for nine would-be
America's Cup sailors.
	   ``Look at this, we can sail all day in this same spot,''
helmsman John Cutler said. Cutler has guided Japanese syndicates in
the past two challenges and is hoping to make it to the America's
Cup in 2000 with the first coed team.
	   On board America True, the boat representing the San Francisco
Yacht Club, things are getting a little tense. Captain Dawn Riley
is overseeing open tryouts for people vying for a shot at heading
Down Under for the grandest of Grand Prix competitions.
	   The light wind only heightens their concentration. The sailors
look out over the sparkling bay and the Golden Gate Bridge ahead,
waiting for the wind.
	   ``The chances of gaining a spot in an open tryout like this are
a little better than winning the lottery,'' says Ed Broberg, 40, of
San Francisco. ``All of us have just been inaugurated into our own
club, to try out for the America's Cup team.''
	   As the winds come up and the crewmembers scramble like overeager
firefighters, the sail pops with a snap and the grinders hunch over
the drums that trim the sail. The 48-foot (14-meter) yacht heels
over, and everyone shifts their weight and concentrates on the next
move.
	   Once selected, the crew of America True will head to New Zealand
in December and train there for two three-month blocks before the
16 syndicates begin the trials Oct. 15 for the right to challenge
New Zealand for the America's Cup in March 2000.
	   In 1995, Riley led the first all-female America's Cup team, 32
of whom were selected through open tryouts. Now, as the first woman
to manage an America's Cup challenger, Riley will select up to four
sailors for her backup team out of the 40 who tried out earlier
this month. She had received about 170 resumes.
	   ``There's very few formal ways of evaluating potential sailors.
If you have one bad regatta, that might limit your potential. It's
kind of scary from a budding sailor's point of view,'' Riley says.
``So we've tried to give people their first chance or a second
chance if they just haven't had the right opportunities. They might
not make it this time, but it's a networking opportunity for
them.''
	   It's an impressive bunch. Sarah Buckley, 23, of Chicago was an
All American last spring at the College of Charleston in South
Carolina; Betty Sherman of San Diego has provided technical insight
to syndicates for four America's Cup races and bikes 13 miles (21
kilometers) a day; and David Burby, 30, of Santa Barbara is a tech
support manager for a software company who got on the America True
this morning as a walk-on.
	   ``You can't throw people together and expect them to be
perfect,'' Cutler says. ``We're looking to see how people respond
to a situation.''
	   The chaos at the beginning stems partially from an unfamiliarity
with the boat, which is rigged differently than most. ``You can
lose your footing,'' Burby says, and others agree.
	   ``You have a big learning curve with other people,'' says John
Campe, 24, of Cleveland, who's serving as the starboard headsail
trimmer. ``You have no idea what they're going to do.''
	   But as the wind picks up to about 9 knots, the teamwork
improves.
	   Cutler is taking the crew through various maneuvers, tacking and
jibing around invisible markers. This time they keep the headsail
to the hull line of the boat, providing the most efficient wind
speed.
	   ``Good job on that one, guys. That was nice,'' says Greg
Burrell, a former tight end for the San Francisco 49ers who was
invited to join Riley's crew as a grinder.
	   ``Getting smarter,'' says Katarina Wikstrom of London, who's the
aft grinder today.

	   FAYETTEVILLE, West Virginia (AP) _ Hundreds of skydivers from
around the world are about to descend on this small southern West
Virginia town to jump off the state's tallest and most famous
bridge.
	   Most locals will be safely on the ground, cashing in.
	   ``I think they're crazy,'' says Sandy Holliday, who works for
Fox's Pizza Den, which will set up a food booth at the New River
Gorge Bridge on Oct. 17, along with about 200 other vendors selling
food, arts and crafts, entertainment and even offering religious
advice.
	   For 18 years, Fayette County has staged Bridge Day on the third
Saturday in October. The population of Fayetteville, a town of
3,000 a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the bridge, swells to about
100,000 for the day-long para-fest.
	   At 876 feet (267 meters) high, the New River Gorge Bridge is
second in height in the United States only to the Royal Gorge
Bridge, which looms 1,053 feet (320 meters) over the Arkansas River
in Colorado.
	   This year's event is expected to draw about 300 BASE jumpers.
BASE stands for Building, Antenna, Spans and Earth, for the kinds
of things members jump from. Their hobby is legal only during
special times and at certain places. Some places where some have
jumped, sometimes illegally, include the 110-story World Trade
Center in New York City and the Leo Burnett Building in Chicago.
	   Three people have been killed during Bridge Day jumps here, the
last in 1987.
	   For dlrs 175, Ray Toney's whitewater rafting operation, Rivers,
will ferry tourists on the New River to watch jumpers from below.
	   Toney is not about to jump. Whitewater rafting is ``exciting
enough,'' he says.
	   Even Tom Wendell, who as owner of Hard Rock Climbing Services,
is not afraid of heights, sticks to his favored sport with its
latches and clasps.
	   ``To each their own,'' he says. ``I like back-ups.''
	   Julie Wingard, an employee at Cathedral Cafe and Bookstore, says
the jumpers are ``adrenaline junkies, I guess.''
	   The jumping into the New River _ a misnomer for the
65-million-year-old river that has sliced out the gorge with its
curving course _ ties into a cottage industry of mountain biking,
rappelling, whitewater rafting and less arduous activities in the
area.
	   Bridge Day generates about dlrs 1 million in revenue for Fayette
County and the surrounding area says Deborah Laird, executive
director of the county Chamber of Commerce.
	   ``It's going to be packed,'' Wingard says. ``Some people just
stay in town. You've got to fight your way through the crowd.''
	   After almost two decades of the event, the novelty and
excitement has worn off for some residents.
	   ``That sort of thing doesn't thrill me,'' Wingard says.
	   Other locals admire the jumpers.
	   ``It takes a lot of guts,'' says Louis Rahall, retired owner of
Ben Franklin Fabric, Crafts and Framing.
	   ``It must be a thrilling thing.''

New fertility technique transfers genes from infertile woman to egg
</HEADLINE>
of fertile woman &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; AP Graphic FERTILITY PROCEDURE &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Scientists have come up with another possible
way of helping women overcome infertility: They took the genes of
an infertile woman and injected them into a donor egg from a
fertile woman.
	   Relying on a technique similar to the one used to clone Dolly
the Sheep, the approach would, in effect, produce a baby with two
genetic mothers, The Washington Post reported Friday.
	   A baby that might result from such a high-tech union would raise
questions of which woman is the mother, or both.
	   Some medical ethicists described the research as ``profoundly
disturbing,'' but typical of the fast-paced and loosely regulated
field of reproductive medicine.
	   It is not human cloning, scientists said, although it borrows
cloning technology to produce the embryo.
	   The method empties the gene-packed nucleus from an egg donated
by a fertile woman. Scientists then transfer the genes from the egg
of an infertile woman into the hollowed egg to make a single
recombinant egg.
	   It is fertilized with sperm provided by a father and the
resulting embryo is transplanted into the infertile woman's womb.
	   The method used by Dr. Jamie Grifo of New York University was
not tested on animals prior to being tried in a pair of infertile
women. The university has approved the use of the method on as many
as five women.
	   In remarks reported by the Post, Grifo said he recognized the
ethical implications of the experiment. He said his team does not
have sources of private funding and a ban on federal funding of
embryo research _ a consequence of the nation's ongoing abortion
debate _ made animal experiments impossible.
	   ``There are a lot of concerns about this. A lot of issues,''
Grifo told the Post. ``It's not like we did this thoughtlessly.''
	   But critics on Friday weren't willing to take Grifo at his word.
	   ``Nobody knew exactly what he was doing,'' said Glenn McGee, a
bioethics professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
``Transferring genetic material from one person's egg to another _
this never happens in nature.''
	   Others offered a more cautious assessment.
	   ``It doesn't sound like genetic tampering. It sounds more like
its transferring the genes into a new environment,'' said Donna
Lieberman of the New York Civil Liberties Union's reproduction
rights project.
	   A new drug must pass several clinical trials before winning
federal approval, and the process can take years to complete. But
fertility research has far fewer barriers, and is propelled by the
ambitions of curious scientists and the desperation of infertile
couples.
	   ``It's like driving down a road with no speed limits and asking
if a person is driving too fast,'' said R. Alta Charo, professor of
law and medical ethics at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.
She serves on the National Bioethics Advisory Committee, which is
investigating the risks of human cloning.
	   ``There is no standard of practice here, and children could be
conceived by this technology that is not well tested,'' Charo said.
	   So far, the procedure brought uncertain results. It failed in
the first patient, who is 47; the second patient, age 44, is not
scheduled for a pregnancy test until next week. Their names were
withheld for privacy reasons.
	   The technique follows the Dolly method of inserting the DNA into
a single-cell egg for implantation. However, Dolly was created from
the genetic material of an adult body cell provided by its mother,
rather than combining genetic material from two different eggs.
	   The method is close enough to human cloning that even Grifo
concedes probably would be illegal to perform in California and
other states with broadly written cloning laws.
	   Grifo described the process on Thursday at the annual meeting of
the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in San Francisco.
	   Grifo and other members of his research team refused interview
requests today. Late in the day, New York University failed to
release a public statement attributed to the researchers.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ A Costa Rican documentary producer
said Friday he has found the remains of what could be a
pre-Colombian city of the Chibcha culture along the Nicaraguan
coast.
	   Jose Cortez presented videos of his findings to Nicaraguan
President Arnoldo Aleman and the nation's media.
	   The remains consist of two igloo-shaped stone formations found
in an autonomous Caribbean zone in southern Nicaragua, near the
natural reserve of Seapaz-Indio Maiz.
	   Clemente Guido, head of Nicaragua's cultural institute, said
only Nicaraguan archeologists authorized by the institute will have
access to the remains.
	   Defense Minister Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said the zone has been
cordoned off by the army to prevent plundering.
	   ___
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Lima's popular mayor, frequently mentioned as
a possible candidate for Peru's presidency in 2000, will test his
popularity in city elections this weekend.
	   Peruvians vote for mayors across the country Sunday, but
particular attention is focused on the race in the capital, where
Mayor Alberto Andrade is leading polls by a wide margin.
	   Andrade, elected in 1995, made his name by cleaning up and
reviving the city's center, previously congested with street
vendors and strewn with garbage.
	   The mayor has been harshly critical of President Alberto
Fujimori and has consistently come out ahead of the president in
job-performance polls.
	   Fujimori's popularity has fallen in recent years, and he has not
said if he plans to run again in 2000.
	   Andrade's chief opponent in the municipal election, Juan Carlos
Hurtado Miller, served as economy minister under Fujimori in the
early 1990s. Hurtado is running on the ticket of a political
movement that is believed to be a front for the president.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A mud slide in a poor suburb on the
southeast edge of Guatemala City killed all eight members of a
family, including four children, police said Friday.
	   Heavy rain loosened a hillside in the village of Santa Catarina
Pinula, burying the family's home late Thursday. Police said
firefighters worked through the night to recover the bodies.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemala's foreign minister criticized
Friday a complaint by Switzerland over the conviction and
sentencing of three Swiss men on drug trafficking charges.
	   Guatemala ``does not accept that rulings by its justice courts
are questioned,'' Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein Barillas said.
	   Swiss officials have criticized last month's convictions in the
so-called ``German Connection'' case, which involved dlrs 100
million in shipments of cocaine sent from Guatemala to Europe
hidden in containers and ornamental plants.
	   A court in Puerto Barrios ordered former Nestle executive
Andreas Haenggi Wyndler, 60, to serve 12 years in prison and pay a
fine of dlrs 77,000. His son, Nicholas Haenggi Chalandrian, 22, was
sentenced to 20 years and fined dlrs 155,000, as was Swiss citizen
Silvio Giovanoli, 30.
	   The Swiss Foreign Ministry called the sentences ``extremely hard
and disproportionate'' and officials asserted that parts of the
proceedings ``didn't meet legal requirements.''

	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Salvadoran legislators
expressed support for President Bill Clinton on Friday and
criticized Republican efforts to impeach him .
	   ``This is a threat to world security,'' said Rep. Gloria
Salguero Gross, of the right-center Nationalistic Republican
Alliance. ``A person's private life deserves respect.''
	   Rep. Juan Medrano of the Democratic Party said ``Republicans
have overstepped their bounds'' with their impeachment efforts,
which will ``undermine the foundations of American democracy.''
	   Rep. Humberto Centeno of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front, the former Salvadoran rebels, said Republicans were looking
for a way to regain the White House in the future.

	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ A former Colombian Cabinet minister
wanted in his country on charges of illicit enrichment was granted
political asylum Friday by Costa Rica.
	   The resolution granting asylum says Alvaro Leyva's role in
trying to achieve peace Colombia's leftist guerrillas ``have
generated situations of risk and danger to his life and that of his
family.''
	   Leyva, a former mines and energy minister, is accused of having
accepted a check for dlrs 36,000 from a company allegedly linked to
drug traffickers. Colombia's request for Leyva's extradition has
been rejected by Costa Rica.
	   Many in Colombia consider the criminal charges a political
vendetta by former President Ernesto Samper. Earlier this year,
Leyva had returned to Colombia from a meeting with rebel leaders
saying the guerrillas had insisted there was no chance for peace as
long as the scandal-plagued Samper remained in power.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Health officials said a woman died Friday
from hemorraghic dengue, becoming the eighth person to be killed by
the tropical illness this year in the central Mexican state of San
Luis Potosi.
	   The 28-year-old woman, a San Luis Potosi native, died in a
hospital in Tamaulipas state where she had been taken for
treatment, said Fernando Torzano, director for health services in
San Luis Potosi, the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   Several Mexican states have reported outbreaks of classic
dengue, a milder form of the illness which is spread by mosquitoes.
Dengue cases usually increase during the rainy season. Symptoms
include chills, fevers, and severe pain in bones and joints.

Pinochet reported recovering well in London after hernia surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet was reported to be
recovering Friday at an undisclosed London hospital after
undergoing surgery on a disc hernia, his Senate office reported.
	   The medical team that operated on the 82-year-old former
dictator ``considered the operation a success,'' a communique from
his office said.
	   ``Sen. Pinochet is now recovering in a satisfactory manner,''
the communique added.
	   Pinochet, who is now a senator-for-life, flew to London several
days ago in the usually secretive trips abroad he takes every year.
His attempt to extend his trip to France failed after the French
govenrment denied him an entry visa.
	   Pinochet had said before his departure that the hernia was
causing him pain and making it difficult for him to walk.
	   Pinochet seized power in a bloody 1973 coup and ruled until
1990. He then remained commander-in-chief of the army, a post he
relinquished last March, when he was sworn in as a
senator-for-life, a guarantee he created for himself in the
constitution written by his regime.

U.S. envoy heads for Pristina and talks with Albanians
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After hours of crisis talks with
Yugoslavia's president, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke travels
Saturday to Kosovo to meet ethnic Albanian leaders as part of a
renewed effort toward a diplomatic solution without NATO
airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke talked for more than six hours on Friday with
President Slobodan Milosevic. Returning to his hotel well past
midnight, Holbrooke said he would go to the Kosovo capital Pristina
later in the day for talks with the main ethnic Albanian leader,
Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Afterward, Holbrooke will return to Belgrade for more talks with
Milosevic. The American envoy refused to say whether he had made
progress in convincing Milosevic to accept international demands
for ending the crackdown in Kosovo.
	   ``There are serious discussions and the situation is serious,''
he said.
	   Holbrooke also refused to say what he planned to discuss with
Rugova. But resuming talks between the ethnic Albanians and the
Milosevic-led government on the future of Kosovo is one of the key
international demands.
	   The ethnic Albanians refused to meet government officials until
the seven-month crackdown in the province was ended.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have
been driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown
Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting to wrest Kosovo province from Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by Kosovo Liberation Army ``terrorists.''
	   After the first round of talks Friday, he called NATO threats of
airstrikes ``belligerent attempts'' to solve the Kosovo problem,
adding that he favors negotiations.
	   Holbrooke arrived from London, where he met with officials of
the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans. He said that movement
toward authorizing the use of force by NATO continues ``in a
sustained and intense manner.''
	   ``The situation remains just as serious at it has been before,''
he said shortly before the start of his fourth meeting with
Milosevic in five days.
	   In Pristina, cafes were full, with people appearing to make the
most of what could be the last few days of relative peace.
	   ``I am not afraid,'' said Jehona Xhaferi, 25, an ethnic
Albanian. ``Maybe that's crazy, but I see it as the finishing phase
of everything,'' she said, alluding to the months of Kosovo
turmoil.
	   The international demands Holbrooke was presenting to Milosevic
included an immediate end to hostilities and a withdrawal of forces
and heavy armaments to levels before March, before the government
crackdown on Kosovo started.
	   In addition, Holbrooke was expected to press for an
international monitoring force to be allowed to oversee compliance.
State Department spokesman James Foley said Holbrooke described
discussions so far as ``very intense and tough going.''
	   The KLA announced a unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo
starting Friday, a move that will add to the pressure on Milosevic
to reciprocate.
	   But Serbian media reported at least five KLA breaches of their
cease-fire Friday. They said Serbian police and ethnic Albanians
loyal to the Serbian government were attacked, but there were no
casualties.
	   The KLA said it was government troops who were on the offensive.
In a statement read on state television in neighboring Albania, the
rebels claimed villages were being attacked west of Pristina, but
added that their troops continued to respect the unilateral
cease-fire.
	   The claims of renewed skirmishes could not be independently
verified. Foley said Friday that there had been no new reports of
fighting in Kosovo. But he said the absence of fighting did not
mean peace.
	   ``While there has been no shooting in the past 24 hours, neither
has there been any measurable change in the Serbian deployment of
army troops in the field,'' he said. ``A large police presence also
remains on major roads and highways.
	   The Serbian and Yugoslav governments showed little sign that
they were prepared to bow to international pressure.
	   Citing the Kosovo crisis and NATO threats of intervention, the
Serbian government Friday put into effect a harsh decree tightening
state control over companies and independent media.
	   The decree broadens government authority and envisions
punishment for companies, institutions and individuals who act
contrary to the government's view of patriotic behavior.

Bid cities for 2012 given more time to get government commitment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The nine American cities hoping to play host to
the 2012 Olympics were given more time Friday to come up with
government guarantees to back their bids.
	   The U.S. Olympic Committee's policymaking panel set Dec. 31 as
the new deadline for the bidders to obtain city or regional
government acknowledgment that tax money could be required to cover
any budget shortfall a privately financed Summer Games might
encounter.
	   That's three months past the original deadline, which was met by
only four bid committees _ Cincinnati, Dallas, Houston and
Orlando-Tampa.
	   Four others _ Baltimore-Washington, New York, San Francisco and
Seattle _ had obtained promises of council consideration of the
commitment, while the ninth, Los Angeles, had no such action in the
pipeline.
	   But rather than cut its field drastically, or even eliminate
just one city that already has staged two Olympics, the USOC
decided to give all bidders more time, committee president Bill
Hybl said.
	   ``I think we have clarified the rules, not changed the rules,''
Hybl said.
	   Los Angeles staged the Summer Games in 1932 and 1984, and is
home to two of the American members on the International Olympic
Committee, vice president Anita DeFrantz and sporting goods
executive Jim Easton.
	   DeFrantz and Easton are USOC executive committee members and
were at Friday night's meeting in Phoenix, Ariz. But Hybl and other
USOC officials said stretching the deadline was not an act of
favoritism.
	   ``We did this to be fair to all nine cities,'' Hybl said.
	   He said the nine bid packages submitted by the Sept. 30 deadline
all looked different, and that a task force including Donald Fehr,
head of the baseball players' union and a USOC member, would work
to coordinate the bid language.
	   USOC executive director Dick Schultz said only one of the nine
cities had submitted a complete and fully documented package. He
declined to say which city that was, but other committee sources,
speaking on the condition of anonymity, identified it as Dallas.
	   The executive committee also set up a task force as the first
step toward possible implementation of an independent drug-testing
agency for all U.S. Olympic sports.
	   The panel, to be headed by medical commission chairman Dr. David
Joyner, will report costs and other elements of the possible move
during the USOC board meeting next April.
	   The committee also heard Hybl reiterate that the USOC would ask
the IOC to consider granting medals to American athletes beaten by
East German swimmers ``proven or documented'' to have used
performance-enhancing drugs. Hybl first took this stand in an
interview on ABC's ``Nightline'' last summer.
	   Schultz said the bid process was lengthy enough to handle the
new deadline. The USOC won't pick its bid city until the fall of
2002 and the IOC doesn't make the final choice until 2005.
	   It's not necessary that government money be spent on any Olympic
bid. But after management problems with the 1996 Games in Atlanta,
which took their entire dlrs 1.8 billion budget from private funds,
the IOC ordered that local governments promise to cover any red ink
an organizing committee might entail.
	   The USOC stressed that language agreed to earlier by the cities
set Sept. 30 as the deadline for city governments to ``understand
and acknowledge'' the potential commitment. No guarantee of
governments contingency funds is needed until Dec. 31, 2001, the
USOC said.

Experts say with treatment Strawberry should survive

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Although Darryl Strawberry's doctors found
evidence of malignancy in one of his lymph nodes after colon cancer
surgery, oncology experts said the Yankee slugger's chances of
survival were better than good.
	   ``I would say the odds are still very much in his favor,'' said
Dr. Keith Lillemoe, oncology surgeon at Johns Hopkins Colon Cancer
Center.
	   American Cancer Society statistics show that 65 percent of black
men with Strawberry's type of cancer are still alive five years
after being diagnosed. The rate is slightly higher, 70 percent, for
white men.
	   But Lillemoe and other experts warned not to read too much into
those statistics, calling them broad-based, general and more than a
decade old.
	   ``I really don't like trotting out statistics,'' Lillemoe said.
``You cannot really generalize that one person is the same as a
group that takes into account thousands of patients with varying
degrees of the disease.''
	   Strawberry underwent surgery at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital
last Saturday to remove the 2 1/2-inch (6.4-cm) tumor, 16 inches
(40.6 cms) of his large intestine and 36 abdominal lymph nodes.
	   He was honored before Game 3 of the American League championship
series in Cleveland on Friday night. His place in line during
pregame introductions was left open and the Indians flashed his
picture and good wishes on the scoreboard.
	   Indians pitcher Dwight Gooden, a former teammate of Strawberry's
with the Mets and Yankees, was pleased to hear that Strawberry
asked the Yankees to make sure they beat him when he starts Game 4
on Saturday night.
	   ``That was a good sign,'' Gooden said. ``It let me know he was
feeling good about himself, and that's good to hear.''
	   The Yankees outfielder is considered to have stage three cancer,
which means a malignancy was found outside of the original tumor.
	   But there was no evidence the cancer had spread beyond the one
lymph node.
	   ``That's very favorable news,'' said Dr. Bernard Levine, vice
president for cancer prevention and professor of medicine at the
University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. ``Although it's
not good to have involvement in any lymph node, it's certainly
better to have it in only one out of 36.''
	   Doctors at Columbia-Presbyterian said Strawberry will likely be
released Sunday and will undergo drug chemotherapy. Normal
treatment lasts about six months.
	   ``It's not unrealistic to say he'll be back playing next
season,'' said Lillemoe, who operated on Strawberry's childhood
friend, Baltimore Orioles outfielder Eric Davis, last year.
``Everything has to go optimally but I certainly think it's
possible.''
	   Strawberry's good physical condition and the fact that he can
begin chemotherapy treatments right away will help, said Lillemoe.
	   The stage three diagnosis shouldn't worry Strawberry or his
fans, experts said.
	   ``Yes, it means his prognosis is not as good as what had been
previously described,'' said Dr. Robert Smith, director of cancer
screening for the American Cancer Society. ``And yes, that one node
has technically dropped him into a stage three category, but that's
not a particularly uncommon stage.''
	   Smith said one in four of the 64,600 men diagnosed each year
with colon cancer are stage three patients.
	   American Cancer Society statistics show that 94 percent of white
men and 85 percent of black men who have local colon cancer _
isolated to one area _ are alive and cancer-free after five years.
	   Strawberry's cancer is regionalized; the survival rate for those
with regionalized cancer are 65 percent among black men and 70
percent in white males, Smith said. But the fact that the cancer
was in only one lymph node ``definitely puts Strawberry at the
higher end of those statistics,'' Levin said.

Steinbrenner fined undisclosed amount for criticizing umpires
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Baseball fined George Steinbrenner an
undisclosed amount Friday for his criticism of the umpires after a
disputed play that led to Cleveland's 4-1 victory over New York in
Game 2 of the American League championship series.
	   The Yankees owner was critical of what he described as
``atrocious'' calls by home plate umpire Ted Hendry on Wednesday
night.
	   Hendry did not call interference against Travis Fryman after
Tino Martinez fielded his bunt up the first-base line. Fryman, who
ran to first along the infield grass and not in the designated box
along the foul line, was hit by Martinez's throw in the back.
	   While Chuck Knoblauch argued the call, Cleveland's Enrique
Wilson scored the go-ahead run in the 12th inning.
	   ``My concern was inappropriate comments that impact the game and
the profession of umpiring,'' AL president Gene Budig told NBC in
discussing the fine against Steinbrenner.
	   Asked if the call was correct, Budig said, ``It was correct in
the judgment of the crew chief, Jim Evans. ... He is one of the
best that we have.''
	   Budig also said Hendry was not fined, and he praised the
umpiring crew, saying it had 123 years of major league experience.
	   Informed by the network of Budig's fine, Steinbrenner said: ``He
has to do what he has to do. ... He has that right, doesn't he?''
	   Steinbrenner had said after Wednesday's game that it was ``too
bad this great game had to be decided by a call like that.''
	   ``I've been around this game 25 years, and the umpiring was
atrocious both ways.
	   ``He (Hendry) saw it, but he didn't call it,'' Steinbrenner had
said. ``He (Fryman) was blocking the guy's ability to throw. I
think it was a very poor call.''
	   Steinbrenner had also said the American League should be
stripped of its authority over umpires.
	   ``You bring the officiating under the commissioner's office. It
doesn't belong under the league offices,'' he said.

Italy starts process of forming next government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs.
 &UR; By ELLEN KNICKMEYER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's president plans to talk with the nation's
party leaders on Monday, looking for someone to who could put
together a new government after Premier Romano Prodi's center-left
coalition collapsed.
	   Prodi's government lost a vote of confidence in the Chamber of
Deputies by a single vote Friday, ending a 2 1/2-year-old
administration that had been Italy's 55th and
second-longest-lasting since World War II.
	   Prodi immediately submitted his resignation to President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro, who asked him to stay on for the time being.
	   Scalfaro must decide whether to call early elections _ a step
few want and few expect _ or ask Prodi or someone else to try to
form a new government.
	   Scalfaro scheduled talks with leaders of Parliament for late
Saturday followed by meetings with party and political leaders on
Monday and Tuesday.
	   After that, he would designate a potential premier who then
would have to prove he or she could command a majority of votes in
Parliament. Prodi's office denied news reports that he had taken
himself out of the running.
	   Prodi's coalition had held together during its drive to qualify
for Europe's common currency but lost momentum and fell apart after
it reached its goal earlier this year.
	   Communists brought about its end by withdrawing support over
Prodi's 1999 budget, saying they wanted more spending for jobs.
	   Their rebellion forced Friday's vote of confidence in the
Chamber of Deputies. Prodi lost 313-312 with the surprise defection
of a lawmaker in his own coalition.
	   Opposition lawmakers roared their approval at the tally and
burst into applause. Prodi slipped away from the presidential
palace so quickly that he outpaced his security agents and briefly
found himself facing reporters alone. ``I'm not bitter,'' he said.
	   Centrist leader Francesco Cossiga appealed to leading parties of
the left and right to work together to form a caretaker government
that would see Italy through tough spots ahead, including passage
of the budget.
	   ``I ask them because as the major political forces, only they
can form a government with the authority needed to face the
delicate international financial situation and the crisis in
Kosovo,'' Cossiga said.
	   Prodi presided over budget cuts and a temporary tax increase
needed to get Italy's economy in shape for the 1999 debut of
Europe's common currency. It qualified for the euro debut earlier
this year, impressing _ and surprising _ many fellow European Union
members with less volatile politics.
	   Prodi would have had to keep on cutting costs to stay in line
with requirements for the European Monetary Union. Communists
wanted more spending, not less.
	   To woo them going into Friday's vote, Prodi pledged that his
government would work to make law a 35-hour work week _ their pet
project.
	   He also held back from endorsing NATO airstrikes on Serbia
without specific backing from the U.N. Security Council, also a
Communist demand.
	   Italy is just across the Adriatic from Yugoslavia, and its bases
and ports could be important to any NATO attack over Yugoslavia's
treatment of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The fall of his government
makes Italy's participation in any attack even more of a question.
	   Prodi led Italy's 55th government since World War II. He
outlasted all but Bettino Craxi, a Socialist who served 3 1/2 years
in two back-to-back stints from 1983 to 1987.

 &UR; Steinbrenner fined for criticizing umpires &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on the amount. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Another day, another fine for the New York
Yankees.
	   Owner George Steinbrenner was fined by the American League on
Friday for his criticism of the umpires after a disputed play that
led to Cleveland's 4-1 victory over New York in Game 2 of the
American League championship series.
	   The Yankees owner was critical of what he described as
``atrocious'' calls by home plate umpire Ted Hendry on Wednesday
night.
	   While the amount of the fine was not disclosed, a baseball
official, speaking on the condition he not be identified, said it
was either dlrs 5,000 or dlrs 10,000.
	   ``My concern was inappropriate comments that impact the game and
the profession of umpiring,'' AL president Gene Budig told NBC.
	   A day earlier, the Yankees were fined dlrs 25,000 by the AL for
violating media access regulations issued by the commissioner's
office.
	   Hendry did not call interference against Travis Fryman after
Tino Martinez fielded his bunt up the first-base line. Fryman, who
ran to first along the infield grass and not in the designated box
along the foul line, was hit by Martinez's throw in the back.
	   While Chuck Knoblauch argued the call, Cleveland's Enrique
Wilson scored the go-ahead run in the 12th inning.
	   Asked if the call was correct, Budig said, ``It was correct in
the judgment of the crew chief, Jim Evans. ... He is one of the
best that we have.''
	   Budig also said Hendry was not fined, and he praised the
umpiring crew, saying it had 123 years of major league experience.
	   Informed by the network of Budig's fine, Steinbrenner said: ``He
has to do what he has to do. ... He has that right, doesn't he?''
	   Steinbrenner had said after Wednesday's game that it was ``too
bad this great game had to be decided by a call like that.''
	   ``I've been around this game 25 years, and the umpiring was
atrocious both ways,'' he said, referring to Hendry's ball-strike
calls as well as Fryman's baserunning.
	   ``He (Hendry) saw it, but he didn't call it,'' Steinbrenner had
said. ``He (Fryman) was blocking the guy's ability to throw. I
think it was a very poor call.''
	   Steinbrenner had also said the American League should be
stripped of its authority over umpires.
	   ``You bring the officiating under the commissioner's office. It
doesn't belong under the league offices,'' he said.

Commissioner: Diversity is NHL's strength
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFF SHAIN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUNRISE, Florida (AP) _ National Hockey League commissioner Gary
Bettman, downplaying the third investigation into racial slurs in a
year, denied a sensitivity problem Friday and lauded the league's
mix of players.
	   ``I think the increasing diversity of our game is one of its
strengths,'' Bettman said hours before the Florida Panthers debuted
in their new arena against the Tampa Bay Lightning.
	   ``Let's not forget for one moment that this is a very physical,
very fast-paced, highly emotional game,'' Bettman said. ``But that
does not mean that because it's those things; it's a whole host of
other things as well.''
	   Bettman's comments came one day after the NHL cleared two Tampa
Bay players of allegations they used racial gestures and a slur in
an argument with Florida's Peter Worrell, who is black.
	   The league said there was insufficient evidence to support
charges that gestures by Sandy McCarthy and Darcy Tucker were of a
racial nature or that slurs were uttered. A complaint had been
filed by two Panthers front-office employees.
	   ``The three players involved all denied it took place,'' Bettman
said. ``It makes it very difficult, particularly when you interview
14 other witnesses, to do something when you're not on a firm
foundation.''
	   McCarthy and Tucker were relieved by the ruling, but said they
were not surprised.
	   ``We both knew the truth would come out,'' said McCarthy,
himself part black and part Canadian Indian.
	   Tucker said: ``I'm glad it's over with. We just wanted to go out
and tell the truth right from the start.''
	   The NHL last year undertook a ``zero-tolerance'' policy toward
racial slurs after Washington Capitals players Chris Simon and
Craig Berube were suspended in separate incidents.
	   ``We're not going to tolerate it,'' Bettman said Friday. ``We
disciplined last season when there were incidents when there was no
doubt about the fact they transpired.''
	   Fewer than a dozen NHL players are black, though that number
slowly is rising. But with a growing number of American players and
a steady supply from Europe, the league's makeup has changed
drastically over the past decade or so.
	   Many of the first European imports were targets for abuse by
players who felt they took jobs away from North Americans. Panthers
president Bill Torrey acknowledged earlier this week that players
have been forced to adjust.
	   ``The fact is there are more blacks in the league, more Swedes,
more this, more that,'' Torrey said. ``The mix in the National
Hockey League is changing. Like anything else, we probably have
some growing pains.''
	   Bettman said despite the recent incidents, the changing
landscape should be viewed as a positive.
	   ``The example of bringing Europeans into the game has brought
some of the most skilled hockey players in the world to our game,''
he said.
	   ``As athletes go, our group is still the best group of athletes
there are in professional sports,'' the commissioner added. ``I
don't want to be in a situation where if there is a problem, it's
ignored. But I don't want to create a problem if it's not there.
Time will dictate.''

Flyers edge Rangers, Panthers down Lightning in NHL openers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ John Vanbiesbrouck made a successful debut with
Philadelphia, beating the New York Rangers 1-0 in a National Hockey
League season opener on Friday night.
	   Vanbiesbrouck, who signed as a free agent with the Flyers in the
offseason after playing with the Florida Panthers, only had to make
20 saves for his 30th career shutout.
	   New York's Mike Richter faced 30 shots, giving up only a
second-period power-play goal to Alexandre Daigle.
	   The Flyers picked up where they left off against New York last
season, when they won the series 3-1-1. The Rangers also picked up
where they left off, continuing to struggle at home. They only won
14 of 41 games at Madison Square Garden last season when they
failed to make the playoffs despite having the highest payroll in
the NHL.
	   The only goal came at 5:45 of the second period when Daigle
scored from in front during a scramble.
 &UR; Panthers 4, Lightning 1
	   In Sunrise, Florida, Mark Parrish's first two NHL goals broke a
tie in the third period as Florida christened its new arena by
beating Tampa Bay.
	   Parrish, who tied for the league lead with six preseason goals,
scored his first career goal at 2:34 of the period to break a 1-1
tie, then gave the Panthers a cushion with another goal at 8:24.
	   Viktor Kozlov assisted on both goals and scored two of his own
as the Panthers moved into their dlrs 185 million home in Fort
Lauderdale's western suburbs after five seasons in the Miami Arena.
	   Jassen Cullimore scored the Lightning's lone goal.

World Cup freestyle returns to Heavenly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ World Cup freestyle skiing will return to
the Lake Tahoe area for the first time in more than 20 years next
Jan. 22-24 with Olympic champion Jonny Moseley, who started skiing
in the Tahoe area, headlining events at Heavenly Ski Resort,
officials said Friday.
	   The announcement came at a press conference at Planet Hollywood
before the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Ball. Heavenly, which held
several Alpine World Cup races up to 1986, last staged a major
international freestyle competition in 1977.
	   ``I'm psyched about going to Heavenly and I know the athletes
are psyched about it,'' said coach Wayne Hilterbrand, whose skiers
won three Olympic gold medals. In addition to Moseley, Eric
Bergoust of Missoula, Montana and Nikki Stone of Westborough,
Massachusetts, captured the Olympic aerials titles in Nagano,
Japan.
	   ``Heavenly does a good job at holding events, and I'm sure the
World Cup will be outstanding,'' Hilterbrand said in a statement.
	   The three-competition will include acro-skiing, aerials and
moguls contests.
	   Moseley, who lives across San Francisco Bay in Tiburon,
California, began skiing at Squaw Valley in the late 1970s. Since
winning his Olympic gold medal last February and adding the World
Cup title at the end of the season, he has signed as ambassador for
the American Skiing Co., which owns Heavenly.

Telesco stops former IBF champion

<TEXT>
	   PORT CHESTER, New York (AP) _ David Telesco, the WBA North
America light heavyweight champion, registered the most impressive
victory of his career Friday night, stopping former IBF champion
Frank Tate at 48 seconds of the fourth round of their scheduled
10-round non-title fight.
	   Telesco, 176 pounds (79.2 kgs), of Port Chester, landed a hard
left jab to the head followed with a hard right and then connected
with a flurry of lefts and rights causing referee Jim Santa to
start a standing eight count.
	   Tate, 177 pounds (79.7 kgs), of Houston, stumbled during the
count and Santa ended the bout.
	   The 30-year-old Telesco improved to 20-2 with 17 knockouts.
	   The 34-year-old Tate, a 1984 Olympic gold medalist and the
current WBU champion, dropped to 41-5 with 24 knockouts. His
previous four losses, including two to Virgil Hill, had been in
world title fights.
	   In his first 10-round fight, James Butler 168 pounds (75.6 kgs)
of New York, registered a unanimous decision over Rufat Baku 170
pounds (76.5 kgs) of Baltimore.
	   Butler, a four-time New York Golden Gloves champion, won his
fifth fight of the year to raise his record to 10-1 with five
knockouts. Baku, a former Russian middleweight champion who was cut
on both eyelids, fell to 13-2-1 with seven knockouts.

Mike Tyson's psychological reports on Monday. It will be up to the
state Supreme Court, however, to decide if anyone else will get a
chance to peek into the former heavyweight champion's mind.
	   The court will rule at midday Monday on whether to limit the
release of Tyson's psychological records strictly to members of the
Nevada Athletic Commission _ just hours before the deadline set by
the commission to receive the reports.
	   Even if the court rules against Tyson, however, his advisers
have said they will submit the reports to the commission by the
deadline. If that happens, they would be released to the public.
	   ``It appears everything will be coming to a head at one time,''
Tyson lawyer Jim Jimmerson said.
	   The commission has set a 5 p.m. Monday deadline for the reports
if Tyson wants to keep an Oct. 19 hearing at which he will ask once
again to get back the boxing license stripped from him for biting
Evander Holyfield's ears.
	   Because the Oct. 19 hearing date is so important to Tyson's
advisers _ who hope to get him fighting before the end of the year
_ they have said they will submit the reports by the deadline no
matter what the Supreme Court rules.
	   ``My understanding is I'll have the stuff Monday,'' said Marc
Ratner, executive director of the commission.
	   Tyson's lawyers petitioned the Supreme Court earlier this week
for an emergency stay of a lower court's ruling that reports from a
team of psychiatrists who examined Tyson over a five-day period
last month at Massachusetts General Hospital be made public.
	   Those close to Tyson say his wife, Monica, is the driving force
behind the attempt to block the release of the records, which could
reveal some embarrassing things about the boxer.
	   A more pressing issue facing Tyson, though, figures to be the
misdemeanor assault charges filed against him in Maryland, where
lawyers for Tyson and the two men are in negotiations in an effort
to settle the case.
	   Tyson is scheduled to go on trial on the charges on the same day
as the commission hearing, and his advisers said there has been
some progress in seeking a settlement that could cause the charges
to be dropped.
	   Prosecutors in Montgomery County, Maryland said Thursday the
trial date is still on, however, despite the efforts to settle the
civil portion of the case.
	   The Oct. 19 hearing is crucial to Tyson because the former
heavyweight champion is in financial trouble and wants to begin his
comeback with a December fight in Las Vegas that could earn him
enough money to pay off a dlrs 13 million IRS lien.
	   If Tyson's relicensing is delayed even further, there would not
be enough time to put together a comeback fight by the end of the
year.

Indians rout Yankees 6-1 to take 2-1 series lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM WITHERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Jim Thome homered twice and Cleveland pounded
Andy Pettitte for four homers _ three in a 13-pitch sequence in the
fifth inning _ and Bartolo Colon pitched a four-hitter on Friday
night for a 6-1 win over the New York Yankees in Game 3 of the
American League championship series.
	   Cleveland, given little chance to stay with the powerful Yankees
before the series started and even less after New York won the
opener in a rout, is doing what many thought was impossible.
	   Manny Ramirez and Mark Whiten also homered for the defending
American League champs.
	   Meanwhile, the Yankees' storybook regular season, which included
114 wins, an AL East title and comparisons to the great teams in
baseball history, seems like ancient history.
	   Manager Joe Torre had held a pregame meeting to focus his club
after the events of Game 2, but even that didn't seem to help. And
now Dwight Gooden, one of the most popular players ever in New
York, will start Game 4 Saturday night against rookie Orlando ``El
Duque'' Hernandez with a chance to push the Yankees a little closer
to elimination.
	   Pettitte, who lost twice to Cleveland in last year's postseason,
got rocked so badly in the fifth he appeared to be on the verge of
tears as he staggered to the Yankees' dugout after the Indians were
done with him.
	   Cleveland was leading 2-1 at the time on the strength of Thome's
second-inning homer and rookie Enrique Wilson's RBI single when the
Indians started taking some in-game batting practice with two outs.
	   After Ramirez hit his fourth homer this postseason and 13th of
his career into the Yankees' bullpen, Travis Fryman walked. Thome
then skied a ball toward right that finally came down over the wall
in right.
	   Whiten, a former Yankee playing in his first playoff game this
year, followed with a liner that scattered fans on the left-field
porch and sent the 44,904 at Jacobs Field into a frenzy.
	   Chuck Knoblauch, the Game 2 goat for failing to pick up a ball
that got away on a controversial call at first base in the 12th
inning, wasted no time in putting Wednesday's events behind him.
	   He was greeted with a sarcastic standing ovation in pregame
introductions and before his at-bat in the first, but his single to
left quickly quieted the crowd. Derek Jeter sacrificed and Paul
O'Neill's groundout moved Knoblauch to third where he briefly
chatted with Fryman, whose bunt single led to Knoblauch's
12th-inning blunder. Bernie Williams then slapped a single to score
Knoblauch.
	   Colon pitched the first complete game in the ALCS since Wilson
Alvarez for the White Sox in 1993, and the first for a Cleveland
pitcher in the postseason since Bob Lemon in Game 1 of the 1954
World Series.

Pettitte's first four-homer game swings playoffs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOE KAY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Andy Pettitte looked like he wanted to jump on
one of those homers he'd just given up and ride it way out of
Jacobs Field.
	   Instead, he had to wait on his mound for a reliever and then
make the long walk back to the New York Yankees dugout, mumbling to
himself and fighting back tears after the most humbling defeat of
his career.
	   In less than five innings Friday night, in a game he absolutely
had to win to get the New York Yankees righted, Pettitte gave up
four homers for the first time in his career.
	   He also gave the Indians a whole lot of reasons to believe they
can indeed take down baseball's best team _ take 'em down and beat
'em up, too. Just like they did Pettitte.
	   Cleveland's 6-1 victory Friday night left the Indians up 2-1 in
the American League championship series against the Yankees, who
won an AL-record 114 games in the regular season.
	   The Yankees turned to Pettitte in a game they needed to win to
get back momentum after their bunt-play gaffe cost them Game 2.
Chuck Knoblauch _ mocked as a ``Block Head'' and given a standing
ovation before his first at-bat _ helped the Yankees forget about
the last game by singling and scoring to start this one.
	   Then Pettitte gave a performance he'll never forget, completing
his personal playoff trilogy of horror against Cleveland.
	   Last year, he started against Cleveland twice in the first round
and lost both games, including the Indians' Game 5 clincher, by
giving up a run per inning _ 11 in all.
	   The pace quickened Friday night, starting with Jim Thome's
second-inning shot to center that started Cleveland's homer
odometer rolling.
	   The homers came so fast in the fifth that they nearly had to cut
through the fireworks clouds left over from the previous one. In a
13-pitch sequence with two outs, the Indians hit three _ Manny
Ramirez, then Thome, then Mark Whiten, who flipped his bat away and
watched a shot find the upper corner of the left-field seats.

Another rookie comes through for Cleveland as Colon handles Yankees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN AFFLECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ A year after Jaret Wright beat New York twice
to lead Cleveland past the Yankees in the playoffs, the Indians
sent another hard-throwing rookie _ Bartolo Colon _ up against New
York in a critical situation.
	   The result was the same _ an Indians win.
	   Cleveland beat New York 6-1 Friday night to take a 2-1 lead in
the AL championship series as Colon threw a four-hitter and
dominated New York from the second inning on.
	   After giving up a single to Chuck Knoblauch on the game's second
pitch and an RBI single to Bernie Williams two batters later, Colon
handled the Yankees about as well as he did in an 11-0 shutout of
New York at Jacobs Field in June.
	   Colon pitched the first complete game in the postseason for the
Indians since Bob Lemon in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series,
striking out three and walking four. Colon gave up just two hits
after the first inning and allowed only one Yankee to advance to
second base.
	   The 23-year-old Colon was making just his second postseason
appearance. Last Saturday, he pitched well in the Indians'
series-clinching win over Boston, allowing one run in 5 2-3 innings
and getting a no-decision.

Braves turn to Maddux in time of need
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ The Atlanta Braves, acknowledged as the team of
the '90s, are in big trouble, trailing 2-0 in the National Hockey
League championship series and down to their No. 3 starter.
	   Of course, Greg Maddux isn't just any No. 3 starter. He's a
four-time Cy Young Award winner who was very good again this
season, going 18-9 with a league-leading 2.22 ERA.
	   And that has to be cause for optimism, something the Braves can
use heading into Saturday's Game 3 against the San Diego Padres.
	   The Braves have advanced to the playoffs every year since 1991
except for 1994, when there was no postseason because of the
players' strike.
	   However, they've won the World Series only once _ in 1995.
	   Time and again, they've disappointed their fans and themselves.
	   The Padres are two wins away from causing that kind of pain
again.
	   Maddux, however, said he's happy to be here, and feels no
urgency at all.
	   ``Playoffs never get old, never,'' he said. ``It just doesn't.
It's better than Christmas.
	   ``It's pride that makes you want to win. We want to win. We
don't feel like we have to win or else. There's not that sense (of
urgency) there. The organization, I don't think, makes us feel that
way.''
	   The Braves are trying to break new ground. No team has ever lost
the first two games at home and come back to win a league
championship series since the format switched to best-of-7 in 1985.
	   San Diego's Jim Leyritz knows such a comeback is possible. He
played for the 1996 New York Yankees, who lost twice to the Braves
at Yankee Stadium to start the World Series before winning the next
four games.
	   Leyritz was a postseason hero then, just as he was against
Houston in the division series last week. It was his three-run
homer off former Atlanta relief ace Mark Wohlers in the eighth
inning of Game 4 that tied the game, and the Yankees went on to an
8-6, 10-inning victory.
	   ``I think they know they have their backs to the wall a little
bit,'' Leyritz said before Padres worked out briefly Friday at
Qualcomm Stadium. ``I'm sure they're thinking, `If we can get home,
we have a chance to win this thing.'
	   ``Our goal is to get that third game. If we can do that, I like
our chances. Sometimes, it's not always the best team on paper that
wins.''
	   Braves manager Bobby Cox believes if his team is a little more
productive offensively, it will be fine.
	   ``Getting one run a night is not going to cut it too many
nights,'' he said.
	   The Braves, who won 106 games during the regular season, hit
just .172 in losing 3-2 in 10 innings and then 3-0.
	   ``We can't feel great, being down 0-2,'' Cox said. ``But we have
the type of club and pitching that can easily roll off four in a
row.''
	   The Braves must win four of the next five games to advance. And
the next three will be played on San Diego's home turf, where
capacity crowds of close to 65,000 are expected for each game.
	   Neither game in Atlanta was sold out, and dreary conditions kept
the crowds down even more.
	   Maddux will be hard-pressed to be more effective than John
Smoltz and Tom Glavine, who combined to allow three runs in 13
innings.
	   ``I thought they both pitched brilliant games,'' Cox said of
Smoltz and Glavine.
	   However, as Cox knows, San Diego's Andy Ashby and Kevin Brown
were just a little bit better.

China's Communist Party expels official for corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's Communist Party has expelled a senior
official who allegedly helped his daughters profit from illegal
land sales, state media said Saturday.
	   Yu Fei, former vice chairman of southern Guangdong province's
local parliament, was the latest senior official caught in a
five-year-old government campaign against corruption.
	   Yu is suspected of using his position to help a company operated
by his daughters rack up 28 million yuan (dlrs 3.4 million) in
profits from the allegedly illegal transfer of land-use rights, the
official Xinhua News Agency said.

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ A Costa Rican documentary producer
says he has found the remains of what could be a pre-Columbian city
of the Chibcha culture along the Nicaraguan coast.
	   Jose Cortez presented videos of his findings Friday to
Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman and the nation's media.
	   The remains consist of two igloo-shaped stone formations found
in an autonomous Caribbean zone in southern Nicaragua, near the
natural reserve of Seapaz-Indio Maiz.
	   ``The findings could constitute an important geological
formation, the outskirts of a lost city, or funeral mounds of great
importance and richness,'' Cortez said.
	   Clemente Guido, head of Nicaragua's cultural institute, said
only Nicaraguan archeologists authorized by the institute will have
access to the remains.
	   Defense Minister Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said the zone has been
cordoned off by the army to prevent plundering.
	   The Chibchas were a wandering tribe, but lived primarily in a
group of small, autocratically ruled states in the east Colombian
Andes at the time of the Spanish conquest.
	   The director of the Nicaraguan Institute of Anthropology and
History, Jorge Espinoza, told The Associated Press that Cortez may
have come upon the city of Cariay, seen by Christopher Columbus in
1502 on his fourth voyage to America.
	   In a letter to the Spanish king, Columbus described having
discovered a city, five leagues (roughly 15 miles or 25 kilometers)
from the Caribbean coast ``where Indians _ probably Chibchas _
displayed brilliant ornaments of pure gold,'' Espinoza said.

Ridge retires after test loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ New Zealand rugby league captain
Matthew Ridge announced his international retirement after
suffering an injury in Saturday night's 30-12 loss to Australia.
	   But Kiwi coach Frank Endacott said he refused to believe that
the arm injury which will keep Ridge out of the third test next
week and the subsequent tour of Britain will end his representative
career altogether.
	   Ridge, who has played 25 test matches, ripped his biceps muscle
off its attachment when trying to tackle Australian winger Tim
Brasher.
	   ``I think that's probably my last game for New Zealand,'' Ridge
said. ``I've been thinking about it a bit and this injury just
makes it a little bit easier.''
	   Ridge, 30, said family commitments and a desire to quit before
he burns out were his motivation.
	   While Ridge had given the matter some consideration and seemed
sure of himself, Endacott thought he was being hasty.
	   ``I'll let the emotion get out of the way and then I'll talk to
Matthew next week,'' Endacott said. ``When Matthew Ridge says
something he usually means it, but I'll wait for him to tell me
again in another week, then I'll believe him.''
	   Endacott said he would work on Ridge over the next week to
convince him to change his mind.
	   ``He still has too much to offer to the game to just give it
away _ I'm not letting him get away that easily.''
	   Ridge, a former All Blacks rugby union international, said he
felt worn out by his commitment to league. He is also at the center
of a dispute at his club Auckland, which has been bought by new
owners.
