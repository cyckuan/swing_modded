   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers' head coaching wish list lost a
charter member Tuesday night when Mike Fratello, presumed by some
to be the lead suspect, said he no longer is a contender.
</P>
<P>
   On TNT's New York Knicks vs. Indiana Pacers pre-game show from
Indianapolis, Fratello was asked about his status vis--vis the
Clippers job.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted there have been phone discussions with team
representatives,'' but quickly added, ``I won't be involved with
the Clippers. That's not going to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   With Fratello down - one team source said the ``Czar of the
Telestrator'' never was a serious possibility - the next name in
line is that of former Georgetown University coach John Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement released by the team, an exploratory
meeting between the Clippers and Thompson regarding the vacant
head-coaching position was held Tuesday. No other information was
available.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who coached Patrick Ewing and the Hoyas to the NCAA
Championship in 1984, has been a friend of Elgin Baylor, the Clips'
vice president of basketball operations, since they were kids
growing up in Washington, D.C.

   BINT JBAIL, Lebanon _ Draped with bandoliers, Shiite Muslim
guerrillas reclaimed the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon
on Tuesday, and as they giddily rode abandoned Israeli tanks
through village after village, they laid waste to Israel's plan for
an orderly, scheduled withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks before the Israelis planned to shut down the military
buffer zone they controlled along the border, the Lebanese
guerrillas accelerated their enemy's departure. By day's end,
Israel held only Beaufort Castle, on a bluff in Lebanon overlooking
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   (Before dawn Wednesday, the Israelis abandoned that and all of
their outposts in Lebanon, and were bringing home their last
troops, Israeli military officials said. Shortly after sunrise, the
last tank rumbled across the frontier behind a column of armored
vehicles, and the border fence was locked.)
</P>
<P>
   With the troops leaving, Israel's occupation of a swath of
Lebanon, maintained since 1978, was ending in a far quicker and
more improvisational way than anyone predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one headline in Lebanon tonight,'' a broadly
smiling anchorwoman said on the official state television channel.
``The liberation of the land. The slinking, servile withdrawal by
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, has protested assertions
by the Hezbollah, or Party of God, guerrillas that Israel was being
chased out. He made a campaign pledge last year, he said
repeatedly, to end Israel's ``misguided'' involvement in Lebanon,
which has divided and troubled Israelis from the start.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday in Jerusalem, Barak declared an end to the ``18-year
tragedy'' dating from Israel's large-scale invasion of Lebanon in
1982, and his government declared that it has regained the
initiative in the halting Middle East peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Israel said that from now on it would hold the governments in
Beirut and Damascus, Syria, responsible for any attacks on northern
Israel from Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
   But Lebanon, flashing a nationwide victory sign, would have none
of that sort of talk on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   All day long, traveling with Hezbollah into the land so long
held by its Israeli enemies, a celebratory procession grew as it
wound its way from west to east through the rugged countryside. By
the road, elderly Lebanese women ululated and sprinkled the cars
with rose petals and rice as if at a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Flashing V's and waving the yellow flags of their Iranian-backed
Hezbollah movement, the guerrillas trailed a miles-long parade of
supporters, including villagers returning to the south for the
first time in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when birds fly out of a cage?'' said Abu Jaffa, 26, a
Hezbollah officer. ``That's how we feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Like sports announcers, local radio reporters gave a village by
village account of the ``liberation'' of the nine-mile-deep zone
over the course of the day. ``Yarun is now liberated,'' one said on
Tuesday morning, ``and I'm looking over into occupied Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel accelerated the disintegration of its control over the
zone by pulling out its troops and equipment in stages and turning
over many posts to the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army. But town
by town, the Israeli-backed militia soldiers caved in to local
pressure. And those who did not seek to cross over into Israel
turned themselves over to local Hezbollah leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The tumble of events began last Thursday when the South Lebanese
Army deserted a small village. It picked up steam on Sunday, when
the militia left behind a more significant post. And then it
snowballed, catching everyone by surprise, including Lebanese
journalists who scrambled to set up television links in this
central town so that they could record the event that most had been
waiting a career to capture.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday night, about 620 of the 2,000-strong South Lebanese
Army militia had ``defected,'' according to Lebanese officials.
Many face charges of treason. Although it was made public that the
Lebanese army was now detaining them, no mention was made of where
or of what might become of them.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Israel planned to blow up its posts before
completing the withdrawal, as it had done in the village of Jezzin,
abandoned last year. But the situation changed before they could
carry out their plans. In at least one instance on Tuesday, the SLA
soldiers disappeared so quickly that they left tanks with their
motors running and rice cooking on the stove.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah fighters quickly foraged through the deserted posts,
stocking up on Israeli rocket launchers, ammunition and gear before
Israel had a chance to do anything about it. In some cases,
Hezbollah fighters squabbled over the Hebrew-inscribed equipment
with members of Amal, another resistance group.
</P>
<P>
   As a honking convoy of newly captured Israeli tanks headed to
Bint Jbail in the zone's center. Israeli helicopters began buzzing
overhead. Soon, they were bombarding some of their own abandoned
posts. and the raids briefly detained the sweep through the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   One man, Abed Taqoush, 50, died in the bombing. He was a veteran
taxi driver for the foreign press who helped reporters from around
the world cover the conflict in Lebanon for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   As it resumed, the convoy converted a narrow road into a traffic
jam directed by gun-toting Hezbollah crossing guards. The Hezbollah
fighters, who kept a low profile in Lebanon as they fought the
Israelis, launching mortar attacks from citrus groves, surfaced
spontaneously and talked relatively freely.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``They have run in the end,`` said one youth who gave his name
as Jawad, speaking of the Israelis. ``We always knew they would,
but no one would have guessed it could happen so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the battle was over, the young men said that that
decision was up to Hezbollah's secretary general, Sheik Hassan
Nasrallah. ``Our purpose is to be told what to do,'' another said.
``If Nasrallah says the fight is on, it's on. And if it's off, it's
off.'' His fellow fighter, however, noted that they had gotten as
far as they had because ``Jerusalem twinkles in our eyes'' _ a
comment that would chill many Israelis to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, the southern zone was off-limits to most
Lebanese. Starting mid-morning, Lebanese army officers opened the
tightly controlled checkpoints and packed cars began rolling past
the gates that have divided the country.
</P>
<P>
   Many cars contained fighters for the Hezbollah movement and its
true believers, like Hala Smayel and a gaggle of young women
friends, who alternated jumping up and down with yelling
``Nasrallah forever.'' They dragged out his name into four
syllables, so that it sounded like `Nasser-Allah,'' a play on words
since nasser means victory and Allah is God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going village and village to give congratulations,''
Smayel said. ``Hezbollah was able to bring the most important
military force in the Middle East to its knees. Every drop of blood
from the martyrs will grow into a child and this child will grow in
an adult and this adult will fight Israel and become another
martyr.''
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, villagers had stormed the Khiam prison, which
was run by the Israeli-backed militia and renowned internationally
for alleged human rights abuses. The militia guards had already run
away, turning the prisoners over to the International Red Cross,
and the villagers accompanied them out the gates and back into
Lebanese life.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said they were surprised that the day went as
peacefully as it did. They attributed that partly to the advance
work of Hezbollah and Amal leaders who had been spending time in
Christian communities in the south, trying to convince them that
they all should stand together, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese political leaders said that the military battle would
now become a diplomatic one. They said that they would fight for an
Israeli pullout from the Shebaa Farms area at the foot of the Golan
Heights, even though the United Nations said this week that it
would certify the withdrawal as complete without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever difficulties happen in life, after every one there is
a catharsis, a joyous moment of release,'' Foda Ramadan, a
returning villager, said on Tuesday. ``And then there are new
difficulties.''

KNICKS MEET THEIR MATCH IN PACERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ With seven minutes left, Patrick Ewing wheeled
into the lane and, with the shot clock running down, positioned
himself to take an 8-foot jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Knicks were in desperate need of points, having
falling behind by 11 to the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 of the Eastern
Conference finals. They did not look worn down from their annual
apocalyptic series against Miami as much as they looked befuddled
by an offensive machine, a skilled team capable of putting up 100
points, easy.
</P>
<P>
   So Ewing, New York's most effective option with the
7-foot-4-inch Rik Smits on the bench in foul trouble, rose for that
shot with every intention to make it a game. Dale Davis rose, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana power forward leaped so high, he met Ewing's shot at
its apex _ and sent it back to the floor along with the Knicks'
aspirations for another improbable victory in enemy territory.
Austin Croshere provided the fireworks on the offensive end.
</P>
<P>
   A loud mob in the heartland whooped and hollered, the people of
Conseco Fieldhouse standing and applauding their small-market
heroes, who had taken care of Ewing and his rowdy playground gang,
102-88.
</P>
<P>
   Terre Haute and French Lick would sleep well on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Van Gundy? He has a few problems.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight hours after taking Game 7 from the Heat, the Knicks
were essentially done in by two significant Pacer runs.
</P>
<P>
   The first came in the first quarter, a 35-17 binge that forced
the Knicks to play catch-up from then on.
</P>
<P>
   The second was even more costly. They crept to within 2 at 68-66
in the third quarter and were then pounded in the fourth. Reggie
Miller, spotting up. Jalen Rose, knifing through the lane. And
Davis, putting a body on Ewing, doing anything he could to stop the
Big Fella from having a huge game.
</P>
<P>
   Given the travel and time to prepare, the Knicks recovered from
what could have been a devastating blowout. Still, several matchups
went Indiana's way, and if that trend continues, New York is
looking at an 0-2 hole on Saturday at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   They have to guard Croshere as if he were Miller, because he
absolutely killed them from beyond the arc. He finished with 22
points and made 4 of 5 3-pointers, consistently taking a kick-out
pass and burying long jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pick-and-roll coverage hurt us,'' Chris Childs said. ``You
can't double-team Mark Jackson and not rotate to Croshere. He's too
good. When he started coming off screens, we didn't stay with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Knicks were blaming their first-quarter collapse on
malaise. They didn't seem to realize they have another rival on
their hands, intent on extracting revenge for last year's upset in
the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't into that game,'' Latrell Sprewell said. ``Although
we almost got all the way back, we expended so much energy getting
there we didn't have anything left. We didn't have that fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell can excuse himself from that description. He ended with
22 points and matched Miller's long, cold stares with several of
his own. Their grade-school show of bravado began in the second
quarter, when Miller knocked down a 3-pointer over Sprewell and
kept looking at him, until Sprewell responded with his own stare.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was more than a little miffed by Miller's gum-flapping
before the series, especially the part about the Knicks not
respecting the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't particularly care for him, but hey, it's not about
Reggie,'' Sprewell said. ``Bottom line, he's a good player and I
respect him as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell threw down a hard dunk in traffic over the Pacers with
2 minutes 42 seconds left in the third quarter. He looked at Miller
for several seconds afterward, enough time for Rose, his man, to
sneak downcourt for a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a crucial basket, but it was indicative of how the
Knicks forgot to prioritize.
</P>
<P>
   Outplayed by Jamal Mashburn early in the Miami series, Sprewell
responded in the final two games. He and Ewing kept the Knicks in
the game on Tuesday night. For the first two quarters, he kept Rose
scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be on my shoulders somewhat to try to contain
him,'' he said before the game. ``Jalen is inside, outside. He can
post you, he can sit out there on the 3. He can face you. I should
be able to stay in front of him. But he has a spin move. He's very
good at going one way and spinning the other way, sort of like
Jamal does. So I'm going to have to slide my feet very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The two are friends, who met in 1993 through their mutual
friend, Chris Webber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care that we're friends, I'm still going hard,''
Sprewell said. ``I respect him and we're friends. But this is
business. All of that's out the door now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is too bad some of the other Knicks did not have that
disposition in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``They outplayed us,'' Childs said. ``We were on our heels. We
gave them everything and took away nothing. &QL;

NO LAUGHING MATTER FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. - If the video montage of Monday night's
third-quarter collapse wasn't enough to stir the Lakers' misplaced
passions, then perhaps one ingrained memory from the game's closing
minutes will serve the purpose as they recover from their worst
loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Blow-by-blow footage of the Portland Trail Blazers' 20-0 run was
replayed during Tuesday's film session, and the technical glitches
were highlighted by coach Phil Jackson. But Jackson wants his
players to remember the way the 106-77 rout ended - with the
Blazers yukking it up on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first big loss the Lakers have suffered in these
playoffs, just the most damaging. Even when the Lakers got
dismantled by Sacramento and Phoenix, they always had the security
of knowing they just had to win all their home games (and they
did).
</P>
<P>
   Now they can't even say that, having lost home-court advantage,
the Western Conference finals now tied 1-1. A loss in Friday's Game
3 at Portland would put them in a deficit for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has reacted well to adversity, I have to give them
credit for that,'' Jackson said Tuesday. ``This is a different
situation, this type of adversity that you have in a series. What
we remember is the attitude that Portland carried off the floor
yesterday. They were kind of jackals down there on the bench, and
we have to remember that when we go back up to Portland, that they
might have been just a little too much so.''
</P>
<P>
   So there's the emotional appeal. The rest is textbook
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have to devise a plan to get Shaquille O'Neal (23
points) the ball with room to work. Same goes for Kobe Bryant (12
points). And when all else fails, they need their role players to
make open jump shots, a key ingredient in their Game 1 win and a
glaring weakness in their Game 2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a matter of turning down shots, it was just we were
taking shots that weren't comfortable for us to take,'' reserve
guard Brian Shaw said. ``We'd bring the ball down and stop around
the 3-point line, they'd sink in Shaq's lap, and then it'd be like,
OK, I'm going to settle for this shot instead of swinging it to the
other side, moving their defense and then trying to punch it in. Or
taking that same shot later in the shot clock.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the offensive ``desperation'' Jackson referred to
Monday night. It was a direct product of the Lakers' lack of
production from O'Neal and Bryant. With lanky forwards Scottie
Pippen and Rasheed Wallace free to roam, the Blazers crowded the
Lakers' two top scorers like no other team has.
</P>
<P>
   When the ball did get dished off, no one could find the net.
Rice went 3 for 9, Robert Horry 1 for 5, Derek Fisher 1 for 4 and
Shaw 2 for 6. The Lakers' 3-point accuracy dropped from 9 of 19 in
Game 1 to 6 of 23 in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their rotation on the defensive end was much quicker than (in
Game 1),'' Glen Rice said. ``They were very attentive, they
realized that in order for them to beat us when they do double down
on Shaq or Kobe, they've got to really get out on the wings and
stop the guys from shooting the jumpers. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You've just got to keep moving the ball,'' Rice said. ``You
keep them on defense as long as you can to try and wear them down a
little bit. Hopefully, you'll get an opening in there and once you
get that opening, you gotta take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep the Blazers' forwards from roaming, the Lakers will need
better production from Ron Harper (guarded by Pippen) and A.C.
Green and Horry (guarded by Wallace). Harper went 2 for 6 and
played just 15 minutes. Green went 3 for 5 but was a defensive
liability against Wallace and logged only 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A.C. did a great job the first quarter,'' Jackson said, ``and
I think it stymied them. And we got the momentum and we actually
went into that quarter in good stead. Robert didn't have a good
shooting game and those things happen some nights, and we just have
to play it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers will have three days to fix everything. And three
days to ponder how they could suffer a 29-point rout in their own
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just move on,'' Bryant said. ``We're professional
athletes, so it's very easy to focus on the next game. In this type
of situation, you have to. It's playoff basketball. No matter if
you lose by 1 or 20, it's still 1-1 (in the series). ... It's all
about challenges in this game. If this game didn't present any type
of challenge, I wouldn't play. It makes it more fun.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
The Astros knew, or should have known, that their starting pitching
would not be as strong this year as it was last year. They had to
expect some tough outings; no surprise there.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And even with a potent lineup, all hitters endure slumps during
a six-month season. So an off night or two at the plate for Jeff
Bagwell and Co. comes as no surprise, either.
</P>
<P>
   Put those two together with more frequency than predicted, and
you have a 16-28 start.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing no one could have expected, and the Astros
certainly did not factor into their plans, was inconsistency from
closer Billy Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, one of the most feared relievers in baseball, already
has four blown saves in eight opportunities after blowing just
three saves the entire 1999 season (in 42 opportunities).
</P>
<P>
   Wagner is supposed to be The Man the Astros' Superman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a point in every pitcher's career when you go through
that,'' Wagner said. ``It kind of puts everything back into
perspective to know that you're human.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wagner has gone about his business proving he's no mere
mortal. In his career, he has converted 101 of 119 save
opportunities (85 percent) while averaging a dominant 14.1
strikeouts per nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this point, Wagner had 12 saves in 13 tries with a
1-1 record. He had 34 strikeouts in 18 innings and had allowed just
nine hits (two home runs) and served up six walks. The Astros'
record: 28-16.
</P>
<P>
   While Wagner's walks are not notably higher _ eight in 19
innings _ his strikeout count is substantially lower (23).
</P>
<P>
   But Wagner insists the ``panic theories'' he has heard are off
base. His fastball is just as fast _ and it moves _ and his slider
still slides. He is doing nothing different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was just a special year,'' he said. ``You can't
expect to match that every year. The hitters are taking shorter
swings than they used to, and they are getting a piece of the ball.
Flares here, bloops there singles hurt me more than home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I feel good when I go to the mound. And when I go to
(catcher Tony) Eusebio, someone who should know, he tells me he
sees no difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker said about the only slight difference he
can point to is pitch location, but he doesn't see that as a major
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the problem for the most part has been inconsistent
work,'' Dierker said. ``We haven't had enough leads, so he hasn't
been in there two days in a row, then take a day off, then (pitch)
another day, then (take) another day off. So his control has not
been as good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year what really vaulted him from just a strikeout
pitcher to the Fireman of the Year was he could put his fastball on
the corner any time he wanted to, and he has not been able to do
that this year. He'll do that when we start giving him more leads
and he gets more consistent work.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker has a point.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner got the save in the Astros' opening-day win over
Pittsburgh on April 4, picked up a save in a win over Philadelphia
on April 8, then followed with another as the Astros topped St.
Louis on April 12.
</P>
<P>
   But it was nine games and 11 days before Wagner got another save
opportunity, which he blew against San Diego. Another nine games
and 11 days went by before Wagner was sent to the mound again with
a game on the line; this time he came through, retiring four
consecutive Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   More than a week later, Wagner was unsuccessful in back-to-back
save opportunities against the Reds at Enron Field as he gave up
three runs in 2 innings in a pair of crushing losses.
</P>
<P>
   His most recent blown save may have been the most disappointing,
when he was part of a seven-run collapse in the ninth inning of
Monday's first-game loss at Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker's theory is that the team has not been in enough winning
situations for Wagner to get into rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``That plays a part, but I don't want to use that as an
excuse,'' Wagner said. ``Whenever you get a save opportunity, you
need to go out there and do your job. I just think it's sort of
that my team's struggling and we're all just falling into that
trap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking to some of the older players, they've heard about it.
It's not an easy thing to go through. You just have to continue to
go out and play hard, do the best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the season, Wagner figured he would have a battle with
elbow problems that plagued him at the end of last year. But he
says his left arm feels fine, and that's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   There is no injury to point to, just a run of tough luck _ for
him and the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``During spring training and the first two weeks of the season
it was tender, but now I'm just as healthy as ever,'' he said. ``I
feel good. It's kind of strange. I feel like I'm throwing the ball
where I want it. The velocity is good; everything seems to be
there. I just seem to catch enough of their bats for them to hurt
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (the problem) is physical, there's nothing you can do
about it. When it's just the luck of the draw, you just have to
battle through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said, ``I don't think he's worried about his elbow
anymore; now he's worried about his pitching. While I don't think
he's done his best, and that's obvious, I do think he will come
back and pitch as well as he has in the past.
</P>
<P>
   `` We need to present him with enough leads to where he can
think more about making pitches than about how bad the team needs
the win.''

NO PANIC SHOWN BY JACKSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. - All was eerily quiet on the purple-and-gold
front Tuesday. Indeed, the media assembled in an undersized holding
pen at the Lakers' practice facility sweated more than the players
did.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson did not have his disciples practicing at the
crack of dawn as a kind of penance for their laggard play the night
before in a 29-point loss to the Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   He did not have Robert Horry taking liquid calories
intravenously, the better to bulk up so he can bang bodies with
Rasheed Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson did not order A.C. Green to run laps until he had shed
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   He did not make Shaquille O'Neal sit in the lotus position,
chanting until his body was frustration-free.
</P>
<P>
   As befits a man who reported to work wearing Birkenstock
sandals, Jackson trod airily around the Lakers' 106-77 loss in Game
2 of their Western Conference finals against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   He chose to ignore the panic and doubt gathering like wolves at
the door of the Lakers' sanctuary. Twenty-four hours after the
Trail Blazers had insolently defiled the Lakers' championship
veneer like garden-variety taggers, Jackson didn't try to whitewash
the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he try to soothe his wounded pride by riding his players
extra hard. Those were Birkenstocks on his feet, remember, not
spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson made his players watch the videotape of their Game 2
fiasco, frame by merciless frame, and then he said, ``The
(best-of-seven) series is 1-1. Deal with it. Suck it up.``
</P>
<P>
   And that was that. No game plans were shredded or gangplanks
erected. Jackson did not throw out the season with the rubbish that
was Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   For $6 million, the Lakers hired a skipper who doesn't stray off
course after one squall. Jackson didn't win six NBA championship
rings with the Bulls by vacillating like a sports radio talk-show
host.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't guide the Lakers to the best regular-season mark in
his first year with the organization by pointing one of his
bedecked digits in the air to gauge which way momentum was blowing.
</P>
<P>
   At other times this season, the Lakers have been able to
navigate so the stiff wind in their faces was suddenly at their
backs. Remember the 24-point loss at San Antonio on Feb. 1? That
stood as their worst loss of the season, until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson didn't do anything drastic and the Lakers rebounded to
win their next 19.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the 13-point loss at Sacramento in Game 4 during
the first round of the playoffs. Jackson didn't demote starter
Green after he had zero points and only one rebound to show for 26
minutes and Green came back with 10 points and six rebounds in a
113-86 win in the deciding Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   And who can forget the 19-point loss at Phoenix in Game 4 during
the second round? Jackson stayed the course and the next game the
Lakers bloodlessly eliminated the Suns 87-65.
</P>
<P>
   After losing their home-court advantage to the Trail Blazers,
the Lakers are in danger of falling behind in a series for the
first time in the postseason. They have to play their next two
games in Portland, knowing full well they are 1-3 on the road in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   It's not nirvana but it's also a little too soon to be singing
``Happy Trails'' to the Lakers. Under Jackson, the team has been
nothing if not resilient. And still, everywhere he went Tuesday,
Kobe Bryant heard shades of Gene Autry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose one game, it's like Armageddon,'' Bryant said, not
bothering to hide his bemusement. ``I'm waiting for Bruce Willis to
walk in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   We'd be really surprised if the Lakers didn't bounce back from
their terrible Game 2 to win one of the next two games in Portland,
starting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Then the series will turn into a double-elimination duel, like
everyone was saying it would until the Lakers won Game 1 by 15
points and short-circuited everybody's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole atmosphere at (Staples Center) before Monday's game
was like people had come expecting to see a crucifixion,'' said
forward Rick Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Little did anybody know it would be the Lakers' backs that were
nailed to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal picked up three fouls early and wasn't sent to the free-
throw line as often as he felt was deserved. Pretty soon his
composure was punctured and it was like all the air left his
Superman pecs.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates took quick shots and in doing so turned the
triangle offense into something in need of triage.
</P>
<P>
   And dare we say a sundial rotates faster than the Lakers did on
defense?
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't pretty but Jackson will smooth out the wrinkles and
apply some rouge and make the Lakers glow again. It's his job. He's
essentially a make-up artist, one who is paid handsomely to conceal
the Lakers' blemishes by playing up their best features.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is measuring out how much energy guys have at this
particular time of the year,'' Jackson said. ``Players are under
duress. They've been playing basketball for nine months.
Physically, how much do they have left to give in practice, how
much do they have left to give out on the floor in a game? That's
what you have to measure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting them prepared to be quick to the ball or active or
physically feeling good about themselves so they feel like they're
attuned with each other,'' Jackson said, ``is part of my job.''
</P>
<P>
   It says here it's what he does best.

SPORTS COLUMN: THESE PACERS COULD SCORE WITH NIELSEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ IT took one early play _ Mark Jackson passing in
the lane between his legs to Jalen Rose and Rose throwing outside
to Austin Croshere for 3 _ to remind us how expressive and joyful
this sport can be. It took one game to remember that basketball
with offense can still be fierce, and how much the National
Basketball Association owes the New York Knicks for saving it from
more Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when no one could have blamed the bedraggled Knicks
for waiting until Friday to compete, it took one electric
second-quarter run for them to let the Pacers know they too have
some weaponry to unload. After nearly climbing out of a 19-point
hole, the Knicks faded and lost Game 1 of the Eastern Conference
finals, 102-88. Don't worry, the Pacers know they are in for a
long, draining series _ ``a dogfight,'' said Reggie Miller _ and
one that will be infinitely easier on the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It did get a tad pontifical during the last few days of the
Knicks-Heat war, with those proclamations of its being the most
hotly contested basketball since the invention of the ball. Though
his expression didn't change, you could hear the snicker in Larry
Bird's voice on Tuesday when he said, ``I can remember some pretty
tough series that I played in, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness there can still be a team that embodies Bird's
creative soul. Mixing Rose and Croshere into the old, familiar
Pacers' equation was too much for the Knicks in Game 1, with the
court spread, the driving lanes open, the 3-pointers flying, with
10 connecting, with a half-dozen Pacers in double figures, with the
eye-opening total of 32 assists.
</P>
<P>
   If you are David Stern, you like this team and are not worried
about losing the New York market in the next round. If you are
Stern, whom would you rather market to America next month _ Bird,
possibly in Los Angeles against his most celebrated playing
opponent, or Jeff Van Gundy? The Hall of Famer who is about to ride
off into the sunset or the unglamorous lifer who drove a Honda to
work before it became a compacted movie prop in The Charter That
Ate The Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people aren't going to see Larry Bird playing when they
tune in,'' Jackson said, trying to debunk my inverted conspiracy
theory. The New Yorker in him still can't forget the Larry Johnson
4-point nonsense of last spring, and worries what the league may be
cooking up.
</P>
<P>
   New York is the preferred television market but the Pacers have
this beautiful Conseco Fieldhouse, with its heartland history and
cozy charm. They have Reggie, the 200-pound nerd who slips into a
phone booth and transforms himself into the playoff assassin. They
have a power forward named Dale and the center who looks as if they
lifted him from one of the trophy cases with the 1950s memorabilia.
Now they have the Sprewell-like Rose and this brash big kid,
Croshere, who leaped off the bench and capped a 35-point first
quarter with a circus shot and then lit up the perimeter the rest
of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling him that Camby was their X factor last year and
that he's going to have to do something this year,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Vast tracks of middle America can relate to these Pacers as the
mom and pop shop who have been shut down four times now in the
conference final by the well-heeled superstore, by a young brute
named Shaq and big-market bullies from Chicago and New York. After
the Knicks left them earthbound and broken last spring, they traded
the rugged Antonio Davis for a high school kid who collects his
allowance and sits on the bench, but they somehow have emerged _
take note, Coach Riley _ as a more versatile team.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were just better last year, and Van Gundy out-coached
Bird. Less than a great bench coach, Bird has nonetheless been a
strong leader, the perfect image-shaper for his home state team as
it built this unique arena that should help keep the franchise
humming against the big-market odds.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, Bird says this is it, three years and out. And if
the Lakers do survive Portland and the Pacers make it out to Los
Angeles next month, rest assured that Stern will be happy to live
with the Pacers in the finals, with a posed shot of Bird and Magic,
now a minority Lakers' owner, to beam around his global empire.
</P>
<P>
   It has never been a reach to think that an official might
subconsciously be influenced by his own perception of what's good
for the league. But that's where the conspiracy conversation should
begin and end. The Pacers have nothing to worry about if they
continue playing the way they did on Tuesday night, and neither
does Stern.

 CRITICS SAY GOP TACTICS HOLDING UP S.F. LAWYER'S JUDGESHIP  &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Not a whiff of controversy arose when
environmental lawyer Barry Goode was nominated in June 1998 to the
federal appeals court in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But two years later, Goode's judgeship has gone nowhere. Though
not a single objection has been raised, his name has not budged
from the Senate Judiciary Committee. He has not been confirmed or
even had a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the San Francisco lawyer is victim to some of the
most bitter political infighting to have gripped Washington in
years.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to take over the White House next year, Republicans,
critics say, have staged a slowdown in confirming the Clinton
administration's judicial nominations in order to run out the clock
on President Clinton's final year in office.
</P>
<P>
   There was a temporary break in the logjam Tuesday. Senate
leaders struck a deal in which the Republicans agreed to clear 16
of Clinton's judicial nominees, and Democrats, in turn, will vote
on a Republican-backed nominee to the Federal Election Commission.
The vote is expected Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Goode, like many other judicial hopefuls, remains caught in
political limbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still way behind in terms of historic rates of
confirmation, even in the final year of a presidency,'' said Sam
Chapman, chief of staff for Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the Senate has confirmed only seven nominees,
while 80 judgeships are still vacant, including 46 before the
Senate or its Judiciary Committee. Typically, the Senate approves
at least 40 federal judges a year. Democrats as well as Bay Area
attorneys are furious over the tactic and have promised to push
through the nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're frustrated and upset,'' said Michael Kahn, a San
Francisco lawyer and a friend of Goode's. Earlier this month, Kahn
helped draft a letter signed by more than 100 California lawyers _
Democrats and Republicans _ calling on members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee to move on Goode's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a Judiciary
Committee member who has tried to block previous appointments to
the federal appeals court in San Francisco, denied that there was
any deliberate attempt to stall the nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just politics,'' said John Cox, press secretary for
Sessions. The Democrats ``are trying to paint the Republicans as
inactive. It's untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he admitted that he was surprised that Goode's
nomination had been held up for two years, and he did not know the
reason behind it.
</P>
<P>
   While other nominees to the federal Court of Appeal in San
Francisco have come under fire from Republicans for their liberal
politics, their ties to the ACLU or their support of affirmative
action, there has been no such grumbling over Goode, a veteran
lawyer who is known to defend corporations in environmental
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Both plaintiff and defense lawyers refer to Goode as a bright,
honest man who would make an excellent judge. And except for
supporting Clinton in his 1991 presidential run, Goode is
considered apolitical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not heard that Republicans in the Senate oppose him
for any substantive reasons,'' said Chapman. ``With Barry Goode,
there's nothing to point to.''
</P>
<P>
   Political infighting in the nation's capital is not the only
roadblock to Goode's confirmation. He also has been caught up in
the controversy over the federal Court of Appeals in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several years, there have been as many as 10
vacancies on the 28-member court. There are now four vacancies,
with nominees awaiting confirmation. But none waited for more than
a year _ except for Goode.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, Democrats have lashed out at
Republicans over the slowdown in confirming federal judges.
Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont noted that prior
Congresses have had no problem confirming federal judges during the
final year of an administration occupied by an opposing party. In
1992, the Democrat-controlled Senate confirmed 66 of President
Bush's nominees, and in 1988 it confirmed 42 of President Reagan's.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's breakthrough agreement came after a series of angry
exchanges between the two parties. In addition to the judicial
candidates now cleared, it paves the way for 48 White House
nominees to the State Department and Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   But the pact will not guarantee safe passage for other nominees,
including Goode. Last week, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
outraged by what he declared were attacks on his stewardship,
warned he would not allow another judicial nominee through unless
Democrats acted on spending bills now pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this batch is moved, if they don't cooperate with us on
these appropriations bills, they are not going to get another
judge. Period,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Tuesday that he
was pleased to get the 16 judicial nominees through the Senate. He
vowed to use ``whatever forceful means required to continue to keep
up the pressure to resolve the remaining nominees.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; `Pending in Committee'
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Lopatto, press secretary for the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said she could not comment on Goode's nomination except
to say it is ``pending in committee.''
</P>
<P>
   But she bristled at criticism of the committee, noting that the
members had approved 10 nominees in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving those who are qualified and who understand the
proper role of a judge,'' she said. But if someone is a ``judicial
activist,'' or for some reason unqualified ``that nominee will not
and should not have the support of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Goode was cautious about commenting on his predicament, except
to say he was honored by the letter of support from colleagues and
respected the careful way the Senate evaluates nominees. ``I am
hoping that the process brings my nomination forward at some
point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; 26 Years at Law Firm
</P>
<P>
   Goode, 52, is a Democrat who has spent his entire 26-year career
as a lawyer at McCutchen, Doyle, Brown &AMP; Enersen, one of San
Francisco's largest law firms. He represents primarily
manufacturers and trade organizations.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest case was representing Rohr Industries, a
manufacturing company that was a defendant in a huge toxic waste
lawsuit involving the Stringfellow dump in Riverside County.
</P>
<P>
   Some have speculated that part of Goode's problem is that there
is nothing controversial about him. ``If there was a point of
controversy, we could have identified it and addressed it,'' Kahn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Goode has been in a state of limbo, doing his day job
and spending his off-hours glad-handing influential lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really had two jobs, and it's been very hard on him and
his family,'' said James Hunt, chairman of McCutchen.
</P>
<P>
   Friends say Goode has no hidden agenda _ he wants to be a
federal judge out of a sense of public duty. It certainly isn't for
the money. If he gets appointed, Goode will take a sizable cut in
pay. Federal judges make $149,900 a year, the salary some firms are
paying a lawyer fresh out of law school.

COOPER LEADS ANGELS PAST TWINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS -- Brian Cooper arrived in the Angels clubhouse at
the Metrodome Tuesday afternoon and hadn't even unpacked his duffel
bag yet when greeted by manager Mike Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia took one look at Cooper's jet-black hair, a sharp
contrast to the light-brown hair he had in spring training, and
snapped: ``Who the heck are you? And what did you do with Cooper?''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia might have said the same thing after the game, a 7-4
Angels victory over the Minnesota Twins before a sparse crowd of
9,032. After all, the Cooper Scioscia watched Tuesday wasn't the
same pitcher Scioscia saw in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper struggled most of the spring and failed to win a spot in
the starting rotation. He took it with him to Triple-A Edmonton,
where he lost his first three starts. But because of injuries and
illness to the pitching staff, and a return to the form that made
him a candidate for the rotation in the first place, Cooper was
called up and made his first start with the big club Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He earned the win after giving up four runs and five hits in six
innings, and attributed his newfound success to the hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struggling, I had to do something,'' joked Cooper, one
of a few Edmonton pitchers to dye their hair. ``New clothes, a new
hairdo, mix it up. That's the key right there. I'm 3-0 with this
hair. ... As long as I keep winning, it's staying black.''
</P>
<P>
   And it certainly didn't hurt that the Angels got out to an early
lead, scoring all seven runs in the first four innings, including
four in the first inning. They jumped on Twins starter Joe Mays
(1-6), getting a two-run single by Tim Salmon and bases-loaded
walks from Scott Spiezio and Bengie Molina for a 4-0 lead in the
first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn (No. 16) and Darin Erstad (No. 7) hit solo homers, and
Garret Anderson had an RBI double. It was a change of pace from the
last homestand, when the Angels had to come from behind late in
games to have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling the guys, 'Let's have a nice day today,' '' said
Vaughn, whose home run reached the fourth row of the upper deck in
right field. ``We got on 'em early. We need to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cooper worked out of a first-inning jam and held the
Twins scoreless until David Ortiz's two-out, two-run double in the
fourth. Cooper also allowed a two-run homer to Brian Buchanan in
the sixth. But that was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Edmonton pitching coach) Greg Minton got me back on track,''
Cooper said. ``I was struggling at the beginning of the year and I
couldn't find anything. I couldn't even throw strikes in the
bullpen. He worked hard with me and revamped my windup. I just got
back to the basics and it really paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought his arm action was great, he was free and easy, the
ball was coming out of his hand better, I liked everything about
him,'' Scioscia said. ``He got a little sloppy in the the last
couple of innings. But he was sharp with his off-speed stuff and he
sunk the ball well. And this is coming off four good starts at
Edmonton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will need another starter for Friday's game, and
there's a good chance they'll go to Edmonton again to find him.
Seth Etherton, who attended USC like Cooper, is a candidate to make
the start against the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the situation with the starting pitching -- we got
guys hurt,'' Vaughn said. ``The main thing is the guys that are
coming up, they've got to do a job. It's not like we can lay down
or look back. We've got to look in front of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``This division, no one's going to run away with it. These guys
have got to do their job. It's definitely encouraging with a guy
like Cooper pitching like he pitched. He took care of the lead and
was aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper got relief help from Mike Holtz (1 1/3 innings),
Shigetoshi Hasegawa (2/3 innings) and Troy Percival (one inning,
13th save), who combined to shut out the Twins on two hits in the
final three innings.

 DOCTOR'S GROUP URGES ROUTINE AIDS TESTING OF PREGNANT WOMEN  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The national organization of doctors who deliver
most of America's babies urged routine AIDS testing Tuesday for
every pregnant woman _ ``regardless of her apparent risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Because there are no symptoms of infection by HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS, no woman can be certain she is uninfected without
testing, said the new recommendation by the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists to its 40,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The test should be routinely offered but not required, said the
policy statement which is in line with recent recommendations by
the National Institutes of Medicine and supported by the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   It marks a significant change from earlier policies which
focused primarily on AIDS testing for women ``at risk'' for the
disease _ which includes minority women in impoverished
neighborhoods and injection drug users.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is holding its annual convention in San
Francisco this week, and its president, Dr. Frank C. Miller of the
University of Kentucky College of Medicine, said the test for HIV
infection should become ``as common as blood typing'' as a
first-line disease-prevention method for every pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
   Women infected by the AIDS virus bear a 25 percent risk of
transmitting the infection to their new-born babies _ either during
pregnancy and delivery or during breast-feeding. But as Dr. Laura
E. Riley of Harvard Medical School said, that risk can be cut to no
more than 2 percent, and perhaps even to zero, by early treatment
of pregnant women with the panoply of AIDS drugs now available, or
by timely surgery when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Although the doctors urge offering the test routinely during
every pregnant woman's first prenatal visit to a doctor or
nurse-midwife, they recognize that many women may reject the offer
until very late in pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   But even during the last ten days, Riley said, ``you can make a
difference'' in a patient's health and in the chances of infecting
her baby by treatment with the powerful new anti-viral drugs and
cesarean delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The organization of obstetricians is launching a major campaign
to persuade all its members, as well as other doctors who see
pregnant patients, to offer the HIV test as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to streamline the process for prenatal HIV testing
for both pregnant patients and their doctors,'' Riley said. ``We
want to make it as easy as possible, in this era of improved
treatments, to be tested, since the potential consequences of going
untested and undiagnosed can be so tragic.''

RIPKEN HOMER OFF MESA IN NINTH DERAILS LATE M'S COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ When Cal Ripken Jr. went deep for a game-winning
homer Tuesday night, it was natural for Orioles manager Mike
Hargrove to say, ``That's just Cal being Cal.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course, baseball is all about perspective, and that was
the Orioles' perspective. The Seattle perspective after a 4-2 loss
in the bottom of the ninth inning was more along the lines of,
``What, again?''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has been a terrific team at home in Safeco Field. And
that includes the bullpen. But let the Mariners wander far afield
and ugly things start to happen. And that's especially true of the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night it was Jose Mesa, stung by Ripken's homer. But on
the last road trip, Kazuhiro Sasaki gave up two walk-off homers,
one in Texas and another in Oakland. Division titles aren't won on
home games alone. Sooner or later, Mesa or Sasaki or Somebody is
going to have to step up in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella hinted after the loss Tuesday that Somebody
might be Arthur Rhodes. But that would only be if the left-hander
were in position to face a couple of the Orioles' big left-handed
bats _ say B.J. Surhoff and Harold Baines _ with the game on the
line.
</P>
<P>
   If not, it will be up to Mesa or Sasaki to get the job done.
Sasaki, who had a back problem flare up again Tuesday, wasn't
available. Mesa was, but he has never mastered pitching to Ripken,
and nothing Tuesday night changed that.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Orioles third baseman, Mesa missed with a curve, then
missed with a slider. Rather than fall behind 3-0 in the count,
Mesa came in with a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken gobbled it up and spit it into the left-field bleachers.
Game over.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Bryan Price is as aware as anyone of the problems
Mesa (2-3, 5.09 ERA) has had this season in the late going. But
Price's awareness extends to this: Mesa's in the bullpen, and for
the bullpen to help the Mariners, Mesa needs to believe he can do
the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't gotten down on Jose, and Lou keeps using him, so he
hasn't gotten down on Jose,'' Price said. ``As long as he doesn't
get down on himself, we've got a quality pitcher. But if he gets
down on himself, we're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   And has he?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen any evidence of that,'' Price said. ``He's not
walking around hanging his head.''
</P>
<P>
   There were many Mariners who were in full head-down mode
Tuesday. Most were hitters, none of whom could do much against
journeyman pitcher Pat Rapp, who started for the Orioles and
pitched seven shutout innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can score just four runs a game, we're going to have a
good chance to win with the pitching we've been getting,''
shortstop Alex Rodriguez said. ``Tonight we didn't do that. Rapp
was what they call `effectively wild.'''
</P>
<P>
   As always seems to be the case, the Seattle offense went south
with Gil Meche starting. Seattle has scored 18 runs for Meche when
he's been in the game this year, and half of those runs came in one
game. The Mariners did it to him Meche again, waiting until the
ninth inning to put together any semblance of offense.
</P>
<P>
   Brady Anderson and Harold Baines hit leadoff homers in the first
two innings for Baltimore, then Meche shut the door.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's hitters didn't get their feet in the door until Edgar
Martinez singled against former Seattle reliever Mike Timlin to
lead off the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Timlin, with his 95-mph fastball and 91-mph slider, is a nasty
customer. But, as the Mariners remember, he is also prone to
mistakes, and he made a whopper to Jay Buhner. After getting ahead
with two quick strikes, Timlin hung a slider, and Buhner parked it
into the cheap seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buhner did what he gets paid millions of dollars to do _ hit
hanging breaking balls out of the ballpark,'' Hargrove said.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, the Mariners were back in the game. In fact,
Seattle had a chance to take the lead, but with two out and runners
on second and third, Mark McLemore grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Mesa. And, just like that, the game was over. Mesa faced
three batters, got behind all three, and paid the price. Albert
Belle opened the inning with a bloop single on a 2-0 pitch, then
Baines popped out on a 3-1 serve before Ripken homered.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Ripken sounded more like a loser than a winner
because, after all, the Orioles are 18-25, mostly for having lost
just this kind of game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody would be lying to say it hasn't been frustrating,''
Ripken said. ``We've had some frustrating losses, and it does
affect you. Sometimes you forget how long the season is. Sometimes
it takes a lot of frustrating losses to get you over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, in the other clubhouse, Price continued to have
high hopes for a Mesa turnaround even as frustration gnawed at his
innards.

RUTAN LOOKING FOR RETURN TRIP TO POLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLES F. BOSTWICK 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOJAVE, Calif. _ Dick Rutan wants to return to the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   Just back from an Arctic trip whose climax was 13 hours stranded
on the polar icecap, Rutan is trying to arrange for a documentary
filmmaker to finance a trip back to the airplane Rutan's group left
stuck in the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stay longer,'' Rutan said Tuesday, a day after his
return to the Antelope Valley, in an interview at his Mojave
office. ``It's so beautiful. I could have spent a month up there.
It's just magnificent desolation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutan, who became famous in 1986 as one of the two-person crew
who made the first flight around the world without stopping or
refueling, videotaped from inside the airplane its landing and the
passengers' scramble to get out when the plane broke through the
ice. He's negotiating to sell the tape for a television series.
</P>
<P>
   Rutan, a Lancaster, Calif., resident, was one of seven people
who left Point Barrow, Alaska, May 11 in two planes for a 20-hour
flight over the North Pole to Norway.
</P>
<P>
   After setting down at the North Pole briefly on their way over,
the travelers spent three days in Spitsbergen, Norway, then started
the return trip.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the North Pole, they set down the planes - a
single-engine Cessna 150 and a larger, Russian-made Antonov An-2
biplane - on a smooth section of polar ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were starting the process of shutting down when they
realized the ice was thin,'' said Rutan, who co-piloted the
Antonov. ``The Antonov starting bowing the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots increased power to try to take off, but the main
landing gear broke through the ice and the plane sank up to its
belly, bending its propeller blades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all scrambled out real quick,'' Rutan said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting wet in 14-degree weather, Rutan noted, would have meant
death.
</P>
<P>
   Once they were out of the plane, the travelers realized they
needed the survival gear inside the plane. They unloaded the plane
and dragged their gear to a thicker spot on the ice, where they
built an ice shelter.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have the skill to build a real igloo, but they built
a shelter large enough to fit all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the travelers left in the Cessna to get help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it got really quiet,'' Rutan said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the travelers' worries were polar bears. From the air,
they had sighted several, and one ate a college student just
outside Spitsbergen right before they arrived there, Rutan said.
</P>
<P>
   They kept a shotgun handy, but no polar bear showed up.
</P>
<P>
   The other travelers slept while waiting for rescue, but Rutan
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so full of adrenalin, I couldn't sleep,'' Rutan said.
``I didn't want to miss any of this.''
</P>
<P>
   After 13 hours, a Canadian flying service's Twin Otter airplane
on skis set down on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The plane flew them to Eureka, a tiny outpost in the Canadian
Arctic; then they took another plane to Resolute. Getting back to
Anchorage took about three days, Rutan said.

DEMOS IN CALIFORNIA SENATE PROPOSE SALES TAX REBATE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Saying they want all Californians to share in the
state's cash bonanza, Senate Democrats pitched a plan Tuesday to
rebate $1.4 billion each year in sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is designed to replace a $1.7 billion one-time
income tax cut proposed by Gov. Gray Davis, which Senate Democrats
said does not benefit all Californians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will spread money to all California taxpayers,'' said
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, of the plan.
``People that need money and spend it for necessities are going to
get a bigger piece of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's tax cut plan is the latest move by lawmakers to
establish their bargaining stance with the Democratic governor over
the shape of the state's $93.7 billion budget for the fiscal year
beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Already Senate Democrats have beefed up spending for the state's
grant program to needy college students beyond what Davis wants and
made various changes in their spending plan counter to Davis'
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Assembly's proposed budget, there is $2.4 billion
earmarked for tax cuts but the plan doesn't say what those cuts
would be.
</P>
<P>
   Davis wants to give single taxpayers a one-time check for $150
and joint filers a $300 check.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats say that many lower income Californians, who
don't pay income taxes, lose a higher percentage of their income
from sales taxes than higher earning Californians.
</P>
<P>
   They also noted that an income tax rebate from the state would
count as additional income on federal taxes so some of Davis' $150
and $300 checks would be lost in higher federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Washington D.C. based nonprofit Institute on
Taxation and Economic Policy found that 41 percent of the state's
families with children would receive no rebates under Davis' plan
because they pay no state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The study said that $250 million of the rebates would go to the
federal treasury because state income taxes are deductible from
federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' proposed rebate check would also count as income the
following year when a person pays their state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the case for sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats are still weighing two ways of doling out the
sales tax rebate.
</P>
<P>
   One would give each sales taxpayer $50 and their dependents
would get $25 -- up to a maximum of $150 per household, according
to Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, chair of the Senate Budget
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The other approach would offer a minimum rebate of $30
increasing to $80, depending on income with a $25 rebate per
dependent.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who pays income taxes would automatically get a rebate
check, Peace said. But about 5.8 million Californians who don't pay
taxes would have to apply for the money, Peace said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebates would remain in effect unless suspended by a
two-thirds vote of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to know both the Assembly and the Senate agree with
the governor that some portion of the surplus should be returned to
taxpayers,'' said Michael Bustamante, Davis' press secretary.
``Details of the tax cut will be part of budget discussions with
the governor.''

 ROOFMAN ICED, YET QUAKEMAN FREE  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I'm Fed-Exing a Happy Meal to Roofman, with a
file cooked inside the burger patty. You deserve a break today,
Roofman.
</P>
<P>
   Roofman is Jeffrey Allen Manchester, arrested in North Carolina
and suspected of committing a series of burger-joint stick-ups. At
each place, he allegedly cut a hole in the roof, dropped down on
the employees, flashed a gun, took the cash, locked the people in
the freezer and split.
</P>
<P>
   He never took anything but company cash, never raised his voice,
was always polite, and always made sure the employees had jackets
and sweaters before he put 'em on ice.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, I'm no fan of armed robbery. But Roofman should be
let off with community service, giving seminars on courtesy to
fast-food employees.
</P>
<P>
   Roofman reportedly stole $100,000 in the 45 robberies. Let him
keep it. That's a class-action karma payback on behalf of every
poor schnook who ever got 10 miles down the freeway before
discovering that he didn't get any sauce for his Chicken McSawdust,
or that he got shorted two nacho cheese-licks, or that the Elmer
Fudd Militia Terrorist toy that his kid so desperately wanted
didn't make the bag.
</P>
<P>
   IF ROOFMAN is being held on $1 million bail, the FBI and Tommy
Lee Jones should be conducting a manhunt for Clogman, the corporate
head of the Burger-Industrial Complex whose mission is to clog up
the arteries of every American by politely selling us bags of
greasy, salted fat.
</P>
<P>
   HOW COME there's not a warrant out for Quakeman, the state
insurance commissioner who comes to the aid of ripped-off
earthquake victims by making TV commercials?
</P>
<P>
   Quakeman cuts a loophole in the roof and drops into the back
room of crooked insurance companies. He is always polite and neatly
dressed, always allows the wealthy companies to pay off potentially
massive fines with pennies on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Then, before making his getaway through the doggie door,
Quakeman locks earthquake-insurance-fraud victims in the deep
freeze, naked, and blames it on his attorney, Attorneyman.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S ENOUGH TO make you want to throw up, but if you reach for
the ipecac, be sure to check the expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pyle was cleaning out his medicine cabinet and came across
a vial of ipecac syrup. He noticed the bottle was stamped with an
expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' wonders Rick. ``What happens if you drink expired
ipecac? Does it make you not throw up?''
</P>

   TODAY'S THEOLOGICAL stumper, from Gar Smith:

<P>
   FAMILIAR NAMES on the local law school graduation lists: Policy
and Alioto.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Policy, Stanford Law, is the daughter of Carmen and
Gail Policy. Carmen was the 49ers' salary cap wizard and overall
mastermind who played a major role in the '90s dynasty before a
major falling out with then-owner Eddie DeBartolo, which resulted
in Carmen going to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Alioto, UCSF School of Law, is the grandson of the late
mayor Joe and son of maybe-future-mayor Angela.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen is going to work for an S.F. law firm and Joe is
staying, for now, with the D.A.'s office.
</P>
<P>
   SO COMEDIAN Dana Carvey didn't think it was so darn funny when
he found out that a San Francisco surgeon who performed a double
bypass on Carvey's heart in '98 made a mistake in re-connecting the
plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   I'm surprised that such snafus don't happen more often. You get
inside there, with all the blood and gunk, and those tiny arteries
look like the MacArthur Maze from the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is, never go to a surgeon whose shingle features
phrases like ``While U wait'' or ``In about an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   TOOTHPICK MAN, not to be confused with Roofman, or Hamburger
Arm, wins today's creative panhandling award.
</P>
<P>
   Hamburger Arm was the dude who raked in sympathy cash for months
by showing people his gruesomely gouged and bleeding arm and asking
for cab fare to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Toothpick Man, reports Scott McKellar, works the median strip on
Van Ness and gives you a show for your donation. He jams a
toothpick up his nose, then pulls it out of his mouth. Then he rams
the toothpick into his eye and pulls it out of his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``An illusion, I assume,'' McKellar says, ``but he's very
good.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd give the guy a buck  &UR; not  &LR; to do it. Hate to see a man make
an hors d'oeuvre out of his eyeball.

 QUACKENBUSH REFUSES TO TESTIFY AT SENATE HEARING  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush angrily
walked out of a Senate hearing Tuesday after accusing it of
orchestrating a political ambush.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic exit by Quackenbush and his top deputies left the
chairwoman of the Senate Insurance Committee, Sen. Jackie Speier,
D-Hillsborough, promising to ask for a subpoena to force them to
appear next week.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush's surprise departure came after he produced a
year-old e-mail between two legislative staff members that used the
word ``ambush.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I agreed to appear here voluntarily, despite my reservations
that this would be a political drill, not a reform-focused,
fact-finding discussion,'' Quackenbush, one of the state's two
Republican statewide officeholders, said in a prepared statement to
the committee. ``After receiving this document, along with some
other worrisome information that indicates some members of the
Legislature are aware of and actively participating in this
`ambush,' I decided to engage outside counsel _ Mr. Donald Heller _
to advise me.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush said Heller advised him not to participate in the
hearing. Then he walked out, to the applause of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   After a 10-minute recess, Speier said she would request
subpoenas and resumed the hearing without the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush is under investigation by lawmakers and the attorney
general for allowing insurance companies to duck as much as $3
billion in fines for mishandling Northridge earthquake claims by
contributing far smaller amounts to a nonprofit foundation set up
by Quackenbush.
</P>
<P>
   The $11.6 million that insurers paid to the foundation was
supposed to finance earthquake research and consumer aid, but
Quackenbush acknowledged at an Assembly hearing last month that so
far, none of the money has gone to earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, money has been funneled to some of Quackenbush's
political operatives, to organizations such as the Greater
Sacramento Urban League and a football camp attended by two of
Quackenbush's sons. An additional $3 million was spent on
television commercials featuring the insurance commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   At Attorney General Bill Lockyer's request, a judge has
temporarily frozen the fund's remaining $6 million and is
considering making the order permanent.
</P>
<P>
   In a crush of news media outside the hearing room, Quackenbush
said he will proceed only on the advice of his attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The e-mail represented that this has been a long-planned
political ambush on the office of the insurance commissioner and is
designed to damage me politically,'' he said. ``We're not going to
allow this to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush then quickly left as aides physically blocked the
hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Heller, a former assistant U.S. attorney, was one of the
prosecutors of Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme, who was convicted of
attempting to assassinate former President Gerald Ford in
Sacramento in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as a political lynching, and once again, it
reflects California politics at its worst,'' Heller said. ``I'm not
saying that there weren't mistakes made, and the commissioner has
candidly admitted making mistakes. But he is a decent, honorable
man, and he was trying to do the best for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Speier, who has said she is interested in running for the
insurance commissioner post, denied that the investigation is
politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in an ambush, and I was almost killed,'' she said,
refering to the 1978 Jonestown massacre, where she was wounded.
``This is a piece of cake in comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   As Quackenbush walked out of the hearing, he released a copy of
a March 1999 e-mail from an Assembly staff member to Richard
Steffen, staff director of the Senate Insurance Committee, advising
him not to write a letter to Quackenbush ``on anything, we have to
set him up first ... if we do not completely ambush him, he will
slide out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steffen said he was not the one who made such statements, but
stood behind his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all political animals here, whether we admit it or
not,'' Steffen said.
</P>
<P>
   The staff member who wrote the e-mail hung up on a reporter
Tuesday afternoon.

PINKERTON OPENS ARCHIVE OF INFAMY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. _ The rap sheets of desperado Jesse
James and his gang. A New York studio portrait of the Sundance
Kid's mysterious mate. A leather-bound book about the foiled plot
to kill President Lincoln in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   All will soon see the light of day after nearly a century in
storage.
</P>
<P>
   Those records - cataloged, reboxed, filed and even restored in
some instances - will be loaded onto a truck today and moved from
the headquarters of Pinkerton USA in Westlake Village to
Washington, D.C., where the company will donate the collection to
the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The library's delighted to have it because it's a very unique
collection, it really broadens our law enforcement collection,''
said John Sellers, a 19th century history specialist with the
library. ``I was afraid it would end up in private hands, sold and
dispersed.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the Pinkerton Archives consists of 195 binders, each
containing reams of historic criminal investigations. They include
photographs and illustrations of suspects and their tools; wanted
and reward posters; press clippings; penciled daily detectives'
reports; and communications between offices, with sheriffs and even
foreign contacts and Pinkerton outposts.
</P>
<P>
   If it had been broken up and sold at auction, Sellers estimated
the collection could have fetched about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1850, the Pinkerton National Detective Agency became
synonymous with America's most important police work in the second
half of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkertons, as the company's detectives became known, chased
bandits hundreds of miles across the country to recover loot for
client banks, investigated the beginnings of organized labor and
even provided security for the president. Both the Secret Service
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were inspired by the
Pinkertons' organization and crime-fighting methods.
</P>
<P>
   The company's old records have occasionally been used by
scholars - and once in the 1940s for a series of 60 articles in
True Detective Magazine - but the company's acquisition by three
different parent companies since 1982 left historians wondering
what had happened to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers sent a letter asking Pinkerton USA for the collection 10
years ago, but never received a reply, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he needed no convincing when Jane Adler, hired by Pinkerton
to organize the disheveled dossiers, photographs and newspaper
clippings, walked into his office in Washington two years ago and
offered the collection to the library.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he'd take it sight unseen and he'd send a truck
immediately,'' Adler said with a mischievous, English-accented
chuckle. ``When I tried to explain to him what we had, he said, `We
know what you have,' and waved his arms wildly about.''
</P>
<P>
   Sellers was one of many who would have liked to have snatched a
peek inside some of those rotting brown cardboard boxes years ago.
Adler said she has upset ``banditry guys'' with the company's
refusal to let them examine the records, because the collection has
files on a number of famous desperados, including Butch Cassidy and
his Wild Bunch, Jesse James and the lesser known but intriguing
Missouri Kid, who wrote to company founder Allan Pinkerton pleading
for his life after he shot a company detective in the head.
</P>
<P>
   And battalions of Civil War buffs would fight their own brothers
for a chance to hold the official War Department telegraph form
with a handwritten cable from Pinkerton, code named ``E.J. Allan.''
Dated April 18, 1865, the anguished message to Secretary of War
Edwin Stanton follows the killing of President Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   ``How I regret that I had not been near him previous to this
fatal act. I might have been the means to arrest it,'' the message
says.
</P>
<P>
   The archives also have been sought by labor historians doing
research on the beginnings of unions in the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Adler found crinkled, yellowed and cracked papers detailing
detectives' investigations of the Molly Maguires, a secret group
founded by coal miners in Pennsylvania that used terrorist tactics
against mine owners until it was infiltrated by the Pinkertons.
</P>
<P>
   The records contain few other references to that most
controversial use of the agency's investigative might, however. On
the wall of the storage room in Westlake Village are journalists'
drawings of a bloodied Pinkerton ``army'' of 300 that made an
attempt to stop an 1892 revolt at a steel mill in Homestead, Pa.,
which was later investigated by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton is now owned by the Swedish security services company
Securitas, and its services include security guard patrols,
commercial security systems, employment screening and
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Company officers and Adler will visit the Library of Congress
next week to officially hand over the archives - which span from
1853 to 1937 - in recognition of two anniversaries: The company's
150th and the library's 200th.

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ Watching the Dallas Stars defend their Stanley Cup
championship is like watching a heavyweight boxer let his opponent
fight himself out.
<TEXT>
<P>
   You see them back on their heels for a period or two. You see
their goaltender peppered with shots. And then you see them land
the knockout punch.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 5 of the Western Conference finals Tuesday night, the
winning blow was struck by Joe Nieuwendyk, who tipped the puck past
Colorado goalie Patrick Roy 12:10 into overtime to give the Stars a
3-2 victory over the Avalanche. Dallas holds a 3-2 lead in the
best-of-seven series, with Game 6 on Thursday in Denver and Game 7
_ if needed _ Saturday in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, on home ice at Reunion Arena, the Stars were again at
their deceptive best. They were outshot 31-20. They played
sluggishly in the first period. But in the end, they won, their
edges being goalie Ed Belfour and Nieuwendyk's stick.
</P>
<P>
   After Belfour had turned back another Avalanche assault through
three-plus periods, Nieuwendyk was able to work himself into the
right spot to deflect Richard Matvichuk's shot past Roy and end the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I remember it is seeing the puck back at the point,''
Nieuwendyk said. ``When you're in that situation, it's all a race
to the net. The puck found a lane right through. I was just able to
get my stick on it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of three Dallas centers, Nieuwendyk was forced to play more
than his usual allotment of minutes Tuesday because Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock had to reorganize his lines when winger Jamie
Langenbrunner went off with a knee injury in the first period.
Extra work in an intense, physical game on an unseasonably warm
evening might be difficult for some players, but Nieuwendyk, the
Most Valuable Player of last year's playoffs, was up to it. More
important, he had something left at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more he played the better he played,'' Hitchcock said,
``and we sure needed him tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Stars also needed Belfour, who has faced 110
shots in the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like last year, Eddie gets better as the playoffs go on,''
Nieuwendyk said. ``He's really focused. And when he goes against
someone like Patrick Roy, he gets fired up. He's made some great
saves, and we certainly need him to do that, because they're
getting quality shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Colorado team that enjoyed a 39-15 shot advantage in
Game 4 was the one that took the ice Tuesday, putting the rush on
Belfour immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took off like a rocket,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a marvelous play by Matvichuk kept the Avalanche from
scoring 10 minutes into the game. Colorado's Shjon Podein had a
shot at an open net, but Matvichuk swooped in to keep the puck from
crossing the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, the Stars weren't so fortunate. Jon Klemm was
in position to lift a rebound over Belfour, putting the Avalanche
on the board and ending a streak of 12 straight playoff games in
which the Stars had prevented their opponents from scoring in the
first period.
</P>
<P>
   In the first period, the Avalanche cranked out 11 shots on goal.
The Stars didn't produce a shot on goal in the first 12 minutes and
came out of the first period with just five.
</P>
<P>
   The fog finally lifted for the Stars 4:26 into the second
period. Jere Lehtinen, camped in front of Roy, was able to backhand
the rebound from a Brett Hull shot high into the net and make it a
1-1 game.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' second goal came 14:41 into the period and 20 seconds
into their third power play of the game. Darryl Sydor got the puck
to Mike Modano, who set up Hull perfectly for the blast that put
the Stars ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado came back to forge a tie early in the third period. Joe
Sakic made the play, working the puck into the Stars' zone and
flipping it in to Milan Hejduk, whose shot beat Belfour 2:19 into
the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche was handed an opportunity to end the game in
regulation when Modano was called for high-sticking with 3:37 left.
A team with one of the NHL's best power plays, Colorado managed a
final push, but Belfour hung in _ at one point turning back Sakic
in front of the net _ sending the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour stopped four shots in overtime, two from Sakic, before
Nieuwendyk put in the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got a two-on-one up top, threw the puck at the net, and
it got deflected,'' Colorado defenseman Ray Bourque said. ``It's
not always pretty in overtime. They threw the puck at the net, and
it was a tough break for us.''

NIEUWENDYK FLASHES MVP FORM AS STARS WIN IN OVERTIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The irony wasn't lost on Joe Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   Just when he finally stopped trying to be the player he was in
last season's playoffs, that's exactly who he started to look like.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk deflected a Richard Matvichuk shot past Colorado
goalie Patrick Roy with 7:50 remaining in overtime to give the
Dallas Stars a 3-2 victory in Game 5 of the Western Conference
Finals on Tuesday night at Reunion Arena. His goal, much like his
game, proved eerily reminiscent of his playoff-MVP performance of a
season ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's natural for everyone to judge on last year and the run
that I had in last year's playoffs,'' said Nieuwendyk, who had 10
goals, including six game-winners, and 11 assists in last year's
playoff but only five goals coming into Game 5. ``I think there was
a time period early in the playoffs where I was putting a lot of
pressure on myself to do that too.''
</P>
<P>
   What Nieuwendyk, who was double shifted a lot after winger Jamie
Langenbrunner injured his right knee late in the first period, did
Tuesday night was put the Stars one victory away from returning to
the Stanley Cup Finals. Game 6 is Thursday night in Colorado where
the Stars will try to do what the Avalanche could not last season:
finish the series with a victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars realize they'll need to play better to win, especially
with Langenbrunner definitely out, but their game seems to be
peaking at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Joe; he's so dangerous all the time, and he's working
real hard, and things weren't going right,'' Stars winger Brett
Hull said. ``All of a sudden, a couple go in and things change at
the drop of a hat.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Nieuwendyk scored the goal to set up the dramatics of
Game 6, Stars goalie Ed Belfour kept the game going until then. The
Stars needed a pair of spectacular saves by him midway through
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour stopped shots by Avs forwards Dave Andreychuk and Joe
Sakic 9 minutes, 48 seconds into overtime. Andreychuk took a shot
from the high slot. The rebound bounced to Sakic, who had snuck
behind the Stars' defensemen. He took a poke at it, but shoved it
under Ed Belfour's pads. The puck eventually trickled out but the
whistle had already blown.
</P>
<P>
   Roy couldn't answer at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This round is about two of the greatest goalies in hockey
history,'' Avs coach Bob Hartley said. ``You are going to need a
perfect shot, a perfect tip to beat them. You are talking about
goaltending at its best.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were once again outshot, 31-20 this time They've been
outshot 110-56 in the past three games. And they've won two.
</P>
<P>
   They, once again, made their shots count, and Belfour made sure
Colorado's didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we did a whole lot to make his night tough,''
Colorado defenseman Adam Foote said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars certainly didn't bother Roy too much. They had five
shots in each of the first two periods, but turned that into two
goals in the second. Both were by the Hull-Mike Modano-Jere
Lehtinen/Brenden Morrow line. Hull, Modano and Lehtinen have scored
or assisted on eight of the Stars' 10 goals against the Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen struck first, getting a stick on a Hull rebound. With
Adam Deadmarsh on his back and Adam Foote on his side, Lehtinen got
the puck to his backhand and chipped the puck over Roy at 4:26 of
the period.
</P>
<P>
   Hull took care of matters himself on the Stars' second goal. On
a power play, Modano moved away from the slot then sent a pass to
where he had just come from. Hull was there for his classic
one-timer and a 2-1 lead at 14:41 of the second period. Modano
didn't have a shot but finished with two assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Jere or (Hull) are doing it, we're all getting
involved,'' Modano said. ``Our line is certainly creating a lot of
goals the three games that we've won. I think that's all you can
really ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had gone 14 consecutive home playoff games without
allowing a third-period goal.
</P>
<P>
   Avs forward Milan Hejduk stopped that streak when he scored at
2:19 of the third period to tie the game at 2-2. Colorado and
Dallas then proceeded to go seemingly forever without a shot. They
were merely saving their energy for a frenetic final couple of
minutes of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars and Avs traded tremendous chances. The only reason
none of them went in was because Roy and Belfour traded even more
spectacular saves, including a doozy by Belfour on Foote.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my job to come up with the big saves,'' Belfour said.
``I got a couple saves there I got maybe a little lucky, and we
needed that.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado looked to be on a crash course for another Game 4,
where shots didn't necessary equal goals, until defenseman Jon
Klemm finally scored at 12:11 of the first period. The Avs were
outshooting the Stars 9-0 at that point.
</P>
<P>
   The Avs could've had another goal if not for Matvichuk. He
swiped a Shjon Podein shot out just before it crossed the goal line
earlier in the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not supposed to be behind Eddie by any means,'' Matvichuk
said. ``It's just one of those desperation plays, and I was in the
right position at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk said the same thing about his shot that Nieuwendyk
deflected for the game-winner. Matvichuk said he just wanted to get
the puck on net. Nieuwendyk said he could see it coming. The way
his luck had been going in the playoffs, he was just hoping to get
a stick on it. He figured he'd keep digging in the corners until
one finally went in.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the attitude I have,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``Just to keep
working and fighting and scratching for everything. Throughout my
whole career, if it hasn't been going in, the only way I know how
to rectify the situation is to keep battling.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the attitude the Stars say they need to win Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk said this series is as hard, if not harder, than the
seven-game thriller these two teams engaged in last season. The
Stars realize they'll need to play better if they're going to win
Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``A minute after the game was over, our dressing room was quiet
as heck,'' Hitchcock said. ``We know what type of battle we're in
right now, and it's going to take everything this team has got.''

IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR: BELFOUR THE BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For all of the daily knee-jerk analysis, for all of the
talk about Adam Foote's eye and Joe Sakic's plus-minus and Brett
Hull's timely resuscitation, the story remains the same in this
Western Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
   It's no mystery novel _ Eddie Belfour three games, Patrick Roy
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``This round is about two of the greatest goaltenders in hockey
history,'' Colorado coach Bob Hartley said graciously after Tuesday
night's 3-2 Dallas Stars overtime victory.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Monsieur Bob, and your man is leaking.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a major misdemeanor to take anything away from Joe
Nieuwendyk's winning goal 12 minutes into the extra period.
</P>
<P>
   As Roy said, clinically, ``It deflected right in front of me,
and I made the save sideways, and after that I saw the puck hit the
post and then cross the line.''
</P>
<P>
   So which line can you see on the big chart, Patrick? Can you
read the big ``E''?
</P>
<P>
   Can you also read the D, D, I and E?
</P>
<P>
   It's handwritten right there on the wall. For all of the
preseries hype, for all of the Avalanche's indignation over
Belfour's alleged slight, and for all of Patrick's catty retorts
about not being able to hear because he had all those ``Stanley
Cups in my ears,'' the story in this year's conference finals is
shaping up to be the same as last year's.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say?'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock answered, when
someone asked about his goaltender. ``He's been great. He's got a
strong focus. He's a proud guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``And right now he has to be the difference for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The more inconsistent that Hitchcock's team plays, the steadier
and more dependable that Belfour seems to get. In the midst of an
indifferent first-period by the home team Tuesday night, one where
the Stars went nearly 12 1/2 minutes without a shot on goal,
Belfour stopped 10 of 11 shots and otherwise sprawled and snared
the home team back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no surprise,'' said the resident elder, Guy Carbonneau.
``He's been playing this way since October.''
</P>
<P>
   It's so true. In this year after his first Stanley Cup, the only
thing that has stymied Belfour has been ... well ... Mace.
</P>
<P>
   Both goaltenders allowed second goals in Tuesday night's tensely
played contest. Belfour rebounded from Milan Hejduk's game-knotting
goal early in the third period and made some of his best saves in
the ensuing 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But Hull's one-timer blast off the feed from Modano _ the Stars'
second goal _ seemed to rattle the plumbing inside of Roy's rooster
head. When his attempted ``pass'' toward the right boards sailed
into the rich folks' seats, drawing a mandatory delay-of-game
penalty, the Reunion Arena crowd howled.
</P>
<P>
   With just under 10 minutes played in the extra period, Belfour
stopped a Dave Andreychuk drive, and then fell on the puck when
Sakic tried to hastily squeeze the rebound under Eddie's leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to drag the puck and get it under him, but I didn't,''
said Sakic, who remained fresh out of explanations.
</P>
<P>
   What we're seeing, though, is a different goaltender. It's been
one of the NHL's stories of the year, and the Eastern Conference
hockey literati has missed it.
</P>
<P>
   Since winning the Cup, Belfour has played with a quiet
confidence that no onrushing bands of Avs, Red Wings, Sharks or
Blues have been able to shake.
</P>
<P>
   As game-winner Nieuwendyk said, ``He is really focused, and when
he goes against someone like Patrick Roy, he really gets fired up
and wants to do well. He is really on top of his game and focused
out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making a lot of great saves for us, and we certainly need
him to do that. They are getting quality chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously enough, the Stars aren't. They skate, they grind, they
scrum along the boards, hoping to kick loose a brief opportunity,
but the defending champs have seemed to swoon for stretches of this
series, unable to generate scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes the fact that Roy is trailing in this series all the
more indicting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a couple of saves that were a little lucky,'' Belfour
said, ``but we need things like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The series is not over yet. We still have to win another game,
and it's going to take a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but for the Stars, what once seemed to be such a starry,
faraway dream now seems like handwriting on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   E-D-D-I-E, it reads. Does the other guy even see it?

RANGERS' BULLPEN DELIVERS SEVENTH STRAIGHT WIN

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Undaunted by early results, Rangers manager
Johnny Oates has kept his relievers in their appointed roles and
keeps bringing them in at the appointed time. Lately the results
have been much more gratifying, although still somewhat
nerve-wracking.
</P>
<P>
   Oates when through it last night when Jeff Zimmerman put the
tying run on second base with no outs in the eighth inning and John
Wetteland got in a first-and-third jam with one out in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   But both pitchers, showing their All-Star grit from last year,
kept their cool, their calm and the tying run from scoring,
allowing the Rangers to hold on to a 4-3 victory over the Kansas
City Royals at Kauffman Stadium last night.
</P>
<P>
   Their relief work allowed Rick Helling to improve his record to
7-1 with a 3.22 earned-run average and extended the Rangers'
winning streak to seven. The Rangers have also won 16 of their past
21, allowing them to move into a virtual tie for first place with
the Seattle Mariners in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a lot of fun,'' Wetteland said. ``Playing with these
guys and being around them every day, they look forward to coming
to the park. Guys are going out looking to win a baseball game;
they're not just interested in their individual stats. It's a fun
atmosphere to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   That atmosphere extends to the bullpen. During the seven-game
winning streak, Rangers relievers have allowed only two earned runs
in 22 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it time and again,'' Wetteland said. ``A strong 'pen
gives a team a good feeling, guys coming in, getting the job done
night in and night out. Early in the season you could see
\Rhitters\S pressing. We'd have a three- or four-run lead and guys
would be trying to make it a 10-run lead. The offense was carrying
us early. ... They're still carrying us, but now we're doing our
part too.''
</P>
<P>
   Their part came up in the eighth. Home runs by Chad Curtis and
David Segui helped Helling take a 4-2 lead into the eighth, but
Carlos Febles started the inning with a home run of his own. That
made it 4-3, and Oates decided it was time for the bullpen, a much
safer decision now than perhaps 21 games ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to win, we're going to win with those guys doing their
job,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, trying to harness his nasty slider, started his night
by giving up a double to Matt Sweeney. Mark Quinn followed with a
soft line drive up the middle that Zimmerman failed to catch. But
he did freeze Sweeney long enough to keep him from going to third
as the ball bounced to second baseman Luis Alicea for the first
out.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman then fell behind Joe Randa 3-0 before coming back to
get the strikeout, then retired Carlos Beltran on a fly to left to
end the inning. Through all of Zimmerman's struggles, he has still
been tough with runners in scoring position; opponents have just
three hits in 29 at-bats against him in those situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as good as I want to be,'' Zimmerman said. ``I
struggled with command of my slider, but fortunately I was able to
make some good pitches. I'm taking small steps and as long as I
keep getting the ball, I'll take the positives out of it and go
from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland got into trouble when he gave up one-out singles to
Jorge Fabregas and Jermaine Dye, leaving pinch-runners Scott Pose
and Luis Ordaz at first and third. That brought up Johnny Damon, a
fast runner who is tough to double up.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland wanted to strike him out but instead jammed him
inside. Damon hit a slow grounder back to Wetteland, who threw home
to get Pose for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   ``John threw the ball right where I wanted him to,'' Oates said.
``Make sure of one. You don't have a shot at getting two with Damon
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Febles then flied out to short right to end the game.

BELFOUR GETTING BETTER IN STANLEY CUP DRIVE

<P>
   DALLAS _ A long time ago, the Dallas Stars learned that where
there's Ed Belfour, there's a way.
</P>
<P>
   It was Belfour who willed the Stars to victory again Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour made 29 saves, many of them at point-blank range, in the
Stars' 3-2 overtime victory in Game 5 of the Western Conference
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie played great,'' Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk said.
``He's played great all playoffs. Everybody knows that goaltending
wins championships, and what he's done for us so far. Hopefully he
can just keep doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour wasn't one of the three finalists for the Vezina Trophy,
but his name should be the early favorite for the Conn Smythe. No
one has played better in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad not to see his name somewhere near a trophy,'' Stars
center Guy Carbonneau said. ``But Eddie doesn't care about awards.
He cares about the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have been outshot, 150-114, in the series, yet they
are one victory from returning to the Stanley Cup Finals. The
reason? Belfour. He has made 141 saves in the series for a .940
save percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's stopped a lot of pucks, and that's what we need,'' Stars
forward Mike Keane said. ``He's really saved our bacon several
times. When you get outshot by 15 or more and still win, that
really says something about your goalie.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past three games, the Stars have been outshot, 110-56.
Yet, they have won twice.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the Avalanche fired 31 pucks at Belfour,
including four in overtime. Avalanche center Joe Sakic twice was
turned back by Belfour in overtime, including once in a one-on-one
situation after a Dave Andreychuk slap shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just was trying to focus on the puck,'' Belfour said.
``That's my job to come up with the big saves. I got a couple of
saves there and got maybe a little lucky, and you need that.''
</P>
<P>
   In a midseason conference call, Belfour said he was ``as good as
Patrick or better'' when responding to a question about how he
rates himself against Colorado goalie Patrick Roy. So far, Belfour
has been better.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has two shutouts, Roy has allowed 10 goals on only
114 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie's playing outstanding,'' Stars center Mike Modano said.
``He's tremendous and getting stronger every game and really
keeping it tight. The games that we lost, we still were in it until
the last minute of the game. To get a lead, he's that much tougher
to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Until it's over, Belfour will not rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to win another game,'' Belfour said. ``That's
going to take a lot of hard work.'' nn

STARS LOSE LANGENBRUNNER TO KNEE INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Injuries are nothing new to the Stars. They've fought
them, played through them and won in spite of them the entire
season.
</P>
<P>
   They had one more to deal with last night when winger Jamie
Langenbrunner pulled up in the middle of the Stars' offensive zone
with a knee injury. Stars coach Ken Hitchcock wasn't certain about
Langenbrunner's injury after the game, but said Langenbrunner won't
play tomorrow in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   That makes depth a serious concern, especially going into the
high altitude and thin air of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock couldn't worry about that last night. In fact, he
didn't even see one of the game's biggest plays, when Richard
Matvichuk cleared the puck out of an empty Dallas net , because his
focus was simply having enough skaters to get through Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too busy scrambling getting our lines together,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Without Langenbrunner, the Stars were forced to use three
centers and had several players, most notably Mike Modano and Joe
Nieuwendyk, playing longer shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk responded, scoring the game-winner in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played him a lot tonight,'' Hitchcock said of Nieuwendyk.
``Joe was the guy who got double-shifted. The more he played, the
better he played. In the last half of the game we sure needed
him.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the loss of Langenbrunner, the Stars weren't the
team drained of energy in the extra period. In fact, they attacked
the Colorado net hard in the last few minutes leading up to
Nieuwendyk's goal.
</P>
<P>
   ```The best thing about this team is our depth,'' said Stars
captain and defenseman Derian Hatcher, who played one shift that
lasted nearly two minutes last night. ``We have plenty of people
who can come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said Jon Sim, who played in 25 regular-season games
but hasn't played yet in the postseason, could fill the roster spot
left vacant by Langenbrunner in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sim's a left shot but a natural right winger,'' Hitchcock
said. ``He's got the speed and the tenacity to match this type of
series.''

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
They could talk about it until the mosquitoes stopped biting, but
until they actually did something about it, mere words would carry
no sting.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Holt got the message in a players-only meeting prior to
Tuesday's 10-2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, and
apparently he wasn't alone. For one night, the Astros were
everything they hadn't been during a season-worst seven-game losing
streak, which ended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They were resilient, relentless and fundamentally sound, bearing
no resemblance to the team that began the day with the worst record
in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one game,'' said first baseman Jeff Bagwell, who called
the meeting. ``It doesn't make the last 43 games OK, but it's a
start. This game was a step in the right direction, and it was good
to see.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point later in the season, the Astros would love to be
able to look back to Tuesday as the day they turned their season
around. If they do, the prevailing memory will be of Holt's
gut-check effort.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old righthander became the first Astro to pitch a
complete game at Enron Field and only the third pitcher overall to
go the distance at the hitter-friendly ballpark. He also drove in
two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Jon Lieber and Colorado's Pedro Astacio had the other
complete games at Enron. It was the second complete game of Holt's
career, both occurring this season.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most impressive was that he threw 138 pitches, easily
the highest total for an Astro this season. Shane Reynolds'
125-pitch effort against the Cubs on April 25 was the previous
high.
</P>
<P>
   Because Monday's doubleheader in Milwaukee took such a toll on
the bullpen, Holt's workhorse performance was exactly what the
Astros needed. Also, considering how unreliable the bullpen has
been, perhaps it was in Holt's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a command performance,'' manager Larry Dierker said.
``You're not going to see a guy step up and go all the way very
often. I kept asking him if he was tired, and he kept saying, `I
want to finish this thing.' That's good to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt won for only the second time this season and the first time
since April 28, his last complete game _ a two-hit shutout at
Milwaukee. He has a 3.38 ERA over his last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tired, but you have to battle through it,'' said Holt,
who struck out a career-high seven batters, including five in a row
at one point. ``We needed to get a win, and I wanted to finish what
I started.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillies starter Randy Wolf came up way short in that
department, lasting just three innings and allowing six runs on
eight hits.
</P>
<P>
   He hardly looked like the same Randy Wolf who held the Astros to
a run on five hits in seven innings earlier this season at Enron.
Tuesday's performance matched the shortest outing of Wolf's career.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who won for only the second time in 10 games, put
together three-run innings against Wolf in the second and the
third. Holt's two-run single highlighted the second-inning rally,
which put the Astros on top for good. They were Holt's first two
RBIs of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou's two-run homer was the big blow in the third
inning, and Tony Eusebio also drove in a run with the first of his
two doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry too much about my swing,'' said Eusebio, who
lifted his average to .227. ``I struggled in April, but I'm going
to be a good hitter again. I'm just waiting for my chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt, who was making his first start in 10 days _ he made a pair
of relief appearances in that span _ no doubt was waiting for the
day when the Astros would actually score more than a few runs in
one of his starts.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday, the club was averaging four runs when Holt
started.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday they scored that many over the final two innings.
Craig Biggio had an RBI single in the seventh, and Richard Hidalgo
drew a bases-load walk from Jason Boyd to give the Astros an 8-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno's two-run homer in the eighth provided the final
margin of victory for the Astros, who banged out 13 hits and scored
their most comfortable victory since beating Pittsburgh 11-2 in the
second game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, who extended his hitting streak to five games, is
batting .342 in his last 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies' only scoring occurred in the second inning when
Holt issued a two-out walk to Mickey Morandini, followed by Desi
Relaford's double to right. Wolf drove both home with his third hit
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Holt allowed just four hits over the final seven innings. He
retired 15 of the last 19 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he got settled down, he did what he does best _ he got
ground balls,'' Dierker said. ``It's no secret that the key to
pitching here is to try to get ground balls.''

nomination for New Jersey's U.S. Senate seat, the most telling two
words in his campaign are the ones Florio has refused to utter:
``I'm sorry.'' Both admirers and critics say it is hardly
surprising that Florio is standing by the one act that has most
defined his political career and infuriated New Jersey voters: the
$2.8-billion tax hike he pushed through the state legislature two
months after becoming governor. The tax hike, enacted in 1990, set
off a tirade by angry voters. Florio was cast into exile, and the
Democrats lost control of both houses of the state legislature. But
if the political fallout is the one indisputible thing about
Florio's term as governor, the tax increase raises two far more
complicated issues about him: first, was it smart policy, and,
second, what kind of a governor was he overall?

THE AD CAMPAIGN: BUSH'S ENVIRONMENTAL RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mo., Wis., Mich., Ohio)  By PETER MARKS  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since early December, the Sierra Club has been running
television commercials that attack Gov. George W. Bush's
environmental record in Texas. In this new 30-second spot, which is
going on the air this week in St. Louis, Milwaukee, Detroit and
Lansing, Mich., the organization is expanding its effort to portray
the Republican as indifferent to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Haddow Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: Shots of two Texas residents, Ed Parten of
Kingwood and Tamara Maschino of Seabrook, alternate with scenes of
sewage spilling into waterways, smoke billowing from factories and
a little girl being treated by a machine to assist her breathing.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: Parten: All of our lakes have water quality problems.
</P>
<P>
   Narrator: Texas leads the nation in the number of factories
violating clean water standards.
</P>
<P>
   Maschino: We've got too many children on breathing machines, too
many people with asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Narrator: Texas has the most industrial air pollution in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Maschino: We're in a crisis situation.
</P>
<P>
   Parten: We've contacted George Bush's office and he has the
attitude that he's not interested.
</P>
<P>
   Narrator: Call George Bush. Tell him to oppose legislation in
Congress that weakens penalties for clean air and water violators.
For our families, for our future.
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: Governors in large states seeking higher office have
to expect to run on their records, and the environment is an issue
on which Democrats believe Bush is highly vulnerable; Vice
President Al Gore regularly decries Bush's stewardship of a state
that ranks in several categories as one of the nation's most
polluted. Texas' vast and influential oil and chemical industries
have yielded the state riches but also some pollution problems.
Houston is among the nation's smoggiest cities, and the release of
toxins into waterways is a growing problem. But just as the Sierra
Club quotes from federal reports that describe Texas' environmental
flaws, Bush can cite some advancements, such as an initiative to
reduce emissions from older plants and the expansion of a program
begun by his predecessor, Ann W. Richards, a Democrat, to reward
companies that cut their toxic waste by half.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: The environmental advocacy group is spending $250,000
to run this commercial in four Midwestern and border states:
Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan and, next week, Ohio, all of which
are considered potentially decisive in the fall campaign. The
Sierra Club started its advertising blitz two months before the New
Hampshire primary and has emerged as one of the most active and
visible special-interest groups of the campaign on television. It
is planning to spend $8 million to raise public awareness of
environmental issues. Bush's efforts to counter the club's
assertions have been fairly low key, limited to events like a news
conference in April in which he unveiled a plan to hasten the
cleanup of abandoned industrial sites.

ANOTHER TOUGH LESSON FOR DODGERS' GAGNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers want to develop young right-hander
Eric Gagne, and they say they're willing to live with the
inconsistency that nearly every rookie fights through.
</P>
<P>
   Such ups and downs are part of the learning curve, but Gagne's
heard that enough and is ready for success. The frustrating part
for the 24-year-old is the learning is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case for Gagne this season, a few poor pitches
hurt dearly as he made just enough mistakes for the Cincinnati Reds
to take advantage of as the Dodgers lost 3-1 Tuesday at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers managed three hits as their six-game winning streak,
their longest since 1997, came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne's had trouble with the long ball in most of his outings,
and again it was the case against the Reds. He allowed two homers
and three runs in six innings, walking three and striking out four.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne fell to 0-3, and the Dodgers are 1-5 in his starts even
though he hasn't allowed more than four runs in any his outings.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth led off the bottom of the first with a single
to center, but the Dodgers didn't have another leadoff runner until
pinch-hitter F.P. Santangelo walked to lead off the eighth against
starter Osvaldo Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williamson relieved and walked Hollandsworth, but Mark
Grudzielanek grounded to third baseman Aaron Boone, who stepped on
the bag and threw to first for a double play. The Dodgers kept the
inning alive when Shawn Green walked, but Eric Karros struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez (1-0) allowed all three hits in seven-plus innings,
walking two and striking out four in winning for the first time
since he beat Houston on April 27, 1997, when he was pitching with
the San Francisco Giants. Danny Graves pitched the ninth for his
sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne, starting for the first time since May 7 and pitching for
the first time in nine days, battled with control at times.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the first on Karros' sacrifice
fly in the first inning. It was Karros' team-leading 39th RBI.
</P>
<P>
   But Gagne surrendered a leadoff double to Benito Santiago in the
third, and after a bunt by Fernandez moved Santiago to third, Pokey
Reese had an RBI groundout to tie it. Barry Larkin, who left the
game in the seventh with a sore left hand, gave the Reds a 2-1 lead
two pitches later when the Reds shortstop hit his third homer of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr., stifled by the Dodgers this season, hit Gagne's
first pitch of the sixth inning over the fence in left field.
Griffey Jr.'s 14th homer was the 10th allowed by Gagne this season
in 35 innings. Only Carlos Perez, who's yielded 12 homers in 47
innings, has given up more.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, who missed the past two seasons because of a pair of
right elbow surgeries, made seven minor-league starts before being
recalled May 1. He fought through the first inning in which the
first three batters reached base but the Dodgers managed only one
run. After that, Fernandez showed no signs of a pitcher who allowed
seven earned runs in 12 innings in two other starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   He kept the Dodgers off balance and in the infield. Ten of the
next 15 outs he recorded were via ground balls. The only runner in
scoring position came when Shawn Green doubled with two outs in the
third. Fernandez then retired nine straight before Karros' two-out
single in the sixth.

SHEFFIELD'S INJURY IS MINOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A possible disaster turned out to be nothing more
than a slight inconvenience when X-rays on Gary Sheffield's injured
right ankle were negative and will cause the all-star left fielder
to miss only a few games.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who sprained the ankle on two other occasions this
season, didn't start for the first time this season Tuesday against
Cincinnati, but he said he's hoping to return Friday against
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought when it happened it was worse than it was,''
Sheffield said. ``The way (team physician Dr. Frank Jobe) put the
X-rays on the board, I thought it was something worse. He said,
`Come over here and sit down,' so I could look at them better. He
just said I pulled ligaments again and stretched it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield injured the ankle sliding into second base trying to
break up a double play in the 11th inning of Monday's 14-inning win
against the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, examined at Centinela Hospital Medical Center by
Jobe, was officially diagnosed with strained ligaments in the
ankle, which has seen its share of trauma. He injured the ankle
initially April 8 in New York, then aggravated it when he stepped
on a ball May 1 during batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm (ticked) off about it,'' Sheffield said. ``My goal was to
play in every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Geronimo Berroa started in left field for the first time in
Sheffield's place, and his absence changes the complexion of the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, hitting .316 with 38 RBI and a team-leading 14
homers, was batting third with Shawn Green in cleanup. With
Sheffield out, Green batted third and Eric Karros fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield might miss only two games because of an off day
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's huge,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``They're
talking about giving him a little more support on the ankle. I'm
definitely not going to rush him. I'll leave it up to Sheff. He's
shooting for Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Fight fallout: Suspensions and fines levied against several
Dodgers could be announced today, but the club is already taking
precautions against possible civil suits stemming from last
Tuesday's melee at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Several players met with Dodgers senior vice president and
general counsel Sam Fernandez about the issue Monday. Though suits
have not been filed, several players were told by club officials
that attorneys in Chicago have contacted the Dodgers about
litigation, team sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, as well as the players, aren't commenting on
the particulars of the incident because of legal ramifications.
Dodgers officials also would not comment on the meetings with
players.
</P>
<P>
   Vegas vs. Vero: Representatives of the Dodgers began two days
worth of meetings Tuesday with officials from Las Vegas, during
which they're expecting to see more detailed concepts of a possible
spring training complex.
</P>
<P>
   However, Las Vegas apparently is fighting an uphill battle that
is going to be very difficult to win.
</P>
<P>
   If Florida Gov. Jeb Bush signs a bill this week to allocate $7
million to help keep the Dodgers in Vero Beach, Fla., it will be
nearly impossible for Las Vegas to rally, according to people close
to the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is expected to sign the bill, and a decision to remain at
Dodgertown under a long-term agreement could be announced within
two weeks of the signing.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Because of Thursday's off day, the Dodgers
juggled their starting rotation for the upcoming Philadelphia
series. Kevin Brown will pitch Friday, Darren Dreifort will go
Saturday and Carlos Perez will throw Sunday on eight days rest....
Dodgers right-hander Mike Fetters threw in the bullpen before the
game and is expected to be activated Friday. It will create a
roster problem, and although Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone
is trying to move one of his middle relievers, he isn't finding any
suitors. To make room for Fetters, the Dodgers might have to send
one of their current relievers, possibly newly acquired lefty
Trever Miller, to Triple-A Albuquerque.... Right-hander Gregg
Olson, on the disabled list since April 9, threw changeups without
pain for the first time during side work and is hopeful he can
begin a rehab assignment within 10 days.

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
INDIANAPOLIS _ Chalk one up for the hicks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers, who revel in their country-boy image,
blasted the city slickers from New York 102-88 Tuesday in Game 1 of
the Eastern Conference finals before 18,345 delirious fans at
Conseco Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   And wouldn't you know it, the Pacer who looks like the biggest
hayseed of them all is the one who did most of the damage, staking
Indiana to a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven series that resumes here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Square-jawed Austin Croshere, who could easily stand in as
Jethro Bodine from the old Beverly Hillbillies TV show, scored 22
points, including four big 3-pointers, to give the Pacers their
first-ever Game 1 victory in the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   And true to his image, Croshere gave little more than ``aw,
shucks'' responses to the media horde that surrounded him after the
game, giving credit to just about everybody but the guy who mopped
the sweat off the floor during timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to give a lot of credit to Rik Smits, who
played excellent offensively (scoring 10 of his 16 points in the
first quarter),'' Croshere said. ``He forced them (the Knicks) to
double-team him inside, and there's only so much help defense like
that can do on the weak side (opposite the ball).
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Reggie (Miller) and Jalen (Rose) out there, and they
(New York's defenders) were concerned about them. I was the open
man, and I just knocked down the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of shots.
</P>
<P>
   Left open by New York's rotating defense, Croshere hit seven of
his 10 field-goal attempts, including four of his five 3-point
tries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he had a great all-around game tonight,'' said Indiana
coach Larry Bird of Croshere. ``Austin's been struggling, worrying
about his shooting, but about every shot he's been taking has been
right on the money. They just haven't been going in for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, that is.
</P>
<P>
   And the same could be said of the entire Indiana roster. Dale
Davis had 14 points and a game-high 16 rebounds, Rose scored all 17
of his points in the second half, and Mark Jackson kept everyone
playing together, finishing with 11 points and 13 of the Pacers' 32
assists.
</P>
<P>
   That balance helped the Pacers get off to a quick start as they
knocked down 15 of their 29 first-period attempts. That offensive
excellence was highlighted when _ who else? _ Croshere caught
Jackson's missed 3-point heave in midair, glided under the basket
and flipped in a reverse layup as the buzzer sounded, putting the
Pacers up 35-17 at the end of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hole the Knicks were never able to escape. They made a
few runs, even cutting the Indiana lead to just two points late in
the third period. But they never did recover from that initial
blast from the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wasted a quarter tonight,'' said New York coach Jeff Van
Gundy. ``And when you waste a quarter in this league, you get
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, who finished with 21 points and eight rebounds
for the Knicks, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we gave them too much room tonight,'' he said. ``We
just didn't play strong enough defense from the beginning. I
thought that 88 points would be enough to win a playoff game like
this, but Indiana was hitting tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were led by Latrell Sprewell's 22 points, while Allan
Houston added 18 and Charlie Ward 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks appeared spent by their grueling series with Miami, a
seven-game affair that ended Sunday. It didn't give them much
turnaround time against an Indiana team that had been resting since
Friday, when it ousted Philadelphia in Game 6 of their conference
semifinal series.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks weren't going to say they were still worn down
from grappling with the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough series,'' Ewing said, ``but I can't use that as
an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not, but the Pacers certainly suspected the Knicks might
be a bit out of sync after the quick turnaround, especially given
the physical nature of the Miami series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get in the game quickly,'' said Miller, who
scored 19 points but made only eight of his 20 field-goal attempts.
``We understood they were coming off an emotional game with Miami
and thought they may be tired. They were, and we got into the game
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, who had been getting beaten badly by Smits early in the
game, suddenly woke up, scoring 11 of his 13 first-half points in
the final five minutes to rally the Knicks to within 52-48 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana built a nine-point third-quarter lead, going ahead 66-57
on a dunk by Davis with 5:43 left in the period. But the Knicks
again rallied, pulling within 68-66 on Ward's 3-pointer with 3:17
remaining in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks appeared to run out of gas at that point. Jackson
responded just 15 seconds later, nailing a 3-pointer to spark a
10-5 run to close the period.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana kept pouring it on in the fourth quarter, putting
together a 12-3 run over the first 6:13 to blow the game open.
Croshere nailed a 3-pointer with 6:17 left to give the Pacers an
88-74 lead, and though the Knicks made a couple of halfhearted runs
in an effort to get back, Indiana pretty much kept up a
double-digit lead the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the Knicks and Pacers have put on some
memorable shows, featuring some of the most high-profile stars in
the game in Miller, Ewing and Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   But Croshere?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about how Austin played,'' said Davis. ``If
we're going to win this series, that's the kind of effort we're
going to have to get.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
YES indeed, things can always be worse.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, these struggling Astros _ these
achy-breaky Astros _ could come from Philadelphia and call
themselves the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   But by the grace of the baseball gods, they are not. By the arm
of Chris Holt, too.
</P>
<P>
   If before Tuesday night you thought this Astros season had been
one bad trip after another, particularly if Montreal and Milwaukee
were on the itinerary, you were right.
</P>
<P>
   But compared to the Astros, the Phils could have looked more
dazed and confused only if Hunter S. Thompson had written the
script.
</P>
<P>
   Astros 10, Phillies 2 was riddled with seemingly rambling story
lines and incoherent twists, and none of them had to do with the
Astros. One feeble turn only seemed to be outdone by the next, and
none of them had to do with Doug Henry or Joe Slusarski.
</P>
<P>
   There was Phillies outfielder Bobby Abreu being waved around
third base in a 3-2 game after a Scott Rolen single in the third
inning. One problem: Abreu was thrown out so easily at the plate by
Jeff Bagwell that fans might have seen the Enron grass grow between
Abreu's strides.
</P>
<P>
   There was a nice throw from Phillies catcher Mike Lieberthal to
second base as he tried to nab Astros speedster Roger Cedeno trying
to steal. Another problem: No Phillie covered the bag, and the ball
rolled into center field.
</P>
<P>
   There was the keen if predictable intentional walk to Moises
Alou to load the bases in the seventh and set up a Phillies force
at any base. Yet another problem: Phillies reliever Jason Boyd
walked the next batter, Richard Hidalgo, to bring in a run and set
off the Astros romp.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it strange how all these bad things happen to the
other guys when it's the Astros getting the kind of pitching
performance they've been craving since Dome Dogs?
</P>
<P>
   ``A command performance,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said of
Holt's complete-game, 138-pitch effort.
</P>
<P>
   And go heavy on the command.
</P>
<P>
   Holt's slider consistently slid over the outside corner on
righthanders, well out of reach. His fastball moved this way, then
that, bending knees and racking up K's for him _ five in a row
during one stretch, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   His location was right on, which might also describe the timing
of this win considering the Astros were coming off seven losses in
a row and the ever-ominous players-only meeting earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Holt's arm probably will feel like it's going to fall off today
after grinding out the kind of marathon effort rarely seen since
the days of Movietone News highlights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to see that kind of effort in this day and
age,'' Dierker said. ``But we needed it. The secret to pitching
here is to try to get the other team to hit the ball on the ground,
and that's exactly what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it strange? On a night when Holt had all his stuff and
fought through fatigue in the heat and humidity, not only was the
other team the one that looked foolish, but the Astros looked
nothing like a team that bumbled through Montreal and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody wrote `No Lucky' on my locker when we were in
Montreal,'' Holt said. It was a deserved nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Holt's fortunes in numerous outings have been hard-luck by any
standard. In his previous start, Holt went seven innings and left
with a 6-2 lead against Cincinnati, only to see the lead vanish
along with the Astros' win.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night Holt was as fortunate in the early innings as
he was superb the rest of the way. Strange how that works out,
isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Holt benefited from a double play in the second inning after
giving up a leadoff single. In the third, when he still couldn't
find his best stuff, he got the ill-advised wave home from Phillies
third-base coach John Vukovich that led to Abreu's being nailed at
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I easily could have been out of there in the third or fourth
inning,'' Holt said. ``I didn't really feel like I was at my best.
I was lucky with the way a few things went my way and the defense
early. But then I started feeling a lot better and started making
good pitches. You've got to have those things if you're going to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   This might not have been the start of a turnaround for the ages.
Twelve games under .500 still is only a fraction better than the
Phillies' 13.
</P>
<P>
   But the Astros got everything going their way Tuesday night, and
it all revolved around a guy you probably would least have expected
to spark something impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, call Holt lucky. But call him good, too.

   BEIRUT _ With fingernails, fists and rifle butts, they tore
their way into Khiam prison _ south Lebanon's Bastille _ to free
the occupants of a place so brutal and hated that it has become one
of the most notorious lockups in the world.
</P>
<P>
   And the men who worked as turnkeys behind the barbed wire _
within the dirty white buildings that so often echoed with the
screams of torture _ simply abandoned their weapons, climbed into
their fancy cars and drove away across the landscape, almost
certainly into the arms of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's proxy force, the South Lebanon Army, jailers to some
160 men and women and children in this dismal place, left behind
extraordinary scenes. Triumphant villagers clambered up the
suddenly empty watch towers, planting Hezbollah flags and blasting
guns into the air.
</P>
<P>
   The SLA men leave with much blood on their hands, as
human-rights organizations have tirelessly reminded them. So do the
Israeli agents who trained them in interrogation techniques and _
in effect _ controlled the prison itself, in Israel's occupation
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them will now hope that their crimes will be forgotten,
drowned by the chaos and tragedies which flow from Israel's
precipitous retreat and the SLA's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But their detainees won't forget. Not ever.
</P>
<P>
   One white-haired prisoner screamed ``Freedom! Freedom!'' as
villagers _ mostly Shia _ smashed down his cell door with their
bare hands. ``We are actually free at last!'' Others _ overjoyed,
overwhelmed _ fainted with joy as their relatives poured in.
</P>
<P>
   According to an Associated Press reporter _ who witnessed the
liberation _ another man fell out of his cell, kissing the ground
and sobbing incessantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what was going on at all, but we had a feeling
we'd be out soon because of all the shelling and bombing we have
been hearing,'' said another, as he ran from the building. ``We
chased them away. Our people actually won. They avenged us.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted, hollow-cheeked, but almost hysterical with joy, some
prisoners began to destroy the very jail that had held them _ and
many hundreds of other enemies of the SLA _ for so long.
</P>
<P>
   They smashed down doors. They shattered windows. The chanted
``long live Nasrallah!'' _ the head of the leader of their
Hezbollah ``liberators.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God damn them. God damn them!'' screamed one man, as he
pounded a desk with his rifle butt.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the villagers ``captured'' an abandoned armored
personnel carrier, and lurched off joyously down the hill to nearby
Khiam village where they were given a rapturous welcome _ a pelting
with rice and rose petals.
</P>
<P>
   The horrors of Khiam have yet to be fully written. Human-rights
groups _ the Lebanese Follow-Up Committee for Detainees in Israeli
Jails, for instance _ have said that electrocution and beating were
routine.
</P>
<P>
   Detainees, it said, were often hung from posts for hours and
beaten with steel rods on their heads and genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday this hellhole was consigned to history. ``The
nightmare is over,'' said one snowy-haired detainee, ``I can't
believe the nightmare is actually over.'' &QL;

`TIRED' DODGERS FIZZLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two weeks of being on the road, followed by a
cross-country flight and a 14-inning game, apparently caught up
with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   And so did Cincinnati right-hander Osvaldo Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   With Gary Sheffield on the bench with a sprained right ankle,
the potent Dodgers lineup mustered three hits as the Reds won 3-1
Tuesday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez's first win since pitching for San Francisco three
years ago ended the Dodgers' winning streak at six, their longest
since the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked a little tired,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``We had a long day (Monday) and looked a little flat. We
didn't hit any balls hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie right-hander Eric Gagne (0-3) continued his solid
pitching but without results. He allowed three runs, including solo
homers to Barry Larkin and Ken Griffey Jr., in six innings, but is
still searching for his first win.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also aren't scoring a bundle of runs in Gagne's
starts. He hasn't allowed more than four runs in any of his
outings, but the Dodgers are 1-5 in his starts.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help on this night that Fernandez, who missed the last
two seasons because of a pair of elbow surgeries, looked more like
the renowned pitcher he was years ago pitching for the Cuban
national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never really threw me the same pitch twice,'' said Dodgers
catcher Todd Hundley, who struck out four times, three of which
were against Fernandez. ``He struck me out with three different
pitches. He had great command of his fastball, great command of his
offspeed stuff. He wouldn't give in.''
</P>
<P>
   The only threat the Dodgers had against Fernandez came when Todd
Hollandsworth led off the first with a single, Mark Grudzielanek
was hit by a pitch and Shawn Green walked. Eric Karros gave the
Dodgers their only run with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the next 15 outs Fernandez (1-0) recorded came via ground
ball. The Dodgers' only other hits were Green's two-out double in
the third and Karros' two-out single in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had a chance off reliever Scott Williamson in the
eighth, but Grudzielanek grounded into a double play with two on
and none out, and after Green walked, Karros struck out. Danny
Graves struck out the side in the ninth for his eighth save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a slider on the first pitch of the game, so that tells
you something,'' Hollandsworth said. ``This team's been fighting
all year. You can probably count on one hand games we didn't have a
chance to win. In the eighth, we had a chance, but things didn't
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds took a 2-1 lead in the third when Benito Santiago led
off with a double and eventually scored on Pokey Reese's RBI
groundout. Larkin, who left the game in the seventh with a sore
left hand, gave the Reds the lead two pitches later when the Reds
shortstop hit his third homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey Jr., stifled by the Dodgers this season, hit Gagne's
first pitch of the sixth inning over the fence in left field.
Griffey Jr.'s 14th homer was the 10th allowed by Gagne this season
in 35 innings. Only Carlos Perez, who's yielded 12 homers in 47
innings, has given up more.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Being tired) is not what it was,'' Dodgers shortstop Jose
Vizcaino said. ``(Fernandez) pitched a great game. He's been out
for two years, but he knows how to pitch. He's experienced. He's
pitched like that in San Francisco.''

MATVICHUK'S PLAY MAKES STRONG ARGUMENT FOR STARS' DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Fort Worth Star-Telegram staff 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ After surrendering 79 shots in two games in Colorado,
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock expected a better effort from his defense
in Game 5. After all, defense has been the Stars' strength for
several seasons and was a key to last year's Stanley Cup run.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock got it last night from all his defenders, most notably
Richard Matvichuk. Not only was Matvichuk second on the team in ice
time with 29:20 (trailing only Derian Hatcher), but he dished out
four hits and recorded a team-high five blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   And he most likely made the play that saved the game in the
first period. Ed Belfour had come out of the crease to make one
save, and when the puck got loose behind Belfour, Colorado's Shjon
Podein had an open net and fired.
</P>
<P>
   But Matvichuk got his stick on the puck just before it reached
the goal line, clearing it and saving a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we all had to play better,'' Matvichuk said. ``We knew
we had to even out the chances and keep their shot total low. We
need to be giving up 15 or 20 shots per game, not 40 or 45.''
\Nsubheds:Hot, hot, hot The Stars are hotter than you think. The
record-high temperatures aren't helping the ice in Reunion Arena.
It was hot outside and hot inside, turning the ice into slush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hot,'' Stars center Guy Carbonneau said. ``It's hot
outside, so obviously, at the end of the game it was hot. When the
ice gets soft, it does get chippy. You can see it a lot. They use
the flip a lot, and we use it a lot, and our defensemen were having
a tough time handling the puck. But both teams play on the same
ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Stars winger Brett Hull: ``Temperature-wise, it's the
hottest I've been in a long time.'' \Nsubheds:About faceoffs The
Stars may have won the war against the Colorado Avalanche in Game
5, but they're still losing a very important battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche won 42 of 71 faceoffs last night. Stephane Yelle
won 14 of 20, Peter Forsberg had a 15-12 advantage, and Chris Drury
won 10 of 17.
</P>
<P>
   For the Stars, Guy Carbonneau won just 26 percent (six of 23),
and Mike Modano lost 18 of his 31 chances. The Stars finally gained
the advantage in overtime, winning six of nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a point that we've tried to address,'' Modano said.
``We're just trying to get our wingers involved, if there are any
loose pucks around our feet, just trying to help us out as much as
possible. \RThe Avalanche\S have some strong faceoff guys.''
\Nsubheds:Gaining, stopping power The Stars took advantage of the
power play. Their second goal came while Colorado forward Serge
Aubin was serving a board-check penalty in the second period. The
Stars' first goal, by Jere Lehtinen, came just as Avalanche forward
Adam Deadmarsh, fresh off a high-sticking call, returned to the
ice.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were just as potent at stopping the Avalanche's
chances. The Avs went 0-for-4 last night, getting only four shots.
\Nsubheds:Quieted The Stars' locker room was silent during the
intermission after the game went into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a good read on \Rthe game\S,'' coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``I've never seen our dressing room that quiet, but
we responded well. One minute after the game, it was quiet again.
We know the type of battle we're in right now. It is taking
everything this group has to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Stars forward Joe Nieuwendyk: ``You just need to get your
rest. The first three periods were awfully tough out there. You
come in the dressing room and you don't have much time to think
about it.'' \Nsubheds:Blurring the lines Ken Hitchcock kept the
lineup he had in Game 4. The lines? Well, not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of having the last change, Hitchcock used Mike
Keane and Guy Carbonneau together as a sort-of checking line. After
the Stars took a 2-1 lead in the second period, Kirk Muller joined
them, reuniting what had been the Stars' primary checking line in
Games 2 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   They were the first line on the ice after winger Brett Hull's
go-ahead goal. \Nsubheds:Briefly Since moving to Dallas, the Stars
have won six of seven series after winning Game 5. And since 1987,
the NHL team that won Game 5 in a series tied, 2-2, has won 63 of
the 74 series.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had not allowed a first-period goal at home in an NHL
record 12 consecutive games, but the Avs' Jon Klemm ended the
streak when he scored off a rebound 12:11 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are 9-0 in the past nine games in which Brett Hull
scored. {Compiled by staff writers Jennifer Floyd, Charean
Williams, Cody Bailey, Mac Engel, J. Douglas Foster and Tracey
Myers.}

BLOWN CHANCES IN OT HAUNT SAKIC, COLORADO
</HEADLINE>
 CHANCES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Joe Sakic's blank face revealed the depth of this
growing mess. That's blank, as in no goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Avalanche captain has few words left, mainly tired
cliches about hanging in there, to explain his utter futility for
the second consecutive playoff series against the Dallas Stars. He
had two chances to win Tuesday night's Game 5 in overtime. He had
five shots altogether, and three others whizzed wide of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic had a nifty third-period assist to tie the game, but his
efforts mainly came up empty as the Avs suddenly find their backs
against the wall after Tuesday night's 3-2 overtime loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which one? I don't know,'' Sakic said when asked which missed
chance irked him the most. ``Throw them all in.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't really matter. The Avs, once seemingly in control of
this series, are one loss from catching the season's final spring
skiing as one of the most prolific scorers in the game has
seemingly lost his touch.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic hasn't scored a goal since May 5 against Detroit. He has
only two in 15 playoff games. His first oh-so-close chance in
overtime was a rocket from the left circle. Stars goalie Ed Belfour
dropped to his knees and gobbled it up.
</P>
<P>
   If Sakic thought he couldn't believe his missed chance near the
left post in the first period of Game 4, his blown chance at the
9:48 mark of overtime might require the Avs to hire a team
therapist.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic corralled a rebound off Dave Andreychuk's liner from the
high slot. Positioned at the right side of the crease, Sakic had
the puck, he had time, but, again, he didn't have any luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to drag it by him (Belfour) and put it in,'' Sakic
said. ``I think it almost got under him, but it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The puck hit Belfour's pad, went under his leg, but stopped
short of crossing the goal line. It was a cruel reminder of the
first period when Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk denied Shjon
Podein by sweeping the puck off the goal line after Belfour got
caught out of the net.
</P>
<P>
   That other Joe, as in the Stars' Joe Nieuwendyk, put in the
game-winner less than three minutes after Sakic's miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it goes,'' Sakic said. ``You've got to park it
and try to do the same thing next game.''
</P>
<P>
   It gets more difficult with each denied chance to believe Sakic
and the Avs can simply park it, meaning leave the bad vibes behind
and move on. In the past three games, they've seemingly done
everything within the rules of the game to beat Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   They've fired 110 shots at him. Only five have gone in. The Avs
have not scored more than two goals in any of the five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to keep going, we have to find a way to score
more goals than that,'' Avs defenseman Ray Bourque said. ``We had
our chances to win in regulation and overtime. We are getting the
opportunities we need. The work is there, and we are playing good
enough to win a lot of these games.''
</P>
<P>
   They just need to put the puck in the net. nn

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Who runs the Big Game lottery?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Big Game is a collaborative endeavor on behalf of the
seven participating states: Georgia, Illinois, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia. Lottery directors
for each of the participating states ``run'' the Big Game and serve
as Big Game officials. Key duties are shared among the directors of
all seven states. Detailed information can be found online at
www.theofficialbiggame.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the Lincoln penny, why does the portrait of Abraham
Lincoln face to the right, when all other portraits of presidents
on U.S. circulating coins face left?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lincoln's likeness is an adaption of a plaque executed by
portraitist and sculptor Victor David Brenner. The U.S. Mint
explained that his facing to the right simply was the choice of the
designer, and wasn't mandated. President Theodore Roosevelt was
said to be so impressed with Brenner's plaque design that he
recommended to the secretary of the Treasury that it be placed on a
coin to be issued in 1909, the Lincoln Centennial Year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sports announcers also often use the term ``bonehead play.''
Do you know its origin?
</P>
<P>
   A: As is often the case with slang, researchers are faced with
conflicting claims. But it appears that the original ``bonehead
play'' was made in September 1908 by Fred Merkle of the New York
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   His team and the Chicago Cubs were tied 1-1. It was the last of
the ninth, two outs, and the Giants had Moose McCormick on third
and Merkle on first. The next man up, Al Bridwell, singled to
center field and McCormick crossed the plate with what appeared to
be the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   The play wouldn't be complete, however, until Merkle touched
second base ahead of the ball. With two outs, no runs can score
until a possible force play has been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming the game was over when McCormick crossed the plate,
Merkle stopped short of second base and veered to the clubhouse.
Johnny Evers of the Cubs signaled for the center fielder to throw
him the ball so he could tag second, forcing out Merkle. The
winning run was nullified, and the game wasn't counted in the
standings.
</P>
<P>
   A sportswriter referred to Merkle's blunder as a ``bonehead
play,'' and it caught on to forever more mean ``dumb play'' in
sports lingo.
</P>
<P>
   Merkle's play became all the more important later in the season
when the Cubs and Giants finished tied for first place, and the
Cubs won the pennant in a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some months ago, a network TV news story concerning the
importance of each senator casting his or her vote mentioned an
instance when a member was brought into the Senate on a stretcher
to cast his vote. Because he was dying of a brain tumor, he
couldn't speak, and voted by making a gesture with his hand. Can
you confirm this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's true. It occurred on June 19, 1964, when Sen. Clare
Engle (D-Calif.) was brought to the Senate by ambulance and wheeled
into the chamber. He feebly raised his arm in support of a motion
to end debate on the civil rights bill and proceed to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   A vote was required to break the filibuster, and Engle's
dramatic gesture provided the turning point. It was the first time
in history that the Senate voted for cloture (the cutting off of
debate) on a civil rights bill.
</P>
<P>
   Engle was elected to the House in 1944 from rural Northern
California. Often seen hurrying through the Capitol's corridors,
trailing a great cloud of cigar smoke behind him, he was known as
``Congressman Fireball'' and ``the only active volcano in the
House.'' He was elected to the Senate in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   He had undergone two brain operations, the first of which, on
Aug. 24, 1963, left his speech impaired and his right side
partially paralyzed. On April 24, 1964, a craniotomy was performed,
and four days later he dropped his candidacy for re-election. He
died at age 52 on July 30, 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With all the attention on gun control lately, I was
wondering: Are there any statistics showing the percentage of U.S.
households that have guns in them now, compared to, say, 50 years
ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics, a publication
of the Justice Department, doesn't go back as far as 1950. Nor does
it have current statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But you can get an idea from its earliest figures, for 1959, and
its most recent ones, for 1997. In 1959, 49 percent of American
households reported having a gun in the home; 51 percent, no guns.
In 1997, 42 percent reported having a gun; 57 percent, no guns (the
remaining 1 percent listed ``no opinion.'')
</P>
<P>
   Q: How are Big Game lottery revenues allotted?
</P>
<P>
   A: About 51 percent accounts for the shared prize pool for all
seven participating Big Game states, which includes the jackpot
amount and eight other prize amounts, which range from $1 to
$150,000. After that, about 35 percent goes toward education; about
7 percent to retailers; and 7 percent to operating costs. The Big
Game states are Massachusetts, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia,
Georgia, Michigan and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Pope John Paul II celebrated his 80th birthday on May 18. In
light of his longevity, can you tell us who was the oldest pontiff,
and who served as pope the longest?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bill Ryan of the U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington said
he couldn't come up with a definitive answer for the first part of
the question because the ages of some early popes aren't known for
certain. However, he added this: ``Surely one of the oldest was
Pope Leo XIII, who was 93 when he died in 1903.''
</P>
<P>
   Pius IX, who was born in 1792, enjoyed the longest reign in
papal history: June 16, 1846, to Feb. 7, 1878. Leo XIII reigned
second-longest: Feb. 20, 1878, to July 20, 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, who is seventh on the list of
longest-reigning pontiffs, will move up to sixth in early October.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My co-workers and I are debating the metropolitan population
of Atlanta, compared to Charlotte. Some say they saw on the
Internet that Charlotte's metro area has 5 1/2 million, which would
be considerably more than Atlanta's 3.8 million. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: On its Web site (www.charlottecvb.org/visitor.cfm), the
Charlotte Convention and Visitors Bureau lists a population of
``more than 500,000 people'' within the city's borders, and about
1.3 million within the metro area. On its Web site
(www.acvb.com/atlanta5.html), the Atlanta Convention and Visitors
Bureau lists a population of 425,200 for the city, and 3.5 million
for the 20-county metropolitan statistical area.
</P>
<P>
   These are the numbers from the 1990 census: Atlanta, 394,017
(city); 2,833,511 (metropolitan statistical area); Charlotte,
395,934 (city); 1,162,093 (N.C.-S.C. metropolitan statistical area,
which includes Charlotte and Gastonia, N.C., and Rock Hill, S.C.).
New, official statistics eventually will be available from the 2000
census.
</P>
<P>
   Your Charlotte-boosting co-workers may have seen a reference on
that city's Web site to 6 million people ``within a 100-mile
radius.'' There's no comparable claim on the Atlanta CVB's Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the expression ``cracker,'' as in
Georgia cracker or Florida cracker?
</P>
<P>
   A: This question comes up often and never fails to sit up
debate, because there are several theories. The Facts on File
Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins offers this information:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cracker'' refers to a poor white person, especially one from
Georgia, so called, perhaps, from his or her use of cracked corn.
The expression originally was ``corncracker,'' someone who cracks
corn to make grits or cornmeal. At one time cracker meant ``a
liar,'' but when, after the Civil War, many people in the South
became too poor to buy cornmeal and had to make their own, cracker
came to mean a backwoodsman and then a poor white, generally a
person living in Georgia and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Others say cracker originally was applied to Florida cowboys,
and derived from their cracking their whips as they herded cattle.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the term now is generally considered offensive. But
many people are proud to call themselves Georgia (or Florida)
crackers, as long as they're the ones doing the calling.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I understand that there has been some legal wrangling
involved in Sue, the dinosaur. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be referring to a dispute that evolved after skeletal
remains of the Tyrannosaurus rex were discovered in South Dakota on
land owned by Maurice Williams, a member of the Cheyenne River
Sioux Indians. The skeleton was found in 1990 by fossil hunter Sue
Hendrickson, who was employed by the Black Hills Institute of
Geological Research.
</P>
<P>
   The institute paid Williams $5,000 for the find, but two years
later the U.S. government claimed it owned the land and should have
custody of the skeleton. The matter wound up in a U.S. District
Court, which finally gave Williams the right to put the fossil
bones up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Sotheby's in New York arranged with Williams to auction
the bones on his behalf. The Field Museum of Chicago _ with
financial support from McDonald's and Walt Disney corporations and
the California State University System _ prevailed in a bidding war
with an offer of $7.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   A later dispute was settled more readily. The dinosaur first was
named Sue, after its discoverer. Then the Field Museum sponsored a
contest for a new name, coming up with Dakota. But after museum
lawyers advised that Dakota had the potential to cause legal
problems, museum officials went back to Sue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why aren't the opening prayer in Congress and the motto ``In
God We Trust'' on coins deemed contrary to the separation of church
and state?
</P>
<P>
   A: In 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the practice of
opening sessions of Congress with a prayer didn't violate the ban
on establishment of religion expressed in the Constitution's First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The court noted that the practice dated to the first Congress,
the same Congress that adopted the First Amendment. ``The practice
of opening legislative sessions with prayer has become part of the
fabric of our society,'' the court stated. ``To invoke divine
guidance on a public body entrusted with making the laws is not, in
these circumstances, a violation of the Establishment Clause; it is
simply a tolerable acknowledgement of beliefs widely held among the
people of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In God We Trust'' is one of several inscriptions on coins
mandated by Title 31, Section 324, of the U.S. Code. In the case of
Aronow v. U.S. in 1970, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals'
decision upholding the slogan included this statement: ``It is
quite obvious that the national motto and the slogan on coin and
currency In God We Trust has nothing whatsoever to do with the
establishment of religion. Its use is of a patriotic or ceremonial
character and bears no true resemblance to a government sponsorship
of a religious exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have two MIA bracelets with the names of Capt. Hugh Fanning
(MIA 10/31/67) and M/Sgt. Edward Dodge (MIA 12/31/64). I would like
to know what happened to them. Where do I start?
</P>
<P>
   A: The P.O.W. Network _ online at www.asde.net/(tilde)pownet/ _
is a good resource. You enter the last name of the person you're
inquiring about, and are given a field of names, some of which are
identical. In the case of Fanning and Dodge, a lot of information
is available, but it's not conclusive on either one.
</P>
<P>
   Fanning and his bombardier were believed to have been shot down
over North Vietnam on a night mission Oct. 31, 1967. In August
1984, remains purported to be his were returned by the Vietnamese
and were buried with full military honors in Oklahoma City. But in
July 1985, his widow, Kathryn, acting on conflicting information
about the remains, arranged for them to be exhumed and examined.
The examiner concluded that they couldn't be scientifically
identified, so the official identification was rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge, based at Da Nang with a Special Forces group, flew on
Dec. 31, 1964, as observer on one of two aircraft that took off in
marginal weather conditions. They were to make a delivery to a
Special Forces camp in the A Shau Valley. Dodge's aircraft was
observed by personnel aboard the other aircraft turning and
becoming obscured by clouds, not to be seen again. While some
returned POWs speculated that Dodge may have been taken captive,
there was no proof, so his case continues to be unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I don't foresee most people wanting to carry many dollar
coins in their pockets or pocketbooks, as opposed to the
easier-to-handle paper dollars. So why is the Mint producing them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Mint claims that demand has increased for a dollar coin
in commerce. Because the government's supply of Susan B. Anthony
dollars is nearly exhausted, it was believed that a new coin was
needed. And to make it easily distinguishable from other change, it
was decided that it should be ``golden.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mint explained that the increase in demand is attributable
to ``a growing recognition in the vending industry of the benefits
of dollar coins, including the convenience that comes from more
rapid transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Paper dollars obviously aren't going away, so if you like them
better, the choice is yours.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is kudzu, the vine that is so predominant in the South, the
same thing as ginkgo, which is an ingredient of some vitamin
supplements? What are their scientific names?
</P>
<P>
   A: They aren't the same. Kudzu (scientific name: Pueraria
lobata) belongs to the pea family, Fabaceae or Leguminosae. Ginkgo
(scientific name: Ginkgo biloba) makes up the division Ginkgophyta
and the ginkgo family, Ginkgoceae.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever became of David Stockman, the budget director in
President Reagan's administration?
</P>
<P>
   A: On Aug. 1, 1985, after serving as director of the Office of
Management and Budget from 1981 _ and being given a large share of
credit for steering the Reagan administration's tax reductions and
domestic spending cuts through Congress _ Stockman resigned to
become a managing director at the New York investment banking firm
Salomon Brothers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he left Salomon Brothers to become senior managing
director at the Blackstone Group, also in New York, a company
involved in leveraged buyout investments.
</P>
<P>
   And last September Stockman, who is now 53, left Blackstone to
form Heartland Industrial Group, a private equity firm focusing on
undervalued industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   Heartland, by the way, made headlines in business circles
earlier this month when Cynthia Hess, one of Detroit's top-ranking
female automotive engineers and a key architect of the Chrysler PT
Cruiser, jumped from DaimlerChrysler to join Heartland.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that singer Marvin Gaye's father served little to no
jail time for murdering his legendary son. Is this true? And where
is he now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Marvin Gay Sr. _ his singer son added the extra letter to him
name when he launched his Motown singing career _ died at age 84 in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1984, he pleaded no contest in Los Angeles Superior
Court to voluntary manslaughter in the shooting death of his son
the previous April. The charge was reduced from first-degree murder
on a plea bargain. A coroner's report showed that drugs were found
in Gaye's system, and photos showed that the elder man had been
beaten by his much larger son. Judge Gordon Ringer suspended the
prison term and placed Gay on five years' probation, saying:
``Sending Gay to prison or requiring additional county jail time
would be a death sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay Sr., a retired apostolic minister, had surgery in May 1984
for a nonmalignant tumor in his skull.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many African-American players are there in the National
Hockey League?
</P>
<P>
   A: The NHL prefers to use the term ``minority players.'' These
were among those listed by the NHL on 1999-2000 rosters: Paul
Kariya, Anaheim Mighty Ducks; Rumun Ndur, Atlanta Thrashers; Anson
Carter, Boston Bruins; Grant Fuhr, Jarome Iginla and Fred
Brathwaite, Calgary Flames; David Tanabe, Carolina Hurricanes;
Blair Atcheynum, Chicago Blackhawks; Sean Brown, Mike Grier and
Georges Laraque, Edmonton Oilers; Peter Worrell, Florida Panthers;
Jamie Storr, Los Angeles Kings; Scott Gomez and Sheldon Souray, New
Jersey Devils; Gino Odjick and Jamie Rivers, New York Islanders;
Jason Doig, Theoren Fleury and Manny Malhotra, New York Rangers;
Joe Juneau, Ottawa Senators; Sandy McCarthy and Craig Berube,
Philadelphia Flyers; Jamal Mayers, St. Louis Blues; Donald
Brashear, Steve Kariya, Kevin Weekes and Harry York, Vancouver
Canucks; and Chris Simon, Washington Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the Oct. 4 issue of Sports Illustrated said
Edmonton's Grier is the only American-born and American-trained
black player in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son is studying the Civil War in his history class. Is
that where the expression ``Don't shoot until you see the whites of
their eyes'' comes from?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It dates to the American Revolution. The Oxford
Dictionary of Quotations traces it to the American Gen. Israel
Putnam (1718-90), who issued this order: ``Men, you are all
marksmen. Don't one of you fire until you see the white of their
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you give us any background information on Edward Egan,
the new archbishop of New York? I haven't seen much about him other
than the fact that he was chosen to succeed the late Cardinal John
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   A: Archbishop-designate Egan, 68, who has led the Bridgeport,
Conn., diocese since 1988, was auxiliary bishop to O'Connor from
1985 to 1988 and had been widely predicted as his likely successor.
</P>
<P>
   Egan was born April 2, 1932, in Oak Park, Ill. After theological
studies at the Gregorian University in Rome, where he later
received a doctorate in canon law, he was ordained in December 1957
to the priesthood for the Chicago archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   His positions have included assistant chancellor of the
Archdiocese of Chicago; assistant vice rector of the North American
College in Rome; an auditor of the Sacred Roman Rota, which is the
ordinary court of appeals for canonical cases appealed to the
Vatican, particularly regarding the validity of marriage; judge of
the Tribunal of the Rota; and professor of procedural law on the
law faculty of the Rota. In 1983, he was a member of the committee
of six canonists who reviewed the final draft of the New Code of
Canon Law with Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Described as an uncompromising defender of traditional Vatican
teachings, Egan will become the 12th archbishop of New York when he
is formally installed June 19. He is also widely expected to be
elevated to cardinal by Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was a kid, I used to take a big passenger train from
Atlanta to Savannah. Do you know the name of that train?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was the Central of Georgia's Nancy Hanks. It ended its
Atlanta-Macon-Savannah runs on April 30, 1971, after 24 years of
service.

 &HT;    GRAPEVINE: Rumors, gossip from the world of wrestling
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Troubles in Extreme Championship Wrestling continued this week.
It's weekly TNN show had its lowest ratings since its debut. Going
head-to-head with the NBA playoffs is believed to be the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ECW will move his September pay-per-view ``Anarchy Rulz'' to
October. No reason was given.
</P>
<P>
   Head honcho Paul Heyman offered Raven his unconditional release.
The move come after Heyman refused to use Raven in the ECW's latest
pay-per-view. Heyman has been vocal in his displeasure with Raven
work ethic since his return to ECW after a falling out with Bill
Busch and WCW. The expected departure comes at a bad time for ECW,
which also just lost Lance Storm to WCW last week. Meanwhile, Raven
will be beating down Vince McMahon's door looking for a job with
the World Wrestling Federation, but he could also find a position
with WCW now that Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff are calling the
shots.
</P>
<P>
   _ McMahon might want to scoop up Raven quickly because his
charges are losing wrestlers at an alarming rate. The Big Show will
be out of action for up to a month with knee surgery. Chris Benoit
and Perry Saturn both dragged themselves out sick bed to wrestle at
the ``Judgement Day'' pay-per-view. Benoit had the flu, while it is
suspected that Saturn may have had a case of food poisoning. But
the worse news is that 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin may be nowhere
near returning to the ring. Reports out of Texas are that Austin's
doctors have advised him to push back any hope for a ring return at
least another three months to the Survivor Series. The
disappointing news may be the result of rushing Austin back for an
appearance last month at the ``Backlash'' pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaking of ``Judgement Day'', it wasn't a very good day for
following the script. The match between Edge, Christian and Kurt
Angle against Too Cool and Rikishi ended later then expected
because of a kick out by Edge when he was suppose to be pinned.
Also, the main event - ``Iron Man'' one-hour match _ ran a little
longer than the 60 minutes. The Undertaker's surprise run-in came
when the clock on the television was at 60:08, that was suppose to
cause the DW of The Rock and give the title to Triple H. One
problem, the match is over at 60:00.
</P>
<P>
   _ The return of the Undertaker will also mean a new joint
venture for the WWF. Rapper Kid Rock will debut his single
``American Badass'' on Monday's Raw is War. His CD will be released
the next day. The single will become the entrance theme music for
the Undertaker.
</P>
<P>
   _ While Storm has left ECW, his valet, Dawn Marie, is still in
ECW and looking for a new wrestler to latch onto. Steve Corino's
group might be a good match, although it would be interesting to
and chance to move in a different directions with his gimmick if
popular Jerry Lynn were to add the annoying Marie to his act.
</P>
<P>
   _ Injury problems are not limited to the WWF. Arn Anderson broke
a bone his his foot during a recent Thunder taping.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expect to finally see Goldberg when WCW has its Nitro in
Atlanta on June 5. He probably will not wrestle but he will be in
person.

   _ Speaking of Goldberg, he was the guest of Lakers superstar
Shaquille O'Neal for a recent Lakers-Suns playoff game. The
friendship may amount to something this summer, when the Lakers
season is over. O'Neal may find a limited role in the WCW, much

   _ Wrestling movies are continuing their run. WCW's ``Ready to
Rumble'' has grossed $12.27 million in six weeks. By comparison,
John Cusack's critically acclaimed ``High Fidelity'' has earned
twice that during the same amount of time. Of course runaway hit
``Gladiator'' made $52.5 million its first weekend. Meanwhile, the
documentary ``Beyond the Mat'' is up to $2.047 million despite
running in many less theaters. But the number of theaters showing
the behind the scenes look at wrestling has steadily increased each
week and could reach 100 this week.

NOW'S THE TIME FOR NOBODY TO COME TO OUR NATION'S AID 

</HEADLINE>
   By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congressman Tony Schnell is a man completely without principle,
a witless, soulless, gutless good-for-nothing who came out of
nowhere and has done zero, zilch, zippo since. He's a nobody, a
nonentity, a big, fat goose-egg.
</P>
<P>
   Think I'm being harsh? Eh, I say these things about Tony because
I love the guy. In fact, I like the good-for-nothing galoot so
much, I'm now running his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Tony, I'm convinced, is a man for our times. A steady stream of
no-accounts and n'er-do-wells flows through our nation's capital,
but fellows like him don't drift by often. We need to grab his tie
and hold on.
</P>
<P>
   Let me give you an example of Tony's abilities: He has never,
ever uttered a word on the floor of the House of Representatives,
but he's so feared by his colleagues that they recently passed a
bill designed to shut him up permanently. A guy like that, you just
gotta believe in.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Schnell is an empty suit of the truest sort. He
doesn't exist. He's the creation of Internet pranksters.
</P>
<P>
   A year or so ago, messages began circulating on the Internet
warning computer users of a dastardly plan to charge them extra to
send e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings came from a loquacious lady named Kate Turner,
ostensibly an assistant to Richard Stepp of the law firm of Berger,
Stepp and Gorman.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service, Kate said, is losing $230 million a
year in revenue because of the Internet, prompting a plan to offset
losses by imposing a five-cent surcharge on each piece of e-mail
sent.
</P>
<P>
   The author of this bill was none other than Congressman Tony
Schnell, a technological know-nothing who _ according to some
versions _ ``has even suggested a $20 to $40 per month surcharge on
all Internet service'' on top of the nickel-an-e-mail charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't sit by and watch your freedoms erode away!'' Kate said.
``Send this e-mail to EVERYONE on your list, and tell all your
friends and relatives to say `No!' to Bill 602-P.''
</P>
<P>
   The messages spread rapidly and began to mutate. Some versions
identified Tony as a Republican in the U.S. House, while others
made him a liberal ``backbencher'' in Canada. The U.S. Postal
Service began to share the blame with the Federal Communications
Commission. In time, Tony grew agitated with e-mail sapping profits
from long-distance telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Postmaster, the FCC and, for all I know, the Royal
Canadian Mounties all issued statements saying the proposal was
bogus, that nobody was talking about a special Internet tax, that
Tony Schnell was a nobody.
</P>
<P>
   But on Capitol Hill, the e-mail, letters and phone calls poured
in. ``The reality is that more people are communicating with us on
this than any other subject _ more than abortion, more than Elian,
more than gas prices,'' says Rep. Fred Upton, a real, live
Republican from Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   So Upton wrote a bill to block the nonexistent Schnell's
nonexistent proposal. And it passed, despite some objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are considering today is a fabricated solution to an
imaginary problem,'' Rep. John Dingell, a real, live Democrat from
Michigan, intoned on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is not bogus,'' Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, a real,
live Republican from Louisiana, retorted. ``There are real lawyers
litigating in the courts on this issue today.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC, for its part, politely called Upton's bill
``superfluous.'' Congress, a commission spokesman said, ``has a
right to legislate policy, and we respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, I'm not a big fan of Internet hoaxes. But the saga
of Tony Schnell is making me reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you like to see Congress finally do something to shore
up Social Security? Wouldn't you like to see campaign finance
reform?
</P>
<P>
   Why not get the fake Schnell to write fake bills proposing, say,
that the Social Security Administration send out cans of cat food
instead checks every other month, or that the Federal Elections
Commission issue candidates big boxes of Glad trash bags to carry
away campaign donations?
</P>
<P>
   Before you can say, ``You've got mail,'' real, live congressmen
will jump into action and stop Tony.
</P>
<P>
   I already have a slogan for his re-election: ``What the hell.
Maybe it's time for Schnell.''

FIGURING THE COST OF RAISING A CHILD 

</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Department of Agriculture has figured that an average,
middle-income family will spend more than $160,000 to raise a child
born in 1999 through age 17.
</P>
<P>
   This seems like an incredibly low figure as my wife and I figure
we spent at least $150,000 on diapers and ear-infection medicine
before our son turned 2.
</P>
<P>
   According to the USDA, a two-parent family with a pre-tax income
of between $30,000 and $66,600 will spend $53,310 on housing,
$27,990 on food and $22,990 on transportation by the time their kid
turns 18.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, does not include the cost of college (roughly
$22,500 a year for a private school; $10,500 a year for a public
school), nor does it figure your costs if, God forbid, your child
continues to live at home after he or she turns 18.
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, the cost of raising a child goes up each
year. It will cost about $4,000 less to bankroll a 1998 baby
through high school than it will a 1999 baby. Also, children become
progressively more expensive as they age, indicating that the
cheapest way to go is to adopt a child at age 17, keep it confined
to a playpen until its next birthday, then send it out to the
convenience store for cake and quickly change the locks.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, few of us are that clever, meaning that we wind
up financing our kids for the full 18 years, if not a great deal
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Even more unfortunately, you've got to keep in mind that the
USDA figure of $160,000 for a 1999 baby is an average (possibly of
Quaker children) and that your personal costs may be higher. Much
higher.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the USDA figures you will spend approximately
$12,000 to clothe your child from the time he or she is born until
the time he or she finishes high school or drops out to pursue a
career in grease-trap management, whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot speak for the parents of girls (though I can feel
sympathy for them), but I know that a $12,000 clothes budget for a
boy is ridiculously low. My 14-year-old is into skateboarding and
goes through $60-a-pair skateboarding shoes the way Homer Simpson
goes through doughnuts. One pair lasted all of two weeks. While we
waited for the Money Fairy to wave her magic wand over our bank
account, the boy had to go to school wearing shoes patched with
duct tape. While this was embarrassing to us, the other boys at
school thought this was ``cool'' and pretty soon everyone was
walking around with duct-taped shoes.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what the moral of this story is. Perhaps there is a
fortune to be made by manufacturing $60 skateboarding shoes made
entirely of duct tape, I don't know. All I know is that if I buy
him $60 shoes every two weeks between now and the time he turns 18,
I will spend $6,000, not including duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of my own personal clothing budget, which I figure to
be somewhere in the neighborhood of $27.50 a year, that would be
enough to last me until I'm 266 years old, or approximately the age
I'll be when I finish paying for his college education.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA also figures you will spend slightly over $18,000 on
``miscellaneous'' between the time your child is born and his or
her 18th birthday. The USDA does not spell out the meaning of
``miscellaneous,'' but you've got to think it includes Christmas
presents, birthday presents, Beanie Babies, Pokemon cards, baseball
cards, Barbie dolls, G.I. Joes, Nintendos, CD's, CD players and
makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Also $100 baseball gloves, $150 bats, basketball hoops, soccer
goals, skateboards, roller blades, $40 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle
assault vehicles that disintegrate into a million pieces of flimsy
plastic before you've finished your first cup of coffee Christmas
morning, $400 BMX bikes, comic books, Hot Wheels, Smurf's shampoo
and one or more Furbies.
</P>
<P>
   Just to be on the safe side, you might also want to figure about
$19.99 for school supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The point I'm trying to make is that while $160,000 may sound
like a lot of money, it doesn't go very far when raising a kid for
18 years.
</P>
<P>
   What's really shocking is that I've heard rumors that some
parents actually have more than one child.
</P>
<P>
   How you people manage is beyond me.
</P>
<P>
   But I bet it involves a lot of duct tape.

WHAT HAPPENS NOW THAT THE MARCH IS OVER? 

</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They gathered. They marched. They gave the NRA hives. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   Elise was a marching mom last week. She opted for the smaller
and rainy day Oakland version of the Million Mom March, and she
considers herself one of the lucky ones. She wasn't carrying a
photo of a dead loved one.
</P>
<P>
   Violence, however, has visited her family. Last summer Elise's
college student son invited a young woman over for dinner and a
video. While he began cooking she went to her car to retrieve the
movie. Two men drove by, slowed and looked at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me later that they gave her a look,'' says Elise,
shaking her head, knowing the look.
</P>
<P>
   The two men burst through the back door, demanded drugs and
money, beat up on Elise's son and forced him and the young woman
into separate rooms. While one shoved Elise's son face-down on the
floor, the other raped the woman. Then they switched.
</P>
<P>
   It was over in less than 20 minutes _ long enough to turn an
ordinary night into something that altered lives forever.
</P>
<P>
   One of the suspects grabbed a butcher knife from the kitchen
counter. One looked to be carrying a gun and Elise's son wasn't
sure if it was a gun or knife at his back as he lay on the floor,
hearing the cries from the other room.
</P>
<P>
   Police found a gun on one of the suspects when they arrested
them later that night.
</P>
<P>
   Elise walked in the rain in Oakland with her husband, daughter
and another son because she knows that ``violence can happen to
anyone at anytime. You can't just worry about the problem, sitting
on your couch. You have to show up, do something,''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the heartbreaking stories of other marchers,
Elise's family felt grateful. ``We saw a family that looked just
like us but they were carrying a sign with a photograph on it of a
young man in a tuxedo, looking like he might be going to a prom. He
was shot and killed a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not sure what the solution to stemming violence is, but
she believes ``what's going on in our country right now is nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Elise attended the trial of her son's alleged attackers,
listening to the couple recount the terror of their ordeal. Family
members of the suspects were also there and when one of the men, a
parolee with a history of sexual and violent assaults, was
sentenced to prison, the man's mother let out a long wail.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I wanted to hate her for not doing a better job at
raising her child,'' said Elise, ``but I don't know her story.''
Elise prays, too, for the suspects. ``They could have killed them,
but they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   To Elise the challenge is more than what to do with guns, but
what to do about ``our beliefs, our culture and how we're
desensitizing people to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to march in anti-war protests but back then we were
trying to stop a war that was over there. Now it's here. This is
our civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   Elise's brother is a member of the NRA and told her that her son
could have saved himself and his friend that night if he'd had a
gun in his apartment. She says, ``The only way having a gun would
have made a difference was if he were holding it in his hand and
waiting for someone to break through the back door.''
</P>
<P>
   Elise says she's always been anti-gun. When her kids were little
she wouldn't let them play with toy guns. But she allows gun
control is a complex issue and doesn't believe guns should be
outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she's trying to think up other strategies for herself
and other mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do it with money because that's the quickest way to
make a difference in this country. My friend's been urging me to
invest in the stock market and when I heard Congress arguing about
trigger locks and how they wouldn't work, I had an idea. I'll find
out which high tech company knows how to make a trigger lock that
yields only to the thumb of the owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if a bunch of us decided that we'll only invest in
companies that are working to end violence?''
</P>
<P>
   What if?

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Laura Schlessinger is not an easy listen.
</P>
<P>
   I've tried, on a number of occasions, but I'm always put off by
her strict treatment of the very listeners who worship her. They
call to tell her about their bad marriages or their loveless lives
or their addictive tendencies or their problems on the job or with
relatives, and she responds by scolding, lecturing, judging and
mocking them for their weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   And then they thank her and hang up.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the shock doc's response to two calls I heard on a
recent program. First was a woman in her early 40s who was involved
with a man in his late 50s. The man was recently divorced after a
37-year marriage and wasn't interested in getting involved in
another serious relationship. Was this normal?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares if it's normal!'' Dr. Laura barked. She followed
that with some verbal vinegar telling the woman it was up to her if
she wanted to be with a man who didn't want a commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Next was an 8-year-old girl, who in a tiny trembling voice said
she was living with her mommy but she was thinking about moving in
with her daddy to see if it would be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it would be different!'' Dr. Laura thundered. ``But
one's not going to be Disneyland and the other one's not going to
be hell!''
</P>
<P>
   After quizzing the poor kid about how often she saw her father,
Dr. Laura claimed in a cold voice that she felt bad for the child
and then said, ``Now go do the right thing!'' before moving on to a
break.
</P>
<P>
   Hate to quibble with the methodology of the advice goddess, but
didn't it occur to her to ask an 8-year-old child a few things
like: what are you doing home in the middle of the day, where's
mommy, who's watching you, do you make it a habit to dial up
nationally syndicated radio hosts, etc. I'm not quite sure how
pulling a Cruella Deville on an obviously confused little girl and
then cutting her off to hit that break at the top of the hour
constitutes responsible counseling.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just me.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, we must give Dr. Laura her props. What I find to
be a shrill, joyless, narrow-minded program is also a tremendously
successful juggernaut _ by some accounts the most-listened-to show
on the air, surpassing the listenerships of Imus, Limbaugh, Stern,
any of the big boys.
</P>
<P>
   If people want to listen to her show and buy her books and
purchase her magazine and scarf up her precious souvenir
merchandise, e.g., the Dr. Laura board game and the Dr. Laura
coffee mug and the Dr. Laura T-shirt and the Dr. Laura license
plate holder, go to it. Whatever gets you through the day.
</P>
<P>
   Same thing goes for the upcoming TV show. Perhaps Dr. Laura will
succeed where Rush Limbaugh failed in translating her strong
personality to a telegenic success; perhaps not. One thing beyond
debate is that she has the right to give it a shot _ despite the
organized efforts by some gay rights activists to have the show
killed in development.
</P>
<P>
   Rightfully outraged by some of the not-so-good doctor's comments
on homosexuality (``If you're gay or lesbian, you're a biological
error''; ``I call homosexual practices deviant''), the ``Stop Dr.
Laura'' movement is engaging in a sustained campaign to pressure
broadcasters and advertisers associated with the TV program, set to
air this fall via Paramount.
</P>
<P>
   The StopDr.Laura.com web site updates Schlessinger's latest
comments on gay-related issues, provides the phone numbers and
addresses of broadcast executives and sponsors, and lists the sites
and dates of upcoming protests in various markets.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal: cancellation of the program before it ever
hits the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   That's troubling. It seems hypocritical to me to say:, ``We're
here, we're queer, get used to it!'' and to follow that with:
``She's there, we're scared, so muzzle her!''
</P>
<P>
   Keep it up, and you're going to turn Schlessinger into a
free-speech martyr. Not to mention the mountains of free publicity
she's receiving for a TV show that might not even attract a sizable
audience on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some reports claiming Paramount will not aggressively
promote Dr. Laura's show or pursue favorable time slots in major
markets, executives for the company say they haven't wavered in
their support and will proceed with a Sept. 11 launch date
supported by considerable advance advertising muscle.
</P>
<P>
   I'm looking forward to it. Schlessinger could turn out to be the
most villainous doctor we've seen on TV in a long time.

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _CINCINNATI _ Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, the leader
of the civil rights movement in Birmingham, Ala., doesn't hesitate
to describe being beaten with bicycle chains and baseball bats by
an angry mob while trying to enroll his daughters in the all-white
Phillips High School. Yet this man often described as ``fiery'' and
``fearless,'' seems pained by the effort of remembering the funeral
of Carole Robertson, one of four girls killed in the Sept. 15,
1963, bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham.

   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's plan

 &HT;    GARDENING Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Walter Reeves

<TEXT>

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Q: A mature hickory tree in my yard is dropping leaves. Could it
be that the tree is showing lack of water, or do I perhaps have a
disease problem, and if so what should I do?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ed H., Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: We don't think of trees having brains, but they do respond to
environmental conditions in rational ways. In your case, the
hickory pecan; same family but this will confuse had plenty of
water and nutrients back in April so it put out lots of new leaves.
Now that we have had weeks of dry weather, the tree has
``reconsidered'' its rash growth and has ``decided'' to drop some
of those leaves. The leaves demand lots of water during the summer
and the tree doesn't want to overextend itself.
</P>
<P>
   Almost the same thing occurs with fruit trees. Hoping for a good
year, the tree blooms and sets many more fruit in April than it can
possibly ripen. During May or June, you'll find dozens or hundreds
of little fruits the tree decided to abort before they became a
burden.
</P>
<P>
   Windstorms and heavy rain will knock out more leaves, but by
June the tree will likely have achieved the balance of roots to
leaves it prefers. Rake up your debris and add it to your compost
pile.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are planning a simple landscape for our school playground.
It is enclosed by a 4-foot-high chain-link fence, and we want to
hide the institutional look. The site is pretty bright, under the
shade of tall pine trees. What would you plant?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill C., Decatur
</P>
<P>
   A: My first recommendation is what not to plant. Never plant
Chinese holly (the one with the pointed leaves needle-point leaves
) where schoolchildren can reach them. Speaking from experience,
you will have a terrible time policing the natural inclination of
kids to torment each other with its spiny leaves. I also do not
recommend plants from which long ``switches'' can be broken. Trust
me. With the Gateway, ITBS, COGAT and CRT tests troubling their
brains, children should not have to worry about their pint-size
counterparts taking torture devices from the schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
   Junipers are tough but would do better in full sunshine. Red-tip
photinia is out of the question. I am bored by the commonplace
Japanese hollies and ligustrum, though they are easy to find and
care for.
</P>
<P>
   You want shrubs that can thrive in the heat and take care of
themselves. My candidates include any of the several loropetalum
varieties (bright pink flowers in March), anise (leaves smell like
licorice) and fragrant osmanthus (sweet perfume in October).
Oakleaf hydrangea has big white flowers in May and nice red leaves
in fall. I am partial to chaste tree due to the lavender flower
spikes that adorn it in August. You could try an ornamental grass
like miscanthus, but someone will have to chop off the brown leaves
every February.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the greatest time to plant shrubs, since summer
drought is not far off. If you simply must plant now, devise a
soaker hose system that can remain in place under the shrub mulch
throughout the summer. You'll need to give the plants a good
soaking (one hour at least) every three days for three weeks after
planting. In late June you can cut back the regimen to one deep
watering per week.
</P>
<P>
   I know that planting and maintaining a school landscape is a
thankless task. Volunteers, though, are the soul of a community,
and you are to be commended for setting an example for others to
follow.

 &HT;    Hey, George, I want free treats, too
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's plan to give away
free trigger locks to gun owners sounds cool, but what about us
people who don't pack heat?
</P>
<P>
   Don't we deserve a complimentary gift? I mean, if you're buying
votes, grease my palm, too. How about at least a free beer opener,
George, or a snow globe, for the rest of us?
</P>
<P>
   No, wait. I've got a better idea. Instead of just giving out
free trigger locks to the gun-totin' public, Bush should expand the
program to hand out free bulletproof vests to people who go around
unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   I sure would feel better about the trigger lock program if I
were getting a freebie out of it. And a flak jacket would make a
great costume come Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   I could go down to Sixth Street as a gun nut.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he'll hand out free trigger locks to gun owners in
Texas, and, if elected president, he will hand out free trigger
locks to gun owners nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Swell, but what about us people who aren't into guns? What about
us folks who don't spend our weekends dressed up in camouflage
going to gun shows? Shouldn't we get a little souvenir, too?
</P>
<P>
   How about a free Charlton Heston T-shirt? Did you ever wonder
why this man needs a gun? The guy parted the Red Sea with a stick.
What's he need a gun for?
</P>
<P>
   Don't think I'm going to pose as a gun guy to try to fool Bush
into giving me a free trigger lock, though. I swore when I got out
of the Army in 1973 that I was never going to wear olive drab
again. And I'm not going to start now just so I can get a
complimentary trigger lock. Besides, have you ever wondered why
they call these events gun ``shows''?
</P>
<P>
   It would be a gun show if they had a couple of howitzers set up
on stage and they blew away a Camaro in the parking lot. I could go
for something like that. They don't really show off the guns at gun
shows, though. They sell guns at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   So why don't they call them what they really are _ gun sales?
They don't call them garage shows, do they? No, they call them
garage sales, because people aren't showing off their old clothes
at garage sales. They're selling them.
</P>
<P>
   I'd be a little more enthusiastic about this trigger lock
handout if there was something free in it for me. Instead of just
handing out trigger locks to these pistol-packing NRA types, why
not have them made into key chains and give them out to everybody?
There's all sorts of things a non-gun owner could do with a free
trigger lock. A pair of them would make great earrings for a woman
running for Miss Trailer Park.
</P>
<P>
   People love to get free stuff, and a program to hand out trigger
locks exclusively to gun owners leaves out a lot of Americans. I
was at the grocery store the other day and they were handing out
beer co-- zies to everybody. This guy had a card table set up and
he was asking everybody who walked by if they wanted a beer coozie.
But he wasn't asking people if they drank beer to see if they
qualified for a beer coozie.
</P>
<P>
   So why should someone have to own a gun to get one of Bush's
free trigger locks? I mean, they're a $10 value. So I want one.
Although I'd prefer a pair of fuzzy dice.

 &HT;    Reverend still rattled by church bombing, deaths
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth has no trouble
remembering Christmas night, 1956, when his parsonage was blown to
bits by 15 sticks of dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttlesworth, the leader of the civil rights movement in
Birmingham, Ala., was flung to the basement. His children had been
sleeping in the next room.
</P>
<P>
   When a police officer advised, ``Reverend, if I were you, I
would get out of town, as quickly as possible,'' Shuttlesworth
replied, ``There's a war on. The battle has just begun, and I'm
here for the duration.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuttlesworth, 78, doesn't flinch when recalling what it was
like to be firehosed by Birmingham police, the water's force
stinging like whips.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't hesitate to describe being beaten with bicycle chains
and baseball bats by an angry mob while trying to enroll his
daughters in the all-white Phillips High School.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this renowned civil rights leader, a man often described as
``fiery'' and ``fearless,'' seems pained by the effort of
remembering the funeral of Carole Robertson, one of four girls
killed in the Sept. 15, 1963, bombing of the Sixteenth Street
Baptist Church in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember,'' he said at first.
</P>
<P>
   In Spike Lee's moving film, 4 Little Girls, Shuttlesworth is
described as ``fearless and courageous to the point of almost being
insane.'' Yet when Shuttlesworth heard the news of the church
bombing, he broke down and wept.
</P>
<P>
   A mass funeral service was held for the three other victims, but
Carole's family wouldn't agree, saying, ``We feel her loss was
personal to us.'' The historical accounts show that Shuttlesworth
eulogized Carole as an innocent victim and as a soldier in the
battle for justice.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttlesworth relates a more personal memory from the funeral:
``I had the problem of comforting the sorrowing, while being aware
there were some in the congregation who were thinking, 'Had it not
been for that so-and-so, we wouldn't be here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet, I had to speak the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   And he had to fight for justice, no matter what the cost to
himself, his family, or even innocents like Denise McNair, Carole
Robertson, Addie Mae Collins and Cynthia Wesley.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttlesworth felt more sorrowful than jubilant after the arrest
Wednesday of two former Klansmen, Thomas E. Blanton Jr. and Bobby
Frank Cherry, in the bombings. ``It makes for good copy the country
is doing something to meet justice,'' he said. ``But the FBI knew
then what it knows now. Justice delayed is justice denied.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the late FBI director J. Edgar Hoover who declined to
prosecute, Shuttlesworth recalled, ``but that decision should have
been made by state officials. There was so much collusion between
Hoover and the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Still an active pastor at the Greater New Light Baptist Church
he founded in Cincinnati in 1966, Shuttlesworth admits, ``I think
about retiring, but there is still too much to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrests in Birmingham shouldn't make us complacent,
Shuttlesworth warned: ``We make a mistake in thinking we've come
very far. Look at the controversy over the Confederate flag.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, the murders of the four girls shook much of the nation
out of its complacency about the civil rights struggle,
Shuttlesworth said: ``It was the innocents crying out from the
ground to the God of justice, crying out to the country _ which
only listened briefly and scurried off to do other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of congratulating itself on the arrests last week,
Shuttlesworth said, the nation should listen again: ``In the
creative moment in the '50s and '60s, America thought we could get
justice. We told ourselves, 'Let's get justice, let's put justice
on the front burner.''
</P>
<P>
   And look where we are today, he laments: ``Today we are
fostering the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday without pressing for
what King stood for, without fighting for the beloved community.
Justice isn't on our front burner anymore; the economy is on our
front burner. Who wants to be a millionaire? Everyone does. But the
real question is, 'Who wants justice?'''
</P>
<P>
   Justice was on Shuttlesworth's front burner from the moment he
arrived in Birmingham in 1953 to become pastor of the Bethel
Baptist Church. ``You can't preach who God is without talking about
justice,'' he explains. He founded the Alabama Christian Movement
for Human Rights and mobilized the struggle to end segregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord gave me a hard skull because I lived in hard times,''
he jokes now. When celebrated in Birmingham in 1988 with a street
named after him, Shuttlesworth remarked, ``You couldn't kill me, so
now you're honoring me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s and '60s, it was no joke. Bethel Baptist Church was
bombed twice. ``There were eight or 10 occasions when I quite
literally could have gotten killed,'' he recalled. ``Everybody
thought I would get killed before Martin. Martin thought I would
get killed first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it was Birmingham,'' Shuttlesworth replied, with the
patient tone of one explaining rudimentary history. ``Because of
the bombings, beatings, and castrations. Because of Bull Connor,
the chief of police who said 'I am the law down here.'''
</P>
<P>
   How could he so fearlessly put himself and his family in such
danger?
</P>
<P>
   ``If all of us got killed, I figured God would exact that as my
contribution,'' Shuttlesworth said. ``The Scripture says that he
who loses his life for my sake shall find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith casts out fear, he believes, as surely as fear puts a
damper on faith: ``We fear each other, we fear tomorrow, we fear
this evening, we fear losing our families, we fear speaking the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuttlesworth makes no apologies for putting such a spiritual
cast on the question of social justice: ``It's a spiritual problem.
We need to look up and look within more than we do. We need to
fight the urges to yield to the spirit of meanness and hatred in
this country. It is the seeds sown in that era that we are reaping
now, with the skinheads, militia groups and schoolchildren who have
no regard for the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the photos of four little girls once again appeared
on the front page of our nation's newspapers. In their blossoming
faces, as well as the chiseled visage of the old warrior, we can
read the challenge:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put justice back on the front burner.''

   BURGERS _ The first burger of summer is a pleasure on its own.
Grilled until crisp on the outside and still juicy inside, with its
hint of smoke, all the burger needs is a simple toasted bun. Says
who? We want to start summer with a bang, and Memorial Day is the
start of summer in this part of the country. The hamburger has to

 HEALTHY 20-MINUTE MENUS: ARTICHOKE RISOTTO; GREENS AND
VINAIGRETTE  
 ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material from The New York Times
Syndicate is for use by 20MINUTE-MENUS clients. Nonsubscribers can

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you had a good handle on the kind of rice you should
buy to make risotto, the goal posts are being moved. When risotto
moved out of Italian restaurants into American home kitchens every
one went in search of arborio rice. A few years later other names
began to appear in the shops, like vialone nano and carnaroli.
</P>
<P>
   I have tried them all and have come to the conclusion that
arborio is just fine and makes an absolutely delicious creamy
risotto. But if you want to go the extra step, for an even creamier
version, you might want to see if you can find carnaroli in your
grocery store. It makes a difference, however slight.
</P>
<P>
   I could eat risotto once a week but since not everyone feels the
same I try not to impose the dish on this column too often. However
when I came across freshly cooked artichokes packaged in water in
the market where I shop the other day, I couldn't resist. It is a
vegetable that I love but seldom take the time to cook.
</P>
<P>
   Because the artichokes were stored in ordinary water, there was
no vinegary taste that you find with some jarred artichokes and
there was no oil, another preserving medium.
</P>
<P>
   Risotto came immediately to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Artichoke Risotto
</P>
<P>
   4 to 5 cups no-salt-added chicken or vegetable stock
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces whole onion or 4 tablespoons chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup arborio or carnaroli rice
</P>
<P>
   8 or 9 ounces cooked artichoke hearts (or frozen)
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 ounces Parmigiano Reggiano (7 heaping tablespoons coarsely
grated)
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1. In saucepan heat the stock to a simmer.
</P>
<P>
   2. Chop the onion. Heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pot;
add the onion and saute until it takes on a little color.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add the rice to the onion and stir until well coated.
</P>
<P>
   4. Add about one cup of the simmering broth to the rice and cook
over medium-high, stirring often, until the broth is absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   5. Continue adding broth as it is absorbed into the rice, while
stirring almost continuously.
</P>
<P>
   6. Meanwhile rinse the artichokes, drain and cut into bite-size
pieces. Grate the cheese and cut the prosciutto into small pieces.
</P>
<P>
   7. After adding the last of the liquid, (you may not need all of
it) cook until the rice is al dente but very creamy. Stir in the
artichokes and mix well.
</P>
<P>
   8. Remove the risotto from the heat and stir in the cheese and
prosciutto. Season with pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 2 servings.
</P>
<P>
   GREENS AND SESAME VINAIGRETTE
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces mixed greens like mesclun
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons rice vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1. Wash and dry the greens.
</P>
<P>
   2. In serving bowl whisk the oil and vinegar. Add the greens and
mix well to coat.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 2 servings

   AMUSEMENT-RIDES (Queensbury, N.Y.) _ The force of modern
amusement rides is attracting worldwide attention, including
hearings in Congress. Officials and some experts are wondering at
what point the gravitational pushes and pulls known as G-forces
turn from ``Gee Whiz'' to G-dangers. By MIKE HUREWITZ.

<P>
   MILITARY-TRAINER (San Antonio) _ The Texan is back. Decades
after the AT-6 ``Texan'' was used to train Army Air Corps and Navy
pilots during World War II, a new plane with a similar name landed
Tuesday at Randolph AFB. The T-6A ``Texan II'' was billed as a
cheaper, quieter and friendlier aerobatic alternative to the aging
T-37 ``Tweet,'' a small jet-powered craft that's been the service's
prime trainer the past 34 years. By SIG CHRISTENSON.

   EXPLORER-MEMORIAL (San Francisco) _ It has taken 224 years for
Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza to make his way back to
Mission Dolores. Only this time, the tenacious scout for colonial
Spain won't be arriving at the old mission on horseback. Most
likely he'll get there on a flatbed truck. Oh, and in the form of
an 8,000-pound bronze statue cast in his likeness. By RACHEL
GORDON.

   LA-SCHOOL-SUPERINTENDENT (San Antonio) _ Henry Cisneros, a

<P>
   SF-SCHOOL-SUPERINTENDENT (San Francisco) _ The San Francisco
school board approved a four-year contract for new superintendent
Arlene Ackerman that will pay her $197,000 a year to head
California's fifth largest district, $12,000 more than her
predecessor. The announcement of the terms of Ackerman's unsigned
contract at Tuesday night's school board meeting drew an immediate
chorus of loud boos among teachers and parents in the audience. By

   ARMY-MEDICS (San Antonio) _ For a good many Americans, memories
of the Korean War stem from the flickering images of characters
such as ``Hawkeye'' Pierce and ``Hot Lips'' Houlihan. The widely
popular, wisecracking television series ``MASH'' helped immortalize
the dedicated doctors and nurses who served at the front lines of
the Korean conflict. Those who experienced the war firsthand say
the show's screwball comedy in the midst of mayhem was, for the
most part, an accurate portrayal of life in a Mobile Army Surgical
Hospital unit. By NICOLE FOY.

<P>
   FIOM-REVIEW-IMPOSSIBLE (Undated)_ Don't look now, but the``
Mission Impossible'' franchise has been officially Wooed. What
constitutes Wooing? Several elements. For a film to be properly
Wooed, it must exploit slow motion at moments of exaggerated drama.
It must feature loving close-ups of a rugged hero, be he Chow
Yun-Fat or Tom Cruise, looking unflappably self-possessed. It must
contain action sequences of extended violence and elaborate
choreography, and it must do so using an endless quantities of
bullets. By AMY BIANCOLLI.

about the papers' profit-splitting agreement and clauses that
allegedly thwarted other firms from buying the papers. By SETH
ROSENFELD.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-EXPLORER (San Antonio) _ Is it a car, a truck or a
sport-utility? Try all three. That's the feeling I got behind the
wheel of the all-new 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac, which from the
nose to behind the rear seat is a Ford Explorer sport-utility
vehicle. G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III.

   SOC-WOMEN'S-SOCCER (San Francisco) _ There will be only one
women's professional soccer league going forward after all. The
Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA), which put in its bid with
U.S. Soccer to run the league last winter, will work with the
cooperation of Major League Soccer to get their league off the

</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Poor, rich little George W. Bush.
The liberal media conspiracy will never stop picking on him for his
youthful mistakes and privileges. The Boston Globe dug up young
Bush's service record in the Air National Guard and claims it shows
that, in his final year of military service in 1972-73, he didn't
do any flying and never showed up at the regular drills required of
guardsmen. You or I probably would be sent to the brig if we missed
our reservist or guard meetings, but not a favorite son _ that's
the implication of the story. By ROB MORSE.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Toysmart Inc., a once-hot Internet retailer that captured the
eye _ and the money _ of the Walt Disney Co., said Monday that it
has instead closed its online doors after failing to drum up
investor support.
</P>
<P>
   The company collapsed Friday, after negotiations over new
funding crumbled and its board _ mostly Disney employees _ opted to
shut everything down. Toysmart.com will close its headquarters and
shop in Waltham, Mass., and a distribution center in Worcester,
Mass. Disney had invested $45 million in the company since August.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the retailer's 170 employees were packing boxes Monday,
and a few sadly joked that they might sell themselves on eBay's
auction site as a prepackaged team of high-tech workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the best we could,'' Toysmart.com chief executive David
Lord said Monday. ``I'm trying the best I can to help our
employees. That's my only concern right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart.com had hoped to carve out a niche in a competitive
marketplace by offering safe, educational toys to parents. Its
now-closed Web site had offered plenty of plush Disney toys,
puzzles, and games _ but no plastic toy weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the company stumbled as the ranks of Internet toy stores
grew, investors began snubbing dot-coms, and Disney reconsidered
its Internet strategy, Lord said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any one of those you can probably overcome,'' he said. ``But
all three _ it's too great a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, Toysmart.com has been trying to reorganize
its operations to please Disney and other investors. It laid off 55
employees and mapped a new strategy of selling to businesses and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But after negotiations over the new investment broke down,
Toysmart.com's board voted to shutter the company. ``Everyone said,
`Well, that's it then,' '' Lord said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Lord purchased the online toy business he had developed
for the Holt family, which retained a 1 percent equity stake in
Toysmart.com.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lord, Toysmart.com grew to to approximately $10 million in
revenue in 1998, according to corporate research by Hoover's Inc.
The closely held retailer did not release its annual sales last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the graveyard of dot-com companies, Toysmart.com will not be
alone. Gift shop Violet.com and education toy retailer Red Rocket
have closed ther Web sites, and last week, British apparel merchant
Boo.com announced its imminent demise after failing to attract
much-needed investment.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Craftshop.com, an Internet arts and crafts retailer
backed by Andover-based CMGI Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in Wilmington, Del. The Connecticut retailer hopes to
sell off its assets, including its domain name and Web store.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe the dot-com failures have only begun. In a
report last month, Forrester Research predicted that financial
performances, heavy ad spending, and competitive pressures will
drive most online retailers out of business by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of traditional stores are taking their spin at the
Internet game, (and) much more emphatically,'' said David
Cooperstein, an analyst with Forrester in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Internet-only merchants, retail giants like Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. and Toys ``R'' Us Inc. have such recognized names that
they do not have to dig deeply into their pockets to advertise
their Web stores.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester also sounded a warning after Disney paid $20 million
in August for a controlling stake in Toysmart.com. ``Beware of the
mouse's appetite,'' its analysts wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Disney, it was a good move,'' Cooperstein said. ``For
Toysmart.com, it was a dangerous game. It wasn't like this was a
venture capitalist in Silicon Valley willing to focus on potential.
Disney is very concerned when things don't pan out the way it
anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Disney chief executive Michael Eisner said
his company's Internet holdings were in no danger of failing. ``Not
only will Disney's Internet assets survive, they will thrive,''
Eisner said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But his company's Go.com Internet unit, which includes
Toysmart.com and Disney Online, is grappling with employee turnover
and slower-than-anticipated growth. And now, Toysmart.com is being
eliminated from Disney's Internet roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I can't talk (as) to what Michael Eisner is speaking
of,'' said Lord, Toysmart.com's chief executive. ``I only know that
Go.com has stated that it's changing and is being redefined. I
guess we're a part of that.''

UPGRADING TO WINDOWS 2000 INCLUDES MAJOR REINSTALLATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DWIGHT SILVERMAN   
 c.2000 Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am interested in trying out Windows 2000, but I don't want
to lose my Windows 98 setup. I understand you can dual-boot with
both operating systems, but would I have to reinstall all my
applications to get them to work in Windows 2000?
</P>
<P>
   A: This question comes up each time Microsoft releases a new
operating system, and the answer is always the same.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you will need to reinstall the programs you want to use
with both Windows 98 and 2000 in a dual-boot setup. This is because
Windows 2000 and Windows 98 do not share the same Registry, or
master configuration file, and in a sense do not know about each
other.
</P>
<P>
   When you install a Windows program, it tells the operating
system key information about itself by adding information to the
Registry. Often, the program cannot run without accessing the
information stored in the Registry.
</P>
<P>
   So long as both operating systems are using the File Allocation
Table, or FAT, file system, you can find the folders for your
applications in either Windows 98 and Windows 2000. But if you try
to click on a program installed in Windows 98 and you're running
Windows 2000, it probably won't launch. And if it does, it may
behave strangely.
</P>
<P>
   If you choose to install the program again in Windows 2000, you
can usually use the same installation path. However, some Windows
programs have their configuration files separate from the Registry,
and these files may include pointers to the operating system. So,
when you reinstall under Windows 2000, it may change the pointers
so they no longer work with your Windows 98 setup.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you will probably need two installations in two separate
folders _ one for Windows 2000 and one for Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   The situation gets even more tricky if you want to use the High
Performance File System, or HPFS, available with Windows 2000.
Here, you will almost certainly need separate installations of all
software, and you will need to set Windows 2000 up in its own
partition on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 is a business operating system, and given its
complexity, if you don't need it for business purposes, you may
want to stay away and keep your computing life simple.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a notebook computer that is three years old. I
recently had to buy another battery because the old one began to
need charging more frequently. When I first got it, it would go
three hours without a charge. When I finally replaced it, it was
down to 30 minutes. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: Certain types of batteries develop what is known as the
``memory effect.'' It is caused by not letting the battery
completely discharge before you begin recharging it.
</P>
<P>
   The battery basically develops a kind of floor for recharging.
Let's say your battery started with three hours of life, but you
started charging it when it had used up only two. Do that enough,
and the battery will only take a two-hour charge. If you notice
it's only getting two hours and you decide to play it safe by
recharging after 90 minutes, that will become your new starting
point.
</P>
<P>
   This happens primarily to older nickel-cadmium batteries, and to
a lesser extent to nickel-metal-hydride batteries. More modern
lithium ion batteries are relatively resistant to it.
</P>
<P>
   There is some controversy as to whether the memory effect really
exists.
</P>
<P>
   But millions of home videocam owners who have replaced $80
batteries can attest to its existence!
</P>

INOCULATE YOUR COMPUTER AGAINST VIRUSES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: After reading about the ``Love Bug'' virus,
I've been afraid to open any e-mail attachments. Is there some way
to tell which ones are safe?
</P>
<P>
   _ Loveless
</P>
<P>
   DEAR LOVELESS: You know what ticks me off? That a bunch of
little four-eyed cockroaches without social lives can intimidate
anyone into even asking that question.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet used to thrive on cooperation and trust, and
because of that, it was a special, idyllic place. Turns out it's
just like the rest of the world, though, susceptible to the lowest
urges that motivate our pathetic little species. Some pinhead with
no conscience wants to validate his existence, so he finds a way to
mess with everybody's e-mail and wreak computer chaos for a week,
all so he can brag about it to the rest of the zeros he hangs out
with. We're all so impressed. Gee, can we be like you?
</P>
<P>
   Virulent as it was, the sad part about the ``Love Bug'' outbreak
is that it appears to have been written by a real bonehead _ or
group of boneheads _ with no sense of style or even the
intelligence to cover his _ or their _ tracks. The virus code was a
Windows script, a list of tasks for a computer to complete, in a
language close enough to regular English that even nonprogrammers
could get a clue what it was meant to do. Oh, and cleverly included
in the script were things like nicknames, e-mail addresses and lots
of other smoking guns, all pointing to the dweebs who thought this
little stunt was so funny.
</P>
<P>
   If you know what you're doing, the code is easy to extract
without infecting your computer. Any decent e-mail program will
display the name of an attachment without actually extracting it.
Because Windows depends on a filename extension to know what to do
with the file, you can tell which kinds of files to dump.
</P>
<P>
   If the file has a .VBS or .JS extension, delete it. It's a
script, you don't know what it does and you don't want to find out.
It executes when you open it.
</P>
<P>
   If you see an .EXE or .COM or .BAT, be very wary. These are all
extensions that Windows will attempt to execute. The file could be
harmless, but unless you know for sure, dump it.
</P>
<P>
   You also need to be suspicious about documents created by any
application program that has a script language, and that includes
all the stuff in Microsoft Office. A virus writer can create an
Excel or Word file that launches a destructive script when it's
opened. The newest versions of the programs warn users that a
script is about to execute, but that doesn't always stop them from
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, please buy a good anti-virus program like McAfee or
Norton, and keep it up-to-date. These guys release virus signature
updates at least monthly, and they burn the midnight oil to come up
with overnight fixes for new viruses like the Love Bug. You might
also download a free copy of ZoneAlarm (www.zonealarm.com), a
personal firewall program that now includes a defense against
script viruses.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: When are you going to put together a book of
your weekly columns? Your advice is the most competent available.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deranged
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DE: Whoops! Somehow I got Heloise's mail.
</P>

accumulated wisdom, but there appears to be no market for a

INSIDE.COM HOPES MEDIA TYPES WILL DIG IN FOR DATA, DIRT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past six months, the media world has been abuzz about
Inside.com, an online entertainment news service. Members of the
media, after all, can't resist a good story about, well, members of
the media. And Inside's cofounder Kurt Andersen has certainly
raised interest and eyebrows with his knack for the controversial
quip: He's been going around calling the competition ``a skeptical
dinosaur'' and claiming in print that raising money for the venture
was ``as easy as getting laid in 1969.''
</P>
<P>
   But after all the verbal fisticuffs and foreplay, most folks
were caught off guard when a ``sneak preview'' of the site appeared
quietly last week with little fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   So what's inside Inside.com? In its first few days, the site
broke the story about salary negotiations with the cast of
``Friends'' (which is of life-or-death importance to six actors,
their network, and their fans) and published a report on a power
shakeup at the Washington Monthly, no doubt of interest to a small
circle of true insiders. The site also offered an astrological
forecast for Napster cofounder Shawn Fanning (a Sagittarius, for
those who care) and let users vote on who has more power, Steven
Case or Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those features _ the silly and the serious _ are still
displayed prominently on the site, which is so laden with headlines
and charts that it's hard to tell what is old news and what has
been recently updated. The design is a murky sea of black and gray
reminiscent of those ``dinosaurs'' called newspapers; the home page
is as busy as a lottery outlet on the eve of a mega-jackpot
drawing.
</P>
<P>
   And the entire venture is something of a gamble. The burning
question here is: Will anyone be willing to pay for this mix of
news, gossip, data, and horoscopes?
</P>
<P>
   Its high-profile editors Andersen (cofounder of Spy and former
editor of New York) and Michael Hirschorn (former editor of Spin)
are betting that people in the entertainment industry will pay $199
a year (or $19.95 a month) for access to the site. Yet the common
wisdom is that nobody pays for content on the Internet, unless it's
pornography or The Wall Street Journal, respectively, of course.
The online magazine Slate scrapped its subscription attempt after a
year, and it is still losing fistfuls of money. Likewise, online
publications like TheStreet.com and and Salon.com haven't exactly
made a killing after lackluster initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   So why should Inside.com succeed where others have failed? In a
word: data.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the dish and the dirt, Inside aims to crunch numbers
that are of particular interest in the entertainment business. ``We
want to go way off the deep end with the depth of our data, so that
you could roll around in the stuff for hours,'' says Hirschorn.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, users can roll around in yesterday's Nielsen ratings,
last weekend's box office grosses, and last week's Internet traffic
figures from Media Metrix. The site also publishes actual sales
figures from Barnes and Noble, which were featured on the site this
week, along with a news item about the book chain's latest Internet
strategy. So far, most of this data is available in other places,
but Hirschorn says that Inside is building gigantic databases and
that the site will eventually offer more extensive data.
</P>
<P>
   But is that enough to make industry insiders subscribe?
Certainly, thousands of media types hustled to sign up for the
30-day free trial, even though technical problems made it necessary
to fill out the registration form several times. Slate editor
Michael Kinsley was one of the first media people to check out the
site, and for now, he's giving it the benefit of the doubt. ``I
wouldn't say it's a sure thing, but they could succeed where we
failed,'' he says, pausing. ``On the other hand, Warren Buffet's
famous line when someone said that they had learned from their
mistakes was that the idea is to learn from other people's
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But still, the founders didn't have any trouble raising $28
million in venture capital (and if Andersen is to be believed, they
had a darn good time getting it). They also attracted a staff of
seasoned reporters from top print publications; natch, they all
have stock options in the parent company, Powerful Media Inc. The
staff has broken a few stories and turned out straightforward
stories, but so far, the site lacks the edge and the attitude one
might expect from the cofounder of Spy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scoops are terrific, but paying your investors from scoops
could be a formidable challenge,'' says Steven Gaydos, executive
editor of Variety, Inside's chief competitor. ``I remember the old
Jimmy Durante line, `Everybody wants to get in the act.' God love
'em. That line was quoted in Variety in about 1932.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, media types wanted at least a look at the act. When the
site appeared a week ago without any advance notice, it was
instantly bogged down with traffic _ and technical glitches. Since
then, features like the Inside Dope and the Daily Digest have been
updated, but many of the stories on the home page haven't changed
since Day One.
</P>
<P>
   And the failure to update the site could be a make-or-break
factor in the subscription model. ``Most news sites start out very
different from each other in the morning, but by the afternoon,
they are all the same,'' says Richard Tofel, vice president of
corporate communications for Dow Jones &AMP; Co., which publishes the
Wall Street Journal. ``That's not a great recipe for convincing
people to pay.'' WSJ.com has 438,000 subscribers who pay $29 to $49
a year for access to the site, which is updated round the clock
with reports from the Dow Jones news service.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal has a captive audience of business readers, many of
whom are able to expense their subscriptions. You could argue that
Inside.com has a similar audience: Media moguls have an
unquenchable thirst for news and gossip about their own. Just
witness the pre-launch hype for Inside.com. ``It was
embarrassing,'' admits Hirschorn.
</P>
<P>
   Whether insiders will pony up for the Inside dirt is anyone's
guess, but people are paying attention. James Ledbetter, New York
bureau chief of The Industry Standard, put it this way: ``Even if
they fail, it's going to be fun to watch.''

MICROSOFT'S SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Isometimes use this space to defend Microsoft Corp. against the
US Justice Department. I do so for three reasons:
</P>
<P>
   --Much of the case against Microsoft is bogus.
</P>
<P>
   --To the extent that the company has done wrong, dismantling it
is a grossly disproportionate response.
</P>
<P>
   --And finally, why bother? If Microsoft continues its recent
idiocies, it will end up eviscerating itself.
</P>
<P>
   First there's the antitrust case, which the company could have
settled painlessly a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Love Bug virus that attacked millions of
Microsoft-based computers worldwide, because Microsoft
intentionally left dangerous security holes in its products.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes Microsoft's legal threat against Slashdot, one of
the Internet's most respected technology sites. The company's
behavior is as clueless as it is brutish. Here's the story:
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows about the free Linux operating system, the most
famous open-source product, but there are many others. Kerberos,
for instance, is a data protocol designed to let people communicate
with computer networks without worrying their data might be
intercepted by bad guys. It was created at MIT, which freely offers
it to any software companies that want to add it to their products.
Kerberos has become quite a hit with businesses that rely on
versions of the Unix operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, sensibly enough, added Kerberos support to its
high-end corporate operating system, Windows 2000. But in standard
Microsoft fashion, the company also wanted to ``improve'' it, by
adding features to Kerberos that would make it work better with
other Microsoft products.
</P>
<P>
   People in the open source software community howled, and not
without reason. According to the notorious ``Halloween documents''
leaked to the public in 1998, Microsoft considered this very tactic
to undermine the popularity of open source software products like
the Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft could add open source features to its own products,
but make changes in them. The open source features would still work
with other companies' products, but would work even better with
other Microsoft products. This would give Microsoft customers a
reason to stay loyal.
</P>
<P>
   The US Justice Department, suing Microsoft for antitrust
violations, said the Kerberos move was an unfair tactic to maintain
Microsoft's dominance of the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   They're correct, except for the ``unfair'' part. Microsoft has
every right to improve on existing products in ways that give them
an edge on rivals. As long as Microsoft's Kerberos still works with
other versions, I figure they're in the clear.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Microsoft promised to publish the details of its
changes to Kerberos. That would give other software makers a chance
to make their products compatible with Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's Kerberos document featured a bizarre legal
notice that said, in effect, ``Everything you read here belongs to
Microsoft. Don't try it at home.'' Microsoft published the data as
a ploy to show its ``openness,'' but ordered open source
programmers to act as if they'd never seen it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when the popular Slashdot Web site published the
Microsoft document with the copyright warning removed, Microsoft
e-mailed Slashdot and threatened to sue if the offending materials
weren't removed. So far, Slashdot has refused. Perhaps it's eager
to see if Microsoft, a company on the verge of being ripped apart
for antitrust violations, would be stupid enough to pick a fight
over Kerberos.
</P>
<P>
   For a mature response to open source software, consider IBM
Corp.'s decision to offer Linux on its S/390 mainframes, the
machines that run banks, factories and the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   IBM will provide full corporate-grade support for Linux running
on its top-of-the-line hardware. Big Blue has had to upgrade Linux
to work on mainframes, but it's giving away its improvements at no
charge. Indeed, IBM has teams of programmers writing new and better
open source software, and giving it away.
</P>
<P>
   It's not altruism, of course. IBM makes its money selling
computer services, and can afford to give away software to get a
foot in the door. It's the same gambit Microsoft used with its Web
browser. Microsoft was right to do it, no matter what the courts
say. And IBM is right to embrace Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Microsoft reacts to the open source challenge with an
unseemly blend of spite and panic. When you're as self-destructive
as Microsoft has been in recent years, a court-ordered breakup
begins to seem almost academic.

HOMING IN ON `INTELLIGENT' WEB DESIGN  
 SCENTS OF THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Agilent. Naviant. Novient. Scient. Teligent. Are the new
economy's neologisms starting to blur?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a certain dot-com conformity appears to be spreading in the
naming and branding of technology companies. Four 26-year-old
partners at a Web design firm in Chicago have put up a parody Web
site that takes you, the e-client, through the process of selecting
a name, logo and motto for your new business.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50,000 different visitors have toured the site since it
opened last month, the creators say.
</P>
<P>
   The site, eNoricom.com, presents 18 slides that depict the
steps, beginning with the ``patented Nametron 3000'' machine to
create a ``best-of-breed name that conveys the essence of your
brand's soul.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Nametron spits out the name Similant, the word is run
up the flagpole of a fictional focus group, a family of four. Dad
finds that Similant evokes a ``very strong customer focus.'' For
Daughter, the name is virtually synonymous with ``global.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, noting that ``nothing says innovation and cutting edge
like having a curved swoosh in your logo,'' the site presents more
than a dozen examples _ from Ameritech, to Gore 2000, to
tickets.com _ before producing a suitably swerving nameplate for
Similant. For focus-group Mom, the Similant logo signifies that
``anything is possible.'' For Son, it cries out ``empowered.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the site observes the popularity of three-word
taglines, like ``Point. Click. Rent'' for apartmentguide.com and
``Beauty. Inspiration. Shopping'' for gloss.com.
</P>
<P>
   For Similant, the concocted tagline is ``Really. Really.
Different.'' (Mom's impression: ``people focused.'' Daughter's:
``frictionless.'')
</P>
<P>
   Matt Linderman, a creator of the parody site, said the point
(besides getting laughs) was to convey his own firm's philosophy
that good Web design helps people communicate and interact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It upsets us when we see these big companies acting Orwellian,
making up words to make themselves sound important,'' Linderman
said. ``Everyone sees logos like that all the time. But it's not
until you see 30 of them together that you say, `Wow, this is kind
of ridiculous.'''
</P>
<P>
   And what name did Lindeman's 10-month-old Web company select for
itself? An arcane one: 37signals.
</P>
<P>
   The name, he explains, alludes to an experiment led by the
astronomer Carl Sagan in the 1980s in which billions and billions
of signals from outer space were analyzed by a radio telescope.
Only 37 were identified as potential signs of intelligent life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked this,'' Linderman said, ``because our goal is to
create and propagate Web sites that show signs of intelligent
life.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Tailer Wants to Bring Aroma of Candy to Internet
</P>
<P>
   James Griffin has been trying to bring smell into the
candy-buying experience since his early days as an executive of
Nestle USA. He recalled an experiment with the scratch-and-sniff
card, a decades-old marketing tool that releases a faint aroma once
the customer has scratched off a thin coating. Trials were a
resounding disappointment. ``If it's sitting next to dog food in
the warehouse it would pick up the smell,'' Griffin said. ``You
couldn't control it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Griffin is the president of e-Candy
(www.ecandy.com), an online candy store that, among other things,
just signed a deal to distribute Nestle's confections.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, he is trying to let candy customers smell before
they buy, but this time the approach is far more sophisticated.
E-Candy, based in Los Angeles, is working with Digiscents, a small
company that is developing a digital language for recording and
re-creating smells, using a device attached to a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Griffin predicts, customers who call up e-Candy's
site will be able to smell the jelly beans, chocolates and sour
gummies. ``Candy is very much a sensory experience,'' Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   E-Candy is not the only consumer goods maker working with
Digiscents, which is based in Oakland, Calif. Digiscents announced
a deal last week with Procter &AMP; Gamble to collaborate on research
that would take advantage of P&AMP;G's $2 billion research and
development budget.
</P>
<P>
   Although P&AMP;G declined to disclose details, the deal presumably
could lead to new ways for online customers to sample the company's
consumer products, which include Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent,
Pantene shampoo and Pringles potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Digiscents, nearly everything can and will be
``scent enabled'' someday, including computer games, electronic
greeting cards and travel brochures.
</P>
<P>
   Digiscents is creating a registry of thousands of scents that
developers can license, along with a digital language for
recording, re-creating and transmitting the fragrances. The scents
are played back by a tiny device called a scent synthesizer that
will activate various combinations of chemicals to create each
aroma. The company hopes to start selling the device early next
year for $50 to $200.

CONCEPTUAL ART FINDS A HOME ON EBAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all heard plenty about the eBay hucksters, the folks who
try to pawn off just about everything but a bridge in Brooklyn.
Last week, it was the sensitive guy hawking the ``100 percent
genuine raft used by Elian.'' This week, it's the henpecked
``husband'' unloading a painting because his ``wife'' hates
abstract images that resemble the work of modern master Richard
Diebenkorn (wink, wink).
</P>
<P>
   I mean, really. Would you offer $135,805, sight unseen, to an
art dealer who goes by the name ``golfpoorly?''
</P>
<P>
   The eBay con artists get all the attention, but what about the
lesser-known eBay artists? That's right. There is a new breed of
artist using the Internet auction site as a forum for creative
expression. Their work is hard to categorize; it's a combination of
conceptual art and performance art, sort of like a digital
happening in cyberspace. Where else can an artist reach a potential
audience of millions? What better place to make a wry comment on
our materialistic consumer culture?
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, sometimes it's hard to tell the serious artists from
the salesmen. Consider Lot 31: a postcard of a goat nursing a baby.
Was this recent sale an artist's attempt to exorcize childhood
scars or simply somebody getting rid of tacky stuff?
</P>
<P>
   Cyber artist Jeff Gates is definitely earnest about his auction
oeuvre. Last year, he posted an unusual item on eBay: his
demographics. Art world folks were impressed with his statement
about the value of art and the nature of privacy, but serious
bidders had no interest in the statistics of a middle-aged artist
and bureacrat. So Gates, who heads the new media initiative at the
Smithsonian's National Museum of American Art, turned the original
auction page into a framed art print and tried to sell that. Alas,
no takers. But Gates made his point. ``I'm interested in
advertising and how things get branded and sold,'' he says. In a
world where everything is up for sale, including our personal data,
how do we place a value on art?
</P>
<P>
   And what is art, anyway? Some eBay artists are using the
Internet to thumb their noses at the art establishment. The
collaborative RTMark, best known for switching the voiceboxes in
Barbie and GI Joe dolls a few years back, was invited to
participate in the Whitney Biennial this year; the group auctioned
off four tickets to the glitzy Whitney gala and then used the
proceeds ($8,400) to fund its anti-corporate activism.
</P>
<P>
   A group of students at the California Institute of the Arts got
some unexpected results when they tried a similar form of
experiment. The artists, who called themselves Akshun, auctioned
off their space in the school's art gallery on eBay last fall. They
were simply critiquing the elitist gallery system; they didn't
expect to stir up trouble with the State Department. It turns out a
group of dissident artists in North Korea were the lead bidders for
the space. The only problem? The sale was illegal under the Trading
with the Enemy Act. Sweet irony, that.
</P>
<P>
   Conceptual artist Cary Peppermint (yes, that's his real name)
hasn't exactly created an international incident with his eBay
experiments, but he is deliberately provocative. In one piece, he
claimed to be auctioning off nude photos of his ex-girlfriend. As
the auction proceeded, he posted titillating (but not quite nude)
photos on the site. The model in the photos wasn't really his
ex-girlfriend, but Peppermint says he felt guilty anyway, as if he
had exploited someone. ``I ended up operating under the thesis that
whoever fakes an illness, ends up staying in bed,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Peppermint is continuing his eBay exploits; earlier this year,
he auctioned an item called ``Use Cary Peppermint as a Medium.''
For $107.50, the winning bidder, artist Tim Whidden, received the
right to tell Peppermint what to do in a performance piece. So a
few weeks ago, Peppermint masqueraded as Whidden at a lecture at
Bard College; in front of a rather perplexed audience, he gave a
long tirade about Jennifer Love Hewitt before he was interrupted by
the real Tim Whidden.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing new about artists dissing the art establishment,
and it seems somehow appropriate to throw such statements into the
digital bazaar, along with the gizmos, the gadgets, and the garage
sale leftovers. But let's not take this too seriously and start
using the language of the art world to describe this passing fancy
as an emerging school of eBay art. ``It's a temporal aesthetic,''
explains Peppermint. ``I'll walk away when the time is right.''

   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Oh my goodness. Another Internet ``first!'' The folks at
www.AtomFilms.com have launched a ``total immersion'' film; called
``The Arrival,'' the film uses a technology that enables viewers to
choose the camera angle as they watch. It's still fairly primitive;
as you watch the film, it's easy to spend the whole time looking
out the window of a car or gazing at the floor. The film does have
a cute surprise ending; let's just say it concerns the death of Old
Media.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, www.Ifilm.com has recast itself as a search engine
and portal for online film in an attempt to differentiate itself
from other entertainment sites. The site will provide a guide to
its competition, including Atom Films, Shockwave, DEN, Wirebreak,
and Urban Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  They call this convergence? A squishy foam foot that you can
squeeze during periods of high anxiety? Fox.com sent over this
little toy to promote its new Web site, www.peggysfeet.com. The
site was a companion to Sunday's episode of ``King of the Hill,''
which is about, well, Peggy Hill's big feet. The site is mildly
amusing, but it isn't exactly a major breakthrough in the merging
of the Web and television. But the foam foot is cute: I wonder how
much it will sell for on eBay?

COMPUTING Q&AMP;A: SORTING LISTS IS EASY AS ABC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID EINSTEIN   
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible to sort a list of song titles or other names
alphabetically in Microsoft Word?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: It is. First, make sure each item on your list constitutes its
own paragraph _ in other words, hit the Enter key after each entry.
Now, go to the Table menu in Word and choose Sort. This will
automatically select your list and present you with a Sort Text
dialog box. To sort the list alphabetically, simply choose OK.
Easy, eh?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Muting Your Modem
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: We use America Online to connect to the Internet. How can we get
the modem inside the computer to be silent during the connection
process?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: What's the matter? You don't like listening to high-pitched
screeching every time you go online? Can't blame you. The noise
emitted by modems is one of the most irritating sounds on the
planet, next only to the singing of Christina Aguilara. So I want
to help you if I can.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a couple things you can do: In the AOL sign-on window
choose Setup. Then in the Setup window click Expert Setup. Now tab
over to Devices, select your modem and choose Edit. In the box
labeled Speaker volume, which should be set to Normal, choose Off.
Then click OK.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't solve the problem, try this: Click the Windows
Start button, point to Settings and click Control Panel. In the
Control Panel, double-click the Modems icon. Select your modem (if
you have just one modem, it will select itself) and choose
Properties. Then use your mouse to slide the Speaker volume pointer
to Off.
</P>
<P>
   That procedure was designed to work regardless of which Internet
service provider you use. So if you ever switch from AOL to another
ISP, keep it in mind. But here's something else to keep in mind: It
doesn't always work. People have told me that no matter what they
do, their modem refuses to shut up. But at least it's worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
How to Cover Your Tracks
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I have been asking different sources this question and have had
zero results. On Netscape, how do I delete the list of addresses
that appear when I click the down arrow on the Address bar? Boy oh
boy, will I ever be thankful for a solution.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: This question crops up frequently. Mostly, I suspect, from
people who have been visiting sites they'd rather keep secret from
their significant other (I'm not casting aspersions here, just
making an observation).
</P>
<P>
   You can erase the list, but it takes a few minutes. Here's how:
First open up WordPad, the simple word processor that you'll find
in Windows' Programs/Accessories menu. Choose Open from the File
menu, and using the Look in: function navigate to C: Program
FilesNetscapeUsers. In that folder you should see a folder named
after you _ your user folder. Inside that folder is a file named
prefs.js. Open it up into WordPad.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the file is a warning not to edit it. Disregard
that. Now find the list of URL entries, which correspond to the
sites on your address list. Each entry will begin like this:
userpref(``browser.urlhistory.URL. Select all of these entries and
press the Delete key. Now save the file and quit the program. The
next time you start Netscape, your address bar should be clean.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Cutting Your Cookies
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: What are the pros and cons of just deleting cookies out of their
folder periodically?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Cookies, for those who still don't know, are very small files
that Web sites put in your computer so they can keep information
about you. For instance, when you sign up for an online account,
your user ID and password may be stored in a cookie. Other cookies
contain personal information and buying preferences for online
shopping sites that you have used.
</P>
<P>
   If you browse with Internet Explorer, your cookies are stored in
the Cookies folder inside the Windows folder. With Netscape,
cookies are in a file called Cookies.txt. You can go into those
files and delete cookies without causing damage to your system, but
it's a good idea to leave the ones associated with automatic
sign-ons. (You should be able to spot them because cookies
generally carry their sender's identity.)
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK: Want to take a look at several Word documents
without actually having to open them up in Word? Go to Windows
Explorer (right-click the Start button and choose Explore) and open
the My Documents folder. Then simply right-click any Word file and
choose Quick View. The document will open instantly in a nifty
little window, complete with special formatting. If you then want
to edit the document, click the Word icon on the window's toolbar.

AGENT'S ROLE IN MUSIC SITE CHANGES WAR OVER RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Ovitz, superagent and former Disney president, has made
his name _ and a considerable fortune _ aggressively securing
hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties and other payments for
artists and studios that he represents. But his latest endeavor, a
pop-culture hub on the World Wide Web, has the potential to drain
income from some of those same clients by enabling users of the
site to copy music, media and other files from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ovitz and a business partner bought 51 percent of
Scour.com, an entertainment site and search engine used to find
music and movie files. Last month, though, the site added a
feature, Scour Exchange, that lets users exchange multimedia files
online with one another, including copyrighted material by some of
the world's leading artists, some of them clients of Ovitz's talent
management agency, Artists Management Group.
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of Ovitz in Scour.com would seem to be at cross
purposes with his role in Artists Management. But his backing of
Scour.com also marks a significant shift in the roiling battle over
copyright protection in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the archnemeses of the recording industry have been
20-something entrepreneurs creating Web sites that make it easy to
exchange copyrighted files over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz's backing for Scour.com's file-exchange mechanism suggests
that opposition may be eroding to technology that, by many
accounts, will force the development of new business models for the
entertainment industry, changing how artists are compensated for
their work and how their work is protected.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz declined to comment. But James Ellis, general counsel for
Artists Management Group and a director of Scour Inc., said it
makes more sense to embrace the technology than to fight it. ``In
the face of a rapidly changing marketplace, Scour had to respond,
to maintain and grow its audience and give them what they wanted,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said that Scour hoped to find ways to make file sharing
lucrative for artists. And he said Scour was vigilant about kicking
copyright infringers off the site if Scour was informed of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rodrigues, 24, co-founder and president of Scour.com, said
Scour Exchange could not be held accountable if some people used
the service to pirate copyrighted material. ``It's impossible for
us to screen, censor or review,'' he said. ``It's not our job to
know what is, or is not, infringing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scour.com Web site does include a copyright notice but,
practically speaking, it is simple to obtain copyrighted material
by entering the search term for the desired song or movie.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet music industry analysts say Ovitz has a
potentially serious conflict of interest in holding a stake in
Scour.com and managing artists whose music and movies may be traded
freely on Scour Exchange. The works of several of the artists
represented by Ovitz's agency are exchanged on Scour Exchange,
including music from the group Blues Traveler and the singer Liz
Phair.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a significant potential for conflict,'' said Kevin
Hause, an Internet music analyst with IDG, a market research group.
``He is someone entrusted to look out for the best interest of
artists.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rodrigues said that Ovitz is actually building a bridge
between the old-world media companies and the new business models
of the Internet. ``He understands both sides of the equation,''
Rodrigues said. ``He understands what entertainment companies need
and what's important to copyright holders and what works on the
Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Scour.com was founded in a two-bedroom apartment near the campus
of the University of California at Los Angeles. Traffic to the site
grew quickly, and the company eventually attracted the interest of
Ovitz, who read about Scour.com in the school newspaper, and the
grocery billionaire Ron Burkle. For $4 million, the pair took a
majority stake in the business, said Rodrigues.
</P>
<P>
   The company reached deals with a number of Internet start-ups
and media companies to provide content to include with the search
function. Scour is now contemplating a variety of business models,
including taking advertisements, selling subscriptions and selling
multimedia content.
</P>
<P>
   It now features movie trailers and music promotions provided
legitimately by movie and record companies, along with some items
for sale, like music available for download. The site now receives
2 million visitors each month.
</P>
<P>
   As with Napster, the controversial site offering a service that
lets users share and trade their music files online, users of Scour
download software over the Internet that allows them to store and
catalog multimedia files on their own computers.
</P>
<P>
   Scour Exchange posts those catalogs and then enables users of
the service to visit one another's computers over the Internet and
share and download one another's music, movies, and other holdings.
The service does not provide the content, but facilitates the
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, based in San Mateo, Calif., has been sued by the
Recording Industry Association of America for reportedly
facilitating music piracy in a pending case that many expect to set
a precedent. The association and the five major record labels it
represents say its artists are losing tens of millions of dollars a
year because of rampant music piracy on the Internet, a practice
that the trade group says threatens to undermine the very economics
of the creation of music.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Rosen, the president of the recording industry
association, said the group was aware of Scour Exchange's
activities and was considering its options. But she said the
organization did not want to rush to file lawsuits against each
Napster-like service, hoping the decision in that case case might
dissuade copycats. ``We don't have any interest in litigating our
way through the Internet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality the industry association might simply lack the
resources to file enough lawsuits, given the boom in these services
and the complexity of the attendant technology. Most recently, a
23-year-old Irish programmer created Freenet, which would enable
people to share files online directly with one another in a way
that would make it virtually impossible for copyright holders to
find a central database or hub to blame for the interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies a key argument of Rodrigues and Scour Exchange.
They contend that the free exchange of files online may be
inevitable, so media companies might as well get on board. ``We're
trying to work with entertainment companies to help them use it,''
Rodrigues said, adding, ``Ovitz has been instrumental to us in
leveraging entertainment relationships he has.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scour has some agreements with other companies aimed at helping
users to download multimedia files in a way that protects
copyright. For instance, Liquid Audio, a company that makes
technology to enable digital distribution of music in a way that
protects copyright and that is a partner of some of the major
record labels has a deal with Scour to enable it to sell several
encrypted songs on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Cook Fleming, vice president of marketing for Liquid
Audio, said Liquid Audio is providing an alternative to people who
might otherwise pirate music rather than pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Another company that has signed a deal with Scour is Nettwerk
Productions, an independent record label aiming to promote one of
its up-and-coming artists, a musician named Brian Transeau who
records as BT, on Scour.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Barrett, director of strategic marketing for Nettwerk,
said the deal puts the label in an awkward position because the
site is promoting the music of BT, but with a single click of the
mouse, users can get pirated versions of BT's songs free through
Scour.
</P>
<P>
   But BT said people will inevitably trade copyrighted music on
the Web, so artists might as well try to figure out how to
capitalize on the sites making that possible. ``It's an
uncontrollable situation,'' BT said. ``You might as well embrace it
and make the best of it, or you're going to go insane trying to
prevent it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some musicians and their agents disagree. Howard King, a
Los Angeles attorney who is representing Metallica and Dr. Dre in
lawsuits against Napster, said that Ovitz and Scour have an
obligation to stand up to piracy. ``Just because some kid in the
Philippines knows how to create a devastating virus, doesn't mean
we say, `Oh it'll happen again,' and not do something about it,''
he said.

3-D GAMING NOW RULE, NOT EXCEPTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, is
always a treat to attend. Each year, the vision of the future of
entertainment becomes just a bit clearer.
</P>
<P>
   For the 2000 gathering, held this month at the Los Angeles
Convention Center, two things became apparent. First, 3-D
technologies are now the rule in computer and video gaming, rather
than the exception. And the hard-core game audience is no longer
the prime market for developers, who are now going after the
mainstream, casual player.
</P>
<P>
   Advances in and the proliferation of 3-D graphics hardware have
made it possible for those who write game programs to craft
elaborate, realistic worlds even for the simplest of games. Nearly
every PC sold in the past two years has a graphics card powerful
enough to run most of the games seen at E3 this year; and many of
those sold in the past three years can also handle them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most of the games being released for personal
computers have some kind of multiplayer or Internet component.
These are usually free _ you don't have to be a member of a service
to find opponents.
</P>
<P>
   For example, remember Frogger, the classic 1980s 2-D video game
in which you guided a frog across busy highways and swift-running
rivers? Hasbro released an updated version a while back, and soon
will offer Frogger 2, which fans of the original will barely
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   In Frogger 2, your little green friend is rendered in three
dimensions and has graduated beyond merely crossing freeways. He
now traverses jungle temples and platforms in space, dodging odd
creatures and tiles that drop from beneath his webbed feet. The
game, due to be delivered later this year, also lets players
compete over a network.
</P>
<P>
   This is a game for a mass audience, but relies on fairly
advanced graphics technology. Hasbro wouldn't be able to design the
game this way if it were not for the pervasiveness of 3-D graphics
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Another example: LucasArts' Monkey Island series of
tongue-in-cheek adventure games have traditionally been in 2-D. But
the next title, Escape from Monkey Island, moves to a 3-D style
that's in keeping with the cartoonish look of past games. This
game, due out in the fall, continues the adventures of
``swashbungling'' hero Guybrush Threepwood as he battles his
longtime nemesis, the villainous pirate, LeChuck.
</P>
<P>
   Games that have traditionally been created in 3-D _ such as
action, strategy and first-person shooters _ looked even better
this year. The realism in some cases was breathtaking, although
these were shown on state-of-the-art graphics cards that are just
now becoming available. They may or may not look as good on your
system when you bring the games home from the store.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive first-person games I saw use id Software's
Quake III engine. That engine, which is at the core of id's own
Quake III Arena death-match game, is being used in three
high-profile games _ Electronic Arts' The World is Not Enough,
based on the James Bond film of the same name; Activision's Star
Trek Voyager: Elite Force, the first shooter to bear the Star Trek
name; and Gray Matter's Return to Castle Wolfenstein, a remake of
the game considered the original first-person shooter.
</P>
<P>
   The capabilities of the Quake III engine make all three titles
incredibly realistic. The Borgs you must battle in the Star Trek
game are creepily rendered _ you can see their ruined faces and the
detailed cyber-components of their exoskeletons. The exotic
settings in the James Bond title are part of an environment that
can be affected by what you do. Shooting at the wrong place on a
balcony can send it crashing down upon you, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But the most realistic of these three games is Return to Castle
Wolfenstein, which updates the original Wolfenstein 3D _ the
precursor to Doom and the original Quake _ in dramatic fashion.
Developers at Gray Matter photographed walls and floors in Europe
to create realistic textures for the Nazi stronghold dubbed Castle
Wolfenstein. The Quake III engine has been tweaked for even more
realism _ you can see the stubble on the chins of your opponents,
and cobwebs waft gently in midair. It is easily the most convincing
3-D environment I've seen yet in any game.
</P>
<P>
   Console games are also increasingly rendered in 3-D, and new
hardware is being developed with that in mind. Sony's Playstation
2, available now in Japan and coming to the United States in
October, is excellent at this. But it pales in comparison to what
will be offered by the latest player in this market: Microsoft's
X-Box.
</P>
<P>
   In closed-room demos for the press, Microsoft showed off the
X-box running at about one-tenth of its power capabilities. Even at
that low level, it was impressive. The detail shown on flowers in
an onscreen garden was rich _ I felt I could reach out and feel the
petals. The Microsoft representative running the demo claimed that
rendering one large flower in the garden used all the power that is
found in Playstation 2, indicating that the X-Box should run rings
around the Sony product.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the overheated atmosphere of E3, it's important to
take all such comments with large grains of salt. But visually, the
X-Box demo beat out anything I saw running on the many Playstation
2 systems at E3. If Microsoft can deliver this quality when it
ships the X-Box sometime next year, the 800-pound gorilla of the PC
world will have made a formidable mark in the console universe.

COMMUNICATION GEAR MAKER TO SEAL ALLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Cisco Systems agreed earlier this month to acquire
Arrowpoint Communications, a maker of switches for Internet
communications, for about $6 billion, some analysts interpreted the
deal as a blow to Arrowpoint's main competitor, Alteon Websystems.
</P>
<P>
   But in the world of communications equipment, in which the
torrid pace of growth is matched only by the ferocity of
competition among giants like Cisco and Nortel Networks of Canada,
small companies with attractive technology can almost always find
friends. Reacting to Cisco's acquisition of Arrowpoint, Alteon
intends to announce this week that it has enlisted two powerful
allies: Lucent Technologies and Akamai Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   As Dominic P. Orr, Alteon's chief executive, put it last Friday:
``Up to 10 days ago, when Cisco acquired Arrowpoint, we were pretty
neutral and worked with any backbone builder. Now Cisco has gone
directly into our area. So now all enemies of Cisco are friends of
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly no bigger enemy of Cisco than Lucent, the
former equipment arm of AT&AMP;T that has stumbled recently, even as
Cisco, the No. 1 maker of Internet communications gear, has become
one of the world's most valuable companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, which has roots in the manufacture of telephone
switches, has spent billions trying to break into the data
communications arena. This week, Alteon intends to announce that
Lucent has agreed to sell Alteon's gear under the Lucent brand.
</P>
<P>
   Alteon and Arrowpoint each make equipment that sits between
communications networks and the big computer servers that support
Web sites and other Internet systems. The gear made by the two
companies helps distribute requests for Internet information among
the various servers within a facility, and helps the owners of
those servers use the computers more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Alteon, based in San Jose, Calif., hopes to benefit from
Lucent's extensive sales force pushing more of its systems into the
market. And Lucent, by putting its brand on Alteon's products, adds
another arrow to its own quiver.
</P>
<P>
   Such deals can be mutually beneficial. But some other small
communications equipment companies have come to believe that such
arrangements favor the bigger player by allowing the giant access
to the start-up's technology, while discouraging the smaller
company from developing its own sales force.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Lucent deal, Alteon also intends to announce this
week that it has struck a partnership with Akamai under which
Akamai will sometimes encourage its customers to purchase Alteon
equipment. Akamai, based in Cambridge, Mass., helps Web sites
distribute information to users more quickly.

REPORT PROPOSES UPDATE OF COPYRIGHT ACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The law meant to protect intellectual property on
the Internet needs to be updated, a Democratic research center says
in a report to be released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report proposes outlawing technologies like the
controversial Napster software that enables Internet users to trade
music files with little regard to copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   The Progressive Policy Institute, which is affiliated with the
Democratic Leadership Council, is releasing its policy brief,
``Napster and Online Piracy: The Need to Revisit the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act,'' ahead of a House Small Business
Committee hearing scheduled for Wednesday to examine Internet music
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is expected to focus on how small recording labels
and lesser-known musical acts are using the Internet and
downloadable music to gain market share. Scheduled witnesses
include Chuck D, founder of Rapstation.com, who has become a vocal
proponent of Napster, which uses a file format called MP3. At
Rapstation.com, music fans can download MP3 files of lesser-known
artists and those who have not yet signed recording contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Progressive Policy Institute hopes the hearing, and its
report, will also focus attention on what it says are needed
updates to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
</P>
<P>
   That law, passed in 1998 to extend traditional copyright
protections to digital works, specifically exempted providers of
Internet access services and search services from liability when
their users transmit pirated works.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, a company in San Mateo, Calif., that operates an online
service, has cited those exemptions as a defense against lawsuits
from major record companies, the heavy metal band Metallica and the
rap artist Dr. Dre, who have accused it of engaging in vicarious
copyright infringement. The groups are seeking damages that could
add up to billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's software works like a co-op. It enables users to swap
songs by trading files in the MP3 format _ a data-compression
formula that turns a CD's music tracks into computer files. Record
companies call it a haven for piracy because it enables
distribution of music without any copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that Napster should qualify as an ISP is not what the
law intended, although it is possible the law could be interpreted
that way,'' said Robert D. Atkinson, director of the institute and
a co-author of the report. ``So we just say, let's tighten the
law.'' ``ISP'' is industry shorthand for ``Internet service
provider.''
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends that the digital copyright law be amended
``to hold Napster, its users, and similar services accountable for
copyright violations while maintaining protections from liability
for service providers that are innocent bystanders to digital
piracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report proposes that services like Napster be required to
collect identifiable and verifiable information from its users,
such as addresses and credit-card information. And it recommends
that the services be required to remove infringing users within a
specific period, perhaps a week, once they are identified.
</P>
<P>
   Napster has argued that it should not be held accountable if its
users illegally trade copyrighted music over the Internet, because
it does not itself store the music on its computers or engage in
trading copyrighted music. Recently, however, Napster did bar
300,000 fans of the rock group Metallica, after the band said the
fans had infringed its copyrights using the service.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson said no legislation had yet been drafted to address the
recommendations in his report. But he said he hoped that
Wednesday's hearing would raise awareness in Washington for the
need to update the digital copyright law to address new
technologies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Any such proposals would likely be met with resistance from the
civil libertarian community, which opposed the original law as
potentially limiting access to works that belong in the public
domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say you are going to take a whole new category of software
and strangle it in its infancy because one of its first uses
resulted in piracy _ that's a bad idea,'' said John Gilmore,
president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online
liberties group based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Other likely opponents are telecommunications companies and
Internet companies that worked for years to reach the compromise
that was passed into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could open a Pandora's box,'' said Peter Harter, a lobbyist
for a company called eMusic, who worked for Netscape when the
digital copyright law was passed. Harter is among the witnesses
scheduled to testify Wednesday.

RENTING SOFTWARE AND THE SKILLS TO GO WITH IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last year, Rave Sports, a small, privately-held maker of
inflatable water trampolines that is based in St. Paul, has been
scrambling to keep up with its sales.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing its executives wanted was the expense of hiring a
computing staff to manage the company's accounting and sales
management systems. So as a lot of other small-business executives
do these days, Rave's chief financial officer, Pat Golden, decided
to ``rent'' its main business software from one of a growing number
of Internet companies known as ASPs.
</P>
<P>
   An ASP _ short for application service provider _ uses the
Internet to offer a range of software and technology-related
services that would otherwise be performed by internal departments
at the customer's company.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers are contracting with application providers to
handle a few computing functions, like accounting, while others,
including Rave, are finding that it pays to farm out just about
everything, including e-mail, human resources management and online
travel booking.
</P>
<P>
   By signing up with an application provider, ``we've eliminated
having to spend a lot of cash upfront,'' Golden said.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has caused an explosion of young companies
specializing in the service, with the leaders including Rave's
provider, Agiliti, as well as Corio, Futurelink and Managed
Opportunity. But the demand has also led to hefty investments by
big telecommunications carriers, including Sprint and Qwest, which
plan to expand into the market. Meanwhile, many of the the nation's
Internet service providers, such as the Concentric Network Corp.,
are moving into the business to make themselves more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, there were only a few dozen companies
calling themselves ASPs. By the end of this year, analysts predict,
there may be several hundred application providers clamoring for
the attention of small and midsize businesses, as well as the
information technology departments at bigger corporations.
</P>
<P>
   And the clamor is likely to fall on receptive ears, as
businesses seek to let somebody else deal with the headaches of
operating a computer network, dealing with frequent software
upgrades and running out of data storage space.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rave is now one of only a few thousand small businesses
that use an application service provider, the number is expected to
rise to 136,000 companies by the end of next year, according to
Cahners In-Stat, a market research company. And by the end of 2004,
according to Cahners In-Stat's forecast, more than three million
small businesses will be using application providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fundamentally changing the way information technology
is purchased and delivered,'' said Tom Kieffer, chief executive of
Agiliti, based in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses typically look at application providers as a
way to ``take away all the pain,'' of computing services, Kieffer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, big corporate computing departments are also rushing
to strike deals with application providers to shed at least some of
their applications. National Airlines, for one, has discovered that
it can keep its technology costs down by contracting out not only
basic services, like e-mail, but some of its more complex tasks as
well, like operating its frequent-flier program.
</P>
<P>
   And it may not be long before the trend touches consumers, too.
Instead of buying the latest new calendar software, a customer
could simply subscribe to a calendar program, accessing it over the
Web so that it would hog memory on a server computer rather than on
a PC, Palm hand-held device or, eventually, even a telephone. The
only requirement is a device with a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Several Web sites already offer consumers scheduling and other
basic software. Still missing is the business model that enables
companies to offer consumers a full range of software services at a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of all this activity, though, the application
provider business is among the fastest-growing information
technology categories today _one whose growth rate will only
accelerate, analysts predict. In 1998, revenues for application
service providers totaled about $400 million in North America,
according to the research firm Dataquest. Last year, that figure
rose to just over $1 billion, and it is expected to double this
year, to $2.4 billion. And in 2001, revenues will more than double
again, to $5.3 billion, Dataquest predicts.
</P>
<P>
   A major force behind the predicted surge is the expected arrival
in the market later this year of Sprint, Qwest and other
communications carriers. Those companies are investing
substantially in systems that will let them supply application
services, even as they roll out high-speed networks capable of
carrying voice, data and images.
</P>
<P>
   As the carriers enter the market, a rash of partnerships is
likely to break out among the various players. By the end of the
year, in fact, analysts are predicting that some companies will be
offering a package of rented software and high-speed Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, for example, has already signed a deal with
USinternetworking to deliver application services over AT&AMP;T's
planned high-speed networks through an AT&AMP;T program called
Ecosystem. Eventually, analysts predict, buying a busines network
computing service will be like choosing a telephone calling plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses aren't going to say, `I want a DSL line,''' said
Kneko Burney, director of markets and computing for Cahners
In-Stat, referring to a type of high-speed Internet connection.
``They'll say, `We want these business services.'''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say another factor driving growth is an increasing
confidence that businesses have with the security of online
communications. Because of that confidence, they are willing to
make the offerings of application providers available to more
employees.
</P>
<P>
   And businesses say they are reaping substantial savings by
renting software remotely rather than buying it and installing it
on site. An e-mail system, for example, can cost a company several
hundred dollars for each employee to operate internally each month.
By contracting with an outsider, some businesses say they can get
the cost down to about $100. Other services, like travel booking
and expense management, are often priced for each transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predict that only the most mundane and basic
computing programs, like word processing, are likely to remain on
the hard disks of office computers as ASPs gain momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Rave, with 55 employees, has contracted with Agiliti to provide
and maintain the company's e-mail, accounting and order management
systems _ all for a monthly per-employee fee.
</P>
<P>
   Golden, Rave's chief financial officer, says the Agiliti
contract has allowed Rave to avoid hiring the additional technical
staff the company would have needed to handle those activities.
Because of the Agiliti deal, Rave's entire internal computing
operations can now be performed by one staff member, working
half-time. Rave's information-technology spending is only 2 percent
of sales, rather than the 5 percent Golden had been budgeting
before signing with Agiliti.
</P>
<P>
   Contracting with an application provider has also meant that
Rave can afford to use the latest accounting software, which would
otherwise have been too expensive to buy for each employee, Golden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among bigger businesses, the construction company Morrison
Knudsen decided to farm out management of its e-mail system after
its acquisition of another company required adding nearly 6,000
e-mail addresses virtually overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine how long it would take to do that ourselves,'' said
Brian Bertlin, information services director of Morrison Knudsen,
based in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison Knudsen also handed off operation of its online travel
booking a few months ago to Unisys and is about to let Unisys take
on the company's travel expense accounting system. The aim, Bertlin
said, is to reduce costs in areas that do not directly generate
revenues for the company.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the application provider business is similar to
the network PC business model that concerns like Oracle and Novell
tried to have companies embrace a few years ago. Under that plan,
stripped-down personal computers were to function as terminals for
software resources stored on remote computer servers. But some
full-scale PCs became available for only a few hundred dollars, and
the network PC model never took hold.
</P>
<P>
   The application provider is also reminiscent of elements of the
mainframe era, when companies paid to time share the resources of
giant systems owned and run by companies like IBM and Digital
Equipment In the time-sharing systems of the 1970s, small and
midsize companies found it more economical to rent the resources of
a mainframe computer company rather than invest in
multimillion-dollar systems of their own, with all the attendant
support and staffing costs.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to the predominance of desktop PCs at most
modern business, as opposed to the few, closely guarded mainframe
terminals of yesteryear, there is at least one other key
difference: in hiring an application provider, the customer is
paying for the knowledge and skill of the supplier, not simply the
software and server computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it's not about economies of scale but about economies
of skill,'' Burney said. ``It's all about expertise and the right
operating environment.''

CAN MARY HIGGINS CLARK LURE HER FAITHFUL TO E-BOOKS?

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary Higgins Clark, the blockbuster mystery writer
who lives in a mansion in Saddle River, N.J., and a Manhattan
apartment with commanding views of Central Park, grew up in the
Bronx, off Pelham Parkway. Her father owned a bar, called Higgins
Bar and Grille, and he died suddenly one Sunday morning while she
was at church.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, my mother had a total of $2,000 and three kids,''
Clark said in a recent interview in her pied-a-terre on Central
Park South, an emerald the size of a Chiclet on the third finger of
her left hand and an oil portrait of herself in rich pastels on the
wall behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's mother, to make ends meet, rented out rooms. ``She put
up a sign that said, `Furnished rooms, kitchen privileges,''' Clark
said. ``But the neighbors thought the second phrase brought down
the tone of the neighborhood, so they asked my mother to cut it off
the sign. So she did. She was terribly enterprising.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clark, 72, has not lost the Bronx-Irish lilt to her voice
or her love of Irish jokes (A favorite: ``You know how an Irishman
proposes? `Nora, would you care to be buried with my mother?'''),
she has come a long way from those early Bronx days. Her latest
contract with Simon &AMP; Schuster, announced last month, is believed
to be a record-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   At five books for a total advance of $64 million, the contract
made her the highest-paid female author in the world, per book,
according to most industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the numbers, Clark is in some ways an intriguing
experiment for Simon &AMP; Schuster. Though the publishing house, a
unit of Viacom, says the author's possible appeal in the digital
world was not a factor in the negotiations, the company this week
will release the electronic version of ``Before I Say Good-Bye'' _
her newest best seller _ and nine of her other books in electronic
versions that will be available for laptops and desktop computers,
electronic reading devices and personal digital assistants.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear if the mass market will find e-books
approachable. But Clark is a proven weapon. Her 22 hardcover books
_ usually critically unacclaimed mysteries that feature heroines
through whom housewives around the world can live out fears and
fantasies _ have all been best sellers. Her first suspense novel,
``Where Are the Children?'' published in 1975, has gone into 70
printings and has sold too many millions of copies for her agent or
publisher to estimate. By 2005, Clark will have received $160
million from Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Romanos, president and chief operating officer of Simon &AMP;
Schuster, said that as mass-market paperback sales atrophy across
the industry, one way to reconnect with readers may be to make a
mass-market author like Clark available in electronic formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, No. 1, if you ask anybody our goal in the next few
years, it is going to be to intelligently guide the predominantly
print-oriented consumer publishing company into the electronic,
digital publishing world that's around the corner,'' Romanos said.
``The potential for the digital future still comes back to words.
The book may have just been a container. And we may now have to try
to reach readers on a screen, not in a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of mass-market paperbacks _ a medium in which the entire
Clark canon has traditionally been available _ are suffering across
the industry, which is struggling to reconcile its musty,
old-fashioned medium with the copyright and distribution issues of
the electronic and digital era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core audience for the mass-market paperback is shrinking,
and that is something we have to think about every day,'' Romanos
said. ``The baby boomers, the `paperback in your back pocket'
people of the 1960s and 1970s, are now older and more affluent and
are buying hardcovers and walking around with reading glasses in
their back pockets. And that is coupled with the fact that we are
losing ground to the electronic media, which young people are
turning to for their leisure time.''
</P>
<P>
   And Simon &AMP; Schuster itself is also in a state of transition. In
1998, Viacom sold the publishing house's highly profitable textbook
and reference division to Pearson for $4.6 billion. And over the
coming year, the remaining part of Simon &AMP; Schuster, its trade-book
division, will be absorbed into the larger corporate structure of
the merged Viacom and CBS and will become an even smaller slice of
the corporate pie.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract gives Clark advances of $15 million each for
four mysteries, and $4 million for a memoir, which is to be
published in 2001 and which she has tentatively titled ``Kitchen
Privileges'' in homage to her mother. (Her last deal, in 1996, was
for three books at $36 million, or $12 million each.)
</P>
<P>
   Her editor, Michael Korda, and her agent, Eugene Winick of
McIntosh &AMP; Otis, both said that Clark made money for Simon &AMP;
Schuster above and beyond what it paid her. But other editors and
executives at Simon &AMP; Schuster said she was considered more of a
break-even author whose best sellers help ease the rest of the
Simon &AMP; Schuster list into bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Each of Clark's books sells about 700,000 hardcover copies,
which retail for $29 and on which she earns as much as a 15 percent
royalty, and about 1.5 million paperbacks at $7.99 with a 10
percent royalty.
</P>
<P>
   Because publishers do not release sales figures, it is
impossible to gauge how much she contributes to Simon &AMP; Schuster's
bottom line. One factor that adds to Clark's value is what is, to
some, her mystifying popularity overseas: she is, for example, the
best-selling fiction author in France, where the paperback rights
to her books regularly sell for more than 3 million francs (about
$420,000), said a foreign publishing scout based in New York who is
acquainted with her French contracts. Simon &AMP; Schuster retains
world rights to her novels, and sells foreign rights in individual
countries like the Netherlands, Italy, Britain and Germany,
countries where she is also very popular.
</P>
<P>
   John Baker, the editorial director of Publishers Weekly, the
trade journal, compared her books' popularity with foreign readers
to Sylvester Stallone movies that fare poorly in the United States
but generate substantial income in foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``For authors who are enormously successful but generally
critically spurned, as I am afraid poor Mary tends to be, there is
a lot of money to be made overseas,'' Baker said. ``I mean, they
name streets after her in France. It's a sort of Jerry Lewis
syndrome, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark's new books also can spur sales of her backlisted books
around Mother's Day each year, when her novels are published.
Unlike some other blockbuster authors like Patricia Cornwell, for
example, who have switched publishing houses during their careers _
all her books are under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   The one area in which Clark makes very little money, compared to
blockbuster authors like John Grisham or Stephen King, is in movies
or television.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said Clark's books are neither violent enough nor sexy
enough for Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her audience is romance readers who want a little suspense
thrown in,'' he said. ``They are not teenaged boys, which seems to
be the Hollywood market these days.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, given the vagaries, opportunities and threat
of the digital world, a traditional publishing company may be happy
to know that at least one of its blockbuster authors will be
sticking around for at least another half-decade.
</P>
<P>
   David Gernert, the agent and editor for Grisham, who is
published by Doubleday, said: ``In five years, a Clancy or a King
or a Grisham could walk up and say to their traditional publisher,
`I'm going to publish my own books on the Web and I'm going to
charge $20 a copy and of that $20 I will take home $18.' Well,
that's a little different from the model that book publishers are
offering. There's nothing like a long-term contract, because the
future is a little uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   There is usually little left to uncertainty in a typical Clark
book. They usually follow a sleuthing protagonist _ always a
self-made woman with a career that lends itself to investigation,
like an attorney, television producer or reporter _ as a mystery,
such as a murder, a kidnapping or a bomb investigation, unfolds
around her.
</P>
<P>
   There is a symmetry between her plots and her own self-made
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is in each book a heroine, and there are certain
similarities to what we know about Mary,'' said Korda.
</P>
<P>
   After attending secretarial school, Clark worked as a secretary
and then as a Pan Am stewardess before marrying a childhood
neighbor, Warren Clark.
</P>
<P>
   She sold her first short story when she was 29, but interrupted
her writing to raise her children. Her husband _ who had a heart
condition that made him uninsurable _ died when Clark was 37,
leaving her with five children. She went to work writing radio
scripts to support the family, and rose at 5 a.m. every day to work
on a novel. (She remarried several years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   She sold her first suspense novel in 1975 for $3,000. For her
second in 1977, she got more than $1 million for all the rights,
and the first thing she did was buy a Cadillac to replace an
Oldsmobile with 146,000 miles on the odometer. Clark returned to
school and graduated from Fordham University in 1979. The
university gave her an honorary doctorate in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the secret to her novels was that she explored the
fears of regular women, and used her heroines to reconcile those
fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``My people are never looking for trouble,'' she said. ``The
example I use is this: a young woman is in a see-through blouse and
a black leather miniskirt and walks along Ninth Avenue at three in
the morning. Something happens to her, You say, `My goodness, that
is terrible.'
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, if you take the same young woman, and she's
in her home, and she looks at her watch and says, `Oh gosh, it's
time to pick up the baby from Mother's,' and she gets in the car
and at the end of the driveway, from the floor of the back seat
someone says, `Don't turn right, dear. Turn left,' then she is your
sister or your daughter and you become emotionally involved in it.
I write about nice people whose lives are in danger.''

NEW ECONOMY: LAW FIRMS SEE A BILL COME DUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider this logic problem: Event A causes Event B. B then
causes C, and C causes D. Now assume A had never happened. Would D
have ever occurred?
</P>
<P>
   This is the multimillion-dollar hypothetical question that the
nation's top corporate lawyers find themselves uncomfortably
pondering after a wild five months that have altered the American
legal industry. If the answer to the question is no _ and there is
some strong evidence to support that conclusion _ then the
country's most prestigious law firms appear to have given
themselves an unnecessary and expensive headache.
</P>
<P>
   In their pain are lessons about the problems that overvalued
equity prices can cause even for businesses that seem to have
little relation to the stocks in question.
</P>
<P>
   The legal world's chain reaction had its beginnings last year in
Silicon Valley. With fast-growing Internet companies desperate for
employees, the Bay Area's law firms became prime hunting grounds.
Dozens of young, well-educated associates were more than happy to
accept the offers, leaving behind legal work that can resemble
drudgery to receive stock options that could be worth millions.
Turnover at the law firms soon hit new highs.
</P>
<P>
   The young lawyers' bosses began responding just before the new
year. Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin &AMP; Hachigian, a
small firm in Menlo Park, Calif., led the way, increasing
associates' salaries as much as 40 percent. Larger Bay Area firms
quickly matched and, to avoid morale problems, extended the raises
to lawyers in offices around the country.
</P>
<P>
   That was the key moment, the one that turned a local problem _
the dot-com talent war _ into a national phenomenon. The biggest
New York firms, which had always paid the highest salaries in the
nation, then had little choice but to match the increases or risk
losing their best lawyers to the East Coast branches of their
California rivals. By the spring, first-year associates at top
firms across the country were earning $125,000 a year, not
including annual bonuses that often exceed $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, however, something ironic was happening. At the
very companies stealing the lawyers, stock prices stopped rising.
Between Jan. 1 and April 1, the Morgan Stanley Internet index fell
5 percent. In April, as everybody now knows, the real drop came.
The index lost an additional 30 percent of its value in the first
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of dot-com companies, running through their cash and no
longer confident of being able to turn to the capital markets for
another infusion, began to conduct business differently. Private
companies had to delay their initial public offerings, making them
less able to offer rich salary packages. Suddenly, the value of
millions of stock options was in question.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rapid change from the two previous years, when many of
the lawyers who left behind law firm life for the Internet quickly
became millionaires, at least on paper. ``It appeared to people for
a while that if you reached for the brass ring, you grasped it,''
said Frederick Muto, a partner who oversees the San Diego office of
Cooley Godward, one of the firms with headquarters in Silicon
Valley. ``That perception has changed already.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is predictable: Turnover at many California law firms
has returned to normal levels. The big raises have surely played
some role in the decrease, but both partners and associates say the
biggest factor has been the technology slump. After all, notes
William F. Lee, the managing partner of Hale &AMP; Dorr in Boston, ``we
could never pay people enough'' to match the upside of stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what happened in the San Francisco office of Brobeck
Phleger &AMP; Harrison, another big California firm. On April 14 _ the
same day the Nasdaq hit its low for the year _ the lawyers there
held a going-away party for a senior associate who was quitting to
join an Internet company. On Saturday, a venture-capital firm
backed out of a large investment it had been planning to make in
the company. On Sunday, the lawyer called a partner to ask if she
could have her job back. On Monday, she was sitting in her office
again ``as if nothing had ever happened,'' said Tower C. Snow Jr.,
the firm's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Brobeck's turnover rate for associates is running at an
annual pace of about 16 percent this year. Because many fewer
lawyers have left in the last two months than in January and
February, Snow said he expected the final number to be close to 11
percent, the same as in 1998. Last year, by contrast, nearly
one-fourth of all Brobeck associates quit the firm.
</P>
<P>
   So the match that started the brush fire that grew into a forest
fire has now been extinguished. The lawyers who run the large firms
are reluctant to say they regret giving the raises _ which would be
tantamount to saying their own employees are overvalued _ but many
partners agree that had the market downturn come sooner, salaries
might not be at their current level.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the environment would have been
different,'' said Alan S. Jaffe, the chairman of Proskauer Rose in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Snow added: ``A lot of the firms were very, very unhappy to make
the adjustments. I'm sure they're even more unhappy now.''
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that the firms overreacted in the first place
and that the decline of many technology stocks in early 2000 should
have suggested that the associate exodus would soon slow. On the
other hand, any individual firm that did not give raises risked
losing lawyers immediately, as would probably happen if the firms
now tried to scale back salaries to their earlier levels.
</P>
<P>
   For the most profitable firms, the raises may do little other
than cut the partners' annual pay by a hundred thousand dollars or
so. But some firms are already considering steps that include
raising their billing rates, cutting back on hiring, using
lawyer-for-hire agencies more often and even withdrawing from some
areas of the law. The drying up of the market for initial public
offerings and the Federal Reserve's recent interest-rate increases
could make cost-cutting more urgent if the lawyers' revenue begins
to slow, too.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the nation's biggest law firms are learning a
tough lesson about a downside of the new economy. For everybody
else, the moral of the story may be more familiar: Be wary of
accepting investment advice from your lawyer.

COMBATTING VIRUSES A NEVER-ENDING TASK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JACK WARNER   
 c.2000 Cox News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There are times, like a couple of weeks ago, when it's
nice not to be on the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   I refer to the weekend when most of the computerized world was
struggling with the I Love You virus. Yours truly was also
struggling, of course, but with an older and evidently lesser
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody sent me the I Love You virus. There would have been no
point in it. The memsahib and I have been married 43 years now, and
we don't exchange e-mails with I Love You in the header. Call us
unromantic if you will, but e-mail seems to lack something in terms
of intimacy. I can still recall those lightly perfumed letters I
got from her during our courtship.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, if I should see ``I Love You'' amongst my messages,
at home or at work, I would assume it to be from a child seeking
money or an ad for a porno site. While it has been one of my
lifelong ambitions to be a sex object, only dogs and an amorous
goat in North Georgia have shown any inclination to follow me
around.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, I'm also leery of opening attachments
unless I know who they're from. Eudora Pro automatically saves
every attachment I get at home, so every so often I go through and
dump them all. Unfortunately, since I subscribe to several busy
mailing lists, there are a lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the I Love You virus reminded me that it's been
awhile since I updated my Norton Anti-Virus protection. Upon doing
that, the system informed my that FNEBJ.EXE, in the Windows/System
directory, was infected with a virus called Back Door SubSeven22.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how long this little fellow has been lurking in my
computer, but he didn't seem to cause any trouble until he was
found. After many system lockups and reboots, Norton agreed to try
to repair the file but could not, suggesting quarantine instead.
</P>
<P>
   The program reports that Back Door SubSeven22 is a rare virus, a
``Trojan horse that creates a security hole into your system.'' Now
that the file is in quarantine, Windows squawks about it every time
the system is booted. Removal from WIN.INI helped, but Windows
still complains.
</P>
<P>
   Try as I might, I couldn't find FNEBJ.EXE anywhere on the
Windows 98 install disk, so one assumes it is created upon
installation. Whatever the case, Windows seems to run all right
without it.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after updating the virus information, Back Door
SubSeven22 showed up again, but this time Norton grabbed it.
</P>
<P>
   The moral? Update your virus definitions regularly.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Keep your home computer spiffed up and running
on all cylinders with Iolo Technologies' System Mechanic 3.2
(Shareware/30 days free, $20-$60; www.iolo.com, for Windows PCs). A
cadre of 12 powerful tools, this utility will optimize your PC's
Internet and network speed and security settings, remove invalid,
orphaned, obsolete and nonsense files, then find and fix broken
shortcuts. Also included is an easy-to-understand start-up manager,
a safe installation feature that tells you exactly what's been
altered after new programs are added, and even an incinerator as a
companion to the recycle bin for total obliteration of sensitive
files. System Mechanic did somehow allow this particular
click-happy user to lose track of his word processor, but for the
most part the cleaning machine is idiot friendly if not idiot
proof. The free and fully functioning 30-day-demo enticement is the
real kicker here. Try it out. As those holistic folks like to say,
there's nothing like a good purge to keep you spiffed.

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Look, you're never going be a true Austinite until you've
learned a few chords and opened for Jerry Jeff Walker. But, what's
that? You don't know how to play guitar? Before you sign up for
lessons, check out eMedia Guitar Method CD-ROM ($60 for Windows and
Macintosh, www.emedia.org). The CD-ROM teaches you guitar basics
with features like an animated fretboard, fretronome, a ``virtual''
guitar neck that illustrates where to put your fingers and a
selection of classic songs to practice, such as ``La Bamba'' and
``House of the Rising Sun.'' Other volumes of the software include
a roster of new songs and help from guitar whiz Peter Frampton.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU CAN KICK IT, THIS WILL RECORD IT
</P>
<P>
   OK, you've learned how to play the guitar and you've put
together a band. The problem is that the major record labels aren't
calling. What do you do? You make your own garage-band-grunge CD.
Helping you in this is Sony's new ECM-MS907 one-point stereo
microphone ($100, www.sony.com). The microphone fits all Sony
minidisc and DAT players and offers superior sound recording in the
right situations, such as recording instruments. However, it didn't
work well in picking up vocals. It also boasts 90- and 120-degree
recording so you can bring the whole orchestra. A piece of advice:
Invite the whole band, can the droning lyrics and get right to the
guitar solo.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK GOOD WHILE YOU LISTEN
</P>
<P>
   You want to look good while listening to your tunes. That's why
you need to pick up Sony's Street Style Discman ($160,
www.sony.com). The industrial-looking Discman is a must-have for
the trendy, on-the-go set. The device is finished in chrome and red
translucent plastic and has a carrying strap, making it the
ultimate accoutrement to a rollerblading escapade. The Street Style
Discman also comes with Street Style headphones, which wrap around
the back of the head and provide awesome sound. If you think this
portable CD player just looks good, think again. This Discman is
equipped with Sony's patented ESP2, which is some of the best skip
protection on the market. With ESP2 and the Street Style Discman,
you'll never miss a beat _ and look good in the process.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   The classic, all consuming, highly addictive Tetris has been
reworked and specifically revamped for preschoolers as Kids Tetris
($30; www. hasbro-interactive. com; for the PC). Still utilizing
the familiar falling multi-gonal block shapes, Kids Tetris has
those traditional, ``elaborate'' puzzle pieces pre-fastened to form
more rudimentary block shapes that fall at a leisurely pace. More
importantly, the blocks are animated with happy cartoon faces that
actually talk to the player, giving hints, suggestions and joyful
words of encouragement. Fun, funny and rewarding gameplay, while
still offering elemental lessons in problem solving and motor
skills.

same neat package.

   If you've got a wireless Web cellular phone, you can order a
book, check sports scores or get the latest news from CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and if you want to make a phone call, you can do that, too.
</P>
<P>
   The newest generation of cellular phones has matchbook-sized
screens and built-in Internet browsers that let users access
everything from CNN to Yahoo to Amazon.com. Industry analysts
expect that most cellular phones will be Web-ready by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Users of wireless Web cell phone service can check e-mail, make
travel arrangements, get the latest stock quotes and even make a
phone call. Unlike personal digital assistants, interactive pagers
or other wireless devices, the wireless Web phone lets you do all
that without having a plethora of interactive devices strapped to
your belt or tucked into your purse.
</P>
<P>
   A Web phone is a handy thing to have. While sitting at an
airport, for example, you can log on to the Delta Air Lines Web
site, enter your flight number, discover that your plane has been
delayed by 45 minutes and either book another flight or just sit
back and have another cup of coffee in the lounge. While you're at
it, you can call your family and friends and tell them not to rush
to the airport to pick you up.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as you wait patiently for your plane, you can do
everything from buy books at Amazon.com to check your e-mail.
Americans are now finding out what the folks in Scandinavia have
known for quite some time. Being able to go online from your phone,
your pager or any other hand-held device is pretty cool.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can use your Web phone to go shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Deanna Sanford said one of her colleagues went
shopping with a list his wife e-mailed to his Hotmail account. He
was able to wander the supermarket aisles while consulting the
e-mail message he retrieved on his cell phone to tell him which
groceries to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wireless technologies are the next Internet,'' said Debora
Wilson, president and chief executive of Weather.com, the online
offering by the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the same feeling about wireless that I had five years
ago about the Internet. The ability to receive information on
devices you carry around with you all day is the next wave of
things. It's like history repeating itself,'' she said. ``A year
ago, everyone wondered what would happen with wireless. It's been
so slow, because the Internet is such a force, but it's the next
wave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much potential (with wireless Web phones), but most
customers really haven't gotten into using their phones for data
yet,'' said EarthLink's vice president of product management, Tom
Andrus. He said educating consumers is the next step in the
development of the wireless Web phones and other wireless products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to education, there are other problems with this
early generation of Web phones. Even though there are people
happily devoted to Web phones, there are others who gripe that the
two- to five-line text-only messages most Web phones can handle are
hard to read and often useless.
</P>
<P>
   To compound the problem, many popular Web sites are not yet
optimized for Web phone users. For example, if you type in the Web
address for Salon using a Web phone, you will receive an error
message telling you the site isn't yet phone-ready. Similarly, if
you want to send e-mail, you'll have to do it over the Web-based
application that comes with your phone, typically Yahoo Mail or
Microsoft's Hotmail.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem are the extra buttons, toggle switches
and other gizmos added to cellular phones to give them Web
capability. The wireless Web is a handy add-on to a cellular phone,
but already there are plenty of users who can't figure out how to
make a local phone call, never mind surf the Web with their phones.
</P>
<P>
   Xcelerate, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based company, operates a
``usability center'' in Atlanta where groups of experienced and
novice users are brought in to test the newest cellular
innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Fawad Ahmad, managing director for wireless services at the
center, said the usability lab tries to find out how easy or
complicated it is for users to actually use the Web via the cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, we ask them to perform eight to 15 different
tests,'' he said. ``Let's say we are doing a test for Amazon.com.
We'll ask users to buy a book, and we'll tell them the title of the
book they're going to buy,'' he said. ``Then we see which phone
it's easiest to do it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad said Xcelerate watches every move the testers make and
examines virtually every button on every phone. ``We observe their
body language, and we look at the screens on the phones and how
friendly they are to a Web-based application. It's pretty extensive
testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad said Web phone users must be comfortable using the Web via
a wireless device, and that it can take some time. He recommends
newer phones, which have larger screens than some of the earliest
models.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some newer phones have a separate keypad or three to four
buttons to use (to access the Web) and are much more
user-friendly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad believes the biggest problem now is that the tiny
telephone screen isn't big enough for most people who are used to a
17-inch color monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key assumption,'' Ahmad said, ``is that screen is not wide
enough or not long enough and you can't do Web browsing on a
two-line display. That drives people crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   While new cell phone technology is making it easier for users to
navigate their way around the Web, Internet companies developing
services for the wireless Web should keep several things in mind,
according to Ahmad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to be a leader in the wireless space, you
have to be innovative,'' he said. ``Your top three lines are your
best real estate. Put the stuff you know users want at the top so
people can read it without scrolling. You won't have as much
information as you have on the Web site, but people just want to
get to your site to use it. Don't give them ads, because then they
won't be able to do the actual task. ``
</P>
<P>
   One of the most active companies in the wireless area today is
Microsoft. It rolled out MSN Mobile 2.0 service in March as part of
its ``Everyday Web'' strategy. The thinking is that users of the
Microsoft Network and its family of Web sites aren't chained to
their PCs all day and will look to other devices for Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   The MSN Mobile service allows users to access most of the MSN
Web sites including Hotmail, MoneyCentral, Expedia travel
information and even horoscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Sanford said MSN's mobile initiatives, including the
MSN Mobile 2.0 cell phone product, are part of the company's
Internet strategy to provide users a satisfying MSN experience on a
variety of devices. She said it's a strategy that's been in the
works for a long time. ``This isn't something you can do
overnight,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's investment with wireless phone provider Nextel in
February 1999 got the MSN team thinking about the best way to
deliver MSN content to cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real challenge,'' Sanford said. ``There is limited
screen space, and people use their phones differently from how they
use the PC-based Web. People don't want to just surf. They want a
more focused experience. We approach it from making things really
timely and really relevant to make things right for the right
devices.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things MSN did when developing products for
wireless devices was to make sure users could keep the passwords
they already use on the Web. Sanford said the key to a positive
wireless Web phone experience is to develop products that are
relevant for the phone, such as travel, maps and e-mail, some of
the most popular wireless Web services.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford said getting Web-based information to customers quickly
is one of the biggest challenges so far. She said Microsoft uses
XML technology to strip the data from the Web pages and put it into
a format that mobile phone users can access quickly and easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think the data network on the phone is slow,''
she said. ``But a lot of the lag time depends on how fast the site
can deliver information across the wireless network. You have to
employ the same kind of technology that Web sites already use to
optimize their pages so they'll load faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the Internet companies, Microsoft is trying to
develop applications for the Web phones that make sense for users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking about a lot of things when we think about the
future of MSN Mobile,'' Sanford said. And she echoes the rest of
the industry that's still trying to tame a new technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all so new,'' she said. ``We're all trying to figure out
what people want when they choose to stay connected with these
devices. We still don't know what people really want because the
phones are just coming out. We are trying to get at what people
would want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been around for a year, so we have a slight advantage.
We know the Web phone should be able to give people things they can
use when they are out and about. We want to give them the ability
to get things done on the run.''
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink Vice President Erika Jolly, who heads up EarthLink's
wireless Web phone efforts, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have to think differently, because it's a totally
different environment. People are used to pictures and colors, so
we have to work to develop something that's still visually
appealing to the customer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may not want a stock chart, but you may want to see the
stock price for that day. You may not want to see all your e-mail,
but maybe you'll want to flag e-mail from your boss or some of your
friends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jolly said wireless Web users want information that's useful and
accessible, but that there's still a long way to go in terms of
development and ease of use. ``It's like the 9,600-baud modems when
they first came out,'' she said. ``Everyone thought they were lame.
There are some limitations on the phones right now, but we have to
be patient.''

 &HT;    Fax machine saves its owners money
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A new fax machine from Sharp Document and Network
Systems of America can cut the cost of running a home business by
finding the cheapest available phone company to handle any fax or
telephone call to another state.
</P>
<P>
   The UX-345L is one of the first fax machines on the market to
utilize low-cost routing technology, according to a press release
from the office product division of Sharp Electronics Corp. The
product is made possible by a collaboration between Sharp and
openLCR.com, a Web-based telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   When you buy the UX-345L, you link the machine to the
openLCR.com Web site to prepare it to work. From the site, the fax
machine downloads a listing of all pricing information for the
available long-distance companies to a chip in the machine.
</P>
<P>
   When the user dials an area code and the first three digits of
the number being called, the UX-345L checks its list and picks the
company with the lowest rate for that day of the week and time of
day.
</P>
<P>
   Users don't have to remember access codes for different
long-distance services or sign up with new long-distance carriers.
They also retain their current telephone billing system; the calls
directed by the UX-345L will be itemized on the customers' regular
phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The machine links to the openLCR.com Web site once a month to
get the latest rate information.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the low-cost routing feature, the UX-345L has all
the bells and whistles found on other moderately priced plain-paper
fax machines.
</P>
<P>
   It has a 60-sheet paper cassette and about 28 pages of built-in
memory that can store incoming faxes when the paper cassette is
empty.
</P>
<P>
   The UX-345L has distinctive ring detection that allows up to
four telephone numbers to ring on one telephone line, a caller ID
that displays the name and number of the caller, anti-junk fax
settings to block unwanted transmissions and a copier function.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a 10-page document feeder and an automatic cover
sheet writer, and it transmits an average page in about 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The UX-345L sells for $129.99 at www.sharpoffice.com, and it's
available where office supplies are sold. For additional
information, call Sharp at (800) 237-4277 (BE-SHARP) or log on to
the www.sharpoffice.com site.
</P>
<P>
   For additional information on the low-cost routing service,
visit www.openLCR.com.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ www.telenaut.com/gst _ Post your original
artwork and view other kids' art in virtual galleries on the Global
Show-'n-Tell home page. Each of the five galleries, organized by
age group, are named after an endangered species with links to
learn more about those species. The artwork, however, doesn't seem

<P>
   www.kidlink.org _ The well-established site based in Norway is
celebrating its 10th anniversary this month. It claims more than
135,000 kids from 135 countries have participated over the years.
The site aims to facilitate a global dialogue for children over the
Internet _ through e-mail lists, chat rooms and various Web-based
dialogues in 15 languages _ in an effort to engender understanding
among cultures and, simply, to make new friends. To participate, a
child must answer these four questions: Who am I? What do I want to
be when I grow up? How do I want the world to be better when I grow
up? What can I do now to make this happen?

What is technology doing to kids? It's creating a new way of
thinking &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ These children, they used to call them nerds.
</P>
<P>
   As they tap-tap-tapped on midget keyboards, eyesight weakened
from pre-EPA-approved, radiation-spewing monitors, the kids spoke
of their love of computers in secret. They joined computer clubs
that met after class, a refuge from the after-school-bell bullies _
because what they were doing didn't remotely approach a state of
acceptable coolness.
</P>
<P>
   They wore corduroy. They might have liked it.
</P>
<P>
   And then the revolution came, quietly in the '80s, then loudly
through the '90s, making a lot of people rich, and putting the
hobby tools of their youth into every home, every low-rent hotel,
on the counters of gas stations, until the computers were
everywhere. Until it was OK.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and modems and the mighty Web are as ubiquitous in a
child's vocabulary as the multiplication table. The geeks did
inherit the Earth. The archaic DOS became the unstable Windows, and
every barely computer-literate person who wasn't a gifted and
talented child could shove a mouse around and feel wired. Now
parents fret about digital divides and computers in the classroom.
Are they learning online? Will they know enough?
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that computers, and more importantly, the Internet,
are changing the way children learn, develop and think. Today's
technotykes will be tomorrow's information wranglers. They'll work
in real-time, though hopefully not by speaking in useless info-age
buzzwords. They will think in multidimensions, incorporating
hyperlinks, sound and video into their everyday communication. The
adults of tomorrow will learn to work as teams, pushing gigabytes
of information around like scraps of Post-It notes. No, forget
tomorrow. They're doing it now.
</P>
<P>
   GALS AND THEIR WEB SITES
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Stanley had a computer in her home even when her family
chose not to keep a TV or radio in the house. ``I've been around
computers all my life,'' she said. The 13-year-old, who comes from
a family of computer enthusiasts, learned how to paint jeans at a
camp last summer. Now she wants to sell her wearable art online.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda's curious eyes and chatty conversation belie a mind built
for multitasking. She is enrolled in Giga Gals, a program that
started at the Austin Children's Museum in February. Web designers
help 9- to 18-year-olds get online and start their own sites, from
Web diaries to e-commerce ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Evans, co-owner of Austin's Digital Voodoo, a Web
design firm, has been helping Amanda get her site up and running.
And, it turns out, they were perfectly matched. ``I used to paint
jeans in college,'' Evans said. ``It's a total coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said she's been surprised by the pace of Amanda's work.
While Evans gets a crash course in pop culture from the teenager,
her student is picking up Web skills at a rate much faster than
most adults could, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has no fear,'' Evans said. ``Kids are faster at absorbing
the technology. The interest level is higher and they're closer to
the technology. Some adults don't want to be a part of the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids and young adults coming of age just as Internet access has
become cheap and commonly available may have an advantage in the
information age over adults who approach new technologies as if
they're learning a new language.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Sams, who coordinates Giga Gals, said that's because kids
have become accustomed to a time when information is available at
their fingertips. Instead of cracking dusty encyclopedias, they
consult CD-ROMs and search engines. ``I'm always shocked,'' Sams
said. ``They have a whole world of information and it's made their
world a lot smaller than ours. I think it's really changing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sams, who with her nose ring and bright flower-shaped hair clips
looks like an enthusiastic teenager herself, says she doesn't think
today's kids are any smarter. ``They're still beating the hell out
of each other and running wild,'' she said. But they are savvier.
``There's the opportunity for them to be more creative as
technology becomes more affordable. There are just more things to
stimulate how smart they are.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the digital divide that sociologists fear will
keep that technology away from kids who need it most?
</P>
<P>
   Sams once taught a class of Spanish-speaking students who had
had little or no contact with the Net. Given the opportunity, they
quickly caught up, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids could hardly speak English,'' she said, ``but they
knew how to get around the Internet. We communicated that way.''
</P>
<P>
   THE WEB _ 'IT JUST IS'
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Human Code, an Austin multimedia company, hosted a
forum on the future of education that aired locally on KLRU. Titled
``Class of 2012,'' the show brought together four experts,
including Brenda Laurel, co-founder of Purple Moon, a now-defunct
kids' software developer, and Elliot Soloway of the University of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the role of teachers, computers and privatization for
the future of education, the talk came back again and again to the
subject of kids and technology. Will computers and the Web act as
substitutes for teachers, or will they aid students in learning
necessary skills for a quickly changing world?
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, one panelist concluded, ``It's not a question of (if
technology is) good or bad,'' said Milton Glick, a provost at
Arizona State University. ``It just is.''
</P>
<P>
   Children, the panelists said, are becoming gatherers of
information, sometimes beating teachers to the punch and bringing
their own research and data to the classroom. And while the
Internet may not give them the humanistic skills they need _
communication with others and work ethics, for instance _
technology may help amplify the skills they will need for the jobs
they take on, many of which haven't been invented yet. In a world
where even the most trivial bit of data is available with a mouse
click, will kids need memorization skills?
</P>
<P>
   A surprising side-effect of the Internet's growth may be on
basic learning. Sue Cole, a computer class teacher at Mendez Middle
School and instructor at River City Youth Foundation's after-school
computer lab, said kids are suddenly becoming interested in good
spelling. ``One of the first things I saw was that the Internet
requires students to focus on their spelling. If you don't spell it
right, you don't get there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cole has watched her students embrace the Net, and that has
changed their relationships with friends, parents and relatives.
``They're finding new ways to communicate with each other using the
written expression,'' she said. ``They're searching the Net and
looking for lost relatives and the origins of their names.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest problems, she finds, is the one that's been
around since the Web took off _ shielding kids from pornography and
hate sites. But almost as bad, she said, is that kids have to be
weaned from quick-developing addictions to the Internet. ``Once
they find out how exciting it is, that's all they want to do. We
have to remind students that they have a life outside the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increasing presence of computers and the Internet at
schools, traditional teaching may not harness the power of the new
technology, some say. Arthur VanderVeen, chief executive of
Austin-based ActiveInk Corp., believes children can learn best by
solving real-world problems and becoming active participants in
what they study.
</P>
<P>
   His company produces Internet educational software for
kindergarten through 12th grades. While the firm doesn't yet sell
its services to the Austin Independent School District, VanderVeer
said ActiveInk is working with 22 other school districts in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Using ActiveInk, students take on projects, working in teams and
using spreadsheets, databases and computer simulations to create
plans of action. If it sounds like the inner workings of a
high-tech firm, that's intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create an environment, replicating the
processes that come up in work environments,'' he said. ``We've
gone to the corporate environment to find out 'what are the skills
students need to succeed in the new economy?' Traditional education
is not preparing students for those skills.''
</P>
<P>
   John Wright, who with his wife, Aletha Houston, runs the
University of Texas Center for Research for the Influences of
Television on Children, has been turning his attention to
interactive entertainment. Teaching kids using models of real-world
events can help them engage in non-linear thinking, he said. And
computers are helping.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a wonderful educational thing,'' Wright said.
``It facilitates thinking in larger concepts and bigger language.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wright is not so optimistic for kids who don't have
computers or Internet access. ``Can you take kids from an
environment where the parents didn't have any interactive
electronic experience and have them, in a single generation, join
the digital world? For children of color, the lag is getting worse,
but only because others are advancing.''
</P>
<P>
   BRIDGING THE MATH GAP
</P>
<P>
   On a Saturday morning, in a cheery house near the University of
Texas, a group of mothers and their daughters are looking at a
dismantled computer, learning the difference between RAM and a hard
drive after a snack of powdered donuts and orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, they're putting together their own Web pages,
coding background colors and choosing clip art. It's part of a
program begun by Girlstart, a local non-profit group aimed at
helping another kind of digital divide _ the one that founder
Rachel Muir says is widening between girls and boys.
</P>
<P>
   Muir, a 26-year-old who began Girlstart as Smartgirls two years
ago, said research suggests girls often lose interest in technology
during middle school, veering off from possible careers in math and
computer sciences. That's why, she said, a major gender gap exists
in the mostly male high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls start off with a strong sense of entitlement, but we see
that diminish substantially between sixth and seventh grade,'' Muir
said. ``If a girl doesn't select a path in math or science in
middle school, she won't have the building blocks to pursue it in
college.''
</P>
<P>
   So, using weekend courses and summer camps, Girlstart has tried
to bridge that gap, a few students at a time. Kids by nature are
curious and want to take apart technology and learn how it works,
Muir said. ``We teach girls not to be afraid to take things apart
and break stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Like another Austin stalwart, software company Girl Games, Inc.,
the group is trying to educate girls and make technology more
accessible to them.
</P>
<P>
   The real-world implications are quickly apparent. The girls
learn desktop publishing and immediately see the results of their
work when their Web pages go live on the Internet or when they can
see a piece of video they've digitally edited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're teaching them to master their physical world,'' Muir
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Overton, a 9-year-old at the Saturday class, wanted to
publish a Web page after months of using the Web on her Dell home
computer and listening to Internet radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Shirley Overton, said she is constantly surprised by
the information absorbed by her daughters, including Sarah's older
sister, a Web designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime she needs to know anything, if I don't have an answer,
she goes to the Internet,'' Overton said. ``It's opened up the
whole world.''

WHITE HOUSE AND AGENCY SPLIT ON INTERNET PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinton administration officials Monday threw cold
water on a proposal by the Federal Trade Commission for legislation
to protect consumer privacy on the Internet. But the commission
chairman said failure to put new federal privacy-protection
standards in place would undermine consumer confidence and
significantly retard the development of commerce in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The jockeying between the administration and the chairman,
Robert Pitofsky, came as the agency gave its annual report to
Congress on online privacy and sought new authority to impose
privacy rules to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The report, approved by the commission on Friday, advises
Congress to continue to allow the industry to regulate itself but
to allow the commission to establish federal standards and to
intervene when industry organizations are unable to resolve a case.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said such an approach already works well in the
advertising and funeral businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers should not have to forfeit their privacy online in
exchange for the rich benefits of e-commerce,'' Pitofsky said. ``A
well-crafted approach, in fact, will benefit the growth of
e-commerce and provide important protections to consumers.
Legislation is now needed to ensure consumers' online privacy is
adequately protected.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission is seeking to establish standards in four areas:
notification about the use of personal data; consumers' choices
about the use of such information; the right of individuals to
review data about them; and security measures to prevent
unauthorized disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   While legislation has been introduced by Democrats in both the
House and the Senate, there is no expectation that Congress will
act any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Industry groups and Republican lawmakers have strongly opposed
the agency's proposal, saying it would amount to a costly and
unwarranted intrusion on a nascent marketplace that has been making
progress on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of
the House Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and
consumer protection, said the industry had made ``extraordinary
progress'' in carrying out privacy rules. He said his primary
concern was heading off efforts by the states to create rules
piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to proceed cautiously,'' he said. ``Internet companies
understand that they need to protect the privacy of their customers
as a matter of good business practice, and that's why they are
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican lawmakers found themselves in an odd alliance
with officials from the White House and the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials were decidedly lukewarm about the
commission's proposal. They said that the government should
continue to rely on the industry to police itself and that the
White House had a deeper interest in promoting privacy laws in
other areas, including health care and financial services.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said Monday that if the
industry could show that it was effectively policing itself,
``legislation would not be necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not see such progress,'' he said, ``then we may
eventually need to consider whether legislation would provide
companies with the right incentives to have good policies and
participate in an effective self-regulatory program.''
</P>
<P>
   While the administration's view was that the Internet needs more
time to develop, the commission's report, based on the results of a
recent study of Web sites, suggested that the industry had already
made some progress but far from enough.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 88 percent of 335 randomly selected Web
sites had some kind of privacy disclosure, varying from a
perfunctory notice that says ``this is a secure order form'' to
something more detailed.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also found that only 20 percent of Web sites that
collect personal information met the existing government
guidelines. And only 8 percent of the most heavily visited Web
sites displayed a seal of approval from one of the programs
established by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because self-regulatory initiatives to date fall far short of
broad-based implementation of self-regulatory programs, the
commission has concluded that such efforts alone cannot ensure that
the online marketplace as a whole will follow the standards adopted
by industry leaders,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the shortcomings in protecting privacy, the
report concluded that many consumers appear leery about making
purchases on the Internet. The report cited studies estimating that
online companies had already suffered significantly from a common
perception among consumers that they should not buy items online
because the information they provide may be misused.
</P>
<P>
   One study cited in the agency's report found that consumer
privacy concerns resulted in as much as $2.8 billion in lost online
retail sales last year, while another suggested a potential loss of
as much as $18 billion by 2002, compared with a projected total of
$40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet commerce will not develop to the ultimate extent
because people just will continue to not have confidence that their
private information will be protected to the maximum,'' Pitofsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two Republicans on the commission disagreed with the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Republicans, Orson Swindle, issued a strongly worded
dissent that criticized the majority for not doing a precise
analysis that weighed the costs and benefits of any new
regulations. Swindle called the privacy report ``embarrassingly
flawed'' and said its recommendations ``would constitute a
troubling devolution of power from our elected officials to
unelected bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's other Republican, Thomas B. Leary, concurred in
part and dissented in part. Leary said that some legislation was
appropriate, but that the majority had asked too much and that a
law on appropriate notice should suffice. He also said the
majority's opinion was too narrow because any legislation should
apply to offline commerce as well as online commerce.

SUMMIT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Is the Cold War still over?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone wandering through the strategic attics of the United
States and Russia might well wonder.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United
States and Russia still have more than 14,000 nuclear warheads in
their arsenals. Together, these weapons could deliver the explosive
equivalent of a ton of dynamite for every man, woman and child on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   The point of it all, analysts contend, is deterrence. If each
side understands the other's capability, the reasoning goes,
neither would see a nuclear attack on the other as a viable option.
Often criticized, the approach has helped to hold the two nuclear
powers in check for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton journeys to Moscow this week, though,
he'll take up the issue of how to reduce those weapons, in his
first summit with Russia's new president, Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who leaves Washington on Monday for a week-long swing
that will take him to Portugal, Germany, Russia and the Ukraine, is
to meet with Putin in Moscow June 4 and 5.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders have much to discuss:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  cooperation on peace efforts in the Middle East and the
Balkans;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the upcoming summit between leaders of North Korea and South
Korea;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  terms of continuing multilateral aid for Russia's beleaguered
economy;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the safeguarding of Russia's advanced weapons technology from
states such as Iran;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and continuing fallout from Russia's brutal war against
Islamic separatists in the southern republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the crowded agenda, however, will be a complex set of
nuclear questions that have divided the former Cold War foes for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important summit,'' Senate Armed Services Committee
Chairman John Warner, R-Va., said at a hearing on the subject
Tuesday. ``I look upon this summit as a building block laying a
foundation for the next president of the United States to build on,
especially in the area of arms control.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Putin and Clinton say they hope to reduce their respective
nuclear arsenals over time. They differ, though, over how deeply to
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of a pair of existing Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaties (START I and START II), both countries have agreed to cut
the number of strategic warheads they have deployed _ perched atop
intercontinental ballistic missiles, for example, loaded into
submarines or tucked in the bomb bay of giant long-range bombers _
to between 3,000 and 3,500 by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin's predecessor, former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, agreed three years ago in Helsinki to seek further
reductions by that time, in cuts that would trim each country's
active warhead inventory to between 2,000 and 2,500 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The further cuts, though, are the subject of a third round of
START talks on which Yeltsin and Clinton made little progress.
Those talks have only gotten underway in earnest, in fact, over the
past several weeks, as Putin has put his new government into place.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining a nuclear arsenal isn't cheap. It costs U.S.
taxpayers anywhere between $20 billion and $33 billion a year,
depending on how costs are allocated.
</P>
<P>
   Russia still employs some 127,000 physicists, nuclear
technicians and weapons experts to maintain its strategic arsenal,
though thousands of them regularly go without pay. The government
is, by some estimates, US$400 million in arrears to these skilled
workers, and the country's poor economy makes a near-term solution
improbable.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the Russians have proposed cutting their
deployed warheads to 1,500. Clinton's opening position is that such
cuts would be too deep. He'd prefer to stick with the Helsinki
formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the risk of large-scale nuclear war is now very low, our
nuclear forces continue to serve as an important hedge against an
uncertain future,'' Defense Department undersecretary for policy,
Walter Slocombe, told Warner's committee. ``They are also a
guarantee of our security commitment to our allies, and a
disincentive to those who would contemplate developing, acquiring
or using their own nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia are even further apart on a
controversial U.S. proposal to set up a defensive shield against
incoming missiles. Clinton is weighing a system that would rely on
roughly 100 interceptor missiles, based in Alaska, on the theory
that such a system could have a strong likelihood of knocking down
a missile coming in across the Pacific Ocean or over the North
Pole.
</P>
<P>
   If a planned July test goes well, Pentagon officials will
present Clinton with cost estimates _ currently they range anywhere
from $20 billion to $60 billion _ and strategic analysis for the
system. It could be September before Clinton gets the Pentagon's
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon claims such a national missile defense system would
be built not to defend against a Russian missile launch, but rather
as protection from attacks by so-called rogue states, such as North
Korea, Iran or Iraq. All three are believed to be well along in
their effort to acquire nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a system that is designed to deal with the Russian
strategic deterrence,'' Deputy Defense Secretary Rudy De Leon told
Pentagon reporters earlier this month. ``It is designed to be a
limited defense, largely against the potential proliferation of
missile technologies in the next decade and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, though, is troubled by the proposal. The Russian
government fears that such a system would negate at least some of
the deterrent effect of its own nuclear arsenal, forcing Russia to
compensate somehow _ likely by deploying more weapons than it would
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds them of Star Wars,'' a White House official said,
referring to the space-based laser defensive shield President
Reagan proposed, and a Democratic Congress killed, during the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing aggressive defense systems from further fueling the
Cold War arms race was the aim of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Nixon in 1972.
The treaty has been amended since then, but essentially it
restricts the ability of either side to deploy more than a limited
number of defensive missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians contend, and the White House agrees, that the ABM
prohibits the United States from building a national missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin agreed last summer, though, at the Group of
Eight meeting in Cologne, Germany, to take up possible amendments
meant to ``strengthen the treaty, to enhance its viability and
effectiveness in the future,'' according to a joint statement the
two leaders signed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes Putin will agree to amend the ABM treaty such that
it would allow a limited national missile defense system, but
Putin's government has yet to warm to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Cologne agreement also called for moving forward with START
III talks, in effect packaging U.S. hopes for ABM treaty
modifications with Russia's plea for further cuts in deployed
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   It's by no means clear that Clinton will be able to complete
those complicated negotiations before he leaves office in January.
White House officials have been especially careful not to predict
any breakthroughs for this summit.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and Clinton are scheduled to meet at least three more
times this year, and U.S. officials have stressed the importance of
establishing a working relationship _ perhaps even some trust _
before pressing too hard on difficult nuclear arms issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first face-to-face meeting with Putin, this is a
tough issue, and we've been slogging it out for months now,'' one
White House official said on background.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this official said, ``There's some hope that all of this
will fall together,'' before Clinton leaves office. The summit ``is
not the end of the process,'' this official said, ``but the
beginning.''

<P>
   HERZILYA, Israel _ For Hanan Achsaf, president of Motorola
Israel Ltd., the country's occasional ``minor disagreements with
its neighbors'' are not enough to blunt the business attraction of
its brain power.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has worked for Motorola. The company came here first in
th100 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's semiconductor design center, with 600 workers in
this suburb of Tel Aviv, is its largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, Israel has become famous for its boom
in software start-up companies. But, Motorola is one of about a
dozen major U.S. firms that have invested here to make or develop
microprocessors, or chips _ the hardware brains to computers,
cellular phones and even anti-lock brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite a worrisome shortage of engineers to feed such
growth, the list of firms with development centers here reads like
a hi-tech Who's Who: Intel, which has two manufacturing plants
here; along with Texas Instruments; National Semiconductor; IBM;
3COM and Microsoft. Applied Materials, developing and producing
equipment for semiconductor makers, came here in 1991 and now
employs 650 in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good match. Israel, a country of about 6 million people,
has little natural resources _ no oil like its Arab neighbors. It
has few markets available on its borders, either because its
neighbors are hostile or have small economies.
</P>
<P>
   What it can do is produce knowledge and that's what draws the
big chip firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of things that come from being a country
where existential problems are permanent,'' said Orna Berry, who,
until she stepped down this month, oversaw government support for
hi-tech development as Israel's chief scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Berry sees Israel's battles for survival and need to look for
support beyond its own region as helping foster the boom. Israeli
hi-tech workers are considered innovative, competitive and
hardworking. Though Israel's first language is Hebrew, English, the
first language of technology, is commonly spoken.
</P>
<P>
   And, most Israelis have to spend at least a couple of years in
their lives in what has become a hi-tech incubator _ the army.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the army, you have been exposed to the most sophisticated
technology,'' said Achsaf, once an instructor in the air force's
technical school. The army even has a so-called ``genius unit,'' a
special intelligence branch specializing in hi-tech.
</P>
<P>
   The government also kicks in its share, giving about $400
million in grants to industry _ mostly hi-tech _ each year. It gave
Intel $600 million to build a semiconductor plant that opened last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The results have changed the economy. Of Israel's total $35
billion in exports last year, about one-third, or $12 billion were
in hi-tech.
</P>
<P>
   Figures were not available for electronics specifically, but
consider that Intel alone expects to export more than $1 billion
from its chip plant this year. Motorola last year exported about
$257 million from its mostly-communications facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that the American firms have not only helped the
electronics industry here grow, but have professionalized Israeli
marketing and managerial skills. The American influence, they say,
has also smoothed some of the rough edges on Israeli workers, known
to be gruff and undisciplined.
</P>
<P>
   There is some hype in Israel's selling of itself. Government
ministries frequently promote a graph showing that Israel has the
highest number of engineers and scientists per capita in the world.
Those figures come from 1984 and, according to one researcher, were
statistically flawed.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israel is indeed well-educated; third in the world in
percentage of residents with a university degree. That is the
lifeblood in the industry, where firms lose precious time to their
competitors if they have trouble finding labor.
</P>
<P>
   The big question hanging over hi-tech firms here is what will
happen now that Israel is starting to see a shortage of engineers.
It's not yet as acute as it is in the United States, but the labor
market is tightening.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli engineers still earn about 80 percent of what their
counterparts do in the United States, but salaries are climbing and
many workers are simply moving to America. Economists say the
hi-tech sector is at full employment at about 50,000. Berry said
there is actually a shortage of about 5,000 electronics workers.
</P>
<P>
   The crunch would be worse, had it not been for the highly
educated influx of 1 million immigrants from the former Soviet
Union. Motorola officials say about 20 percent of the workers at
their semiconductor center are from there.
</P>
<P>
   The market was still so tight that, two years ago, a corporate
association asked the government to grant visas to about 1,500
engineers from Asia, mostly India. It was an idea that would not
fly in the Jewish state, as some feared it would cause an influx of
largely non-Jewish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shortage, major newcomers still arrive. Last year,
Dallas-based Texas Instruments spent about $415 million to buy two
Israeli companies that develop DSP technology _ specialized chips
for things like cable television systems.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Bernier, TI European manager for communications, said the
company still sees Israel as a ``vibrant center of high-level
expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of Israel's electronics firms may depend on whether
the country can maintain its effort to increase the number of
engineering graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while Israel's got a hi-tech boost in the past from its
army technology, it may rely more in the future on it's peacemaking
abilities. Israel Kashat, vice president at Motorola's design
center, said peace talks could enable Israel to use the engineering
pools in the countries on its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, for example, show avid computer affinity and some
already work for Israeli firms. Egypt, with 55 million people, has
a large supply of engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real untapped potential,'' Kashat said, ``is our
neighbors.''

   HI-TECH FIRMS ATTRACTED TO ISRAELI BRAIN POWER

its highly educated workforce. Here's how it compares to some other
industrialized nations:

<P>
   KIRYAT GAT, Israel _ This meadowland in central Israel was once
the domain of the Philistines and their warrior, Goliath. Now it is
the land of Intel, a much more welcome giant.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's boxy semiconductor plant on the edge of this depressed
town dominates the rural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Arab shepherds still bring their livestock to graze.
Inside, workers in the dust-free ``clean room'' produce advanced
microprocessors _ chips _ for computers all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The company's might seems to stretch the boundaries of this
small country.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.6 billion plant was the largest ever private investment
here. The government chipped in $600 million, the biggest such
corporate subsidy in the its boldest move here yet with the
proposed construction of another semiconductor plant. At a cost of
maybe $3 billion, it would be, of course, the biggest investment
the country has seen.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israel now has its own firm footing as a high technology
center. It is not as needy and almost certainly will not agree to
hand out as much money for another plant as it did in the
mid-1990s, when the deal was made for the last one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole conditions in 1994-95 were different. The whole
circumstances have changed,'' said Israeli Minister for Industry
and Trade Ran Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel is an example of the advantages that have been offered,
and will not be offered to the same extent any longer,'' said
Yaacov Yisraeli, president of the Israel-American Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Cohen met in New York with Intel executives to
discuss the plan. He and Finance Minister Avraham Shochat formed a
commission to decide what Israel can offer. The commission will
take several weeks to make recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Intel's track record here, which goes back nearly 30
years, will be in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The link between the world's biggest make of computer chips and
the tiny Jewish state started with Dov Frohman, an
American-educated Israeli. He joined Intel in 1969 and developed
the EPROM semiconductors, the first devices that allowed computers
to store information even after power was turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Frohman, now a 61-year-old Intel vice president, is known for
his long gray beard and a style that is casual even by Israel's
informal standards.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, Frohman wanted to move to Israel from the
United States in 1974. The company appeased him by sending him to
establish its first overseas design center. He put it in Haifa with
just a $300,000 investment.
</P>
<P>
   Intel would add its first overseas manufacturing plant in 1985
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the government of late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin made the deal for the Kiryat Gat plant.
</P>
<P>
   Israel was just starting to realize the great potential the
hi-tech industry could offer a country low on natural resources,
and friendly neighbors. Rabin wanted to steer prosperity toward
depressed towns like Kiryat Gat, about an hour's drive south of Tel
Aviv. With just 20,000 residents, the town has little industry and
unemployment that hovers around 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The plant opened in June 1999 and projects exports exceeding $1
billion a year. Intel employs about 1,700 workers and uses another
1,700 as contract workers from local firms.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of five Intel producers of processors in the advanced
.18 micron technology _ a figure measuring the tiniest distances
possible between components on processors.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, there are few severe Intel detractors. The $600
million government incentive has nearly all been doled out.
</P>
<P>
   Amos Samuel, monitoring Intel's activities for the government,
gives a mixed, but generally positive, review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too bad,'' he says. ``We were hoping it would do better,
but all in all the progress is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel, while refusing to discuss specific terms, said Intel has
not done enough to work with local universities or share knowledge
with local companies.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the company high marks, though, for its involvement in
community projects, such as work with schools, and for establishing
teams to work on its other commitments.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a company big enough to make the locals play by its
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli workers, known for being as unruly as they are
innovative, are getting used to Intel's tight safety and security
regimes. Government inspectors grudgingly let Intel employ Jewish
workers on the Sabbath, a violation of Israel's laws _ albeit
inconsistently enforced _ to preserve country's Jewish nature.
</P>
<P>
   A of that was for construction of the plant. Intel also claims
it helped Israeli firms market $132 million in products, and paid
$69 million for goods Intel bought from local suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The figures do not include salaries for its workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company also graduated and hired 90 Israelis from its own
nine-month course aimed at bringing local residents up to the
skills level needed in the plant. The course will soon start again.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's arrival raised higher hopes among local
residents. Anter Kertes acknowledges, ``They have a lot of
expectations and many of them we can't meet.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Kiryat Gat, a town largely of small tenements
filled with working-class Israeli natives and Russian and
Uzbekistani immigrants, employment at Intel is a dream few count
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good the government gave the money. But a lot of people
here thought that it would mean work for people who live in Kiryat
Gat,'' said Maya Azirov, a 40-year-old native of Uzbekistan who
runs a delicatessen with her husband. ``You need a lot of training
to work there.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Kiryat Gat lacks English speakers. Though the
sign outside the plant spells Intel in English and Hebrew, inside
it is largely an English world.
</P>
<P>
   Koko Fahima, a member of the Kiryat Gat City Council, estimates
that less than 15 percent of workers at the plant are from Kiryat
Gat. Company figures do not dispute that, but note that 60 percent
of the workers are from the larger region around the small town.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a $600 million investment the government could have gotten
a lot more,'' Fahima said, calling Intel a ``superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he's quick to note that Intel has lead to the creation of
50 new companies in the town.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   It's had other effects. Benny Uzinskau, a 25-year-old laborer
who worked for an insulation contractor at Intel, said he was
surprised that the company fined workers for not wearing their
helmets on the job or for smoking where they shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was difficult. But you get used to it.'' Uzinskau
said.
</P>
<P>
   Near the plant, the town's fire station commander Tzion Saban
said he's learned a lot from Intel's fire control experts. A
hotline connects the plant directly to the station.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   But, whether another Intel plant will soon be nearby depends on
how much Intel and Israel still feel they need each other.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Israeli parliament lowered the amount the
government can pitch into a project to 24 percent. That's down from
the nearly 38 percent it gave Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also has other chip makers competing for government
grants. They include Tower Semiconductors, partly owned by National
Semiconductor, which is offering to build a new plant in a
consortium with Toshiba Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Intel officials say they are evaluating sites near
other plants in Ireland as well as in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon
and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Industry and Trade Minister Cohen said he considers Intel a good
corporate citizen, but notes that he talks to companies all the
time that want to come here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is one of the advanced economies all over the world,''
he said. ``We do not need one project to change Israel.''

   WASHINGTON _ Is the Cold War still over?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone wandering through the strategic attics of the United
States and Russia might well wonder.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United
States and Russia still have more than 14,000 nuclear warheads in
their arsenals. Together, these weapons could deliver the explosive
equivalent of a ton of dynamite for every man, woman and child on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   The point of it all, analysts contend, is deterrence. If each
side understands the other's capability, the reasoning goes,
neither would see a nuclear attack on the other as a viable option.
Often criticized, the approach has helped to hold the two nuclear
powers in check for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton journeys to Moscow this week, though,
he'll take up the issue of how to reduce those weapons, in his
first summit with Russia's new president, Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who leaves Washington on Monday for a week-long swing
that will take him to Portugal, Germany, Russia and the Ukraine, is
to meet with Putin in Moscow June 4 and 5.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders have much to discuss:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  cooperation on peace efforts in the Middle East and the
Balkans;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the upcoming summit between leaders of North Korea and South
Korea;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  terms of continuing multilateral aid for Russia's beleaguered
economy;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the safeguarding of Russia's advanced weapons technology from
states such as Iran;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and continuing fallout from Russia's brutal war against
Islamic separatists in the southern republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the crowded agenda, however, will be a complex set of
nuclear questions that have divided the former Cold War foes for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important summit,'' Senate Armed Services Committee
Chairman John Warner, R-Va., said at a hearing on the subject
Tuesday. ``I look upon this summit as a building block laying a
foundation for the next president of the United States to build on,
especially in the area of arms control.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Putin and Clinton say they hope to reduce their respective
nuclear arsenals over time. They differ, though, over how deeply to
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of a pair of existing Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaties (START I and START II), both countries have agreed to cut
the number of strategic warheads they have deployed _ perched atop
intercontinental ballistic missiles, for example, loaded into
submarines or tucked in the bomb bay of giant long-range bombers _
to between 3,000 and 3,500 by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin's predecessor, former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, agreed three years ago in Helsinki to seek further
reductions by that time, in cuts that would trim each country's
active warhead inventory to between 2,000 and 2,500 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The further cuts, though, are the subject of a third round of
START talks on which Yeltsin and Clinton made little progress.
Those talks have only gotten underway in earnest, in fact, over the
past several weeks, as Putin has put his new government into place.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining a nuclear arsenal isn't cheap. It costs U.S.
taxpayers anywhere between $20 billion and $33 billion a year,
depending on how costs are allocated.
</P>
<P>
   Russia still employs some 127,000 physicists, nuclear
technicians and weapons experts to maintain its strategic arsenal,
though thousands of them regularly go without pay. The government
is, by some estimates, US$400 million in arrears to these skilled
workers, and the country's poor economy makes a near-term solution
improbable.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the Russians have proposed cutting their
deployed warheads to 1,500. Clinton's opening position is that
re,'' Defense Department undersecretary for policy, Walter
Slocombe, told Warner's committee. ``They are also a guarantee of
our security commitment to our allies, and a disincentive to those
who would contemplate developing, acquiring or using their own
nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia are even further apart on a
controversial U.S. proposal to set up a defensive shield against
incoming missiles. Clinton is weighing a system that would rely on
roughly 100 interceptor missiles, based in Alaska, on the theory
that such a system could have a strong likelihood of knocking down
a missile coming in across the Pacific Ocean or over the North
Pole.
</P>
<P>
   If a planned July test goes well, Pentagon officials will
present Clinton with cost estimates _ currently they range anywhere
from $20 billion to $60 billion _ and strategic analysis for the
system. It could be September before Clinton gets the Pentagon's
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon claims such a national missile defense system would
be built not to defend against a Russian missile launch, but rather
as protection from attacks by so-called rogue states, such as North
Korea, Iran or Iraq. All three are believed to be well along in
their effort to acquire nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a system that is designed to deal with the Russian
strategic deterrence,'' Deputy Defense Secretary Rudy De Leon told
Pentagon reporters earlier this month. ``It is designed to be a
limited defense, largely against the potential proliferation of
missile technologies in the next decade and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, though, is troubled by the proposal. The Russian
government fears that such a system would negate at least some of
the deterrent effect of its own nuclear arsenal, forcing Russia to
compensate somehow _ likely by deploying more weapons than it would
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds them of Star Wars,'' a White House official said,
referring to the space-based laser defensive shield President
Reagan proposed, and a Democratic Congress killed, during the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing aggressive defense systems from further fueling the
Cold War arms race was the aim of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Nixon in 1972.
The treaty has been amended since then, but essentially it
restricts the ability of either side to deploy more than a limited
number of defensive missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians contend, and the White House agrees, that the ABM
prohibits the United States from building a national missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin agreed last summer, though, at the Group of
Eight meeting in Cologne, Germany, to take up possible amendments
meant to ``strengthen the treaty, to enhance its viability and
effectiveness in the future,'' according to a joint statement the
two leaders signed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes Putin will agree to amend the ABM treaty such that
it would allow a limited national missile defense system, but
Putin's government has yet to warm to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Cologne agreement also called for moving forward with START
III talks, in effect packaging U.S. hopes for ABM treaty
modifications with Russia's plea for further cuts in deployed
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   It's by no means clear that Clinton will be able to complete
those complicated negotiations before he leaves office in January.
White House officials have been especially careful not to predict
any breakthroughs for this summit.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and Clinton are scheduled to meet at least three more
times this year, and U.S. offrd on difficult nuclear arms issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first face-to-face meeting with Putin, this is a
tough issue, and we've been slogging it out for months now,'' one
White House official said on background.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this official said, ``There's some hope that all of this
will fall together,'' before Clinton leaves office. The summit ``is
not the end of the process,'' this official said, ``but the
beginning.''

<P>
   HERZILYA, Israel _ For Hanan Achsaf, president of Motorola
Israel Ltd., the country's occasional ``minor disagreements with
its neighbors'' are not enough to blunt the business attraction of
its brain power.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has worked for Motorola. The company came here first in
the 1960s with an investment of less than $20 million and now
controls assets worth more than $20 billion and 4,100 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's semiconductor design center, with 600 workers in
this suburb of Tel Aviv, is its largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, Israel has become famous for its boom
in software start-up companies. But, Motorola is one of about a
dozen major U.S. firms that have invested here to make or develop
microprocessors, or chips _ the hardware brains to computers,
cellular phones and even anti-lock brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite a worrisome shortage of engineers to feed such
growth, the list of firms with development centers here reads like
a hi-tech Who's Who: Intel, which has two manufacturing plants
here; along with Texas Instruments; National Semiconductor; IBM;
3COM and Microsoft. Applied Materials, developing and producing
equipment for semiconductor makers, came here in 1991 and now
employs 650 in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good match. Israel, a country of about 6 million people,
has little natural resources _ no oil like its Arab neighbors. It
has few markets available on its borders, either because its
neighbors are hostile or have small economies.
</P>
<P>
   What it can do is produce knowledge and that's what draws the
big chip firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of things that come from being a country
where existential problems are permanent,'' said Orna Berry, who,
until she stepped down this month, oversaw government support for
hi-tech development as Israel's chief scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Berry sees Israel's battles for survival and need to look for
support beyond its own region as helping foster the boom. Israeli
hi-tech workers are considered innovative, competitive and
hardworking. Though Israel's first language is Hebrew, English, the
first language of technology, is commonly spoken.
</P>
<P>
   And, most Israelis have to spend at least a couple of years in
their lives in what has become a hi-tech incubator _ the army.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the army, you have been exposed to the most sophisticated
technology,'' said Achsaf, once an instructor in the air force's
technical school. The army even has a so-called ``genius unit,'' a
special intelligence branch specializing in hi-tech.
</P>
<P>
   The government also kicks in its share, giving about $400
million in grants to industry _ mostly hi-tech _ each year. It gave
Intel $600 million to build a semiconductor plant that opened last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The results have changed the economy. Of Israel's total $35
billion in exports last year, about one-third, or $12 billion were
in hi-tech.
</P>
<P>
   Figures were not available for electronics specifically, but
consider that Intel alone expects to export more than $1 billion
from its chip plant this year. Motorola last year exported about
$257 million from its mostly-communications facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that the American firms have not only helped the
electronics industry here grow, but have professionalized Israeli
marketing and managerial skills. The American influence, they say,
has also smoothed some of the rough edges on Israeli workers, known
to be gruff and undisciplined.
</P>
<P>
   There is some hype in Israel's selling of itself. Government
ministries frequently promote a graph showing that Israel has the
highest number of engineers and scientists per capita in the world.
Those figures come from 1984 and, according to one researcher, were
statistically flawed.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israel is indeed well-educated; third in the world in
percentage of residents with a university degree. That is the
lifeblood in the industry, where firms lose precious time to their
competitors if they have trouble finding labor.
</P>
<P>
   The big question hanging over hi-tech firms here is what will
happen now that Israel is starting to see a shortage of engineers.
It's not yet as acute as it is in the United States, but the labor
market is tightening.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli engineers still earn about 80 percent of what their
counterparts do in the United States, but salaries are climbing and
many workers are simply moving to America. Economists say the
hi-tech sector is at full employment at about 50,000. Berry said
there is actually a shortage of about 5,000 electronics workers.
</P>
<P>
   The crunch would be worse, had it not been for the highly
educated influx of 1 million immigrants from the former Soviet
Union. Motorola officials say about 20 percent of the workers at
their semiconductor center are from there.
</P>
<P>
   The market was still so tight that, two years ago, a corporate
association asked the government to grant visas to about 1,500
engineers from Asia, mostly India. It was an idea that would not
fly in the Jewish state, as some feared it would cause an influx of
largely non-Jewish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shortage, major newcomers still arrive. Last year,
Dallas-based Texas Instruments spent about $415 million to buy two
Israeli companies that develop DSP technology _ specialized chips
for things like cable television systems.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Bernier, TI European manager for communications, said the
company still sees Israel as a ``vibrant center of high-level
expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of Israel's electronics firms may depend on whether
the country can maintain its effort to increase the number of
engineering graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while Israel's got a hi-tech boost in the past from its
army technology, it may rely more in the future on it's peacemaking
abilities. Israel Kashat, vice president at Motorola's design
center, said peace talks could enable Israel to use the engineering
pools in the countries on its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, for example, show avid computer affinity and some
already work for Israeli firms. Egypt, with 55 million people, has
a large supply of engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real untapped potential,'' Kashat said, ``is our
neighbors.''

   KIRYAT GAT, Israel _ This meadowland in central Israel was once
the domain of the Philistines and their warrior, Goliath. Now it is
the land of Intel, a much more welcome giant.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's boxy semiconductor plant on the edge of this depressed
town dominates the rural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Arab shepherds still bring their livestock to graze.
Inside, workers in the dust-free ``clean room'' produce advanced
microprocessors _ chips _ for computers all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The company's might seems to stretch the boundaries of this
small country.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.6 billion plant was the largest ever private investment
here. The government chipped in $600 millsrael's DSP Communications
for $1.6 billion, the largest such acquisition in Israeli history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Intel is pitching its boldest move here yet with the
proposed construction of another semiconductor plant. At a cost of
maybe $3 billion, it would be, of course, the biggest investment
the country has seen.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israel now has its own firm footing as a high technology
center. It is not as needy and almost certainly will not agree to
hand out as much money for another plant as it did in the
mid-1990s, when the deal was made for the last one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole conditions in 1994-95 were different. The whole
circumstances have changed,'' said Israeli Minister for Industry
and Trade Ran Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel is an example of the advantages that have been offered,
and will not be offered to the same extent any longer,'' said
Yaacov Yisraeli, president of the Israel-American Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Cohen met in New York with Intel executives to
discuss the plan. He and Finance Minister Avraspotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The link between the world's biggest make of computer chips and
the tiny Jewish state started with Dov Frohman, an
American-educated Israeli. He joined Intel in 1969 and developed
the EPROM semiconductors, the first devices that allowed computers
to store information even after power was turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Frohman, now a 61-year-old Intel vice president, is known for
his long gray beard and a style that is casual even by Israel's
informal standards.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, Frohman wanted to move to Israel from the
United States in 1974. The company appeased him by sending him to
establish its first overseas design center. He put it in Haifa with
just a $300,000 investment.
</P>
<P>
   Intel would add its first overseas manufacturing plant in 1985
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the government of late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin made the deal for the Kiryat Gat plant.
</P>
<P>
   Israel was just starting to realize the great potential the
hi-tech industry could offer a country low on natural resources,
and friendly neighbors. Rabin wanted to steer prosperity toward
depressed towns like Kiryat Gat, about an hour's drive south of Tel
Aviv. With just 20,000 residents, the town has little industry and
unemployment that hovers around 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The plant opened in June 1999 and projects exports exceeding $1
billion a year. Intel employs about 1,700 workers and uses another
1,700 as contract workers from local firms.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of five Intel producers of processors in the advanced
.18 micron technology _ a figure measuring the tiniest distances
possible between components on processors.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, there are few severe Intel detractors. The $600
million government incentive has nearly all been doled out.
</P>
<P>
   Amos Samuel, monitoring Intel's activities for the government,
gives a mixed, but generally positive, review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too bad,'' he says. ``We were hoping it would do better,
but all in all the progress is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel, while refusing to discuss specific terms, said Intel has
not done enough to work with local universities or share knowledge
with local companies.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the company high marks, though, for its involvement in
community projects, such as work with schools, and for establishing
teams to work on its other commitments.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a company big enough to make the locals play by its
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli workers, known for being as unruly as they are
innovative, are getting used to Intel's tight safety and security
regimes. Government inspectors grudgingly let Intel employ Jewish
workers on the Sabbath, a violation of Israel's lawsat Gat plant
has already added more than $790 million to the Israeli economy.
Nearly 60 percent of that was for construction of the plant. Intel
also claims it helped Israeli firms market $132 million in
products, and paid $69 million for goods Intel bought from local
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The figures do not include salaries for its workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company also graduated and hired 90 Israelis from its own
nine-month course aimed at bringing local residents up to the
skills level needed in the plant. The course will soon start again.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's arrival raised higher hopes among local
residents. Anter Kertes acknowledges, ``They have a lot of
expectations and many of them we can't meet.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Kiryat Gat, a town largely of small tenements
filled with working-class Israeli natives and Russian and
Uzbekistani immigrants, employment at Intel is a dream few count
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good the government gave the money. But a lot of people
here thought that it would mean work for people who live in Kiryat
Gat,'' said Maya Azirov, a 40-year-old native of Uzbekistan who
runs a delicatessen with her husband. ``You need a lot of training
to work there.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Kiryat Gat lacks English speakers. Though the
sign outside the plant spells Intel in English and Hebrew, inside
it is largely an English world.
</P>
<P>
   Koko Fahima, a member of the Kiryat Gat City Council, estimates
that less than 15 percent of workers at the plant are from Kiryat
Gat. Company figures do not dispute that, but note that 60 percent
of the workers are from the larger region around the small town.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a $600 million investment the government could have gotten
a lot more,'' Fahima said, calling Intel a ``superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he's quick to note that Intel has lead to the creation of
50 new companies in the town.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   It's had other effects. Benny Uzinskau, a 25-year-old laborer
who worked for an insulation contractor at Intel, said he was
surprised that the company fined workers for not wearing their
helmets on the job or for smoking where they shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was difficult. But you get used to it.'' Uzinskau
said.
</P>
<P>
   Near the plant, the town's fire station commander Tzion Saban
said he's learned a lot from Intel's fire control experts. A
hotline connects the plant directly to the station.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   But, whether another Intel plant will soon be nearby depends on
how much Intel and Israel still feel they need each other.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Israeli parliament lowered the amount the
government can pitch into a project to 24 percent. That's down from
the nearly 38 percent it gave Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also has other chip makers competing for government
grants. They include Tower Semiconductors, partly owned by National
Semiconductor, which is offering to build a new plant in a
consortium with Toshiba Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Intel officials say they are evaluating sites near
other plants in Ireland as well as in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon
and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Industry and Trade Minister Cohen said he considers Intel a good
corporate citizen, but notes that he talks to companies all the
time that want to come here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is one of the advanced economies all over the world,''
he said. ``We do not need one project to change Israel.''

   PHOENIX - He is a poor fisherman who dreamed of greatness, like
the old man in the famous novel by Ernest Hemingway. Only his name
is not Santiago, it's Donato. And he is not old, but middle-age.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago was an unschooled Cuban who was nonetheless skillful
and wise. Donato is a high-school dropout from Poughkeepsie who is
not Cuban but has learned to play one on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago and Donato fished the same waters off the coast of
Florida and dreamed of hooking a fish so grand their names would be
renowned.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago spent his life at sea. Donato, according to news
reports, was at sea once, when he went fishing with his cousin, Sam
Ciancio, last Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   There is a boy in Santiago's life, and there is a boy in
Donato's life.
</P>
<P>
   The boy in ``The Old Man and the Sea'' is named Manolin. The boy
in Donato's story is named Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago sometimes fished with young Manolin. Donato and his
cousin fished young Elian out of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   To Santiago, Manolin was a friend and apprentice. To Donato,
Elian was a gold mine and, most recently, bait.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest moment in Santiago's life occurred when he hooked a
marlin. The greatest moment Donato's life occurred Monday, when he
used Elian to hook an even bigger fish _ the United States
government.
</P>
<P>
   Donato Dalrymple filed suit against Attorney General Janet Reno,
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder and Immigration and
Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner. He is seeking
$100 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complaint alleges unnecessary and excessive physical
force,'' said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, the
conservative group that constantly fishes for ways to get its hooks
into politicians like Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Donato Dalrymple was in the Little Havana house where relatives
had been keeping Elian when federal agents broke in. They removed
the boy from the home and reunited him with his father. A picture
of Donato holding Elian while an armed officer confronts them
appeared in all the papers.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Old Man and the Sea,'' Santiago struggles with the huge
marlin for days, only to lose it, bite by bite, to hungry sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Donato, hoping not to lose his enormous catch, hired the sharks
to work for him.
</P>
<P>
   He claims his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search
and seizure was violated, as well as his Fifth Amendment right to
due process.
</P>
<P>
   Since the TV cameras have begun pointing in other directions,
Donato Dalrymple has had to go back to cleaning houses, which is
what he did for money before claiming he was selected by God to be
Elian's ``savior.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangers in Miami shouted ``pescador,'' Spanish for fisherman,
when they saw him on the street. Now they are able to shout
``sanguijuela.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloodsucker.
</P>
<P>
   In life as well as fiction, the principal character in a story
often speaks of a conquering hero after whom he would like to model
his life.
</P>
<P>
   In Ernest Hemingway's book, Santiago the fisherman admires the
skill and instincts of the baseball player Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   In modern America, Donato Dalrymple greatly admires the skill
and instincts of O.J. Simpson's former house guest, Kato Kaelin. &QL;

<P>
   Advanced degrees in physics come in different varieties. At the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, students earn them by
writing a dissertation. At the Karate Institute in New York City,
they earn them by breaking 1-inch-thick pine boards. Lots of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Paris, a fourth-degree black belt in tae kwon do, is happy
to demonstrate his grasp of the scientific principles. First, he
adjusts his belt. Then he lets out a short, sharp yell, snaps his
left leg forward and smashes his foot through three boards,
showering the mat with splinters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five boards is about the most I can break,'' Paris says. ``But
I'm not really limited by strength; I'm more or less limited by the
size of the hands holding the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Few things offer more visceral proof of the power of physics
than a karate chop. Punch a brick with your bare hand, untutored in
the martial arts, and you may break a finger. Punch it with the
proper force, momentum and positioning, and you break the brick
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazingly, there are no tricks involved at all,'' says Michael
Feld, a physicist at MIT. ``What you have here is one of the most
efficient human movements ever conceived. We've found nothing in
our studies to improve upon the art.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, when Feld was earning a brown belt in karate,
his instructor, Ronald McNair, also happened to be his physics
student. (McNair later died tragically while working as a
scientist-astronaut aboard Space Shuttle Challenger)
</P>
<P>
   The secret to karate, both men agreed, lies in the speed and
exceptional focus of the strike. But just how fast does a karate
punch move?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, they joined with undergraduate Stephen Wilk and set
up a strobe light that flashed either 60 or 120 times per second.
Then they photographed McNair and others throwing various kicks and
punches.
</P>
<P>
   Once the film was developed, they could calculate the speed of a
punch by counting how many times the strobe flashed until the fist
hit its target.
</P>
<P>
   Feld and McNair found that beginning students can throw a karate
chop at about 20 feet per second _ just enough to break a 1-inch
board. But a black belt like McNair could chop at 46 feet per
second. At that speed, a 1.5-pound hand can deliver a wallop of up
to 2,800 newtons (one newton is roughly equal to the force exerted
by the weight of an apple). Splitting a typical concrete slab 1.5
inches thick takes on average only 1,900 newtons.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the best boxers can punch as quickly and powerfully
as any black belt. Why can't they break concrete blocks too?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in the nature of their punches. When a boxer
throws his fist, he usually ends the movement with follow-through.
This gives the punch maximum momentum (golf and tennis players
follow through for the same reason), and it can help knock an
opponent down. But the impact itself is diffuse: It's meant to jar
an opponent's brain, not crack his skull.
</P>
<P>
   A karate chop, on the other hand, has no follow-through at all:
It lashes out like a cobra and then withdraws instantly. When a
black belt hits a slab of concrete, for instance, his fist touches
the block for fewer than 5 milliseconds, and yet the block breaks
with a resounding crack.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how this works, Jearl Walker, a former tae kwon do
student who now teaches physics at Cleveland State University, set
up a study much like Feld and McNair's. A well-thrown fist, he
found, reaches its maximum velocity when the arm is about 80
percent extended.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what my tae kwon do master had taught me,''
Walker says. ``You learn to focus your punch in your imagination so
that it terminates inside your opponent's body, rather than on the
surface. To deliver the maximum power, you want to make contact
before the slowdown begins.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of all that focused power is brutally obvious: to
break bones and rupture tissue.
</P>
<P>
   But success also depends on more subtle forces. Solid as they
seem, all materials are at least slightly elastic. Whack them in
the right spot and they will start to oscillate. A punch with a
follow-through would dampen such oscillations, but a karate chop,
by pulling away at the last moment, lets them move freely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tweak a rubber band it goes up and down, and the same
is true if you tweak a board or a brick with a much greater
force,'' Feld says. ``When they reach their elastic limits, they
start to yield. In other words, they break.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for most of us, reaching that limit in bones is no
easy matter. Feld says bone can withstand 40 times more force than
concrete, and a cylinder of bone less than an inch in diameter and
29 inches long can withstand a force of more than 25,000 newtons.
</P>
<P>
   Hands and feet can withstand even more than that, because their
skin, muscles, ligaments, tendons and cartilage absorb a great deal
of impact. As a result, a well-kicked foot can absorb about 2,000
times as much force as concrete before breaking.
</P>
<P>
   Feld himself has never broken a finger in karate, even though he
once broke eight 1-inch-thick boards at a time. Still, good bones
and a Ph.D. in physics alone couldn't earn him a black belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger Woods didn't just wake up one morning and start hitting
a ball 320 yards, and we don't just walk in and shatter a
cinderblock,'' says Shiak Henry Cho, grand master at the Karate
Institute. ``Everybody has to work at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Students not only have to increase their speed and improve their
aim, they have to toughen up their hands and feet by striking them
against a post wrapped in foam and canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, your skin is so soft you may end up cutting
it. And then comes the blood,'' Cho says. ``This is not
recommended.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the shuto, or knife-edge of the hand, develops a
callus that acts exactly like a car bumper, absorbing and diffusing
the force of the collision. ``You practice every day hitting harder
and harder and harder, and then you can hit as hard as you can
without really getting hurt,'' Cho says.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Advanced degrees in physics come in different varieties. At the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, students earn them by
writing a dissertation. At the Karate Institute in New York City,
they earn them by breaking 1-inch-thick pine boards. Lots of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Paris, a fourth-degree black belt in tae kwon do, is happy
to demonstrate his grasp of the scientific principles. First, he
adjusts his belt. Then he lets out a short, sharp yell, snaps his
left leg forward and smashes his foot through three boards,
showering the mat with splinters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five boards is about the most I can break,'' Paris says. ``But
I'm not really limited by strength; I'm more or less limited by the
size of the hands holding the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Few things offer more visceral proof of the power of physics
than a karate chop. Punch a brick with your bare hand, untutored in
the martial arts, and you may break a finger. Punch it with the
proper force, momentum and positioning, and you break the brick
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazingly, there are no tricks involved at all,'' says Michael
Feld, a physicist at MIT. ``What you have here is one of the most
efficient human movements ever conceived. We've found nothing in
our studies to improve upon the art.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, when Feld was earning a brown belt in karate,
his instructor, Ronald McNair, also happened to be his physics
student. (McNair later died tragically while working as a
scientist-astronaut aboard Space Shuttle Challenger)
</P>
<P>
   The secret to karate, both men agreed, lies in the speed and
exceptional focus of the strike. But just how fast does a karate
punch move?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, they joined with undergraduate Stephen Wilk and set
up a strobe light that flashed either 60 or 120 times per second.
Then they photographed McNair and others throwing various kicks and
punches.
</P>
<P>
   Once the film was developed, they could calculate the speed of a
punch by counting how many times the strobe flashed until the fist
hit its target.
</P>
<P>
   Feld and McNair found that beginning students can throw a karate
chop at about 20 feet per second _ just enough to break a 1-inch
board. But a black belt like McNair could chop at 46 feet per
second. At that speed, a 1.5-pound hand can deliver a wallop of up
to 2,800 newtons (one newton is roughly equal to the force exerted
by the weight of an apple). Splitting a typical concrete slab 1.5
inches thick takes on average only 1,900 newtons.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the best boxers can punch as quickly and powerfully
as any black belt. Why can't they break concrete blocks too?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in the nature of their punches. When a boxer
throws his fist, he usually ends the movement with follow-through.
This gives the punch maximum momentum (golf and tennis players
follow through for the same reason), and it can help knock an
opponent down. But the impact itself is diffuse: It's meant to jar
an opponent's brain, not crack his skull.
</P>
<P>
   A karate chop, on the other hand, has no follow-through at all:
It lashes out like a cobra and then withdraws instantly. When a
black belt hits a slab of concrete, for instance, his fist touches
the block for fewer than 5 milliseconds, and yet the block breaks
with a resounding crack.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how this works, Jearl Walker, a former tae kwon do
student who now teaches physics at Cleveland State University, set
up a study much like Feld and McNair's. A well-thrown fist, he
found, reaches its maximum velocity when the arm is about 80
percent extended.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what my tae kwon do master had taught me,''
Walker says. ``You learn to focus your punch in your imagination so
that it terminates inside your opponent's body, rather than on the
surface. To deliver the maximum power, you want to make contact
before the slowdown begins.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of all that focused power is brutally obvious: to
break bones and rupture tissue.
</P>
<P>
   But success also depends on more subtle forces. Solid as they
seem, all materials are at least slightly elastic. Whack them in
the right spot and they will start to oscillate. A punch with a
follow-through would dampen such oscillations, but a karate chop,
by pulling away at the last moment, lets them move freely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tweak a rubber band it goes up and down, and the same
is true if you tweak a board or a brick with a much greater
force,'' Feld says. ``When they reach their elastic limits, they
start to yield. In other words, they break.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for most of us, reaching that limit in bones is no
easy matter. Feld says bone can withstand 40 times more force than
concrete, and a cylinder of bone less than an inch in diameter and
29 inches long can withstand a force of more than 25,000 newtons.
</P>
<P>
   Hands and feet can withstand even more than that, because their
skin, muscles, ligaments, tendons and cartilage absorb a great deal
of impact. As a result, a well-kicked foot can absorb about 2,000
times as much force as concrete before breaking.
</P>
<P>
   Feld himself has never broken a finger in karate, even though he
once broke eight 1-inch-thick boards at a time. Still, good bones
and a Ph.D. in physics alone couldn't earn him a black belt.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   A thrum, low and insistent, emanated from the room next to
engineer Greg Swift's office at Los Alamos National Laboratory in
the late evening of May 3, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very weird,'' he recalls. ``Those guys had never made
any noise before.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift hurried next door and found postdoc Scott Backhaus in a
state of disbelief. Backhaus' experimental sound-powered engine,
wrapped in heater tape and suspended from a framework of steel
pipes, had suddenly fired up on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was heating it up to test expansion and contraction,''
Backhaus says. ``I didn't expect it to start up at such a low
temperature.'' He was both surprised and relieved: ``My major
reaction was, `Thank God, it works.'''
</P>
<P>
   Backhaus' Thermoacoustic Stirling Hybrid Engine, which he
affectionately refers to as TASHE, performs the same basic job as
an ordinary car engine or gas-fired turbine: It converts heat into
motion. But the similarity ends there.
</P>
<P>
   TASHE operates entirely on pressure waves, using high-intensity
sound to do the work of steel. As a result, it has no moving parts,
can be constructed from cheap, basic materials, and yet it is just
as efficient as a typical modern internal combustion engine.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, sound engines could take dozens of forms, from big
ones that liquefy plumes of natural gas to little ones laboring in
the cellar, that would provide supplemental home electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sound allows us to do is build invisible machinery. It's
the next level of mechanical engineering,'' says Tim Lucas,
president and CEO of Macrosonix Corp., a research and development
company in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Although the idea of using sound to drive an engine is new,
TASHE relies on a mechanical blueprint that dates back to the era
of steam power. In 1816, Robert Stirling, a multitalented minister
of the Church of Scotland, patented a simple design for an external
combustion engine; unfortunately, it proved too costly to mass
produce.
</P>
<P>
   Stirling's engine consists of a sealed chamber filled with gas
that shuttles back and forth between a ``cold'' end, often at room
temperature, and a ``hot'' end, which can be heated by any energy
source.
</P>
<P>
   A displacer piston within the chamber moves the gas between the
two ends, while a power piston oscillates in response to the
movement of the gas as it expands when heated and cools when
chilled. The power piston can be attached to a crankshaft to do the
work.
</P>
<P>
   Time and the internal combustion engine passed the Stirling
engine by, but it continued to intrigue scientists and engineers.
Then, in 1979, Peter Ceperley, a physics professor at George Mason
University in Fairfax, Va., published a paper showing that the work
done by heat in a Stirling engine could also be carried out by a
sound wave. After all, sound is nothing but motion _ we hear
because pressure waves traveling through the air vibrate our
eardrums at varying frequencies. Those waves, Ceperley realized,
could bat a slug of gas back and forth in a Stirling-like cycle,
just as heat moves a piston back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people tried to put flesh on that idea, with limited
success,'' says Swift, a fellow at Los Alamos. ``About three years
ago, we said, `Let's put a postdoc on it full time.'''
</P>
<P>
   That postdoc was Scott Backhaus. To test Ceperley's ideas, he
built his own test engine, starting with a baseball-bat-shaped
resonator made from inexpensive steel pipe. The resonator
determines the operational frequency of the engine, in the same way
that the length of an organ's pipe determines its pitch.
</P>
<P>
   At the ``handle'' end of the bat, Backhaus bolted on a
doughnut-shaped metal chamber to hold the hot (about 1,300 degrees
Fahrenheit, or 700 degrees Celsius) and cold (70 degrees
Fahrenheit, or 20 degrees Celsius) heat exchangers. Then he filled
the device with compressed helium.
</P>
<P>
   The heat exchangers in TASHE act like a huge stereo speaker _
creating sound, sending it down the resonator, and amplifying the
feedback repeatedly until it becomes inconceivably powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were in that wave, permanent hearing loss would be the
least of your problems. It's loud enough to set your hair on
fire,'' Swift says.
</P>
<P>
   The operating engine is remarkably muted, however, quieter than
an idling car. Quarter-inch-thick steel walls, needed to contain
the highly compressed helium, maintain the silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cavity walls are extremely stiff. They don't flex, so the
sound wave hardly escapes,'' Swift says.
</P>
<P>
   He and Backhaus are just beginning to sort out what their sound
contraption can do. Soon it may provide a better way to recover
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of drilling, offshore oil rigs can liberate
natural gas, which is often just burned as a waste product. The
sound engine could provide a cost-effective way to capture and ship
the gas to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   In cooperation with Cryenco Inc., a Denver gas-transport firm,
the Los Alamos engineers are building a huge model of the engine _
40 feet tall and 4 feet in diameter _ that can cool and liquefy 500
gallons of natural gas per day. The heat needed to run it will come
from burning a little of the cast-off fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both conserving a resource and cutting the pollution
caused by flaring off that gas,'' Swift says.
</P>
<P>
   Sound engines could perform a similar conservation coup in the
home. Gas-fired hot-water heaters dump unused warmth into millions
of basements around the country. The sound engine could tap that
thermal waste and use it to move a spring-mounted piston driven by
acoustic waves. The piston, in turn, could run a household
generator.
</P>
<P>
   Swift has teamed up with the Clever Fellows Innovation
Consortium in Troy, N.Y., to develop such a hybrid device.
</P>
<P>
   ``You burn natural gas, and instead of putting the heat directly
into the water, your use that heat to run an acoustic engine to
make electricity,'' Swift says.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more than one way to tap into the power of sound. At
Los Alamos in the late 1980s, Tim Lucas worked on a resonator
capable of creating far more intense sound waves than those
generated by devices like TASHE. By vibrating the resonator with an
electric motor, he generated sound waves having energy densities
thousands of times greater than had ever before been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   After forming Macrosonix in 1990, Lucas began exploring ways to
use extreme sound to perform a variety of jobs that normally
require complex machinery, such as manufacturing pharmaceuticals,
grinding up materials, mixing chemicals rapidly, compressing gas,
turbocharging engines and recycling plastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a factory in a bottle. There's a level of control there
that has never existed before,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Chemicals can be heated and cooled 600 times per second over
temperature swings as large as hundreds of degrees Celsius, or
turbulently mixed 1,200 times per second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can create a wide range of physical effects that were
simply impossible to attain before,'' Lucas says.
</P>
<P>
   He calls his sound-generating process resonant macrosonic
synthesis, and he thinks it will someday find applications as
diverse as the laser. But first the technology will show up in more
conventional applications, such as acoustic compressors, which can
be used in refrigerators, air conditioners and cooling systems for
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Given the way this work is going, Backhaus' little experiment at
Los Alamos could soon become the thrum heard 'round the world.

Los Alamos in the late 1980s, Tim Lucas worked on a resonator
capable of creating far more intense sound waves than those
generated by devices like TASHE. By vibrating the resonator with an
electric motor, he generated sound waves having energy densities
thousands of times greater than had ever before been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   After forming Macrosonix in 1990, Lucas began exploring ways to
use extreme sound to perform a variety of jobs that normally
require complex machinery, such as manufacturing pharmaceuticals,
grinding up materials, mixing chemicals rapidly, compressing gas,
turbocharging engines and recycling plastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a factory in a bottle. There's a level of control there
that has never existed before,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Chemicals can be heated and cooled 600 times per second over
temperature swings as large as hundreds of degrees Celsius, or
turbulently mixed 1,200 times per second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can create a wide range of physical effects that were
simply impossible to attain before,'' Lucas says.
</P>
<P>
   He calls his sound-generating process resonant macrosonic
synthesis, and he thinks it will someday find applications as
diverse as the laser. But first the technology will show up in more
conventional applications, such as acoustic compressors, which can
be used in refrigerators, air conditioners and cooling systems for
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Given the way this work is going, Backhaus' little experiment at
Los Alamos could soon become the thrum heard 'round the world.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Christy's parents were at their wits' end. About two months
before, she had been fine, walking and talking like any 2-year-old.
Then she got a cold. First her eyes started jiggling; then her body
began jerking. The twitches were so strong she couldn't talk or
walk. She fell often, was covered with bruises and had trouble
sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents had taken her to a pediatrician, who referred them
to a neurologist. He said Christy was still fighting a virus and
would get better. When she didn't, her parents brought her to me
for another opinion.
</P>
<P>
   My physical examination included tests of balance and
coordination. From Christy's responses I could see she had suffered
an injury to her cerebellum, a fist-sized structure at the base of
the brain that helps execute movements.
</P>
<P>
   But I also knew that her jerks and eye movements had to
originate in the brain stem, a slender stalk of tissue that
connects the brain to the spinal cord. Her problems with language
and behavior probably meant other brain structures were involved
too.
</P>
<P>
   I told the parents that Christy had OMS _ opsoclonus-myoclonus
syndrome. The name is simply a description of the symptoms.
Opsoclonus refers to the jiggling eye movements, and myoclonus is a
term for the muscle jerks.
</P>
<P>
   OMS is caused by a brain injury, but the problem can't be easily
detected on brain scans. The brain contains a staggering thousand
trillion junctions between neurons. It would take a malfunction in
only a small percentage of neurons to produce Christy's symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can this be cured?'' her mother asked. I shook my head. ``I'm
talking about treatment, not cures.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents seemed incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   I explained that in about half the known cases, the cause is
thought to be a viral infection. The other half are caused by a
tumor called a neuroblastoma in the chest or abdomen. This type of
pediatric tumor accounts for about 8 percent of cancers in
children, and it occurs most often in toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 4 percent of those children _ roughly 30 U.S. cases
each year _ develop opsoclonus-myoclonus. We needed to do more
tests on Christy to know if her OMS was caused by a tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Her blood tests, X-rays, electroencephalogram and urine sample
showed nothing unusual, but I ordered a CAT scan just to make sure.
A tumor of only millimeters in diameter can be extremely difficult
to detect.
</P>
<P>
   When the CAT scan was completed, the radiologist pointed out a
small blotch in the chest _ a tumor. Within a week Christy was in
the operating room and a surgeon cut out the mass. Lab results
confirmed it had not spread to other parts of her body.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, the tumor itself is not directly responsible
for OMS symptoms. Christy's immune system was getting a message to
strike the tumor, and the message was prompting an attack on a
protein in her brain.
</P>
<P>
   Why does the immune system assail the very constituents it is
designed to protect? The explanation begins with the maturing
immune system. During fetal development, it tries to eliminate the
immune cells that can recognize proteins the body manufactures
itself _ the so-called self proteins. The problem is that the
system of elimination is not foolproof. Some sequestered tissues _
like brain cells _ remain vulnerable to immune-cell activity. So if
a tumor or virus makes a protein that also appears on brain cells,
the immune system will hunt down and attack those cells as well.
It's a biological version of friendly fire.
</P>
<P>
   In Christy's case, the tumor had primed her immune system to
attack a protein on the cerebellum's Purkinje cells, which connect
with neurons in other parts of the brain to coordinate movement and
aid learning.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after Christy's surgery, her neurological condition
worsened. I explained to her stunned parents that we could try to
weaken the immune response by treating her with adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH), the same hormone secreted by the pituitary gland.
ACTH would prompt her adrenal glands to produce steroids, and
steroids help rein in immune-cell activity.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians have more questions than answers when treating OMS.
Should we give Christy chemotherapy to kill her immune cells, even
though her tumor was benign? Should we try filtering the attacking
antibodies from her blood, even though we don't know if it will
work in kids her age?
</P>
<P>
   Christy's parents were taught how to give her daily ACTH
injections and how to monitor side effects, which can include fluid
retention, behavioral problems and sleeplessness.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, she was much better, and she could walk if she
kept her legs apart for better balance. She still couldn't talk,
but she suffered fewer jerks and eye abnormalities. Her parents'
sense of hope made me feel like a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Christy's mother called. She was frantic.
``Christy's worse. We were down to the lowest dose of ACTH, and she
was due to come off the medication at the end of the week. Then she
got a cold and deteriorated.''
</P>
<P>
   The panic in her voice frightened me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring her in,'' I said, wondering what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to avoid conventional treatments, such as
immunosuppressants or chemotherapy, because they inflict widespread
destruction on the immune system. By the time the family arrived, I
had a plan. I said we would give Christy an intravenous dose of
immunoglobulins (IVIG), or antibodies. By flooding her blood with
so many normal antibodies, we might be able to throw off the
signaling that was directing the attack. If it worked, I explained,
we'd give it to Christy once a month for several months.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure costs as much as $20,000, so I had to convince
Christy's insurance company of its worth. The representative had
never heard of opsoclonus-myoclonus. Was the treatment standard
care or research, he asked. I said I would fax reports on the few
published cases of IVIG treatment that I knew of. We waited. Two
weeks passed. Approval came _ for one dose.
</P>
<P>
   Christy returned to the clinic, and the nurse infused her with
IVIG. The procedure took three hours. While everyone else worried,
Christy fell asleep in her mother's arms.
</P>
<P>
   Later the father took me aside. If Christy's OMS had been
treated earlier, he asked, could she have recovered? I said that
although the syndrome has been known for at least 40 years, few
physicians are aware of it. Too often the telltale eye movements
and muscle jerks are mistaken for symptoms of a simple viral
infection. So no one gets treated for OMS right away.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hit on the head with a brick, we are quick to follow
certain protocols. But we are only beginning to realize that when
the immune system attacks brain cells, the consequences can be just
as serious.
</P>
<P>
   The antibodies seemed to work, and Christy soon regained lost
ground. I decided to reduce the ACTH dosage but not stop it
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   That was months ago. I recently received a birthday announcement
from the family. Christy had turned 3. Her cheeks were puffy from
steroids, but she was running. Smiling faces in the family photo
told me everything I wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Christy's future is uncertain. I don't know if she will
ever be able to live independently or hold a job. I don't know if
she'll have learning disabilities or mental retardation. I do know
that relapses will be likely.
</P>
<P>
   ACTH withdrawal and childhood infections _ particularly those
that produce a fever _ could provoke her immune system into another
rampage. I worried that using drugs to subdue her immune system
might weaken her resistance to serious infections or even another
kind of tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Although we take precautions, the hormone, too, could stunt her
growth and harm her health. And nobody knows how long children who
suffer from OMS need to be treated.
</P>
<P>
   Above all else, do no harm _ the tenet of my medical education _
echoed in my thoughts. But there were no better options for
treating OMS.
</P>
<P>
   At least Christy's brain had an opportunity to resume its
critical development. The rest was up to the plasticity and
resilience of youth.

   &UR; BATTLE FATIGUES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Munroe spends his days thinking about how to avoid getting
killed in the new millennium. He's not paranoid _ he's doing his
job.
</P>
<P>
   As warrior systems integration team leader at the Natick Soldier
Center in Massachusetts, Munroe is developing a vision of what
American soldiers will be wearing in combat a quarter century
hence.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army is preparing to roll out uniforms that include
video-display goggles and a chest-mounted mouse for weapons and
radio controls.
</P>
<P>
   Munroe's Future Warrior 2025 concept draws on much more far-out
engineering. Night-vision glasses correct for the distortion caused
by the curvature of the visor. The helmet, called ``headgear
subsystem-information central,'' links with the soldier's suit and
firearm so that the soldier need only look at a target and the
voice-activated gun is locked on and ready to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   The suit itself is a bullet-resistant mesh of carbon nanotubes.
It circulates hot or cold water to keep the wearer comfortable and
contains embedded enzymes to neutralize biological or chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Future Warrior 2025 is just a dream _ or a nightmare.
The necessary technology is years off, and the mockup at the Natick
Soldier Center isn't a working prototype _ it's a ``conceptual
simulation'' to stimulate the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   So how does one decide what a conceptual simulation of
tomorrow's soldier should look like?
</P>
<P>
   ``The black suit shows you he's of the future,'' Munroe
explains.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; DINOSAUR ON THE GROW &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Duck-billed dinosaurs, 30-foot-long plant-eaters that once
roamed much of North America, were hardly bigger than toy poodles
when they hatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is almost nothing you can think of as vulnerable as a
16-inch-tall duck-billed dinosaur,'' says paleontologist Jack
Horner of the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a tiny baby dino to do? Grow fast like a bird, not
slowly like a lizard.
</P>
<P>
   Horner, paleontologist Kevin Padian of the University of
California at Berkeley, and their colleagues examined fossil
embryos and hatchlings from three types of duck-bills to figure out
how they matured. The researchers counted the number of microscopic
blood vessels in the part of the bone surrounding the marrow _ a
large blood supply denotes fast growth. They also examined
embryonic bone from modern alligators, ostriches and emus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dinosaurs had even more vascular space than the birds. It
looks like they grew up to somewhere between nine and 12 feet long
in just one year,'' Horner says.
</P>
<P>
   They may have looked like lizards, but Horner finds that
dinosaurs had evolved a birdlike, fast-paced development style to
survive the cretaceous competition. ``In other words, birds didn't
invent this method of growth. It was invented by their dinosaur
ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; TRAFFIC WITH THE WEATHER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Morning newscasters give a fairly accurate prediction of the
day's weather. Wouldn't it be nice if they could also give
forecasts of traffic jams?
</P>
<P>
   Civil engineer John Leonard of the Georgia Institute of
Technology has created a set of computer programs to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard collects car speeds from automated roadway cameras and
feeds the numbers into the program, which turns them into
color-coded maps showing how long it takes to travel from a given
starting point to more than 5,000 destinations.
</P>
<P>
   He has also created a database summarizing the past two years of
traffic speeds. When this database is combined with information on
current happenings, such as special events in town or holidays,
Leonard can anticipate what commuters should prepare for.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard expresses traffic on a numerical scale. An open
interstate would rate a 30, while heavy congestion might rate a
100. Many people could leave for work 15 minutes earlier, if they
knew they were facing a messy drive. That small change, he says,
could decrease congestion and frustration.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; GENE-IUS COMPUTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Engineers planning tomorrow's supercomputers are finding it hard
to beat the power of the genome.
</P>
<P>
   DNA expresses information as a sequence of molecules along the

   &UR; BATTLE FATIGUES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Munroe spends his days thinking about how to avoid getting
killed in the new millennium. He's not paranoid _ he's doing his
job.
</P>
<P>
   As warrior systems integration team leader at the Natick Soldier
Center in Massachusetts, Munroe is developing a vision of what
American soldiers will be wearing in combat a quarter century
hence.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army is preparing to roll out uniforms that include
video-display goggles and a chest-mounted mouse for weapons and
radio controls.
</P>
<P>
   Munroe's Future Warrior 2025 concept draws on much more far-out
engineering. Night-vision glasses correct for the distortion caused
by the curvature of the visor. The helmet, called ``headgear
subsystem-information central,'' links with the soldier's suit and
firearm so that the soldier need only look at a target and the
voice-activated gun is locked on and ready to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   The suit itself is a bullet-resistant mesh of carbon nanotubes.
It circulates hot or cold water to keep the wearer comfortable and
contains embedded enzymes to neutralize biological or chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Future Warrior 2025 is just a dream _ or a nightmare.
The necessary technology is years off, and the mockup at the Natick
Soldier Center isn't a working prototype _ it's a ``conceptual
simulation'' to stimulate the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   So how does one decide what a conceptual simulation of
tomorrow's soldier should look like?
</P>
<P>
   ``The black suit shows you he's of the future,'' Munroe
explains.
</P>

 &UR; DINOSAUR ON THE GROW &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Duck-billed dinosaurs, 30-foot-long plant-eaters that once
roamed much of North America, were hardly bigger than toy poodles
when they hatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is almost nothing you can think of as vulnerable as a
16-inch-tall duck-billed dinosaur,'' says paleontologist Jack
Horner of the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a tiny baby dino to do? Grow fast like a bird, not
slowly like a lizard.
</P>
<P>
   Horner, paleontologist Kevin Padian of the University of
California at Berkeley, and their colleagues examined fossil
embryos and hatchlings from three types of duck-bills to figure out
how they matured. The researchers counted the number of microscopic
blood vessels in the part of the bone surrounding the marrow _ a
large blood supply denotes fast growth. They also examined
embryonic bone from modern alligators, ostriches and emus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dinosaurs had even more vascular space than the birds. It
looks like they grew up to somewhere between nine and 12 feet long
in just one year,'' Horner says.
</P>
<P>
   They may have looked like lizards, but Horner finds that
dinosaurs had evolved a birdlike, fast-paced development style to
survive the cretaceous competition. ``In other words, birds didn't
invent this method of growth. It was invented by their dinosaur
ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; TRAFFIC WITH THE WEATHER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Morning newscasters give a fairly accurate prediction of the
day's weather. Wouldn't it be nice if they could also give
forecasts of traffic jams?
</P>
<P>
   Civil engineer John Leonard of the Georgia Institute of
Technology has created a set of computer programs to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard collects car speeds from automated roadway cameras and
feeds the numbers into the program, which turns them into
color-coded maps showing how long it takes to travel from a given
starting point to more than 5,000 destinations.
</P>
<P>
   He has also created a database summarizing the past two years of
traffic speeds. When this database is combined with information on
current happenings, such as special events in town or holidays,
Leonard can anticipate what commuters should prepare for.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard expresses traffic on a numerical scale. An open
interstate would rate a 30, while heavy congestion might rate a
100. Many people could leave for work 15 minutes earlier, if they
knew they were facing a messy drive. That small change, he says,
could decrease congestion and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; GENE-IUS COMPUTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Engineers planning tomorrow's supercomputers are finding it hard
to beat the power of the genome.
</P>
<P>
   DNA expresses information as a sequence of molecules along the
double helix in much the same way that silicon chips process
information as zeroes and ones, but DNA is far more efficient: One
gram of the molecules could hold as much data as a trillion CDs.
</P>
<P>
   So two research groups have turned to DNA to crack math problems
containing so many variables that they overwhelm conventional
computers.
</P>

&HT;     IN REAL LIFE, CHAOS REIGNED IN `MASH' UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: Note optional trim)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By NICOLE FOY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ For a good many Americans, memories of the Korean
War stem not from the battlefield or history books, but from
flickering images of characters such as ``Hawkeye'' Pierce and
``Hot Lips'' Houlihan.
</P>
<P>
   The widely popular, wisecracking television series ``MASH''
helped immortalize the dedicated doctors and nurses who served at
the front lines of the Korean conflict. Those who experienced the
war firsthand say the show's screwball comedy in the midst of
mayhem was, for the most part, an accurate portrayal of life in a
Mobile Army Surgical Hospital unit.
</P>
<P>
   But actor Alan Alda may never have reached the degree of fame he
did without the hand San Antonio had in molding the concept the
television series showcased. In 1948, the Medical Field Service
School at Fort Sam Houston played a lead role in designing the MASH
model, said John Greenwood, chief of the U.S. Army surgeon
general's Office of Medical History.
</P>
<P>
   Working with the surgeon general's office, the service school _
which trains combat medics and medical technicians _ helped with
the original design of the MASH, Greenwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to create a structure that was more
responsive to the front and much more mobile,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For those without the touchstone of battle, the television
series, book or movie, a MASH was a multitent surgical hospital
normally established about six to 15 miles from the battlefield's
front lines. Its main mission was to revive and stabilize the
seriously wounded so they could survive a trip to another facility,
usually an evacuation hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of a mobile treatment hospital evolved from World
War II, when the military created portable surgical hospitals
containing 25 to 30 beds, said retired Lt. Col. G.A. ``Scotty''
Knight, curator of the U.S. Army Medical Department Museum at Fort
Sam Houston in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The original mobile surgical hospitals in Korea had 60 beds,
but, by necessity, several bulged to 200 by the end of the
conflict, Knight said. Although it was but one piece of the medical
treatment system during the conflict, the MASH units were critical
in saving the lives of soldiers fighting on the front lines,
retired Lt. Col. John Catalano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't look at a MASH as a total entity,'' said Catalano,
who served as a platoon leader in Korea. ``But they sure did do
good work, considering the hostile situation they were operating
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Being close to the battlefront, the units _ which could span the
length of a football field _ often were forced to pick up and move
at a moment's notice. Evacuation could be frantic, especially when
the unit was continuing to receive and treat the wounded as it
attempted to move out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   In one month alone, the 8063rd MASH zigzagged up the rugged
Korean peninsula, covering 300 air miles on the ground. Each time
the unit moved, it took with it provisional and medical gear as
well as its 14 physicians: three surgeons, two anesthesiologists,
three assistant surgeons, two internists, one radiologist and three
general medical officers.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital also had 12 nurses, two medical service corps
officers and 93 enlisted men.
</P>
<P>
   Although health conditions such as malaria besieged the U.S.
military, it was Mother Nature who did the worst damage, according
to several historical accounts of MASH life. Temperatures as cold
as 30 degrees below zero took troops by surprise, causing hundreds
to freeze to death and sending scores of frostbite injuries to MASH
units.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A published history of the 8076th MASH recalled one of the first
winter days in 1950 when the temperatures plummeted below zero and
snow blanketed the battlefields:
</P>
<P>
   ``There were men who were fighting in nothing more than fatigues
and field jackets. During six days, there were 1,836 admissions to
the hospital and on one day, (there were) 661 admitted. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The patients were arriving in such a large number that
literally there was no place to put them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ambulances would arrive they would just have to leave
the patients lying in the snow, where unfortunately, some froze to
death before they could even be brought into the hospital tents.
However, being brought inside was no assurance against freezing,
because the temperature in the tents was so low that patients froze
there, their resistance being lowered as a result of their
injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the sudden influx of cold-related injuries was so great
that the MASH could not care for all of them, medical officers were
forced to make one of the ``most difficult decisions ever,'' the
history recounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the more seriously injured patients were given
sufficient medication to prevent suffering and then they were put
aside to die while the hospital's attention was focused on those
casualties who could be saved,'' according to the historical
account.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was amid such chaos that MASH units worked to stabilize the
wounded for movement to evacuation hospitals. Eventually, many
patients also were transferred to Brooke Army Medical Center in San
Antonio for care.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Korean War, combat medicine has continued its
trend toward more mobile medical teams. The Army's last MASH _ the
212th _ was phased out last year, and in its place the next time
U.S. troops go to war will be a Forward Surgical Team.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller and more efficient FAST unit, as it's known,
consists of 22 people and occupies an area only 20 by 30 feet. The
idea emerged from a post-Gulf war demand for lighter, more mobile
medical units that can be placed as far forward as possible near a
battlefield.

   A more practical idea might turn out to be a Daedalus proposal
to use the ``junk DNA'' incorporated in the genomes of all living
creatures, including microbes, as a vehicle for storing vast
quantities of information.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Although he denies the existence of any philosophic agenda in
his columns, Daedalus sometimes applies mischievous
pseudo-scientific analysis to explanations of supernatural
phenomena, including religion.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the genre was a column published on Nov. 17, 1994, in
the journal Nature (and included in the new book), examining ghosts
and poltergeists, which ``pose a severe challenge to science.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that there are two worlds, one material and one
spiritual, and that a poltergeist ``is a local leakage or coupling
between these two worlds.'' The chill experienced by people while
being haunted, Daedalus surmises, could be explained by assuming
that the spirit world is cold _ perhaps 3 degrees Kelvin, the value
of the cosmic microwave background left over from the Big Bang. In
Daedalus' thermodynamic analysis that follows, he concludes that a
poltergeist could be exorcized using an ordinary microwave oven
rigged to operate with its door open.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Jones acknowledged in an interview that some of his zany ideas
had outraged readers. In a column in 1993, Daedalus outlined a
scheme for measuring the velocity, direction and quantum-mechanical
spin of a soul as it leaves a body at the instant of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main gainer will be theology,'' he wrote. ``Traditional
theology, perhaps, predicts that the soul of a sinner would depart
downward, and would weigh less than that of a righteous believer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daedalus soul meter could shed light on a host of matters,
including the precise moment when a soul enters a fetus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the soul turns out to enter the fetus quite late in
pregnancy,'' he wrote, ``the religious arguments against
contraception and early abortion will be neatly disproved.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones admits that the latest book of Daedalus columns is not for
everyone, even though the science in them is written to be
accessible to nonscientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that anyone who is strongly against evolution,
or who believes that intelligence is not inherited, or whatever,
would ever read the book,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even people with no understanding of science may enjoy it,
he believes.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on a quotation from Thomas Beecham, the eminent British
conductor, Daedalus said of the English, ``They don't understand
music, but they like the noise it makes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't understand science,'' he added, ``but
they like the noise it makes, so to speak. I try to address them as
well.''

   WASHINGTON _ In the final terrifying moments of Alaska Flight
261, which crashed off the southern California coast Jan. 31, a
pilot warned Los Angeles air traffic controllers that the plane was
veering in and out of control, according to audio tapes released
Wednesday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are, uh, in a dive here,'' the pilot, clearly winded, told
tower controllers about 10 minutes before the crash. ``We're out of
26,000 feet. We're in a vertical dive, not a dive yet, but, uh,
we've lost vertical control of our airplane,'' he said, almost in a
gasp.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a note of hope, he added, ``Yeah, we've got it back
under control there.''
</P>
<P>
   But seconds later, he reported, ``No we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The audio tapes underscored an effort made by crew members to
correct what they had reported earlier were problems with the jet's
vertical stabilizer, a wing-like horizontal portion of the tail
responsible for ensuring level flight. Federal investigators are
assessing the possible failure of the so-called jackscrew, a key
part of the plane's tail stabilizer system.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261, bound from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San
Francisco, crashed off California's Ventura County coast, killing
all 88 passengers and crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes showed that shortly after the plane nose-dived from
about 26,000 feet to about 24,000 feet, the pilots regained level
flight for several minutes. The pilot who talked to controllers
also reported that the MD-83 jet was ``kinda stabilized. We're
slowing down here and, uh, we're going, uh to do a little
troubleshooting. ''
</P>
<P>
   About five minutes before the crash, the pilot told controllers
that the plane had descended further to 22,500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a jammed stabilizer and we're maintaining altitude
with difficulty,'' he said, asking permission to land at the Los
Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   But the pilot, concerned about whether the jet could stay aloft
as he maneuvered toward the airport, also asked if he could start
his descent over water. He said he wanted to ``make sure I can
control the jet and I'd like to do that out here over the bay if I
may.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, about four minutes before the crash, when controllers had
cleared the jet to descend to 17,000 feet, the pilot sent his final
transmission to the control tower. At that point he appeared calm
and said only, ``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   However, about a minute before the crash, other pilots in the
area witnessed the jet's horrifying dive into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   One of those pilots radioed: ``That plane has just started to do
a big, huge plunge.'' He added that the distressed jet was
``inverted,''
</P>
<P>
   that is, flying upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of another plane, a Sky West Aviation jet, told
controllers that flight 261 jet was ``nose down'' and ``descending
quite rapidly definitely out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   About five minutes from the flight 261's final transmission,
both of the other planes' pilots said they saw the jet splash down.
``He hit the water,'' one said. ``He's down.''
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials declined to name the flight 261's pilot whose
voice was heard on the tapes. They also declined to comment on the
tapes and referred questions to the National Transportation Safety
Board, which is probing the cause of the crash.

&HT;     ROLLER COASTER SAFETY CONCERNS RISE WITH G-FORCES

<P>
   QUEENSBURY, N.Y. _ Andy Schoonover was sluicing along on a
Jurassic Park River amusement ride in Florida last month when the
ride plunged into a pool of water, as it was supposed to. What
followed wasn't supposed to happen: He fractured two of his ribs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't anticipate stopping so suddenly,'' said the
41-year-old resident of Clinton Park, N.Y. ``I was thrown forward
and my chest hit a padded bar.''
</P>
<P>
   The force of modern amusement rides is attracting attention in
Congress and elsewhere. Officials and some experts are wondering at
what point the gravitational pushes and pulls known as G-forces
turn from ``Gee Whiz'' to G-dangers.
</P>
<P>
   In the rush to build bigger, faster, loopier rides, these
officials fear the industry is pushing the envelope on the limits
of human tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   In recent hearings, Massachusetts Rep. Edward J. Markey, who is
the ranking Democrat on a congressional consumer safety panel, said
the industry should take a more cautious approach. He cited a spike
in recent years of injuries from amusement park rides.
</P>
<P>
   Markey's office said the number of injuries resulting from
G-force cases is small _ only 15 cited in the medical literature
worldwide from 1966 to 1999 and only five in the United States. But
most have occurred since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Markey's office said most of the injuries were in the nature of
brain bruises and were treatable.
</P>
<P>
   In the related issue of ride safety in general, in one
catastrophic week last August four people died in roller coaster
accidents across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is about to adopt limits on how much force should be
allowed on rides, said David Moulton, Markey's chief of staff. He
said German officials initially planned to adopt a standard of 5
Gs, but instead imposed a limit of 6.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, several coasters in the United States,
including one in Texas, claim to be above 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the industry in Germany telling us there are rides there
that are not safe that might be operating here?'' Moulton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Escape park in Queensbury features five roller
coasters. Park officials declined to supply the G-forces of those
coasters, but a spokesman for the park's parent corporation said
they aren't as powerful as some of the newer and more controversial
coasters.
</P>
<P>
   Great Escape's coasters include ``The Comet,'' a 95-foot-high
classic wooden ride moved to the park and rebuilt in 1994. ``The
Nightmare at Crack Axle Canyon,'' which made its debut last year,
is 45 feet high and attains speeds up to 34 mph as its twists and
turns in complete darkness inside a six-story building. There also
is the ``Alpine Bobsled,'' with a maximum height of 65 feet, the
``Boomerang Coast-to-Coaster,'' a high-tech backward-looping steel
coaster that attains speeds up to 45 mph, as well as the
74-foot-high ``Steamin' Demon.''
</P>
<P>
   John Collins, general manager of the park, said the rides go
through a four-step process to ensure their safety. The New York
Labor Department inspects the rides each spring. Great Escape's
insurance agency conducts several independent inspections, and the
park hires an independent auditor to conduct additional
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   And every day, before the park opens, employees conduct ``a
comprehensive checklist to make sure the rides are safe from an
electrical, mechanical and operational standpoint,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy McCormack, a spokesperson for the state Labor Department,
which oversees park safety, said G-forces are not recorded or
regulated by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to the engineer who designs the ride and the ride
manufacturer,'' McCormack said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Premier Parks' Six Flags Corporation, the parent
company of Great Escape since 1996, said the rides here, while
thrilling, are nowhere near the cutting edge of the high-tech
offerings at some of the newer, larger parks.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which often moves rides from park to park, wouldn't
hesitate to bring in a bigger coaster, spokeswoman Debbie Nauser
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have any qualms about having the same coasters as
at Magic Mountain or Six Flags over Dallas, because they are all
safe rides,'' Nauser said.
</P>
<P>
   This year the new Millennium Force at Cedar Point in Sandusky,
Ohio, will break what had been a 300-foot barrier by 10 feet. That
means the coaster is higher than the Statue of Liberty. It will
reach speeds of 92 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the engineering society that sets standards for the
industry in the United States is looking at the issue of G-forces
and whether it would be prudent to impose limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We routinely do accelerometer testing of G-forces,'' said
Nauser, adding that a key to the safety of the experience is the
brief duration of the more extreme stress on the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to wear a flight suit to regulate your blood
flow. This isn't NASA,'' she added. ``On a roller coaster you are
probably going to experience a high G-force for maybe a 10th or a
100th of a second.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nauser said tests have shown this is less stress than the forces
of a human sneeze, which actually measures anywhere from 5 to 9 Gs.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Israel, a spokeswoman for Zemperla, which manufactures
about one-fourth of the rides in the Six Flags chain, said that
while the Italian-based company has long made family-oriented
amusement rides, it is now moving increasingly into the thrill-ride
category. The trend is ``pushing the envelope'' with such rides,
she said, but she insisted that the company has the testing and
technology to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more sophisticated with the testing, more rigorous with
the manufacturing. What you can do quickly these days in modifying
and making changes is light years ahead of where we were,'' Israel
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Schoonover, the sore ribs from his Florida trip will
likely keep him off the coasters of the Great Escape this year, but
he is already looking forward to ``getting back on the horse'' next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the thrill, I like the speed,'' he said, ``and I assume
that if they're running, that they've been adequately tested.''

<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Just to stay in business, Chuba Egolum must
cope with daily annoyances most Americans would confront only
during a natural catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, people who know Nigeria like to sum things up with a
joke: ``What's the difference between Nigeria and a disaster
area?''
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``In a disaster area, the Red Cross will come to help
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Egolum isn't laughing. His time in the United States _ including
three years obtaining an MBA in Atlanta _ taught him to appreciate
basic things longed for in a place like Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I have to deal with whether I'm going to have
electricity,'' he says, sitting at his desk in a striped golf shirt
and tan Dockers trousers. His company drills wells and builds water
distribution systems. ``I have to make sure to pump enough water
into the tank on top of the building so we will be able to flush
the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic in this immense swirling city is impassable at most
hours. ``It is bedeviling,'' Egolum says. ``When I pick up the
phone, most often it is dead,'' he says. ``This is what it is to do
business in Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite it all, Egolum is hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in nearly two decades, Nigeria has a civilian
government. Africa's most populous nation, with 123 million people,
now can carry on without the crushing weight of the corrupt
military regimes that have saddled it for most of its 40 years of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   While the end of military rule is universally praised, a year of
living democratically has been sobering, even disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is a new experience for us,'' says Egolum, who still
considers genuine representative government a distant destination _
a Promised Land. ``We haven't gotten there yet, but we have a
pretty good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   This sentiment is widespread in Nigeria, but it is accompanied
by an uneasy belief that the window of opportunity may shut at any
time. People worry in particular that too much may be riding on the
powers of one man: President Olusegan Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday(5/29), Obasanjo will celebrate the anniversary of his
inauguration as Nigeria's first civilian leader since 1983. A man
who counts among his friends Bill Clinton and former President
Jimmy Carter, Obasanjo, 63, is regarded widely as auled between
1976 and 1979 before handing power to a doomed civilian government,
has made an auspicious start. He summarily retired from government
crooked military officers, pushed an ethics agenda and has labored
to repair the country's dreadful reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the problems confronting Obasanjo and Nigeria remain both
broad and deep, a perilous combination in a country whose people
have high expectations and little patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigerians are about getting Nigeria fixed,'' said John Muibi
Amoda, the head of the pro-democracy Africa Peace Support
Initiative. Yet, Amoda cautions that people expect too much and
understand too little. ``Just because you have an internationally
monitored so-called democratic election doesn't mean that you have
a democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While reformers demand that Obasanjo do more, the robber barons
who dominated for so long are working to obstruct him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is walking a tightrope with people at both ends
shaking the rope,'' Amoda said.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders are aware of the president's plight but are
eager for him to succeed because they believe Africa's future may
depend heavily on the success of a healthy and democratic Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration identified Nigeria as one of four
''key democracies'' along with Colombia, Indonesia and Ukraine. It
ended the country's pariah status, and is seeking $100 million in
aid. In January, the administration said it would end its ban on
direct flights from the United States to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Obasanjo has pledged to deploy his disused but
still potent military to help bring stability to west Africa. He
offered to send peacekeepers to Sierra Leone, so long as Nigeria
receives foreign support _ particularly from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also has responded favorably, if vaguely, to
Obasanjo's anxious pleas for relief from the country's estimated
$35 billion in international debt, which consumes more than a third
of Nigeria's federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   American policymakers take particular note of Obasanjo's
ambitions of doubling Nigeria's oil output to 4 million barrels a
day. The country already produces about twice as much crude oil as
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Obasanjo embraces the free market and has embarked
on a drive to privatize major industries.
</P>
<P>
   And while Obasanjo's momentum has been stalled by an assertive
Legislature _ which will be a year old in June _ many observers
believe the government is at least learning the deliberative,
power-sharing process.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Nigeria was poised to assume the role of an
African superpower. Today it is a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   For 17 years this vast country _ which is about the size of
Texas, Georgia and Florida combined _ was ravaged by military
juntas that wrecked the economy, impoverished the people and
depleted the national treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of neglect are everywhere. In the primary city Lagos,
skyscrapers stand with broken windows and weedy sidewalks like the
ruins of some flourishing but bygone metropolis. Without reliable
electricity, elevators rarely run in the buildings made stifling by
the lack of air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the commerce in this sprawling urban jumble of 11
million is what economists call ``informal,'' meaning individuals
and small businesses hawk whatever they can for whatever they can
get. In many ways, Nigeria is a nation of hardy and hard-bitten
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   In today's world of e-commerce and automated everything, Nigeria
seems primitive. Banks don't issue credit cards and, with the
exception of the two or three hotels that specialize in fleecing
foreigners, no one accepts them. There are no automated teller
machines and, perhaps most startling, no McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is a constant companion. Hotel doormen panic when foreign
guests suggest taking a stroll. For a fee, heavily armed soldiers
at the airport will stand guard over newly arrived visitors and
their bags until a taxi or friend comes to gather them up.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking any public transport and little traffic enforcement,
roads in Lagos are choked in a hopeless, chaotic gridlock _ known
here as ``slow-go.'' To keep things moving, whip-bearing policeman
apprehend laggardly drivers and administer lashes on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   And even with its vast oil resources, Nigeria must import
gasoline, creating frequent shortages and a thriving black market.
Without the luxury of being able to worry about the environment,
the air has become brown with dust and pollution and roadsides are
covered with layers of litter. Much of the country's hardwood
forests are gone and the oil-rich Niger Delta is a disaster in the
view of many environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to get the impression that nothing works.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians blame the mess on the run of dictators who were inept,
dishonest or both. Over the past two decades, Nigeria developed the
reputation of being perhaps the world's most corrupt country. (In
1998, Transparency International rated Nigeria No. 2 among corrupt
countries,
</P>
<P>
   trailing only neighboring Cameroon.)
</P>
<P>
   To many outsiders, it often seemed as if the entire nation was
on the take. From passport officers to traffic cops, just about any
problem could be resolved with a ``dash'' _ a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian leaders now consider regaining credibility paramount.
``If there is one single thing that has retarded economic
development, it is the issue of corruption,'' said Farouk Lawan,
the chairman of the ethics committee of the Nigerian House of
Representatives. ``We are talking about a situation where the
previous head of state looted vast amounts of money and stifled
</P>
<P>
   the entire economic system of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Sani Abacha, who ruled from 1993 until he died in office in
1998, is accused of personally stealing more than $4 billion. With
the assistance of friendly governments _ including the United
States _ Obasanjo has located several hundred million. But much of
the money may never be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite many small victories, the economy remains in critical
but at least stable condition. Last weekend, Obasanjo announced
that Nigeria was had caught up with $1.5 billion in back payments
to the government's private partners in oil joint ventures,
including Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon-Mobil and Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, economists worry that a recovery may be impossible
given the poor state of the nation's infrastructure, particularly
the power grid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidence in the Nigerian economy cannot be restored
until these basic infrastructure needs are met,'' said Chike
Uchime, the editor of the Nigerian magazine Business &AMP; Finance
Digest. Additionally, the country needs to diversify its economy,
he said. Nearly 90 percent of the country's export revenues and
virtually all its tax income comes from oil.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest internal threat is the continued strife
between Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The flashpoint has been the attempt by leaders in the heavily
Muslim northern states to impose Sharia, conservative Islamic law.
Since February the conflict has claimed thousands of lives in
brutal clashes with machetes the weapon of choice. Obasanjo has
been criticized for reacting too slowly and indecisively.
Politicians from both religions express concerns that
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria will disintegrate if Obasanjo cannot gain control of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With all the problems, most people seem to believe that the
change toward democracy is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   On a particularly hot day recently, T. Bimbo Akande sought
refuge in the breeze made by a fan in his office on the 18th floor
in one of the weary old skyscrapers that haunt downtown Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   Akande believes his import-export business will improve only if
Obasanjo can win the trust of foreign investors. He's skeptical but
modestly hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   However, Akande counts his loss to the years of chaos in
personal terms. In November, his 21-year-old son Dapo Akande came
home in the evening to a dark house. As usual, the power was out,
so he cranked up the diesel-powered generator. It burst flames that
engulfed the young man.
</P>
<P>
   Akande found his son and rushed him to the poorly equipped and
scantily staffed hospital. Four days later, he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my loss to the conditions in Nigeria,'' Akande said.
``He was a huge investment for me that I will never be able to
recover. How many souls have been wasted just this way?''
</P>
<P>
   Akande, whose brother lives in the suburban Atlanta community of
Powder Springs, expressed deep frustration at the wasted potential
_ both in his son and his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've traveled around the world and I know what this country
has to offer, what its people are capable of,'' he said. ``With
good leadership. We should be among the first in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all too obvious, isn't it. There's no going back from
democracy.''

   History: First inhabted in about 500 B.C, but Nok people; many
tribes followed. Islam was introduced in the 13th century. The
British annexed Lagos in 1851 and seized control of the rest of the
region by 1886. Britain created Nigeria and made it a colony in
1914. Nigeria gained independence in 1960. Rioting broke out in
1966, and military leaders seized control. In July, a second
military coup put Col. Yakubu Gowon in power. Also in that year,
Muslim Hausas in the north massacred Christian Ibos in the east,
many of whom had been driven from the north. Thousands of Ibos took
refuge in the eastern region, which declared its independence as
Biafra in 1967. In 1970, Biafra surrendered to the federal
government. Gowon's nine-year rule ended in 1975 with a bloodless
coup that made Gen. Muritala Rufai Mohammed chief of state. Gen.
Olesugan Obasanjo assumed power in 1976 and in 1979 handed control
to civilian government of Alhaji Shehu Shagari. An oil boom in the
1970s buoyed the economy, and by the 1980s Nigeria was considered
an exemplary of African democracy. In 1984, the military seized
power, only to be followed by a coup in 1985. Gen. Ibrahim
Babangida said the country would be returned to civilian rule, but
in 1993 he voided the results of election and Babangida resigned.
In November 1993, Gen. Sani Abacha led a coup to restore military
rule. Abacha's regime was condemned for corruption and inefficiency
as well as a harshly repressive methods. Abacha's rule turned
Nigeria into an international pariah. The hanging of writer Ken
Saro-Wiwa in 1995 was condemned around the world. Abacha died of a
heart attack in June 1998, and was succeeded by another military
ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar. He pledged to step aside for an
elected leader by May 1999. In February 1999, Obasanjo won an
overwhelming victory. He was inaugurated May 29, 1999.

<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Just to stay in business, Chuba Egolum must
cope with daily annoyances most Americans would confront only
during a natural catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, people who know Nigeria like to sum things up with a
joke: ``What's the difference between Nigeria and a disaster
area?''
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``In a disaster area, the Red Cross will come to help
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Egolum isn't laughing. His time in the United States _ including
three years obtaining an MBA in Atlanta _ taught him to appreciate
basic things longed for in a place like Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I have to deal with whether I'm going to have
electricity,'' he says, sitting at his desk in a striped golf shirt
and tan Dockers trousers. His company drills wells and builds water
distribution systems. ``I have to make sure to pump enough water
into the tank on top of the building so we will be able to flush
the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic in this immense swirling city is impassable at most
hours. ``It is bedeviling,'' Egolum says. ``When I pick up the
phone, most often it is dead,'' he says. ``This is what it is to do
business in Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite it all, Egolum is hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in nearly two decades, Nigeria has a civilian
government. Africa's most populous nation, with 123 million people,
now can carry on without the crushing weight of the corrupt
military regimes that have saddled it for most of its 40 years of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   While the end of military rule is universally praised, a year of
living democratically has been sobering, even disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is a new experience for us,'' says Egolum, who still
considers genuine representative government a distant destination _
a Promised Land. ``We haven't gotten there yet, but we have a
pretty good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   This sentiment is widespread in Nigeria, but it is accompanied
by an uneasy belief that the window of opportunity may shut at any
time. People worry in particular that too much may be riding on the
powers of one man: President Olusegan Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday(5/29), Obasanjo will celebrate the anniversary of his
inauguration as Nigeria's first civilian leader since 1983. A man
who counts among his friends Bill Clinton and former President
Jimmy Carter, Obasanjo, 63, is regarded widely as an honest,
intelligent and dedicated leader. Among his credentials is a period
as chairman of Transparency International, a Berlin-based
organization that promotes honest government.
</P>
<P>
   And by most measures, Obasanjo, a former general who ruled
between 1976 and 1979 before handing power to a doomed civilian
government, has made an auspicious start. He summarily retired from
government crooked military officers, pushed an ethics agenda and
has labored to repair the country's dreadful reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the problems confronting Obasanjo and Nigeria remain both
broad and deep, a perilous combination in a country whose people
have high expectations and little patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigerians are about getting Nigeria fixed,'' said John Muibi
Amoda, the head of the pro-democracy Africa Peace Support
Initiative. Yet, Amoda cautions that people expect too much and
understand too little. ``Just because you have an internationally
monitored so-called democratic election doesn't mean that you have
a democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While reformers demand that Obasanjo do more, the robber barons
who dominated for so long are working to obstruct him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is walking a tightrope with people at both ends
shaking the rope,'' Amoda said.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders are aware of the president's plight but are
eager for him to succeed because they believe Africa's future may
depend heavily on the success of a healthy and democratic Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration identified Nigeria as one of four
''key democracies'' along with Colombia, Indonesia and Ukraine. It
ended the country's pariah status, and is seeking $100 million in
aid. In January, the administration said it would end its ban on
direct flights from the United States to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Obasanjo has pledged to deploy his disused but
still potent military to help bring stability to west Africa. He
offered to send peacekeepers to Sierra Leone, so long as
Nigervaguely, to Obasanjo's anxious pleas for relief from the
country's estimated $35 billion in international debt, which
consumes more than a third of Nigeria's federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   American policymakers take particular note of Obasanjo's
ambitions of doubling Nigeria's oil output to 4 million barrels a
day. The country already produces about twice as much crude oil as
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Obasanjo embraces the free market and has embarked
on a drive to privatize major industries.
</P>
<P>
   And while Obasanjo's momentum has been stalled by an assertive
Legislature _ which will be a year old in June _ many observers
believe the government is at least learning the deliberative,
power-sharing process.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Nigeria was poised to assume the role of an
African superpower. Today it is a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   For 17 years this vast country _ which is about the size of
Texas, Georgia and Florida combined _ was ravaged by military
juntas that wrecked the economy, impoverished the people and
depleted the national treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of neglect are everywhere. In the primary city Lagos,
skyscrapers stand with broken windows and weedy sidewalks like the
ruins of some flourishing but bygone metropolis. Without reliable
electricity, elevators rarely run in the buildings made stifling by
the lack of air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the commerce in this sprawling urban jumble of 11
million is what economists call ``informal,'' meaning individuals
and small businesses hawk whatever they can for whatever they can
get. In many ways, Nigeria is a nation of hardy and hard-bitten
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   In today's world of e-commerce and automated everything, Nigeria
seems primitive. Banks don't issue credit cards and, with the
exception of the two or three hotels that specialize in fleecing
foreigners, no one accepts them. There are no automated teller
machines and, perhaps most startling, no McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is a constant companion. Hotel doormen panic when foreign
guests suggest taking a stroll. For a fee, heavily armed soldiers
at the airport will stand guard over newly arrived visitors and
their bags until a taxi or friend comes to gather them up.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking any public transport and little traffic enforcement,
roads in Lagos are choked in a hopeless, chaotic gridlock _ known
here as ``slow-go.'' To keep things moving, whip-bearing policeman
apprehend laggardly drivers and administer lashes on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   And even with its vast oitee of the Nigerian House of
Representatives. ``We are talking about a situation where the
previous head of state looted vast amounts of money and stifled
</P>
<P>
   the entire economic system of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Sani Abacha, who ruled from 1993 until he died in office in
1998, is accused of personally stealing more than $4 billion. With
the assistance of friendly governments _ including the United
States _ Obasanjo has located several hundred million. But much of
the money may never be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite many small victories, the economy remains in critical
but at least stable condition. Last weekend, Obasanjo announced
that Nigeria was had caught up with $1.5 billion in back payments
to the government's private partners in oil joint ventures,
including Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon-Mobil and Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, economists worry that a recovery may be impossible
given the poor state of the nation's infrastructure, particularly
the power grid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidence in the Nigerian economy cannot be restored
until these basic infrastructure needs are met,'' said Chike
Uchime, the editor of the Nigerian magazine Business &AMP; Finance
Digest. Additionally, the country needs to diversify its economy,
he said. Nearly 90 percent of the country's export revenues and
virtually all its tax income comes from oil.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest internal threat is the continued strife
between Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The flashpoint has been the attempt by leaders in the heavily
Muslim northern states to impose Sharia, conservative Islamic law.
Since February the conflict has claimed thousands of lives in
brutal clashes with machetes the weapon of choice. Obasanjo has
been criticized for reacting too slowly and indecisively.
Politicians from both religions express concerns that
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria will disintegrate if Obasanjo cannot gain control of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With all the problems, most people seem to believe that the
change toward democracy is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   On a particularly hot day recently, T. Bimbo Akande sought
refuge in the breeze made by a fan in his office on the 18th floor
in one of the weary old skyscrapers that haunt downtown Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   Akande believes his import-export business will improve only if
Obasanjo can win the trust of foreign investors. He's skeptical but
modestly hopeful. .
</P>
<P>
   Akande found his son and rushed him to the poorly equipped and
scantily staffed hospital. Four days later, he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my loss to the conditions in Nigeria,'' Akande said.
``He was a huge investment for me that I will never be able to
recover. How many souls have been wasted just this way?''
</P>
<P>
   Akande, whose brother lives in the suburban Atlanta community of
Powder Springs, expressed deep frustration at the wasted potential
_ both in his son and his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've traveled around the world and I know what this country
has to offer, what its people are capable of,'' he said. ``With
good leadership. We should be among the first in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all too obvious, isn't it. There's no going back from
democracy.''

   Does your grill drool grease or sputter sparks? At one time or
another most grills become the source of a deck-top mess. Instead
of pressure washing wood or stone after every cookout, why not buy
a bib for the barbie?
</P>
<P>
   The ``Original'' Grill Pad, manufactured by DiversiTech Corp.,
is little more than a pad of thick, feltlike material coated in
colored concrete. But it's big enough (30-by-42-inch rectangles or
30-inch rounds) to protect the deck and can be cleaned off with a
shot from the garden hose. Prices range from $25 to $40 depending
on size. Look for it at area home centers and hearth and patio
stores.

   OXO, the company that made kitchen utensils comfortable, has

outdoor cooking. OXO's Barbecue Tool Set includes a stainless-steel
turner, fork and tongs at a suggested retail price of $34.99. The
pieces are also available individually with prices from $9.99 to
$14.99.
</P>
<P>
   If sauces and corn-on-the-cob are usually part of your cookout,
a matching stainless-steel basting brush ($9.99) and
corn-on-the-cob holders ($5.99 for eight) are also available.

   CHARCOAL, NATURALLY
</P>
<P>
   More and more folks are saying ``to heck with briquettes'' and
opting for natural charcoal, wood that has been burned in a
controlled process. Unlike the bagged stuff, natural charcoal
starts easily and burns evenly and hot. The fire also suffocates
more easily and the remaining charcoal can be relighted. It's also
safer to store, since it's not presoaked in lighter fluid.
</P>
<P>
   On the down side, natural charcoal produces more soot, needs
lighter fluid to start and can be hard to find.

&HT;     VIOLENCE ABOUNDS IN `M:I-2,' BUT IT'S A GAS TO WATCH

<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't look now, but the ``Mission: Impossible'' franchise has
been officially Wooed.
</P>
<P>
   What constitutes Wooing? Several elements. For a film to be
properly Wooed, it must exploit slow motion at moments of
exaggerated drama. It must feature loving close-ups of a rugged
hero, be he Chow Yun-Fat or Tom Cruise, looking unflappably
self-possessed. It must contain action sequences of extended
violence and elaborate choreography, and it must do so using an
endless quantities of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The hero must, at points of apocalyptic violence, shoot
two-fisted at the villain while dodging (in slow motion) an
assortment of handguns, rifles, bazookas, grenades, speeding
vehicles, exploding vehicles and knives. Hand-to-hand combat must
be bloody and crisp; doves must be plentiful; villainous hideaways
must be subterranean. At all costs, motorcycles must be used as
deadly weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the demands of a formal Wooing. And ``Mission:
Impossible 2'' _ that's ``M:I-2,'' in advertising parlance _ bears
in every way the stamp of John Woo, the Hong Kong director
(``Face/Off,'' ``Hard Boiled'') renowned for turning low crime into
high opera. And while Woo's films are surely an acquired taste (if
you hate movie violence, don't even try), there's no question that
this hard-driving, stylish sequel is both more entertaining and
less confusing than the original. Put it this way: You won't
scratch your head till your scalp bleeds. And that's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission: Impossible 2'' offers Tom Cruise reprising the role
of Ethan Hunt, agent extraordinaire for the Impossible Mission
Force. Hunt is relaxing on the side of a cliff when he gets word,
via souped-up sunglasses, from the IMF boss in Seville. Said boss,
played by an uncredited Anthony Hopkins, tells Ethan to dump his
vacation plans and hightail it Spain, where he'll hook up with a
comely thief named Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton) for some
as-yet-undisclosed mission.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan goes to Seville. He encounters Nyah and, after a few
scenes of deliciously sexy double-entendres, finds himself in the
thick of an affair. Then he meets up with Hopkins' smooth jefe, who
informs him that Nyah must bed an old boyfriend, Ambrose (Dougray
Scott, much skankier here than in ``Ever After''), in an effort to
retrieve a hijacked super-virus from his clutches. Ethan balks.
``She's got no training for this kind of thing,'' he says. ``I
don't think I can get her to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the astute _ and somewhat amazed _ cinema dweeb
will recognize the above-described scene as a paraphrase of the key
set-up in Alfred Hitchcock's ``Notorious,'' in which Cary Grant's
G-man, having embarked on a torrid fling with Ingrid Bergman,
learns from his boss that she must bed the exiled Nazi (Claude
Rains) who has a crush on her. Grant says ``I don't know if she'll
do it'' and ``she's had no experience'' and ``she's never been
trained for that kind of work'' and goes off in a huff to Bergman;
in the painful balcony scene that follows, Bergman agrees to seduce
Rains.
</P>
<P>
   In ``M:I-2,'' Ethan returns in a huff to Nyah _ and in the
painful (but crucially altered) balcony scene that follows, she
agrees to seduce Ambrose. Other nods to ``Notorious'' follow: when
Nyah meets Ethan surreptitiously at the race track, when a
purloined item leads Ambrose to suspect that his prodigal
snuggle-bunny is actually an agent in disguise. There are touches,
too, of ``To Catch a Thief'' (the sexy repartee; the suicidal
driving maneuvers) and ``North by Northwest'' (Ambrose's sprawling
home looks suspiciously like a Frank Lloyd Wright), all of are
worked delightfully into the script.
</P>
<P>
   Credit such sneaky touches to Woo and his screenwriter, Robert
Towne (``Shampoo''), who enlivens the script with a good deal more
wit than he brought to the original ``Mission.'' The plot is no
shocker, but there are twists enough, and plenty of
latex-face-peeling, to keep us clamoring summer drones engaged.
</P>
<P>
   As for Woo's breathlessly over-the-top action setpieces, they're
absolute killers; the motorcycle tricks alone are masterpieces of
vehicular stuntwork. Technonerds will be pleased to learn that the
current film is almost as gizmo-centric as the earlier one _ Ving
Rhames is still holed up in his van with a laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its PG-13 rating, ``M:I-2'' is a colossally violent
movie. The final cut lacks the rumored bed tango between Cruise and
Newton, so there isn't any sex to speak of, and there isn't much
profanity, either. But it is a Woo film, and Woo films aim for
overkill _ literal and figurative. They're shoot-'em-ups on
steroids, movies addicted to the adrenal punch of gunpowder.
They're bloody. They're loud. And sometimes, they're a gas to
watch.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Poor, rich little George W. Bush. The liberal
media conspiracy will never stop picking on him for his youthful
mistakes and privileges.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe dug up young Bush's service record in the Air
National Guard and claims it shows that, in his final year of
military service in 1972-73, he didn't do any flying and never
showed up at the regular drills required of Guardsmen.
</P>
<P>
   You or I probably would be sent to the brig if we missed our
reservist or Guard meetings, but not a favorite son _ that's the
implication of the story.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe also cites Bush's skipping the boring monthly meetings
as further evidence of his being an underachiever as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   As if anyone needed more proof.
</P>
<P>
   But man, is he an overachiever now. What Joe Six-Pack doesn't
identify with youthful underachievers who later make good on almost
no effort at all? The heck with that silver spoon, whatever orifice
it was used on.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he did not use illegal drugs after 1974. Whew. Who
would have wanted him flying an expensive taxpayer-purchased
airplane in 1973, anyway?
</P>
<P>

<P>
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals are up to their
attention-getting ways again. In Wisconsin, cheeseheads are furious
because PETA has placed ads saying ``Got Zits?'' to convince
teen-agers that milk and cheese cause acne.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that's bogus, how about PETA's notion that not
buying milk will save cows' lives? Sorry, not buying milk will just
lead to the creation of more meat.
</P>
<P>
   PETA is still pushing its ``Got Beer?'' campaign, an effort to
get media attention by urging young people to drink beer instead of
milk. Never mind the outrage PETA received from that other
media-attention group, Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
</P>
<P>
   PETA's www.milksucks.com Web site has a list of reasons why beer
is better than milk, including ``Beer has zero fat; milk is loaded
with fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Come on. How about these? Nobody ever danced to ``Louie, Louie''
around a keg of milk. Nobody ever squished an empty milk can
against his head. Nobody ever got wasted on milk.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you got beer, and afterward you go out to some
farmer's field and tip over his cows.
</P>

   The Supreme Court struck down a federal law requiring cable
systems to limit sexually explicit channels to late-night hours.
That didn't come as a big surprise to me.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise was that there is a thing called ``signal bleed,''
in which cable systems fail to scramble their signals well enough
to keep lascivious programming from leaking through to
non-subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   My cable company doesn't let anything through but old movies,
comedy shows from 1991 and reruns of Hitler rerunning over Russia.
The signal often fails entirely, providing the only blue material I
ever see _ an entirely blue screen.
</P>
<P>
   How can I get signal bleed from the Adam and Eve Channel, and
what can the Supreme Court do about it?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   What does California Gov. Gray Davis have against the New York
Times? Our great national newspaper ran a front-page story Tuesday
on how tough California's governor is on crime, noting that Davis
refused numerous requests for interviews, on the grounds of being
too busy.
</P>
<P>
   Well, here's what happens when you decide you're too big to fit
all the news fit to print. The Great Gray Lady, as the Times is
known, referred to Davis twice as ``Mr. Gray'' (I guess the Times
has a Freudian slippage defense on that one). The newspaper also
brought back Davis' one memorable campaign line, the one about how,
on issues of law and order, he considers Singapore ``a good
starting point.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a Democrat, must love the lash indeed. He's trying to
create an imperial aura by not talking to reporters and not holding
news conferences, so reporters are waling on him.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a big-money guy, you can talk to Mr. Green, er, Mr.
Gray, er, Mr. Davis. On Tuesday he was in Las Vegas speaking at the
meeting of the International Council of Shopping Centers.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times does everything on purpose, I think. In its
Tuesday obit for Mark R. Hughes, 44, founder of the nutritional
supplement firm Herbalife, appeared the sentence: ``His death
appeared to be from natural causes, a spokesman for Herbalife
said.``
</P>
<P>
   Naturally.

&HT;     FORD OFFERS A NOT-QUITE-A-PICKUP PICKUP 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it a car, a truck or a sport-utility?
</P>
<P>
   Try all three. That's the feeling I got behind the wheel of the
all-new 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac, which from the nose to
behind the rear seat is a Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   From the back of the rear seat, it gets a bit different. Ford
has chopped off the top of what would have been the cargo area in
an Explorer and created what amounts to a four-by-four-foot pickup
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we who know our pickups know that no real pickup would have
a bed just four feet long. Six feet, maybe, but not four. You could
barely get half of a sheet of plywood in that bed, and you would
need to tie one of those little red flags on the end of it to keep
other motorists from running into it.
</P>
<P>
   Ford isn't calling it a pickup, so neither will I, despite a
point-well-taken comment about the Sport Trac from one of our
readers, who insists that if it quacks, it must be a duck, and if
it has a bed, it must be a truck.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford has a good reason for not calling the Sport Trac a
pickup. According to the company's marketing literature and news
releases, the Sport Trac is designed to appeal to people ``who
would never consider buying a truck.'' So if we don't call it that,
perhaps we can sneak it past these anti-truck consumers, who surely
must not be from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Truck or not, the Sport Trac can carry stuff in its non-pickup
bed that you wouldn't want inside the passenger compartment of your
nice, clean, fancy Explorer _ like muddy off-road toys, hiking
boots, kayaks or camping equipment. And you can put stuff back
there that would be just way too tall to go in your regular
Explorer, such as a personal watercraft, motorcycle, or a muddy
all-terrain vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   What you don't have, though, is a nice, secure, dry,
weatherproofed place to put the things you would put in the cargo
area of your Explorer if you were on a cross-country trip with your
family, for instance. You'd have to toss everything _ suitcases and
all _ into the non-pickup bed, and worry about those storm clouds
looming on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Ford sells a lockable hard cover to go over the non-pickup bed,
however, so perhaps that's the route to take. But what happens if
you need to carry something taller than the non-pickup bed, yet
also need to keep something else covered up and out of the weather?
Maybe one of those car-top carriers like they sell at Sears or rent
at U-Haul would do the trick. That's how many of our parents
carried the family's luggage on summer trips when we all had those
big station wagons with the third seat.
</P>
<P>
   I remember a trip to North Carolina in my parents' '56 Ford
wagon once, with the luggage stacked on top of the car, covered by
a tarp. We hit a bump on some two-lane highway and my father
watched in dismay through the rearview mirror as a couple of the
suitcases fell off and went bouncing down the road. One of those
was mine, so I ended up having to share my two sisters' clothes for
the rest of the trip, but that's a whole other story.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, if you can overcome all of these little problems that
might crop up with an Explorer Sport Trac, then it just might be
the car/truck/SUV for you.
</P>
<P>
   Close your eyes while behind the wheel of the Sport Trac, and it
feels just like you're driving an Explorer, a vehicle that has
become very carlike over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Our test model came with a 4.0-liter V-6 engine that turns out a
respectable 205 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of torque. I don't
think I'd want to try to pull a large horse trailer or cabin
cruiser with that engine, but for most people it will have adequate
power.
</P>
<P>
   Ride comfort is truly car- or SUV-like; it really doesn't feel
as though you're riding in a pickup. The rear end doesn't bounce
all over the road when you hit a bump, for instance. The seats are
carlike, and so are the instrument panel and most of the other
interior components _ including the leather-covered front bucket
seats (part of the $1,495 leather comfort group) and Berber floor
mats. When's the last time you drove a pickup with Berber mats? I'm
not sure I would want to climb into this vehicle with muddy shoes
on, for fear of ruining those mats.
</P>
<P>
   Our test vehicle came with part-time four-wheel drive and a
five-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, both included in
the $25,270 base price (plus $575 destination). A limited-slip axle
option ($355) helped turn this nontruck into a capable off-road
performer, and the $195 cargo cage at the rear of the non-pickup
bed would be a good place to tie down the picnic cooler and camping
gear to keep it secure while bumping over rocks on your favorite
unpaved trail.
</P>
<P>
   And this vehicle is intended to be used that way. Ford says the
Sport Trac is designed for people in their 30s and 40s with active
lifestyles, who go skiing and off-roading in Colorado or
beach-running in Baja.
</P>
<P>
   There were lots of other amenities on our Sport Trac that might
not come on the average compact pickup, including 16-inch
cast-aluminum wheels (part of a $700 ``premium sport group'' that
also brought fog lights and all-terrain tires), a power moon roof
($800), power windows and door locks (and a power rear window,
too), roof rails, a locking tailgate, speed-sensitive intermittent
wipers, a composite cargo bed, electric remote outside mirrors,
AM/FM/six-disc CD audio system ($270), privacy glass, and both
interior and exterior tie-downs.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle can be operated in two-wheel-drive mode, or shifted
into four-wheel drive for off-road driving. There is a
four-wheel-drive low range for the transmission that allows the
vehicle to negotiate serious off-road hills.
</P>
<P>
   Four-wheel antilock brakes are standard, as are front air bags.
Side air bags for the front occupants are optional. Power
rack-and-pinion steering is standard.
</P>
<P>
   Maximum payload is 1,460 pounds (1,500 pounds with two-wheel
drive), and the vehicle is designed to tow a trailer of up to 5,040
pounds with four-wheel drive or 5,260 pounds with two-wheel drive.
Overall length is 205.9 inches, which is 17.4 inches longer than
the standard four-door Explorer. The wheelbase is a bit longer than
the four-door Explorer's, too _ 125.9 inches vs. 111.5 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Total sticker on our vehicle was $30,535, which is about what a
decently equipped regular Explorer costs. You can trim out some of
the extras and get a fairly well-equipped four-wheel-drive Sport
Trac for about $27,000, or a two-wheel-drive model for about
$25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is about average for an SUV in this class: 15 miles
per gallon in the city and 19 mpg on the highway. The Sport Trac
has a 20.5-gallon gasoline tank.

Thursday, May 25:
</P>
<P>
   BAHAMAS-OLDMONEY (Lyford Cay, Bahamas) _ Here on ``Lifeless
Cay,'' as many residents have called it, there are no stores, no
restaurants, no Manolo Blahniks. At least, not at the moment. Like
Southampton, N.Y., Greenwich, Conn., and most recently Palm Beach,
Fla., Lyford Cay is being invaded by the young and the feckless.
And almost nobody likes it. By Monique P. Yazigi.
</P>
<P>
   NY-ARTISTS-HOUSING (New York) _ Two original residents of
Westbeth _ the grand experiment in subsidized artists' housing that
opened in 1970 _ sat side by side on a wooden planter in front of
the entrance. One had a long graying beard and a brown fedora; the
other was missing some teeth and wore a fisherman's hat. Like them,
Westbeth is showing its age. The buildings look a little seedy: the
Corbusian curved balconies seem to be rusting away; the industrial
metal windows whistle; the inner courtyard is bleak. The fountain
on the outer courtyard has been cemented over. Yet on its 30th
anniversary, Westbeth is poised to reinvent itself. By Tracie
Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   MEIER-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ Richard Meier, the
world-renowned, Pritzker Prize-winning architect, is promoting his
glassy new condominium in Greenwich Village _ his first building in
Manhattan in 30 years. By Tracie Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Gardening questions answered. By Dora
Galitzki.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPEAN-PORCELAIN (New York) _ In a gesture that could be
interpreted as either the last straw for minimalism or an inspired
embrace of refined product design, several hundred pieces of
porcelain, conceived in the 18th century at the Nymphenburg factory
in Bavaria but still in production, were on display at Moss, the
SoHo store and purveyor of avant-garde modernism. By Julie V.
Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA-OUTDOORS (Vero Beach, Fla.) _ Windsor, a planned
community created here in 1989 by the husband-and-wife team of
Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk and Andres Duany, is meant to encourage
outdoor living. But unlike Celebration and Seaside, other Florida
planned communities where leisure time is spent on front porches
and stoops, Windsor is a place where outdoor time is lived out
back, in courtyards and on loggias, patios and verandas. By Martha
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTCHGARD (Undated) _ While experts argue the efficacy of
building America's space-based Strategic Defense Initiative, here
on earth one of the nation's most trusted defense systems will, by
the end of the year, be dismantled. Scotchgard, the soil retardant
and stain repellant spray manufactured by the the 3M Company of St.
Paul, Minnesota, is being ``phased out,'' the company announced on
May 16, because of environmental concerns about its
perfluorooctanyl chemistry. The same stuff that makes it easy to
lift a blob of chip dip off a carpet is, it turns out, harder to
get off the planet. Scotchgard does not decompose. By William L.
Hamilton.

HORN OF AFRICA WAR HAS DEEP ROOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The war between Ethiopia and Eritrea may seem like a just
another senseless waste of lives and resources in the agonized
history of the Horn of Africa, but this fight is not about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the characteristically acute antagonisms of
allies-turned-enemies, beyond the negligible value of the
blood-soaked ground, lie important issues of geography, economics,
and politics.
</P>
<P>
   The founders of the first post-Marxist government of Ethiopia
and of the first government of independent Eritrea were allies in
the struggle to topple the dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, who from
the late 1970s to the early 1990s ruled an Ethiopia that included
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   The Eritrean People's Liberation Front had been fighting since
1960; their comrades in Ethiopia's northern province of Tigray, the
Tigray People's Liberation Front, had been struggling for Tigrean
autonomy since 1974. They finally toppled Mengistu in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Mengistu fell, Meles Zenawi, the Tigrean leader, was
able to make himself not just boss of Tigray but president of
Ethiopia. One of his first major moves was to recognize the
independence of his Eritrean allies and end the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the struggle against Mengistu, Meles and Isaias
Afwerki, president-to-be of Eritrea, became friends, ``as close as
Churchill and Roosevelt in their feelings for each other,'' says
Robert I. Rotberg, of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
Consequently, ``they made the kind of promises that people make
when they are close.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigray insurgents and their comrades in Eritrea, many of
whom are ethnic Tigreans, committed Ethiopia and Eritrea to free
trade, a common currency, and the ideal of an integrated economy
for the region. So trusting of the relationship were the Tigreans
that they willingly gave up Ethiopia's access to the Red Sea. So
confident of the relationship were the Eritreans that they did not
worry about having their own currency or defining their new
borders.
</P>
<P>
   When they set the terms of the new state-to-state relations,
says James C. McCann, an Ethiopia specialist and director of
African studies at Boston University, they did not lay down a
realistic basis for the long-term relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war is not about a barren border area,'' he said, but
about frictions over tariffs, currencies, and access to the sea
that grew out of the poor initial agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethiopians began routing their shipping through Djibouti.
The Eritreans developed a separate foreign exchange policy. The
Ethiopians began insisting on hard currency. The Eritreans issued
their own currency and, provocatively, named it after Nak'fa, scene
of their climactic defeat of Ethiopia during the independence
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   McCann, who returned to the Boston area from Ethiopia last
weekend, said the naming of the currency was symbolic of a long
period in which the Eritreans disrespected the Ethiopians, and
ultimately underestimated them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eritreans bet that Ethiopia, which has scores of very
different linguistic and ethnic groups, was not a place, and would
fall apart rather than fight this war,'' McCann said. ``They
overplayed their hand and found themselves faced with a united,
determined, and powerful Ethiopia.''
</P>
<P>
   Some outside observers said Ethiopia will not try to add
substantially to its territory, but will attempt to destroy
Eritrea's capacity to threaten it militarily. They also said
Ethiopia would restore an outlet to the sea that cannot be readily
cut off by the Eritreans.
</P>
<P>
   McCann suggested Ethiopia could achieve this without annexing
Eritrean territory by orchestrating autonomy for the Afar, a Muslim
group that is dominant around the port of Assab. Bure, a border
town on the road to Assab, was a center of the fighting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the confusion in which the conflict is shrouded for
people outside the region surely is caused by the combatants

<TEXT>
<P>
   The makers of the nation's top-selling doll swelled with pride
this month when they unveiled the new, enlightened ``Barbie for
President 2000'' doll. What she lacked in anatomical correctness,
this Barbie would make up for in political correctness, waving a
Girls' Action Agenda aimed at empowering her young audience.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite her politics-as-usual plastic smile, she seemed
sincere in her message that you don't have to be a white person to
aspire to the White House. Mattel made ``Barbie for President'' in
three types: Caucasian, African-American, and Latin-American.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the Asian-American version?
</P>
<P>
   It was somehow eliminated, or perhaps never got on the drawing
board to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   This snub from Mattel Inc., the nation's largest toymaker, has
angered many Asian-Americans, who already feel overlooked in many
spheres of US life despite being the nation's third largest
minority.
</P>
<P>
   It has also triggered soul-searching within the Asian-American
community as to why there are so few Asian faces on doll store
shelves. Aside from exotic-looking collectibles, such as Barbie's
``Fantasy Goddess of Asia,'' Asian-American features are rare among
dolls, giving Asian-American girls few choices of dolls whose faces
and clothing styles resemble theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation's second largest toymaker, Hasbro, prepares
to market a major new doll that is available in different races _
but not Asian _ members of the Asian-American community are
wondering what they have to do to get attention, even in this small
world of dolls. They wonder, too, what effect it has on the
impressionable minds of Asian girls that they are portrayed in toy
stores as kimono-wearing foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's an omission, it reinforces the image that you
don't exist,'' said psychologist Jean Lau Chin, who practices near
Boston. ``Or, if you do exist, it's only exotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattel's reasons for offering other minority presidential dolls
but not an Asian apparently had little to do with the fact that the
11 million Asian-Americans (four percent of the US population) are
a smaller market than the 35 million African-Americans (13 percent)
and 32 million Hispanics (12 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, company officials said the decision had to do with the
impression that Asian girls don't care that much about a look-alike
Barbie. While offering no figures to support the claim, a Mattel
spokeswoman said Asian girls tend to choose white dolls instead of
Asian ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``That particular community has not expressed interest in a doll
that reflects their ethnicity,'' said spokeswoman, Julia Jensen.
</P>
<P>
   However, she acknowledged that the African-American and Hispanic
communities never lobbied for a Presidential Barbie in their
likenesses either, but Mattel chose to be ``pro-active'' about it.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the omission strikes many Asian-Americans as
callous to the girls in their community who adore Barbies as much
as other American girls. It's particularly galling, they said,
given that Mattel is based right outside Los Angeles, Calif., which
has one of the fastest-growing Asian populations, and many of the
dolls are made in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just such an outrage,'' said US Representative Patsy
Mink, a 72-year-old Hawaiian Democrat of Japanese descent. ``How
are these girls supposed to buy Asian dolls if there are none to
buy?''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Mink isn't just reacting out of ethnic
solidarity: She was actually the first Asian-American woman to run
for the US presidency. In 1972, Mink was on the Democratic ticket
in the Oregon primary.
</P>
<P>
   Some Asian-Americans worry this is another instance of Asians
being too politically passive, making it easy for institutions to
ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of a larger pattern in which Asian-Americans are
left out of the discussion,'' said Michael Liu, president of the
Boston-based Asian Pacific American Agenda Coalition, which
supports Asian-American political candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is somewhat ironic that Mattel should overlook
Asian-Americans, too, since the company has made more effort to be
inclusive in its selection of dolls than many companies. After
years of criticism that Barbie projected a dumb blonde stereotype,
Mattel has turned Barbie into an umbrella for a wide range of
backgrounds and aspirations, offering Barbie in a wheelchair and
basketball stars.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel also recently bought the Pleasant Company's popular
mail-order line of American Girl dolls, products that enable girls
of different races to create their own look-alike doll, though at a
hefty price tag of $80 or so. Barbies each cost roughly $10 to $15.
</P>
<P>
   Two major nonprofit groups dedicated to boosting girls'
self-esteem were asked by Mattel to assist in creating the
Presidential Barbie. The White House Project and Girls Inc., both
say they emphasized the importance of having blacks, Hispanics, and
Asians represented in the final product.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Wilson, the founder of ``Take Our Daughters to Work Day''
and head of the White House Project, said she understood that
Mattel was creating dolls representing each of the three large
minority groups. But just before production, she was told
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them if we still have all the races, and they said,
`We don't have Asian,' '' Wilson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said she was also told that the decision had to do with a
belief that Asian-American girls wanted Caucasian dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Some Asian-Americans don't doubt that many girls of Asian
descent gravitate toward Caucasian dolls, but it has to do with a
complicated mixture of media influence and product availability.
Just as some studies over the past several decades have shown a
majority of black children choose white dolls over black dolls,
other minority children face a barrage of advertising that suggests
white is beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Asian-American parents feel it's hard to test their
daughters' real preferences because there are so few Asian dolls to
pick from.
</P>
<P>
   In the Barbie world, Asian-looking dolls are confined to the
adult-oriented collector edition with an international focus or the
second-tier ``Friend of Barbie'' collection. Barbie has one Asian
``friend'' named Kira. While not heavily promoted, Kira has been a
hit among some Asian-American girls, such as 5-year-old AnnieJoy
Abbott of Dedham, Mass., who has five of them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more heavily marketed mainstream Barbies, said
Mattel's Jensen, ``Barbie has not been produced as an Asian.'' And
other toymakers don't appear poised to buck the trend. Hasbro hopes
to make a big splash this fall with the introduction of ``My Real
Baby,'' a doll with high levels of artificial intelligence. Again,
there's no Asian, though there's a Caucasian, African-American, and
Latin-American version.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the Asian omission, Hasbro spokeswoman Audrey
Basso said there simply aren't enough Asians to justify it.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond numbers, of course, there is the issue of political
clout, and Asian-Americans have been less aggressive in sensitizing
the consumer-product and entertainment industry to their needs than
Hispanics or African-American leaders, both of whom have pushed for
more representation in everything from TV characters to sports
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Chin adds that Asian women may also have an
emotionally charged reason to keep a particular distance from doll
issues. She said they have long tried to escape the shadow of the
pervasive ``China doll'' image here, suggesting Asian women are
simply delicate and docile romantic objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps there's some ambivalence about giving us more China
dolls,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Barbie tends to blur racial distinctions. The black
and Hispanic versions of Presidential Barbie look much like the
Caucasian version, except with different shades of tan, different
hair color, and barely detectable, facial feature changes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the most obvious racial markers _ like hair color or
skin color _ appear to matter to some Asian children. When Abbott,
a little girl adopted from China, was asked at a Dedham toy store
to look at three collector-style dolls of the same model that
represented Caucasian, African, and Asian looks, she went instantly
for the Asian one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this one because it has black hair,'' she said. ``It
looks like me.''

CATHOLIC SCHOLARS PUSH FOR ADVANCED STUDIES INSTITUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An elite group of Catholic scholars is proposing to form a
top-flight academic institute to strengthen the quality of Catholic
intellectual life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies, which may
be located in Boston, comes at a time of some turmoil for Catholic
scholars, who are divided over social policy issues and worried
about the Catholic hierarchy's attempt to assert more control over
the teaching of theology.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the institute have raised $13 million of the $60
million they say they will need to start the project, which would
offer one-year fellowships to scholars in subjects related to
Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   Among the members of its founding board are three leading
Catholic intellectuals from Massachusetts: the Rev. J. Bryan Hehir,
dean of Harvard Divinity School, Lisa S. Cahill, a theologian at
Boston College, and David J. O'Brien, a historian who heads the
Center for Religion, Ethics and Culture at the College of the Holy
Cross in Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a couple of Catholic universities really reach the level
of first-rate research, and even there, outside of theology, they
often are under pressure to do work that is indistinguishable from
that in the secular US,'' O'Brien said. ``This is something that
needs to be done for the future of Catholic intelligence in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Cahill said the institute would provide an opportunity for
scholars who don't ordinarily interact to work together. About 25
scholars would be fellows at the institute each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inspiration for this was the value of having a place for
Catholic scholarship to proceed in an interdisciplinary way,
without any particular ideological bias, and outside the control of
any particular institution,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The institute is the brainchild of the Rev. James L. Heft,
chancellor of the University of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we have many Catholics with PhDs, but we don't have many
Catholic intellectuals, Catholics who in their bones, whatever
their discipline may be, instinctively draw on their faith
tradition to raise ethical and theological questions,'' Heft said.
``Scholarship in the Catholic intellectual tradition reinforces
that instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute would not be a university, because it will not
grant degrees, and it will not be a think tank in that it will not
promote policies. The institute would be loosely modeled after
secular programs such as the Woodrow Wilson International Center
for Scholars in Washington and the Institute for Advanced Studies
in Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   The institute would not be governed by church hierarchy, and its
scholars would apparently be exempt from any requirement for church
approval of theological teachings because they would not be
teaching students. But the institute is seeking support from the
hierarchy, and its supporters included the late Cardinal John
O'Connor of New York and his successor, Archbishop-elect Edward
Egan, as well as the archbishops of Malines-Brussels, Cincinnati
and Los Angeles and the bishop of Oakland and the current or former
presidents of Catholic, Georgetown, Notre Dame, and Sacred Heart
universities and Carroll and Williams colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have won a $10 million grant from a European
foundation and are attempting to double that by Christmas. They
have run into some roadblocks raising money because, although
Catholics are increasingly affluent, there are numerous Catholic
academic, religious and social service programs seeking money.
</P>
<P>
   ``A problem that we have faced from the beginning is that, while
there are donors interested in Catholic issues, they tend to be
more attuned to practical needs, such as working with the poor, and
Catholic missionary endeavors,'' Cahill said. ``There is an
important connection between academic life and the practical life,
but it's not as immediately engaging for some donors.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute would most likely be located in one of five
regions, chosen largely for the quality of their research libraries
and for their attractiveness to academics: Boston, Chicago,
Princeton, San Francisco and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not in opposition to Catholic colleges and
universities, nor is it a critique of what they're about,'' said
Hehir. ``The possibility is to be able to have the time and space
and a limited but very carefully chosen team put together to try
and illustrate the significance and relevance of the Catholic
vision to the rest of humanistic and secular knowledge.''

WHAT SOX CALL `PARTNERSHIP' SOUNDS MORE LIKE WELFARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The only change in the official proposal by the Red Sox
for a new Fenway Park is that they want far more public money than
before.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the project was supposed to cost $550 million, with
the team covering $350 million. Now the Red Sox say the baseball
park will cost $627 million. The team will still cover only $352
million. The public portion has risen from a speculated $200
million to a confirmed $275 million.
</P>
<P>
   The $627 million would be the most costly single sports stadium
project in the history of the United States. The Sox are bragging
and moaning in the same breath that it is the largest
``investment'' by a team. What they do not want the public to dwell
on is that the $275 million from the public is alone more than the
cost of 10 of the 15 baseball stadiums built in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   This is depravity. No way should Fenway be built this way.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of their turpitude, the Red Sox brass came to the
Globe Friday to explain why some millionaire ballplayers, a wealthy
family trust, and rich limited partners deserve $275 million of
welfare. Red Sox CEO John Harrington, General Manager Dan Duquette,
and their hit men in dark suits tried to pawn themselves off as
Brooks Brothers businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly blubbered into a Blues Brothers self-absorption.
Their display charts, which looked pretty but said nothing, only
made them seem ever more the infant wailing for milk, the teenager
asking for new rollerblades after totaling the car, or the college
student begging for cash after smoking up the credit card. In
pining for a stadium, they acted as if they were as broke as
residents of the Pine Street Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing that several members of the Globe were underwhelmed with
this lame presentation, Sox officials emitted a stream of alarms:
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is of the essence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is coming in on us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We really do not have the option of the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last site available to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Status quo is not one of the options we have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last site.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Status quo is not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer we wait, the farther we fall behind in our
competiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're maxed out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We only broke even.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The players expect a modern facility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the gateway to Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a new ballpark to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The alarmist stategy is utterly status quo. The Sox are just
another team in America that is making an extraordinary call for
public money with the least public participation, trying to ramrod
a stadium through the Legislature and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino
before the summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $275 million, $135 million would come from the state and
$140 million would come from Boston. The state would build parking
garages for $82 million. Garages could be fine, assuming the state
controls enough parking revenue to pay itself back. More dubious is
the $53 million in state road and transit improvements and in
utilities. It is unclear whether improvements would benefit
residents on a daily basis, such as a nicer subway stop, or which
ones the Sox ought to pay for themselves as the sole beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   Far more insidious is Boston's $140 million. As it is now, it
would be a gift. The team would have no obligation to pay a penny
back to the city. The city would spend the $140 million to buy land
from private landowners, clean it up, prepare it, and then hand it
over to the Sox for the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox project $45 million a year in new revenues from a
new ballpark. The team's market value would skyrocket. Local
taxpayers would be left with at least $13 million in annual debt.
They and tourists would face more taxes to benefit the Sox while
Boston's after-school programs reach only half of its eligible
students and officials voted to cut $1 million from bilingual
education. Bilingual education these days is to help the Sox pay
Pedro Martinez so the Globe can keep running Martinez game stories
in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox hope we are all illiterate. The Sox say they will
``privately'' fund $352 million, but much of their private sources
for money are the fans who buy tickets and use the parking and
concessions. The Sox call this a public-private ``partnership.'' It
is a lie. Subtract the money from luxury suites, broadcast rights,
naming rights, and advertising, and it becomes clear that the team
wants a stadium with relatively no hard cash of its own.
</P>
<P>
   True partners share the risks and rewards. The Sox want $140
million a year to make $45 million more a year, while Boston goes
in the hole $13 million a year at a time when huge percentages of
its children are failing standardized tests. That is not a
partnership. That is depravity.

   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Just to stay in business, Chuba Egolum must
cope with daily annoyances most Americans would confront only
during a natural catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, people who know Nigeria like to sum things up with a
joke: ``What's the difference between Nigeria and a disaster
area?''
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``In a disaster area, the Red Cross will come to help
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Egolum isn't laughing. His time in the United States _ including
three years obtaining an MBA in Atlanta _ taught him to appreciate
basic things longed for in a place like Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I have to deal with whether I'm going to have
electricity,'' he says, sitting at his desk in a striped golf shirt
and tan Dockers trousers. His company drills wells and builds water
distribution systems. ``I have to make sure to pump enough water
into the tank on top of the building so we will be able to flush
the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic in this immense swirling city is impassable at most
hours. ``It is bedeviling,'' Egolum says. ``When I pick up the
phone, most often it is dead,'' he says. ``This is what it is to do
business in Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite it all, Egolum is hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in nearly two decades, Nigeria has a civilian
government. Africa's most populous nation, with 123 million people,
now can carry on without the crushing weight of the corrupt
military regimes that have saddled it for most of its 40 years of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   While the end of military rule is universally praised, a year of
living democratically has been sobering, even disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is a new experience for us,'' says Egolum, who still
considers genuine representative government a distant destination _
a Promised r that too much may be riding on the powers of one man:
President Olusegan Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday(5/29), Obasanjo will celebrate the anniversary of his
inauguration as Nigeria's first civilian leader since 1983. A man
who counts among his friends Bill Clinton and former President
Jimmy Carter, Obasanjo, 63, is regarded widely as an honest,
intelligent and dedicated leader. Among his credentials is a period
as chairman of Transparency International, a Berlin-based
organization that promotes honest government.
</P>
<P>
   And by most measures, Obasanjo, a former general who ruled
between 1976 and 1979 before handing power to a doomed civilian
government, has made an auspicious start. He summarily retired from
government crooked military officers, pushed an ethics agenda and
has labored to repair the country's dreadful reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the problems confronting Obasanjo and Nigeria remain both
broad and deep, a perilous combination in a country whose people
have high expectations and little patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigerians are about getting Nigeria fixed,'' said John Muibi
Amoda, the head of the pro-democracy Africa Peace Support
Initiative. Yet, Amoda cautions that people expect too much and
understand too little. ``Just because you have an internationally
monitored so-called democratic election doesn't mean that you have
a democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While reformers demand that Obasanjo do more, the robber barons
who dominated for so long are working to obstruct him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is walking a tightrope with people at both ends
shaking the rope,'' Amoda said.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders are aware of the president's plight but are
eager for him to succeed because they believe Africa's future may
depend heavily on the success of a healthy and democratic Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration identified Nigeria as one of four
''key democracies'' along with Colombia, Indonesia and Ukraine. It
ended the country's pariah status, and is seeking $100 million in
aid. In January, the administration said it would end its ban on
direct flights from the United States to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Obasanjo has pledged to deploy his disused but
still potent military to help bring stability to west Africa. He
offered to send peacekeepers to Sierra Leone, so long as Nigeria
receives foreign support _ particularly from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also has responded favorably, if vaguely, to
Obasanjo's anxious pleas for relief from the country's estimated
$35 billion in international debt, which consumes more than a third
of Nigeria's federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   American policymakers take particular note of Obasanjo's
ambitions of doubling Nigeria's oil output to 4 million barrels a
day. The country already produces about twice as much crude oil as
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Obasanjo embraces the free market and has embarked
on a drive to privatize major industries.
</P>
<P>
   And while Obasanjo's momentum has been stalled by an assertive
Legislature _ which will be a year old in June _ many observers
believe the government is at least learning the deliberative,
power-sharing process.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Nigeria was poised to assume the role of an
African superpower. Today it is a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   For 17 years this vast country _ which is about the size of
Texas, Georgia and Florida combined _ was ravaged by military
juntas that wrecked the economy, impoverished the people and
depleted the national treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of neglect are everywhere. In the primary city Lagos,
skyscrapers stand with broken windows and weedy sidewalks like the
ruins of some flourishing but bygone metropolis. Without reliable
electricity, elevators rarely run in the buildings made stifling by
the lack of air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the commerce in this sprawling urban jumble of 11
million is what economists call ``informal,'' meaning individuals
and small businesses hawk whatever they can for whatever they can
get. In many ways, Nigeria is a nation of hardy and hard-bitten
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   In today's world of e-commerce and automated everything, Nigeria
seems primitive. Banks don't issue credit cards and, with the
exception of the two or three hotels that specialize in fleecing
foreigners, no one accepts them. There are no automated teller
machines and, perhaps most startling, no McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is a constant companion. Hotel doormen panic when foreign
guests suggest taking a stroll. For a fee, heavily armed soldiers
at the airport will stand guard over newly arrived visitors and
their bags until a taxi or friend comes to gather them up.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking any public transport and little traffic enforcement,
roads in Lagos are choked in a hopeless, chaotic gridlock _ known
here as ``slow-go.'' To keep things moving, whip-bearing policeman
apprehend laggardly drivers and administer lashes on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   And even with its vast oil resources, Nigeria must import
gasoline, creating frequent shortages and a thriving black market.
Without the luxury of being able to worry about the environment,
the air has become brown with dust and pollution and roadsides are
covered with layers of litter. Much of the country's hardwood
forests are gone and the oil-rich Niger Delta is a disaster in the
view of many environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to get the impression that nothing works.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians blame the mess on the run of dictators who were inept,
dishonest or both. Over the past two decades, Nigeria developed the
reputation of being perhaps the world's most corrupt country. (In
1998, Transparency International rated Nigeria No. 2 among corrupt
countries,
</P>
<P>
   trailing only neighboring Cameroon.)
</P>
<P>
   To many outsiders, it often seemed as if the entire nation was
on the take. From passport officers to traffic cops, just about any
problem could be resolved with a ``dash'' _ a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian leaders now consider regaining credibility paramount.
``If there is one single thing that has retarded economic
development, it is the issue of corruption,'' said Farouk Lawan,
the chairman of the ethics committee of the Nigerian House of
Representatives. ``We are talking about a situation where the
previous head of state looted vast amounts of money and stifled
</P>
<P>
   the entire economic system of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Sani Abacha, who ruled from 1993 until he died in office in
1998, is accused of personally stealing more than $4 billion. With
the asanjo announced that Nigeria was had caught up with $1.5
billion in back payments to the government's private partners in
oil joint ventures, including Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon-Mobil and
Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, economists worry that a recovery may be impossible
given the poor state of the nation's infrastructure, particularly
the power grid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidence in the Nigerian economy cannot be restored
until these basic infrastructure needs are met,'' said Chike
Uchime, the editor of the Nigerian magazine Business &AMP; Finance
Digest. Additionally, the country needs to diversify its economy,
he said. Nearly 90 percent of the country's export revenues and
virtually all its tax income comes from oil.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest internal threat is the continued strife
between Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The flashpoint has been the attempt by leaders in the heavily
Muslim northern states to impose Sharia, conservative Islamic law.
Since February the conflict has claimed thousands of lives in
brutal clashes with machetes the weapon of choice. Obasanjo has
been criticized for reacting too slowly and indecisively.
Politicians from both religions express concerns that
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria will disintegrate if Obasanjo cannot gain control of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With all the problems, most people seem to believe that the
change toward democracy is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   On a particularly hot day recently, T. Bimbo Akande sought
refuge in the breeze made by a fan in his office on the 18th floor
in one of the weary old skyscrapers that haunt downtown Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   Akande believes his import-export business will improve only if
Obasanjo can win the trust of foreign investors. He's skeptical but
modestly hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   However, Akande counts his loss to the years of chaos in
personal terms. In November, his 21-year-old son Dapo Akande came
home in the evening to a dark house. As usual, the power was out,
so he cranked up the diesel-powered generator. It burst flames that
engulfed the young man.
</P>
<P>
   Akande found his son and rushed him to the poorly equipped and
scantily staffed hospital. Four days later, he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my loss to the conditions in Nigeria,'' Akande said.
``He was a huge investment for me that I will never be able to
recover. How many souls have been wasted just this way?''
</P>
<P>
   Akande, whose brother lives in the suburban Atlanta community of
Powder Springs, expressed deep frustration at the wasted potential
_ both in his son and his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've traveled around the world and I know what this country
has to offer, what its people are capable of,'' he said. ``With
good leadership. We should be among the first in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all too obvious, isn't it. There's no going back from
democracy.''

   History: First inhabted in about 500 B.C, but Nok people; many
tribes followed. Islam was introduced in the 13th century. The
British annexed Lagos in 1851 and seized control of the rest of the
region by 1886. Britain created Nigeria and made it a colony in
1914. Nigeria gained independence in 1960. Rioting broke out in
1966, and military leaders seized control. In July, a second
military coup put Col. Yakubu Gowon in power. Also in that year,
Muslim Hausas in the north massacred Christian Ibos in the east,
many of whom had been driven from the north. Thousands of Ibos took
refuge in the eastern region, which declared its independence as
Biafra in 1967. In 1970, Biafra surrendered to the fede in 1976 and
in 1979 handed control to civilian government of Alhaji Shehu
Shagari. An oil boom in the 1970s buoyed the economy, and by the
1980s Nigeria was considered an exemplary of African democracy. In
1984, the military seized power, only to be followed by a coup in
1985. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida said the country would be returned to
civilian rule, but in 1993 he voided the results of election and
Babangida resigned. In November 1993, Gen. Sani Abacha led a coup
to restore military rule. Abacha's regime was condemned for
corruption and inefficiency as well as a harshly repressive
methods. Abacha's rule turned Nigeria into an international pariah.
The hanging of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa in 1995 was condemned around
the world. Abacha died of a heart attack in June 1998, and was
succeeded by another military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar. He
pledged to step aside for an elected leader by May 1999. In
February 1999, Obasanjo won an overwhelming victory. He was
inaugurated May 29, 1999.

<P>
   It is small and light, but since 1935 the Social Security card
owned by every American voter has been a blunt instrument, the
weapon of choice wielded by Democrats against Republicans. So it is
in the contest between Al Gore and George W. Bush, but this year
the weightiest factors may not be actuarial tables or market
projections, but tone, emphasis, and body language.
</P>
<P>
   Character will count more than 16-point programs in this, the
longest general presidential election in American history. (Not so
long ago, parties chose nominees in June, July, or August.)
</P>
<P>
   Although their strategies sometimes obscure their qualities,
both candidates are competent and likable. How they react to each
other will answer a question undecided voters will ask: What sort
of guy is he?
</P>
<P>
   Since wrapping up the Republican nomination in March, Bush has
been gliding toward the center the way some critics contend he
glided through life: short on specifics, long on charm.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who had a relatively easy time winning the Democratic
nomination, does not glide, but screeches full throttle into
endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   Gore resembles Eddie Mayehoff, a character actor who worked in
movies with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Mayehoff was a football
coach or an Army sergeant, whose rules were relentless: Hit 'em
hard, hit 'em low, and if they get up, hit 'em again.
</P>
<P>
   This is Bush's first national campaign, but Gore's fourth, after
his own run in 1988 and two with President Clinton. The vice
president has learned the rapid-response lesson of the 1992
Clinton-Gore campaign. His campaign's ``war room'' is on full 24-7
alert. Rapid-response intensity can alienate some voters when it
sounds ``partisan,'' a word that became pejorative when a
Republican Congress tried to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's intensity can convert an adjective into a heat-seeking
missile. Bush wants a tax cut? ``Risky.'' School vouchers?
``Risky.'' Changing Social Security? ``Risky.'' In the debate over
privatizing part of Social Security, Gore can exploit the two
emotions that rule Wall Street: greed and fear. But he is also
stuck with an old Democratic theme: trust the government.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, voters equate risk-taking with leadership. Bush made
his Social Security speech in the southern California district
represented by Jim Brulte, the state Senate Republican floor
leader, who endorsed Bush after a trip to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a candidate I'm proud of because he's willing to use
his political capital to help fix a program that every one of us
knows is broken, every one of us! It's the big elephant in the room
no one wants to talk about,'' Brulte says. ``Bush didn't have to
raise the issue, but that's what he did in Texas on schools and tax
reform. He had a huge approval rating, but what's the point of
being in a position to make things happen if you're not willing to
spend political capital?''
</P>
<P>
   Brulte's question brings to mind the political reality that a
vice president has no capital to spend. A veep's assets are bundled
with those of his one-man constituency, the fellow in the Oval
Office. Being vice president also means inheriting the party
machinery. Martin Van Buren, Richard Nixon, Hubert Humphrey, and
George Bush did so, but only Van Buren in 1836 and Bush in 1988
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   For victory, a vice president needs a popular president like
Andrew Jackson or Ronald Reagan, but Dwight Eisenhower's popularity
wasn't enough for Nixon in his 1960 race against a young,
inexperienced opponent whose ideas were considered ``risky.''
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy won that election by promising ``to get this
country moving again'' and by standing against the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   If today's status quo declines economically, so does Gore. If
his assets become liabilities, he has no role model in taking
sensible risks in Clinton. Also the code of the vice presidency
forbids risk. Gore is, in effect, still risking his future on the
other fellow's riskiness.

<P>
   On Tuesday, Alan Dershowitz scored a four-fer.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of one day, the ubiquitous Harvard Law School prof
appeared on NBC's ``Today'' show, on MSNBC, on ``Larry King Live''
and Chris Matthews's ``Hardball,'' holding forth on an Arkansas
disciplinary committee's decision to strip President Clinton of his
law license. Thanks to modern technology, he did all this without
leaving his chair _ a chair sitting inside a rehabbed steam car
factory on a back street in the Boston suburb of Watertown. Called
VideoLink, it's a television studio that is Ground Zero for the
Boston Commentariat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best hangout in town,'' says Dershowitz, VideoLink's
unofficial First Citizen. ``It's better than any bar in Harvard
Square. Where else can you bump into Doris Kearns Goodwin, Bob
Reich, and Alan Simpson all on the same day?'' In fact, the Dersh
did bump into Goodwin at VideoLink on Tuesday; he was taping a 7
a.m. ``Today'' appearance, while she was on at 8.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz loves the Link. During last year's impeachment
crisis, he taped as many as five television appearances a day from
Watertown, all in one sitting. ``My only fear is that some day it
will lift up into the clouds and disappear, because of all the hot
air pumped in by the Cambridge intelligentsia.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfectly situated between Cambridge and the affluent western
suburbs, VideoLink is the venue of choice for the Harvard
professorate and the suburban intelligentsia. (Both Goodwin and
Dershowitz have timed their home-to-VideoLink commutes. Hers is 26
minutes. His is 6.) Have you ever seen a talking head opining from
Boston with that harbor skyline behind them? That fakey view of
Rowes Wharf, which could have been photographed only from a
helicopter or from the Logan airport control tower, is probably the
most-seen Hub landmark since 50 million TV fans ogled the
``Cheers'' awning back in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Dershowitz practically lives here,'' jokes VideoLink
manager Andrew Kelley. And Kelley's staffers take pains to make the
studio a second home for the Dersh. Upon arrival, he is served his
beverage of choice (chamomile tea), and his beloved York mints
await in the green room, where make-up is applied. Like Goodwin and
fellow heavy user John Kerry, the Dersh even rates his own
custom-fitted audio earpiece. VideoLink keeps copies of
Dershowitz's books on hand, for convenient on-air brandishing.
``They provide everything,'' says the longtime law prof. ``With
them, all I have to bring is my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Such creature comforts breed near-fanatical loyalty. Goodwin
says she doesn't travel any more to do television. ``I've been in
studios all over the world, and they are by far the best,''
Dershowitz says. ``When CNN opened up their new studio in
Brookline, I told them to forget about it. The only place I'm going
is VideoLink.''
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of broadcast entrepreneurs Doug Weisman and Dean
Gaskill, VideoLink's business took off in 1997, during the Louise
Woodward ``killer nanny'' trial. ``Everybody had to get talking
heads from Boston,'' says manager Kelley. ``And we could deliver
them.'' ABC, NBC, PBS, CNN, and Fox News all conduct interviews out
of VideoLink, with the likes of Anthony Lewis, Republican
consultant Charley Manning, and Democratic commentator Mary Anne
Marsh, at the rate of eight to 10 a day. In the summer, Geraldo
Rivera motors up from Marion in his black Rolls Royce and
broadcasts his nightly talk show. . . live from Watertown!

   VideoLink offers convenience and economy; a half-hour in their
studio costs about $1,000, less than half the price of a rented
satellite truck. But just as important, it is a luxury motel for
the 24/7 gasbags. For the Stahkhanovites of the Ready-Opine-Think
business, no detail is spared. Dershowitz gets his tea and mints;
Goodwin gets Altoids and Diet Coke _ and her favorite make-up
artist, when available.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, Kelley's staffers place fresh flowers in the green
room, and make happy talk to distract guests if someone else is
eating into their airtime. The fresh coffee comes from Starbucks;
the fresh muffins from nearby Lilly's bakery. Hubby got the car?
VideoLink will pick you up.
</P>
<P>
   Last week at VideoLink, Goodwin logged her own four-fer _ one
PBS, one NBC, and two MSNBC appearances. Although she was taping
her comments on a sunny afternoon, viewers would see her in the
evening. Kelley and the New York producers thought about sliding
the ``Boston by Night'' panel in behind her. In the end, they opted
for ``dusk,'' which worked fine. (VideoLink also has separate
background panels of fake law books and medical tomes, to lend
gravitas to lawyer and doctor guests.)
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for her close-up, Goodwin banters with make-up artist
Phoebe Rambler. They are pals. Rambler has heard Goodwin's son's
rock band play at a club. Goodwin has shared her primo Red Sox
tickets with VideoLink staffers. Rambler will monitor Goodwin
throughout her broadcasts _ three before dinner, and one after _
brushing up her lips, or adusting the part of her hair when needed.
</P>
<P>
   On the set, Goodwin winds up her group discussion with Michael
Beschloss and Haynes Johnson on Social Security for the PBS
NewsHour, and then plunges into her notes. No one disturbs her.
After a few moments, Goodwin looks up and asks, ``Have we switched
over yet?'' From the control room, Kelley tells her that NBC's
``Nightly News'' is running late. Also, for the next shoot, could
she please turn her head slightly to the left? On screen, this will
look as if she is actually being interviewed by Andrea Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, an NBC producer comes on the line to conduct the
interview about the media's coverage of political sex scandals.
This is real TV, not PBS. Without prompting, Goodwin cuts her
answers from 40 seconds down to 20 seconds, and punctuates each
insight with a radiant smile. With time running out, an MSNBC
producer slips in a few questions about ``Clinton Nostalgia'' for a
10-minute long ``in-depth'' segement with anchor Brian Williams.
</P>
<P>
   In the control room, Kelley makes sure NBC liberates Goodwin by
5:30. She will make her downtown speaking engagement, and then
re-appear in Watertown one more time before going home. ``These
people are great,'' Goodwin enthuses as Kelley escorts her to her
waiting car. ``They are like family to me.''

UNITED ANNOUNCES PURCHASE OF US AIRWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN and DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The world's largest airline, United, officially
announced Wednesday that it had agreed to acquire the biggest
carrier in the northeast United States, US Airways, for $4.3
billion in cash. The deal would create a carrier with by far the
largest share of passengers from Boston to New York to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clearly a lot of hurdles in front of us, but we
anticipate this transaction can be completed in the first quarter
of 2001,'' James Goodwin, the chairman and chief executive of UAL
Corp., the parent of United, said Wednesday at a news conference in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ``creates the first truly efficient nationwide network
in this country,'' Goodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Wolf, chairman of US Airways Group, immediately tried to
allay fears that US Airways employees might harbor about the
buyout, saying that ``our employees will have the opportunity to
participate in an unparalleled venture in aviation history.''
</P>
<P>
   If the acquisition is approved by shareholders and government
regulators, United will carry almost 500,000 passengers a day, have
hubs in nine U.S. cities from Philadelphia to San Francisco and
employ 145,000 people. The acquisition represents the first merger
of two large U.S. airlines since a wave of consolidation in the
1980s, and analysts said United's new strength could force other
airlines to consider deals.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to exude confidence, both Goodwin and Wolf spoke while
standing near model airplanes representing their companies.
</P>
<P>
   UAL Corp. officials said on Tuesday that the combination would
allow millions of travelers in the Northeast _ long the company's
weak spot in the United States _ _ to tap into its vast network of
flights to the Midwest and West Coast and, on partner airlines, to
Europe and Asia. The company also pledged not to raise fares on
some domestic routes for at least two years except for price
increases needed to cover inflation and higher fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, UAL Corp. said it intended to shed many of US
Airways' routes at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington
and sell them to Robert L. Johnson, a member of the US Airways
board and the founder of Black Entertainment Television. Johnson
plans to operate a new airline with those planes, employees and
routes. But it will not include US Airways' lucrative shuttle
service between Washington, New York and Boston, which United would
continue to operate.
</P>
<P>
   The step is intended to satisfy regulators who might become
concerned about market concentration in the Washington area, where
United is the largest carrier at Washington Dulles International
Airport and US Airways is in a similar position at Reagan Airport.

CRUISE TAKES `M:I-2'' A LITTLE TOO SERIOUSLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   M:I-2 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by: John Woo &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Screenplay by: Robert Towne &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Tom Cruise, Dougray Scott, Thandie Newton, Richgard
Roxburgh, John Polson, Brendan Gleeson, Rade Sherbedghia, Ving
Rhames &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 124 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rated: PG-13 (violent action and some sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cruise is Hollywood's clenched fist. He's an overwound kind
of guy _ tight, serious, intense. In ``M:I-2,'' Cruise's ``Mission
Impossible'' sequel, he hangs by his fingernails from a rock face,
rides a motorcycle through a wall of fire, parachutes off a
skyscraper, and drops from a cable into a biotech sanctum to keep a
deadly new virus out of a terrorist's grip. Egged on by
transplanted Hong Kong actionmeister John Woo, who eggs with the
best of them, Cruise takes a licking and keeps on ticking until he
turns ``M:I-2'' into a triumph of over-the-topness that figures to
demolish the competition for a few weeks. Still, high-powered as it
is, it's more driven and silly than giddy and exuberant.
</P>
<P>
   The action is just as preposterous as it was the first time
around. Understandably, ``M:I-2'' forgets about logic for long
stretches at a time. All you have to keep in mind about the plot is
that if you're injected with the red stuff, you die in 20 hours. If
you're injected with the green stuff, you live. Handy color-coding
for a stop-go plot tooling around Sydney and surrounding patches of
Australia. But what really counts are the set pieces, starting when
a guy who looks like Cruise rips off a latex mask and is revealed
to be the bad guy in disguise. Woo overdoes the mask bit, a habit
he apparently got into after directing ``Face/Off.''
</P>
<P>
   e But what am I saying? Overdoing it is meat and drink to this
film, as nothing else is. When Cruise's superspy meets up with
Thandie Newton, as a larcenous love interest whose thieving
abilities he needs, they enjoy the automotive equivalent of rough
sex as they play bumper cars on a narrow road hugging the side of a
cliff. Woo ups the ante by having Cruise's Ethan Hunt clash more
than once with Dougray Scott's heavy, a renegade agent turned
big-time biothief and global shakedown artist. There are of course
the usual car chases and shootouts, with Woo making copious use of
slo-mo as this or that body hurtles through the air, gun in each
hand, blazing away.
</P>
<P>
   The slo-mo, once original and even flecked with a certain visual
poetry, is starting to look old, and there's nothing quite as
spectacular here as the sight of Cruise clinging to the top of a
train in the first ``Mission Impossible.'' Not that anybody is
going to complain of somnolence here. Still, hard-driving and
propulsive as it is, the film is unable to hide the fact that Woo
seems not only to be repeating himself, but parodying his earlier
films on a much bigger scale, more crudely and coarsely. You're as
likely to laugh at ``M:I-2'' as with it, especially if you know
Woo's earlier films.
</P>
<P>
   When we see a doorway framed in flames, we know Tom Terrific
will soon be framed by it, too. At a certain point during one
shootout, one of Woo's signature white doves flies out of an
alcove, providing as much ironic comment as this film is interested
in providing. After a motorcycle joust, Cruise's white knight and
Scott's dark one square off on a beach, where they provide a
scientific demonstration of the number of times a star can get
kicked in the head without loss of speed, much less function. Or
teeth. Still, ``M:I-2'' does have a certain integrity. At least it
doesn't insist that Cruise's character and Newton's are supposed to
have anything like real feelings for one another.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness of ``M:I-2'' is that it's too humorless to embrace
its preposterousness. On the surface, it has a certain James Bond
quality. But Bond would have winked at a lot of the stuff that just
makes Cruise set his jaw more firmly here. Scott holds the screen
ably against Cruise, considering that we know at the start that
he's going to lose. Anthony Hopkins puts in only the most
perfunctory appearance as Cruise's boss, although he has the film's
best line when Cruise momentarily balks. Under the circumstances,
Newton does a game job of projecting naughtiness and vulnerability.
``M:I-2'' has all the fireballs, forward motion, latex masks, and
views of Sydney harbor you could hope for. There's not much there,
but with what there is, the film hits hard. At heart, it's a huge
comic strip. But nobody seems to have reminded Cruise of this.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Maury Bromsen, 81-year-old Boston manuscript dealer,
bibliographer, and collector of Latin American materials, is
showing a visitor a few of the treasures in his living room. There
is the French cello made in 1743, with a carved head of a plumed
cavalier, created for Louis XV, still bearing the original label;
the late-17th-century refectory table used in a monastery,
perfectly preserved; the elegant bust of the Marquis de Lafayette,
circa 1790.
</P>
<P>
   His voice swells with pride with every item he points out. But
then comes the real prize. He retrieves a leather-bound volume from
a back room, bearing it toward a visitor like a gem on a velvet
pillow. It is his humble junior high school autograph book. He
turns to the ``Your Favorites'' section. Whom did the 13-year-old
Bromsen list as his ``favorite hero'' back in 1932? Babe Ruth,
perhaps? George Washington?
</P>
<P>
   How about Simon Bolivar?
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century revolutionary leader in the struggle for South
American independence was hardly an obvious choice for a
13-year-old Jewish kid from New York City who'd traveled no farther
than Long Island. What makes it even more unusual is that his
reverence for Bolivar lasted a lifetime. Bromsen went on to amass
this country's largest and most significant collection of original
Bolivar-related art, manuscripts, and iconographic materials.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Bromsen officially parted with his beloved collection
of ``Bolivariana,'' valued, he says, at ``several millions of
dollars,'' donating it to the John Carter Brown Library at Brown
University. The library is devoted to the preservation of
historical materials related to the Americas, and the collection is
now lodged in its newly inaugurated Maury A. Bromsen-Simon Bolivar
Room.
</P>
<P>
   It includes not only paintings of Bolivar but the document
Bromsen calls ``the crown jewel of my collection.'' Dating to 1825
and signed by Bolivar, it announced the appointment of Antonio Jose
de Sucre as Grand Marshal of Ayacucho. Sucre commanded the
revolutionary army in the final battle of the war for independence
in Spanish America; Ayacucho, in Peru, was the site of this
decisive battle.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of such a document might be lost on the average
American, but never Bolivar groupie Bromsen. The battle of
Ayacucho, he says emphatically, ``is like Waterloo. It's like the
last battle of Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   He bought the document in 1963 directly from a descendant of
Sucre, in Quito, Ecuador. The price? ``I won't tell you,'' he says
immediately. ``But everybody wants it. In fact, the former
president of Venezuela asked me if I'd give him the document and
said he would send for me in an airplane and bring me to address
Congress, and give me the Order of Simon Bolivar, in the first
degree.'' He smiles triumphantly. ``I didn't fall for it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `80 percent joy'
</P>
<P>
   Bromsen, a compact man, says he feels ``80 percent joy'' at his
decision to relinquish his collection to Brown. ``It's 80 percent
because I know it is safe, it has purpose, and since I didn't need
the money, I didn't have to sell it,'' he says. ``I wanted to keep
it together.''
</P>
<P>
   But then there is the other 20 percent, the part that is
``sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been ``de-Bolivarized,'' Bromsen says glumly, who is
meticulously dressed one recent afternoon in a dark suit and
golden-yellow tie with a matching silk pocket handkerchief. He
gestures at the walls of his elegant living room. (Decorated, he
indicates, with authentic hand-embroidered 18th-century curtains
that once hung at the estate of a French nobleman.) The apartment
is one of three suites Bromsen occupies in downtown Boston to house
his prodigious antiquarian collection and book inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sadness,'' he says, ``is when I look on my walls, I have
no more Bolivar.'' No more prized oil portrait of Bolivar painted
``anonymously in Lima in 1822 or early 1823,'' the ever-precise
Bromsen points out. No more Bolivar miniatures, including one
painted on ivory in Haiti in 1816 by renowned native artist
Jacques-Marie Legros. No more pencil drawing by Jose Maria Espinosa
made in Bogota in 1830.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the paintings were expeditiously replaced by others
in his collection, including his Gilbert Stuart portrait of
Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry and his painting of St. Cecilia by
Rembrandt Peale.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bolivar will remain forever in his heart, if not his
apartment and vault. What, a visitor inquires, drew him to Simon
Bolivar in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   Bromsen seems literally taken aback by the question. He winces
in his chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you got someone better to collect?' he wants to know. ``I
wanted a titanic, challenging subject and the greatest figure of
Latin America was Bolivar.''
</P>
<P>
   He enumerates his hero's numerous attributes. He was a man of
ideas as well as action. He believed in legal equality for
everyone, despite being a man of great wealth, and he freed his own
slaves in 1821. He dreamed of the freedom of America from Spanish
control, and of social and economic reform. He was a brave and
daring military leader. He was the Spanish counterpart to George
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to resist a digression into detail, the inveterate
bibliographer suddenly switches gears. ``He was a little man, only
about 5 feet 4 1/2 inches tall,'' Bromsen points out cheerfully.
``He was the size of President Madison, who was the shortest of our
American presidents. Lincoln, of course, was the tallest.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to his original subject, he adds: ``It might have been
presumptuous of me (to have collected Bolivar), but I'm glad I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Work as progeny
</P>
<P>
   Bromsen, a 1945 Harvard graduate, has had many other passions in
life besides Bolivar. As it turned out, marriage and family life
were not among them. He has always been single. ``It was one of the
reasons I was able to do all the things I have done,'' he says.
``My collection and work were my children.''
</P>
<P>
   His work has been multifaceted. There is Bromsen the book dealer
and manuscripts expert, specializing in Latin American materials,
whose clients have included the family of William Randolph Hearst.
Among his coups were acquiring a copy of Walt Whitman's ``Leaves of
Grass'' in 1970 for what was then the highest price ever paid at
auction for a printed volume of American literature ($9,000); and
the discovery _ amid the personal letters of the Hearst family _ of
a copy of a 1787 invitation to the 13 governors of the United
States to a meeting that led to the drafting of the US
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   There is Bromsen the bibliographer, who has such an
extraordinary memory for detail he is like a walking catalog card.
``When I was 8, I could say all the presidents of the United States
and can still do it within one minute,'' he boasts, and proceeds to
demonstrate. He still works seven days a week on the ``exceedingly
difficult and unpleasant task'' of cataloguing his voluminous
acquisitions of Latin American books, checking them against
numerous references to establish their historical authenticity. He
once spent eight days to catalog one book.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a workaholic,'' says his Venezuelan personal assistant
of 20 years, Fredy Quevas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a kind of genius, and I don't like to use that word too
loosely,'' says Norman Fiering, director and librarian of the John
Carter Brown Library. ``He has such a well-stocked mind.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also a man of no small vanity. ``I have the greatest
collection of Cuban books in private hands, you know'' is a typical
Bromsen declaration. Or, describing his reputation at major auction
houses: ``I was the Prince Charming of the Latin American room.
When I entered the room, everyone interested in Latin America would
get up and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   But his achievements have made him a prosperous man, and a
generous one. He has endowed two funds at the Boston Public
Library, one for the acquisition in Latin American materials and
the other for an annual lectureship in humanistic bibliography.
This year's lecture took place last Saturday night, featuring
historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Bolivar has been safely housed in a room of his own,
Bromsen can turn his full attention to the work of bibliography.
Alas, at 81, his memory, while still ``remarkable,'' is ``maybe 85
percent of what it used to be,'' he says. It worries him sometimes
because in his field, ``you have to retain things or you sink and
drown.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he can't afford the luxury of slowing down.
``I have such a tremendously valuable inventory that, if I lived
till 200, I could never sell it all,'' says Bromsen. ``There is so
much to do, I dare not die.''

   How's this for irony? You have to slog through 275 pages, many
of them featuring very-thin, curve-free women with too little body
fat, to get to Glamour's three-page examination of Hollywood and
society's unhealthy obsession with very-thin, curve-free women with
too little body fat.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Hollywood Starve Wars,'' writer Megan McCafferty tells us
what we already know _ namely, that actresses like Calista
Flockhart, Lara Flynn Boyle, and Jane Leeves are so thin, you
almost want to launch a food drive on their behalf. With some
actresses now striving to wear a size 0, in certain circles a
once-enviable size 4 is now considered huge. But McCafferty
contends the obsession to be thin can be contagious _ how else to
explain Flockhart's incredibly shrinking ``Ally McBeal'' co-stars
Courtney Thorne-Smith and Portia de Rossi? (Thorne-Smith has since
left the show.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about peer pressure,'' says Bernie Brillstein, one of
Hollywood's most prominent managers. ``If an actress is thinner
than the rest of the cast and successful, the women are going to
feel compelled to diet down to her size, thinking, `If it works for
her, why not?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The same thing, McCafferty finds, is happening among sorority
sisters, sports teams, even in the armed services, where body image
is important and pressure to conform is high. ``A member may know
the group's behaviors are unhealthy, but not want to be an outcast,
and over time, she starts starving and purging, too,'' says Arizona
State University nutrition professor Melinda Manore. About 10
percent of anorexics die from medical complications or suicide _
how long before some Hollywood starlet with visions of size 0 in
her eyes starves herself to death?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Of all the hip-hop tragedies _ the AIDS death of Eazy-E, the
still-unsolved shootings of Tupac and Biggie _ the passing of
Christopher ``Big Punisher'' Rios in February may be the saddest of
all. At 28 he died of a heart attack blamed on years of extreme
obesity.
</P>
<P>
   But how did this happen, and did those around him, including his
wife and friends, fail to get him the help he so desperately
needed? That's the question posed by Riggs Morales and Kim Osorio
in The Source as they examine how the platinum-selling rapper,
despite the concerns of others, essentially ate himself to death.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 10 years, Liza, says her husband associated every
emotion with food. He'd eat as salve for an argument, he'd eat to
celebrate, he'd eat when he was bored. His unusually slow
metabolism, coupled with his aversion to physical activity,
contributed to a tripling of his weight in six years.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly didn't help that success allowed him to surround
himself with sycophants who catered to his whims and pampered him;
on tour, they would even get wheelchairs for him so he wouldn't
have to walk. Pun was aware of his weight problems, and last summer
was convinced by his friend and fellow rapper Fat Joe to join Duke
University's acclaimed weight clinic. He lost 80 pounds, but once
he returned home, he fell into old habits, gaining twice as much
weight as he'd lost. Joe recalls Pun telling him to ``mind my
business. Whenever I want to I could lose this weight.''
Tragically, he never did. At the time of his death, Big Pun weighed
698 pounds.

   Message to Indiana University president Myles Brand: IU
basketball coach Bobby Knight should have been fired. Sacked.
Terminated. Kicked to the curb. Forget the three national
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine years of obnoxious, threatening, and boorish
behavior toward players, assistants, and generally any human being
in his path should have been more than enough reason for IU to give
Knight the bum's rush. But last week, Knight convinced IU officials
that he can change, and university officials, after professing a
``zero tolerance'' edict for any future stupidity, allowed Knight
to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   In Sports Illustrated, Alexander Wolff takes hard-edged look at
Knight, and especially the university that flinched when they
should have flexed. Says IU psychology professor David Pisoni of
Knight's reprieve, ``It's an embarrassment to the state and the
university. This demonstrates the priorities of the university.
Athletics come before moral and ethical conduct. The revenue stream
is more important than credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a videotape of Knight choking a player wasn't enough to get
him fired. ``To be sure, the administration found itself in a
pickle,'' Wolff writes. ``How much was Knight really at fault when
the school had been his enabler, deep in a denial of its own? The
chain of command had long ago gone kerblooey.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the hoop-crazy Hoosier state where Knight is king, that
doesn't seem to matter. As incoming IU freshman Jared Jeffries
says, ``If we win a lot of games, all this will die down. People
love winners.'' Even, apparently, when they're losers like Knight.

A TOUGH CALL AWAITS SONUS NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's one of the toughest calls on Wall Street: choosing whether
to launch an initial public offering in to a queasy stock market,
or pull back and wait.
</P>
<P>
   While the Nasdaq Composite index was slumping toward a six-month
low Tuesday, Sonus Networks Inc. of Westford was making its
road-show IPO pitch to a function room crowded with potential
institutional investors at the Boston Harbor Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the Sonus offering is scheduled to be priced by
underwriter Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. Wednesday. Will it really happen
then?
</P>
<P>
   Sonus has a lot going for it and surely would have been an IPO
winner in the final months of 1999 or very early this year. Right
now, even the best deals are a day-to-day proposition, though.
</P>
<P>
   Sonus is working in a growing field, selling gear for
``converged'' old-style circuit-switching and modern
packet-switching communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   It has a well-regarded management team that includes serial
entrepreneur Rubin Gruber, who has helped found VideoServer Inc.,
Cambridge Telecommunications Inc., and Davox Corp., and Cascade
Communications veteran Hassan Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
   Sonus also has a blue-chip roster of venture capital backers and
a handful of big customers, including one that has already signed
on for a contract worth up to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a pretty solid product and a solid pipeline of
customers,'' said John Golden, a technology analyst at John Hancock
Mutual Funds.
</P>
<P>
   What it doesn't have is much of a history actually selling
things to customers. Revenues of $1.1 million in the first quarter
of this year were the first at Sonus. The company has burned
through $37 million since the start of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sonus also faces big competitors with deep pockets, like Lucent
Technologies and Nortel Networks. Cisco System and others also pose
a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk on this is that Nortel and Lucent are competitors,''
said Golden. ``Although Sonus might have a technology lead in the
short term, the question is can they maintain it?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the mood among technology investors is decidedly
gloomy. While Sonus was making its case downtown, BankAmerica
Securities was hosting an Internet software conference at the
Copley Plaza amid dampened enthusiasm Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging by everyone's mood, we're all grumpy,'' said one
institutional investor who was there.
</P>
<P>
   But networking companies seemed to be one of the few sparks in
the IPO market over the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   New Focus Inc. shares soared 155 percent in their first day of
trading last week, and hope was raised for ONI Systems Corp.,
another optical networking company scheduled to go public this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Sonus would fit into the category of hot networking
stocks is open to debate.
</P>
<P>
   David Menlow, president of IPOFinancial.com, finds all the
networking sizzle in companies that are working with fiber-optic
communications. That doesn't include Sonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got a little bit of sex appeal, but pales in
comparison,'' Menlow said. He predicted a marginal increase in
Sonus shares once it begins trading. Others, like Golden, see
investor enthusiasm for companies that would fit under a
``next-generation'' networking umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   But those issues are dwarfed by the larger tech stock market
direction and all the worries that go along with it.  &UR; Today &LR; 's new
idea will still draw an audience, but it is one hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The window, while it's open, is just barely open,'' said David
Smith of Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co.
</P>

Enivsion, Part II
</P>
<P>
   Last week, we were trying to puzzle out how the public stock of
Marblrough-based Envision Development Corp. could possibly be worth
nearly $500 million. Now it may have a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, it's not a simple story.
</P>
<P>
   Envision announced Tuesday that it was in talks about the
possible acquisition of the company by Zero.net, a private San
Francisco venture firm that already owns 41.5 percent of its stock.
Zero.net acquired its Envision stock through Dominion Income
Management and Alta Ltd., a Channel Islands entity. In the middle
of Zero.net and both the sellers, you would find Andrew Evans.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Evans helped manage personal money for Bill Gates.
According to a 1993 Wall Street Journal profile, Evans got six
months in prison after pleading guilty to federal charges related
to bank fraud in 1985 and settled an unrelated US Securities and
Exchange suit without admitting or denying insider trading charges
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Evans didn't return our phone call Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If you missed our earlier installment, Envision went public
under a different name last fall and has bought several private
technology businesses since. But it has never publicly recorded
revenue from anything other than selling perfume over the Internet,
a part of the business it sold this month. Revenues in its most
recent quarter nearly tripled, to $1.5 million, amid losses.
Envision executives say their new technology strategy will become
more apparent when they report their next quarter. Stay tuned.

KEEPING GOOD EMPLOYEES   IS A CHALLENGE THESE DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Job counselors agree: the key to retaining top employees in a
tight labor market is to treat them well.
</P>
<P>
   Given a national unemployment rate of just 4 percent, the lowest
in three decades, you may think retention of staff is an uphill
battle. You may also think it's a battle you are likely to lose.
Not so, says career counselor Barbara Moses, author of ``The Good
News About Careers: How You'll Be Working in the Next Decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Most employers in the new economy want workers who are
autonomous, can take initiative, and are independent
problem-solvers, says Moses. The problem, however, is once they've
attracted workers with these qualities, many have trouble holding
onto them, because employees with such traits are by nature
initative takers _ people less likely to stick around when their
needs are not being met.
</P>
<P>
   Today many workers, regardless of their ages, tend to have
similar needs:
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about employability: Will this job give me the skills I
need to insure a decent living in the future?
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about commitment: Does this company offer the chance to
commit to my work, team members, or profession rather than blind
loyalty to The Corporation?
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about work-life balance: Will I be able to manage this
job and still have time for my family, friends, or personal
interests?
</P>
<P>
   Job counselors say a tight labor market coupled with
dissatisfaction with compensation and any one of those areas of
concern have helped fuel the current job-hopping craze.
</P>
<P>
   The US Labor Department reports that job retention among
employees ages 25 to 34 has steadily declined, dropping from 3.0
years in 1983 to 2.7 years in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Younger workers, who watched their downsized parents struggle to
get along, are not waiting around for the axe to fall. Those with
cutting-edge skills are looking for workplaces that offer freedom,
flexibility, and the opportunity to expand. And, as the market
tightens, older workers who have acquired sought-after skills are
finding they, too, can successfully market themselves.
</P>
<P>
   John Challenger, president of Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, an
outplacement firm in Chicago, says workers have developed an
independent, free-agent mentality in the wake of layoffs. As a
result, they see their skills as permanently up for auction.
</P>
<P>
   Moses, in an interview while in town last week, agreed. ``Right
now, a person might have a full-time job, but to survive they must
also have the mindset of a temp,'' she said. ``They now know that
they must always have money in the bank, they must always be
prepared for the next new challenge. They cannot afford to rest on
their laurels.''
</P>
<P>
   In a push to retain and attract employees, some companies are
offering cars, money, travel, and other expensive perks. But that
might not be enough. A recent study by Indianapolis-based Walker
Information, a research firm and think tank, found employers spend
too little time showing workers that they matter. Lack of
communication and a lack of interest in new ideas and contributions
were seen as key reasons for switching employers.
</P>
<P>
   Moses believes expensive gifts are probably a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the death of corporatism, employers should focus on
other, more successful ways to attract and retain good people,''
she said, adding that many perks can be tailored to fit the
individual needs of employees and are more likely to have broad
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   Skill-building opportunities: ``Skills can be acquired in a
number of different ways, even in apparently dead-end jobs,''
writes Moses. ``Managers can encourage the process by matching
workers with people they can learn from, giving workers
opportunities to participate in cross-departmental task forces,
setting up opportunities for them to shadow other workers in other
jobs, and promoting cross-functional training.''
</P>
<P>
   Tying compensation to learning opportunities: ``One life
insurance company, which takes its learning organization credo
seriously, gives staff a percentage of their salary to use for
developmental purposes such as courses, travel to conferences, or
books,'' says Moses. An example: A major hotel chain offers a small
sum of money as a reward for top performance. Those chosen to
receive the perk can apply it to courses, spa services at the
hotel, skiing or golf lessons _ any endeavor they choose that
allows them to learn something new, regardless of whether that new
skill can be directly applied to the job.
</P>
<P>
   Offering sabbaticals: Everyone needs to recharge himself,
especially in the current go-go economy. Even two months away can
be beneficial, says Moses. ``Sabbaticals shouldn't be tied to
levels of hierarchy in an organization or length of service,'' she
says. ``They should be used to recognize that in the new work
landscape people will have an ongoing need to retool and recharge.
This means that weary baby-boomers grappling with mid-life crises
and 20-somethings and 30-somethings seeking time off to travel or
to test themselves in new ways are equally likely to welcome a
sojourn from their everyday lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoting and building on personal relationships: Moses believes
individuals are more concerned about the personal relationships
they build on the job and within their professions than
profit-and-loss statements and year-end results. ``It is
extraordinary how often it is the small and often banal gestures
that are the most meaningful,'' she says in her book. ``People will
often say things like, `I'm not really happy, but I'm not yet
prepared to jump ship because my boss was really good to me when my
mother was sick.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Employers can promote personal relationships by offering breaks
during work or after when they can mix, talk, and socialize.
Companies that sponsor bowling, basketball, or softball teams
understand the importance of community. At the same time, social
events are even more effective in creating workplace bonds when
rapport develops naturally among colleagues during the course of a
regular work-week.
</P>
<P>
   Offering flexible benefits: More and more companies are
beginning to understand that new workers are less likely to
sacrifice their personal lives for the job. They are also realizing
the importance of flexible benefits and flexible scheduling, and
they are providing workers with a menu of benefits from which they
can choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are working 80 hours per week and the important
relationships in your life are suffering, then you are paying a
huge price for work,'' Moses noted in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are now evaluating the effort-reward equation
differently,'' she said. ``They are now asking themselves, `If I
work that hard, what do I sacrifice?' ''

SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, SILICON VALLEY STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAL0 ALTO, Calif. _ It's Saturday night at geek central. You can
get dizzy checking out the beige cables and motherboards at Fry's
Electronic. And you can almost smell the testosterone of the
techies who trek here for supplies to build their computers from
scratch. These guys don't do Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Once a grocery store chain, Fry's has evolved into an
institution both loved and loathed in Silicon Valley. Its massive
stores are Nerdvana, stocked to the rafters with peripherals,
parts, and gadgets. But its reputation for poor service is also
legendary. Spurned customers have spawned numerous anti-Fry's Web
sites, complete with chat rooms and bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ability of Fry's to draw a full crowd on a Saturday
evening is testament to its strange hold over the Valley's
hard-core techies who, for better or worse, tend to be male.
</P>
<P>
   Where else can a geek wander down aisle after aisle of
semiconductors, urgent memory chips, line transformers, and CPU
coolers? There are parts so obscure they're identified only by
letters and numbers, such as the ``SCR-200 nVRM, 4.0A.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fry's is a cultural icon,'' said Peter Monta, a graduate of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is an engineer at
Terayon Communications Systems in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Monta stopped by on a recent Saturday to look at the latest
motherboards and pick up a couple of toner cartridges. He, like
many elite engineers, eschews the Microsoft Windows operating
system in favor of Linux when he builds his computers from parts.
``Fewer compatibility problems,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Monta explains that the service at Fry's can be ``actively
hostile.'' Its employees often aren't versed in techno-speak. ``You
have to know what you want before you come here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is advice often heard about Fry's which, since its start in
Sunnyvale in 1985 has grown to 17 stores in Arizona, California,
Oregon, and Texas. It is rumored to be one of the most successful
electronics retailers in the country, with estimated annual sales
of over $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But no one knows for sure, because Fry's remains a closely held,
family owned and run company that steadfastly refuses to reveal
much information. Analysts have been escorted out of its stores,
and film is confiscated whenever managers discover that pictures of
its stores are being taken. Company officials declined to be
interviewed for this story.
</P>
<P>
   Its chief executive, John Fry, a former math major and football
star at Santa Clara University, is the son of a successful grocer,
Charles Fry, who gave each of his three children $1 million after
selling his food stores for about $14 million in 1972. Led by John,
the Fry brothers pooled their money and founded the electronics
store.
</P>
<P>
   Their roots in the grocery business are apparent in their
merchandising and retail philosophy. Their stores stock
hypercaffeinated soft drinks, toiletries, magazines, and junk food
_ ideal fare for techies heading off to all-night programming
sessions. Loss leaders are heavily advertised in local newspapers,
selection is prodigious, and prices generally low.
</P>
<P>
   Each store is bizarrely decorated along fantasy themes. The
Fry's in Campbell, Calif., for instance, is modeled after ancient
Egypt and decorated with a 20-foot sphinx and tomb replicas. Others
feature ``Alice in Wonderland'' themes, a UFO crash site, and
ancient Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The Palo Alto store is ``Wild Bill's Wild, Wild West.'' Here, an
enormous buffalo head eyes customers from behind a phalanx of 45
cashiers at the checkout stand.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the whimsy, however, is a dead-serious attitude toward
theft. Each store is monitored by dozens of cameras, and bags are
checked and receipts examined upon exit. Returns require waiting in
two separate, often lengthy lines so that identification is checked
twice. Employees are searched before they leave their shifts.
</P>
<P>
   A San Franciscan who goes by the screen name of Yoda replied to
a bulletin board inquiry about Fry's shoppers. He wrote that he has
``an intense love-hate relationship with the place . . . Lines can
be staggering, returns are painful. And yet, I think Fry's is ideal
for techies. They offer a mountain of goods on the cheap . . .
Techies don't want the cute pastel-colored Friendly Computer. They
want the screaming home-built hot rod bristling with gadgets and
tweaked to their specific tastes. And Fry's hits that demographic
dead-center.''
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, that demographic is largely male, many of
them single. According to the most recent Census figures, there
were 237,800 men who had never been married in Santa Clara County,
as opposed to 166,206 unwed women. In engineering schools across
the country, where Silicon Valley draws much of its talent, it is
not unusual for men to outnumber women by three to one.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fry's store in Palo Alto one Saturday evening, there were
19 men at the checkout line but only three women. This is something
the owners of Fry's have undoubtedly picked up on. Copies of
Playboy magazine sit alongside titles such as Low Rider, MacAddict,
and the C/C++ Users Journal. There are razors and ties decorated
with pictures of tiny cell phones and pagers.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Torres, a bank marketing officer in San Jose and
self-described ``Fry's junkie,'' explained the store's allure for
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've ever watched the show `Home Improvement' that
depicts the fascination men have with power tools and such, it is,
to me, much the same kind of thing at Fry's,'' Torres said. ``You
can look at all these parts and gizmos and think `More Power!' ''
</P>
<P>
   But as with most comments about Fry's, the topic of Fry's
treatment of its customers inevitably comes up. ``Fry's isn't
perfect,'' Torres said. ``The service can best be described as
poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Fry's is aware of the criticism. ``We certainly understand that
some people are not as satisfied as we would like them to be,''
said Manuel Valerio, its community relations manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is partly the nature of retail. Anytime you deal with
customers, there will always be some individuals that will not be
easy to satisfy. We will go out of our way to try without, of
course, putting Fry's at a competitive disadvantage in terms of
financial losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerio said Fry's this year joined the Better Business Bureau
to ``clear up any backlog of concerns our customers may have
expressed to the Better Business Bureau in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the customers come in droves. Tour buses often unload at
a Fry's store where the uninitiated gawk at the merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Evgeny Devyatyh, a 23-year-old software engineer, brought to the
Palo Alto Fry's two childhood friends visiting from his hometown in
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second night in a row Devyatyh had found himself in a
Fry's store. This time, he was buying the parts to put together his
own computer. He swung by the software aisles, which carried
thousands of titles and were populated by over a dozen men and two
women, one of whom was a store clerk. Devyatyh picked up a copy of
Linux, then headed off to the cash register, where he threw in a
bag of candy and a soda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this place,'' he said with an approving nod.

LISA LESLIE HAS FOUND BASKETS FULL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was going to be famous. Amid the bleakness and blight of
poverty-ravaged Compton, Calif., this was her refuge.
</P>
<P>
   She was going to be a fashion model. And a television news
correspondent. These ambitions sustained her while her mother, a
truck driver, was on the road and the little girl was left in the
care of a live-in housekeeper who, she would recall, treated her
and her sister unkindly. To transport herself from the grim present
into the boundless future, to prepare for that day when she would
emerge from a dreary childhood into full-fledged celebrity, she
would practice her autograph. She would write over and over until
she had the signature just right, each capital ``L'' flowing into
the rest of the word, each small ``e'' and ``s'' a study in
symmetry, so that the name rolled off the paper as she imagined it
would roll off the tongues of those who would trumpet her
achievements:
</P>
<P>
   ``Lisa Leslie.''
</P>
<P>
   She knew this was inevitable, just as certainly as she knew one
other thing.
</P>
<P>
   Her beacon of escape would not involve basketball.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She has become a prominent fashion model, a runway and photo
fixture. The high-powered Wilhemina agency signed her in 1996, and
since then, she has been featured in a Herb Ritts portfolio for
Vogue, a Newsweek spread, an Annie Leibovitz shoot, and shows for
Anne Klein, Armani, and Tommy Hilfiger, among other glossy
appearances. She shares the cover of the latest issue of Sports
Illustrated For Women with her good buddy Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   She has become a TV news correspondent, though her reporting for
``NBA Inside Stuff'' would be considered far more TV than news.
Beyond that, she has established a niche as a guest star on sitcoms
such as ``Sister, Sister,'' ``Hang Time,'' and ``Moesha.''
</P>
<P>
   The dream has followed her schoolgirl blueprint, with one
exception. Basketball is at its core, the linchpin of the entire
publicity machine. Her striking 6-foot-5-inch beauty and sparkling
glibness around microphones and cameras would not be nearly as much
in demand were it not for the fact that, six weeks shy of her 28th
birthday, Lisa Leslie is one of the greatest players ever to square
up to the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche of attention
</P>
<P>
   She has been a national name since scoring more than 100 points
in one half of a high school game. She dominated women's college
basketball at the University of Southern California, a career
framed with NCAA honors as Freshman of the Year in 1991 and Player
of the Year in 1994. She became a cult figure in Italy for one
season in 1994-95, hailed as ``Grande Lisa'' (``Big Lisa'') by
adoring hordes while playing for Alcamo in Sicily. And her fame
blossomed into worldwide proportions in 1996, when she led the
United States to the Olympic gold medal in Atlanta as the fulcrum
of the American attack, owner of Olympic records for points in a
game (35 against Japan) and tournament (156, 19.5 per game).
</P>
<P>
   That triggered the avalanche of individual attention from
outside sources and, on a more cosmic level, helped spawn the
Women's National Basketball Association, an adjunct of the NBA that
has become a viable enterprise in its own right as it taps off its
fourth season Monday. Leslie, a three-time All-Star, will be the
guiding force of the Los Angeles Sparks during the 32-game schedule
and playoffs, which will funnel directly into the Olympics at
Sydney, where she again will be an American mainstay in the title
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's probably the most versatile player in the world,'' said
Leslie's Olympic coach, Nell Fortner, during the recent US Olympic
Committee Media Summit in Houston. ``She's a 6-5, any-position
player. She presents the most problems for anyone we play. Also,
her experience'' is a major asset.
</P>
<P>
   Such experience was something Leslie never envisioned while
growing up in Compton, ``which most people know is a pretty bad
neighborhood,'' she said. ``But it's only what you make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Christine Leslie-Espinoza, made sure Lisa didn't
make it a training ground for drugs and despair, Compton's calling
cards. She set strict limits, and the housekeeper enforced them
while Christine was behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were (bad) things going on,'' said Lisa. To avoid them,
``you had to be in the house before the street lights came on.''
</P>
<P>
   Until curfew, she would play kickball or jump rope ``like a
normal kid,'' but physical endeavors were mere pastimes, not
passionate pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wasn't into sports as a kid,'' said Leslie. ``I never
had any aspirations to be in sports, just loving the sport. That's
not my background.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, her focus was greatly influenced by her aunt Judy, who
lived in nearby Carson and took in the Leslies when Lisa was 13.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Simpson was ``a beautiful lady,'' said Lisa, ``and she was
really into fashion. I think that's where I got a lot of my fashion
sense from, like it's OK to be aware of your body and your
appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, Leslie had discovered that her body could do
wondrous things on a basketball court. The revelation occurred by
accident.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taking to the game
</P>
<P>
   By seventh grade, Leslie had sprouted to 6-1 and was looking for
social outlets. An older girl, Sharon Hargrove, suggested an
unlikely one: basketball. Sharon was extremely popular. She played
basketball. She invited Leslie to try it. Leslie figured, well, if
it worked for this girl . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, in junior high, you just get there in the seventh
grade and you don't know anyone,'' Leslie said. ``And everybody
knew her.''
</P>
<P>
   So Leslie went out for the team, with meager ambitions: ``I just
told the coaches, `I'm going to fall down now. Keep playing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't fall down. She became consumed by the game: ``I feel
basketball was my destiny.'' And she overcame a lonely experience
when she was introduced to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day,'' she said, ``I'm actually lefthanded, and the
coach said, `All the righthand kids get on one side and all the
lefthand get on the other.' And I was the only one over there by
myself. And I said, `When I come back tomorrow, I'm going to be
righthanded.' So I actually play righthand now.''
</P>
<P>
   She soon found that she also played at a level above her peers.
This development dismayed Aunt Judy to an extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get my hair done and I'd go play,'' said Leslie. ``My hair
would be all over my head, and she's like, `I just got your hair
done.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But she wasn't forsaking her aunt's fashion tenets, merely
incorporating them into her new parlay for success: glamour and
grit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that kind of balance of who I am today,'' said Leslie.
``Just trying to take care of yourself, but you can still go out
and play sports. That's OK. I'm probably a little more feminine
than most basketball players you've ever seen, but that's just my
background. It helps, but it can hurt you, because people think I
don't live up to my potential because I'm trying to be cute or that
I'm too feminine or fragile or whatever. But I get the job done and
I work hard on defense and offense, and I'm not worried about my
nails or my hair. But I'm also a woman first, and I feel like when
I come off the court, there's no reason I can't put on a skirt and
be a lady.''
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake. Leslie is a terror on the court, as
epitomized by her triple-digit epic for Morningside High in
Inglewood, Calif., where the family moved when Leslie was 14. It
was a team tradition to give a senior a showcase game, in which she
would be constantly fed the ball. Leslie was chosen for the honor
against South Torrance High, but she approached it with
apprehension: ``I'm thinking, `OK, I could stink up the gym here.'
''
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, she lit it up for 101 points in 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a few layups and made some jump shots and made some
turnaround jumpers,'' she said. ``And then I started getting hot
and just making everything, and they were fouling me and I made
about 35 free throws.''
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, Inglewood led, 102-24. There was no second half
because South Torrance was down to four players after its
foul-plagued first two quarters. But that game served as Leslie's
transcontinental springboard, and she has been soaring ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The game has become not only her foundation for personal gain
but a forum for community outreach. Back in Inglewood, Leslie has
translated her endorsement deal with Nike into funding for various
youth programs. She also is a regular presence in her old
neighborhood, making herself accessible to the kids, delivering a
message that transcends the standard lip service because she has
lived their experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just talking about it when the camera's on,'' she
said. ``It's actually going there and saying, `Hey, I've sat in
these same seats. I've been there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And now she's here. At the top.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not a finished product
</P>
<P>
   There is still work to be done. Leslie is a tireless crusader
for the game she stumbled into by happenstance. She believes it is
imperative for the US women to prevail in Sydney to maintain the
momentum established in Atlanta. The WNBA is on the upswing, but
the average salary is $55,000, dwarfed by the six-figure European
contracts, and Leslie wants to see the US league attract more men
as fans, escape the nether reaches of the sports section, mushroom
into a prime-time TV staple.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there have been giant strides of credibility. Many NBA
players are fans of the WNBA. Leslie recalls an encounter with
Minnesota Timberwolves All-Star Kevin Garnett. Seeing him at a
Sparks game, she approached him with what she considered necessary
deference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Mr. Garnett,'' she said. ``How you doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Garnett laughed as he admonished her, ``Don't call me that. I
know who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   The childhood fantasies have been fulfilled thanks to the plot
line that wasn't in the grandiose script. Lisa Leslie is famous.
Because of basketball.

&HT;     BOARD APPROVES NEW SUPERINTENDENT AMID CRITICISM FROM
TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RAY DELGADO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco school board approved a
four-year contract for new superintendent Arlene Ackerman that will
pay her $197,000 a year to head California's fifth largest
district, $12,000 more than her predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the terms of Ackerman's unsigned contract at
Tuesday night's school board meeting drew an immediate chorus of
loud boos among teachers and parents in the audience. ``Shame on
you'' they chanted before the board voted 6-0 to approve the
contract. Board member Dan Kelly abstained because he wanted more
time to see the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board keeps telling us that they don't have the money to
pay us, but they found it for (Ackerman),'' said Jennifer Bloom, a
first-grade teacher who wore a hat to the meeting that read ``Pay
me to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're throwing money out to get her and we're begging to
have a living wage,'' Bloom added.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the contract, Ackerman's salary goes into
effect on Aug. 1 and includes vacation time, sick leave, health
benefits, life insurance and moving expenses from Washington, D.C.,
where she has headed that city's troubled school district for two
years. A clause in the contract also allows Ackerman an unspecified
amount of leave time to complete a doctorate degree at Harvard
University, said Deputy City Attorney Mark Barmore.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman was hired last week to run the 64,000 student district,
ending a nationwide search.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials and school board members said Ackerman's salary
is competitive with other superintendents at major city school
districts. Superintendent Bill Rojas, Ackerman's predecessor in the
San Francisco post, left the district two years ago to head Dallas'
school district for an estimated salary of $275,000 a year. His
last salary in San Francisco was $185,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Several school teachers who attended the meeting said they were
aware of the pressure board members were under to hire a
superintendent, but they now need to approach teacher raises with
the same sense of urgency or expect that teachers will leave the
district to make more money elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I have to do is add 20 minutes to my commute and I can
make $12,000 more a year,'' said Stacy Stephens, a social studies
teacher at Lincoln High School.

RISK WOULD BE WORTH IT FOR IRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Problem: risk and Vanguard Index 500
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Age: daughter, 43
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; . I recently convinced my daughter to start an IRA in the
Vanguard Index 500 fund. I know this is a fairly high-risk fund,
but in view of the fact she has 22 years before retirement, she has
to take some risk. We recently sold a house that we jointly owned,
and she will make a fair profit. I want her to put this in one of
Vanguard's money market funds and then each year transfer money
into the IRA account. Does this make sense?
</P>
<P>
   J.R., Attleboro, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A &LR; . The investment in Vanguard Index 500 is a solid one, but I
would not characterize it as high-risk. The fund simply holds the
500 stocks of the Standard and Poor's index, proportionally to
their market weight in the index. Basically, an investment in Index
500 is a bet on the fortunes of America's dominant public companies
_ a solid holding, especially for a long-term investor such as your
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   You do not say how much she will net from the house sale. If
it's sizable _ say, more than $10,000 _ I would suggest that far
from being too risky, the plan you outline is too cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Let's suppose your daughter nets $26,652. If it were invested in
Vanguard's Prime Money Market fund and $166.66 a month were
withdrawn and put into her IRA, she would have enough money to fund
the IRA payments for 264 months, or 22 years, provided the yield on
the fund averaged 5 percent. Given that she already has $2,000 in
Vanguard Index 500, if that fund averaged 10 percent returns during
those 22 years, her accumulation at age 65 would be $176,697.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's suppose she had the same $26,625, plus the $2,000
already in her IRA, and she simply bit the bullet and put all of it
into a taxable holding in Index 500, each month transferring
$166.66 from the taxable account into her IRA. If Index 500
produced the same 10 percent average annual returns, her
accumulation at age 65 would be $256,195.
</P>
<P>
   Is what I am suggesting riskier? No question about it. Moreover,
you can argue, the large-cap stocks that have driven Vanguard Index
500 to its current 24.1 percent five-year average annual returns
are pretty expensive right now, and in the opinion of many market
watchers they are due to take a breather. I agree with that
thinking, but I also think that 22 years is simply too long for a
dollar-cost averaging program when all of the funds are available
at the outset. If you take the long view, a single investment now,
or at the most cautious, a dollar-cost averaging program that would
get all of the money invested over four or five years, is a better
bet.
</P>
<P>
   Another option: a variable annuity invested in Vanguard Index
500. Just as an IRA does, a variable annuity serves to defer the
income tax obligation on earnings until they are withdrawn. (The
initial investment, being after-tax money, is not taxed upon
withdrawal.) There is an element of insurance in variable annuity
contracts, and the cost of the insurance tends to reduce the
returns by about 0.5 percent, compared to the similarly invested
mutual fund, but even if returns averaged only 9.5 percent, the
22-year accumulation would be $213,652, and she would have a
further $17,883 in the IRA that you persuaded her to open,
presuming 10 percent average growth. Of course, one advantage of
the annuity plan is she would still be eligible to contribute up to
$2,000 of her annual earnings to the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Problem: How much of my savings can I spend?
</P>
<P>
   Age: 81
</P>
<P>
   Social Security: $860 monthly
</P>
<P>
   Savings:
</P>
<P>
   $15,418 Washington Mutual fund
</P>
<P>
   $12,400 Washington Mutual IRA
</P>
<P>
   $12,070 Capital Income Builders
</P>
<P>
   $12,400 Capital Income Builders (IRA)
</P>
<P>
   $4,007 Growth Fund of America (IRA)
</P>
<P>
   $2,598 New Perspective fund (IRA)
</P>
<P>
   $692 bank IRA; $18,436 CD; $3,000 checking account
</P>
<P>
   Other: $10,000 personal loan to daughter
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; . My daughter fears I am not invested in the best funds for
my situation. Am I? I would like to move to a retirement home near
where my daughter lives. How much can I safely spend from my
investments without running out? Obviously it matters how long I
live, so use ages 90 and 95.
</P>
<P>
   L.W., Brea, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A &LR; . Excluding both the personal loan and your checking account
balance, you could withdraw $1,107 a month from your $86,755
portfolio to exhaust the funds at age 90; if you took the more
conservative course, withdrawals of $835 a month would mean the
pool would last until age 95.
</P>
<P>
   I used a projected portfolio return of 7.5 percent annually. I
did this because I agree with your daughter _ you are much too
reliant on the stock market for your comfort, especially since you
are relying on these funds for a good piece of your income. I tally
67.2 percent of your total portfolio is in stocks, a calculation in
which I credited 62 percent of the positions in Capital Income
Builders as stock holdings. My suggestion would be to confine the
stock position to the two taxable accounts, in Capital Income
Builders and Washington mutual. This would have the effect of
cutting your reliance on the stock market to a little more than 26
percent.
</P>
<P>
   You could look among the many fixed-income funds within the
American fund family, but at this point _ and particularly for a
person such as yourself who cannot afford a great deal of risk _
the high CD rates available now look mighty attractive. Entering
this week, the nation's best rate on a five-year CD was a flat 8
percent, available at Capital One FSB in Falls Church, Va.
(800-564-7426.) You can find a list of the highest rates on the
Data Bank page of the Sunday New York Times. But shop around,
because the highest rate and the national average differ widely.
(The national average was 6.06 this week.)
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion: Move all of your IRA money to such a CD, a
transaction which would cause you no short-term tax problems
(although with the higher yield on the CD than from your fund
holdings, your taxable income would increase).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I'd suggest that you use the more conservative
projection that you will live to age 95. As for the income you
expect from the personal loan you made, I suggest you just salt it
away as emergency funds _ and I suggest you salt it away in a
similar CD, but this time in a taxable account. The balance would
eventually amount to a tidy sum upon which you could rely in the
event _ horrors! _ that you blow out all of the candles on your
96th birthday cake.
</P>
<P>
   Problem: Choosing an annuity for great grandchildren, ages 4, 6,
8, 10
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; . I want to invest $5,000 each for my four
great-grandchildren. What would be the best way? My bank wants me
to buy a variable annuity for each one. If I do this, should I
specify large-cap or small-cap?
</P>
<P>
   A.J., Phoenix &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A &LR; . Without knowing specifics, I would suggest a large-cap
investment. Since you are interested in annuities, I presume you
intend this money to represent a head start on retirement planning
for each of the great-grandchildren. These are handsome gifts. If
the oldest child's investment returns average annual gains of 10
percent, his or her accumulation would be $1,196,682 at age 65;
since the younger kids have more time, their accumulations would be
greater.
</P>
<P>
   Over the very long haul, small-caps have provided better
returns. But it is also more difficult to manage a small-cap fund,
and that means many opportunities for disaster. Large-caps,
presumably, have weathered many storms and built dominant
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Second, over half a century, the typical mutual fund will go
through many managers, so even if you choose a well-managed
small-cap fund,there's no guarantee things will remain that way.

&HT;     FORMER HOUSING SECRETARY DOWNPLAYS INTEREST IN L.A. SCHOOLS
POST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUDOLPH BUSH  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros is on the short list of
candidates to head the huge and beleaguered Los Angeles Unified
School District.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, whose last foray into public life ended when he
resigned as secretary of Housing and Urban Development in 1996,
said he is not interested in the superintendent's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've indicated that I'm not a candidate, and I took my name
out of circulation Sunday,'' Cisneros said. He added, however,
``that's my present position,'' and he plans to consider the idea
more thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles district, one of the largest in the country with
more than 700,000 students, has been plagued by management
troubles, low test scores and a monumental scandal over what was to
have been the country's most expensive high school, the Belmont
Learning Center.
</P>
<P>
   The $200 million Belmont project was abandoned, half-finished,
because it was built on an old, toxic oil field.
</P>
<P>
   Being considered with Cisneros are former Colorado Gov. Roy
Romer; Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan; Liam McGee, president of
Bank of America in Southern California; Houston school
Superintendent Rod Paige; and Adam Urbanski, the head of the
Federation of Teachers in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, who lives in Southern California, is the president and
chief operating officer of Univision, a Spanish-language television
network.
</P>
<P>
   To re-enter the public sector, he would have to give up a large
salary, bonuses and stock options he receives at Univision.
</P>
<P>
   The salary range for the superintendent's position ranges from
$190,000 to $250,000, said Roger Rasmussen, a spokesman for the
school district. The district hopes to hire a new superintendent as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Cisneros earned $4.5 million from his Univision post:
$600,000 base salary, $600,000 in bonuses and a profit of $3.3
million from the sale of stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros can cash in additional stock options for about $5.2
million, according to the Univision proxy statement filed with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   If he were to stay with the company, other stock options, now
worth $15.4 million, would mature in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, Univision's president since 1997, renewed his contract
with the media company through 2002 with a base salary of $600,000
for each of those years, according to company documents filed with
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros is credited with helping Univision capture the
spotlight and major advertising dollars with its popular soap
operas and solid ratings in several major markets, including Los
Angeles, Miami and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The company raised its advertising rates 33 percent last year
without driving away advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Although he says he does not plan to return to politics,
Cisneros has been particularly visible at rallies for congressional
candidates in Texas and California.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year alone, Cisneros' name was mentioned as a
potential candidate for Texas governor, Senate and chancellor of
the University of Texas System. Cisneros is a former mayor of San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure as President Clinton's housing secretary,
Cisneros was under investigation for reportedly lying to the FBI
about payments he had made to a former mistress in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros pleaded guilty on Sept. 8, 1999, to a single
misdemeanor charge of lying to the FBI during routine background
checks on nominees for Cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros paid a $10,000 fine. In exchange for the guilty plea, a
federal judge dropped 18 felony counts that could have sent him to
prison.

ANOTHER JAPANESE FIRM ASKS FOR DEBT FORGIVENESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ For the second time in less than a month, a large
Japanese company beseeched its banks Wednesday to forgive billions
of dollars' worth of debts, intensifying pressure on Japan's
financial system.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Hazama Corp., a general contractor, to request
400 billion yen, or $3.7 billion at current exchange rates, worth
of debt forgiveness is yet another sign that the bad loan problems
of Japanese banks are far from over.
</P>
<P>
   On April 26, Sogo Co., a faltering Japanese retail company, sent
its bankers reeling by asking them to write off 639 billion yen, or
roughly $6 billion, in debts. That was the biggest amount of debt
forgiveness ever sought in Japan, where the practice is still far
from standard.
</P>
<P>
   The shock of Sogo's request was magnified a few days later when
the senior executive in charge of the retailer's financial
restructuring plans was found dead in his home of an apparent
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Just Tuesday, the company's lenders postponed a decision on
Sogo's request, although the largest lender, the Industrial Bank of
Japan, has said it is willing to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of Sogo's outstanding debts to the bank, 180 billion
yen, or $1.7 billion, is roughly equivalent to one year's worth of
operating profits, according to James P. Fiorillo, senior banking
analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo. Nor does the bank have sizeable
unrealized gains on its securities portfolio to offset such a write
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of whether to forgive these debts or not is a big
one,'' Fiorillo said.
</P>
<P>
   In Hazama's case, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, its largest lender, is
apparently willing to waive 90 billion yen of the construction
company's loans, according to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's
leading business daily.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in accounting standards are intensifying the pressure on
troubled companies. In the fiscal year that began April 1, they
must value their real estate and securities holdings at market
value. The new rules also strictly limit their ability to hide
their debts in the accounts of affiliates by forcing them to report
their results on a consolidated basis.
</P>
<P>
   Including Hazawa and Sogo, more than 10 large companies have
asked for debt relief this year. The biggest numbers seeking such
forgiveness have come from the construction industry, and analysts
warn that many more contractors are in similarly weak shape.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hazama, they took on loads of debt to finance real estate
purchases in the 1980s only to watch the value of that real estate
plummet when Japan's economic bubble burst.
</P>
<P>
   But whether debt forgiveness will really help ailing companies
to regain their footing is a matter of much debate here. Unlike in
the United States, where creditors of distressed companies can
force radical changes onto businesses in exchange for debt relief,
Japanese creditors have very little power to force change. ``It
would be much better if these companies went bankrupt,'' said
Tadashi Nakamae, a prominent economist here. ``Debt forgiveness is
only going to prolong their problems.''

MISSISSIPPI MUD BLACK AND TAN: LET THIS ONE GO DOWNSTREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've ever had an occasion to encounter the mud along the
Mississippi, particularly near the delta, you know it isn't very
attractive. After draining about half the United States, the river
coughs up a gooey, sticky, oily and chemical-smelling mess.
</P>
<P>
   That said, one wonders why someone would try to sell a beer
called Mississippi Mud, particularly when what we have here is more
about gimmicky packaging and marketing than it is about beer.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi Mud purports to be a ``black and tan,'' which is a
dark porter or stout typically thinned out with a lighter,
amber-colored beer.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, with that name you would expect something dark, thick
and strong, and Mississippi Mud fails to deliver on any level.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting color from this combination isn't bad. Mississippi
Mud produced an attractive reddish-brown color.
</P>
<P>
   But the taste left not only much, but nearly everything, to be
desired. It had a pleasant hoppy aroma, but the taste was very
thin. There was no finish to speak of. There wasn't much of a
beginning either.
</P>
<P>
   Real Mississippi mud would taste better.
</P>
<P>
   The best we can say is that it is a brownish liquid that smells
and tastes vaguely beerlike.
</P>
<P>
   But then, this is a dishonest brew from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   The label says it is produced by Mississippi Brewing Co. in
Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   But what we actually have here is something concocted by AriZona
Beverage Co., which isn't even in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   AriZona is a ``New Age'' beverage company in Lake Success, N.Y.,
and its real business is selling herbal tea, coffee, fruit juices
and elixirs in fancy bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi Mud Black and Tan comes in 32-ounce jugs ($3) and
16-ounce jugs designed to look like a backwoods jug that might
contain moonshine.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a real black and tan, simply mix equal parts of
Guinness and an amber beer or ale. Bass or Harps works fine.
</P>
<P>
   I rate Mississippi Mud Black and Tan a 0.4 on the international
0 to 5 scale, which puts it smack between ditch water and a flat
Big Red soda.

FIRST LADY MAY BE SORRY THAT RUDY IS GONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton doesn't have Rudy Giuliani to kick around
anymore. So she's exhuming the cold political corpse of Newt
Gingrich to use as a scarecrow in her New York campaign for the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Rick Lazio was barely off the bench and into the
game as Giuliani's replacement before Clinton's strategists were
accusing Lazio of being a Gingrich ``puppet'' who hauled water for
the ex-House speaker after the Republican takeover of Congress
during the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation isn't true, but then truth has never been a
priority in the Clinton household. Past performance suggests that
Hillary Rodham Clinton, like her presidential husband, Bill,
subscribes to the theory that a lie is always preferable to the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   No, the dishonesty of her opening salvo against Lazio isn't
surprising in the least. What's surprising is the first lady's
apparent belief that there is still political mileage to be gained
by railing about Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   There must be voters in New York state who don't remember
anything about the Gingrich speakership, or even remember that
Gingrich led the so-called Republican Revolution that produced the
Contract With America and other high-profile conservative
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   And there must be lots of voters, in New York and all across
America, who wouldn't dream of voting for or against a
congressional candidate because of some real or alleged connection
between the candidate and a former speaker who has fallen so far
off the political radar screen that the late-night TV comics don't
even tell jokes about him anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But you never know. Bill Clinton and the Democrats had plenty of
success demonizing Gingrich, his ideas and just about everyone who
agreed with his ideas. Maybe Hillary and political gurus such as
Harold Ickes know what they're doing; maybe they can defeat Lazio
by hanging Gingrich around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, of course, will be reluctant to let them get away with it
_ and he is well-armed with facts to refute the Clinton attacks.
According to several news reports about Lazio's entry into the race
after Giuliani dropped out to deal with prostate cancer, the
four-term congressman has won praise from liberals as well as
conservatives and moderates for his independent views on a variety
of issues.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clintonites intend to create the perception that Lazio is
a right-wing ideologue who adheres to the gospel of Gingrich, how
will they explain his past support from environmental activist
groups and his vote for the Brady law regulating purchases of
handguns?
</P>
<P>
   By the time Election Day rolls around, Hillary Clinton might be
wishing that Giuliani had stayed in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City mayor is no hard-line conservative, either,
but Clinton did enjoy thrashing him over New York cops' proclivity
for gunning down unarmed minorities _ and Giuliani's penchant for
occasionally rubbing salt in the wound by suggesting that the
shooting victims got what they deserved.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine Lazio lapsing into the almost snarling
insensitivity that Giuliani is prone to display. If his recent TV
appearances are any indication, Lazio has a permanent smile etched
on his face.
</P>
<P>
   His amiability suggests a personality far different from the
edgy Giuliani's _ and from Clinton's. The first lady often seems to
talk with her teeth clenched, as if suppressing the urge to start
yelling at someone.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Lazio isn't tough. Responding to the
Clinton campaign's attempt to tie him to Gingrich, Lazio
counterpunched with the dreaded L-word and a sharp jab at Hillary's
potential Achilles' heel: the ``carpetbagger'' problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent is a liberal and a proud one, and I respect her
for that,'' he said. ``But make no mistake, she is no more a New
Democrat than she is a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I would have bet that Giuliani's departure from the
race would crush Republican hopes of keeping Clinton out of the
Senate. Now I'm thinking that Lazio just might be up to the task.

they're called German pancakes there, more often they're found in

MONEY MAKES FOR UNTIED FAMILIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Put money, fame and family together, and it can make for a
volatile mix.
</P>
<P>
   The current example features Texas teen country-pop star LeAnn
Rimes; her divorced parents, Wilbur and Belinda; and several
million dollars that Mama and daughter say Daddy (and co-manager
Lyle Walker) skimmed over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in Dallas on May 2, casts a new shadow over
Rimes' career, causing heads to shake and rumors to fly throughout
the country music community.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the $7 million quoted in the lawsuit is just a
``base'' figure: Rimes' attorneys say that the total that LeAnn
lost and deserves to regain is more, but that they don't know how
much more because there's been no true accounting of the money she
earned.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the dispute is that Wilbur and Belinda have been
divorced for three years, and a counterallegation that LeAnn's
company owes money to her father and Walker. And there are the
comments from a hurt-sounding Wilbur Rimes that he did everything
for his little girl, which makes the saga sound like a
pedal-guitar-sweetened tabloid-ready court drama.
</P>
<P>
   The Rimes case is not an aberration in the showbiz world. Child
celebrities who accused their parents of mismanaging or embezzling
money include silent-film star Jackie Coogan, Shirley Temple and
Mimi Gibson, who had a role in ``The Three Faces of Eve'' and
starred with Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in ``Houseboat.'' When
Gibson turned 18, she found out that her mother had squandered her
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson has sponsored a bill in California that would
automatically put 15 percent of a child star's earnings into a
trust fund that can be withdrawn only when the child turns 18.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some of the more recent examples of child
celebrities who say they were fleeced by one parent or both:
</P>
<P>
   The most famous case in recent history involves actor Macaulay
Culkin, a lavish lifestyle, and more than $17 million he earned as
the child star of the ``Home Alone'' movies. Culkin's parents were
also divorced. The Culkin case, which also involved a custody
dispute, centered on who would control his fortune. In March 1998,
after extensive and costly legal wranglings, Manhattan Supreme
Court Judge David Saxe fired dad Christopher Culkin and mom
Patricia Brentrup and put the family's accountant, Billy Breitner,
in charge of the money until Culkin turned 18.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Coleman's case didn't involve divorce, but it did involve
an eight-figure fortune. Coleman was the star of NBC's ``Diff'rent
Strokes'' between 1978 and 1986; at one point he was making $70,000
per episode _ which afforded him homes in Denver and Arizona and a
train set with 30 miles of track.
</P>
<P>
   The show ended when Coleman was 17; three years later, he fired
his parents as his trustees and took them to court, saying that
they misspent his money, including an amount set aside in a trust
fund. He won the case in 1993 and was awarded $1.3 million, a far
cry from the $18 million he once had.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman declared bankruptcy in August, listing debts of $71,890
and assets of $19,850. In September, he told ``People'' magazine he
had sold his two homes and was living in an $800-per-month
apartment in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Pop star Tiffany's troubles were with her mom. The fresh-faced
vocalist released her eponymous debut in 1987 when she was 15, and
enjoyed several fluffy hits, among them ``Could've Been Me.'' Her
mom, Janie C. Williams, contended that Tiffany and manager George
Tobin conspired to prevent her from handling her daughter's career.
</P>
<P>
   In spring 1988, according to the ``Los Angeles Times,'' Tiffany
didn't return home from Tobin's studio. Williams filed a missing
person report; Tiffany, 16, filed an emancipation action the next
week. A few weeks later, the court appointed her aunt, Julie Abbas,
as temporary guardian until the emancipation request was heard. A
Los Angeles Superior Court judge eventually removed Tiffany's
mother as trustee. The judge also increased from 30 to 50 percent
the amount of Tiffany's earnings to be placed in a trust fund and
named the Bank of California and an accounting fund as her
trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the messiest child/parent battle involved gymnast
Dominique Moceanu and her father, Dumitru. At 14, the American-born
Dominique was the youngest member of the U.S. women's gymnastics
team that competed in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, who had been on the Romanian Olympics gymnastics
team before defecting to the United States, moved her to Houston in
1990 so Dominique could train with renowned coach Bela Karolyi.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, 17, sued her parents in October and sought to be
declared an adult, in part to find out what had happened to her
money. She alleged that her parents spent part of her trust fund on
personal items. The trust fund also paid for a 70,000-square-foot
gym.
</P>
<P>
   Her former coach, Luminita Miscenco, left Houston in November
after police told Moceanu that they were looking into reports that
her father had hired a hit man to kill Miscenco, according to a
story in The Houston Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu denied that allegation but took the Fifth
Amendment when questioned under oath. A protective order was
granted Dec. 9 that would keep father and daughter separated for a
year. Dominique has moved to Florida to resume training.
</P>
<P>
   To Tom Rhodus, one of Rimes' attorneys, these sorts of cases
spring from two main factors: Kids grow up faster nowadays and are
more aware of their rights as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children have greater access to courts than 30 to 40 years
ago,'' Rhodus says. ``But also, in the last 20 years you've seen an
explosion in lawsuits, and that's part of it, too. That can be seen
as a bad thing, but it's good, too, because it speaks of greater
awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodus says greed plays a role, too. ``All human beings are
similar in one regard: We tend to be selfish, even the best
people,'' he says. ``We're all capable of finding reasons to
justify what we do _ and this is true of everyone from serial
killers to somebody stopped for a speeding ticket. And it's much
easier to do it when it's just money.''

&HT;     JUDGE IN S.F. NEWSPAPER CASE RAISES NEW QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The federal judge hearing the antitrust case
filed against the proposed sale of the San Francisco Examiner
ordered lawyers to answer questions about the profit-sharing
agreement between San Francisco's two daily newspapers and clauses
that allegedly thwarted other companies from buying the properties.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker posed the queries as the
lawyers on Wednesday filed their final legal briefs in former
mayoral candidate Clint Reilly's antitrust suit to prevent the sale
of The Examiner and the purchase of the San Francisco Chronicle by
The Hearst Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's suit claims the plans will result in Hearst owning the
only major metropolitan daily newspaper in San Francisco, an
alleged illegal monopoly that would reduce editorial voices and
increase advertising and subscription rates.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's questions indicated that the judge is considering a
wide range of potential legal remedies in the trial, the nation's
first to challenge the breakup of a joint operating agreement
between newspapers. They are among several he has asked while
hearing the case, in which closing arguments are set for May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph M. Alioto, Reilly's lawyer, has asked Walker to bar
Hearst's proposed purchase of the Chronicle for $660 million. He
wants the judge to order the Chronicle Publishing Co. to offer the
paper for sale anew to other potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto claims Hearst misused its position in the joint operating
agreement to ward off other buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, The Examiner and the Chronicle since 1965
have evenly shared their combined revenue, costs of production and
remaining profit.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is allowed under the Newspaper Preservation Act,
an exemption to antitrust laws meant to keep alive economically
failing newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst and Chronicle representatives have denied Reilly's
contentions and say the deals should be allowed to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst claims that outside the agreement, its afternoon Examiner
would be an economically failing firm and that as a result it may
buy the Chronicle and sell or close The Examiner without violating
antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Walker issued two orders, one page each, and asked
one question aimed at the contentions.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, Walker asked the lawyers to brief him on the
validity of a restriction in the joint operating agreement that, in
effect, bars the owners of each paper from selling to any other
firm operating a paper within 60 miles of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The question also asked the lawyers to address another
restriction that gives each partner the ``right of first refusal,''
or the chance to outbid any potential buyer of the other partner's
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto contended in an interview Tuesday that Walker should
disallow the two restrictions on the ground that they have nothing
to do with operating the newspapers or serving the purposes of the
Newspaper Preservation Act.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed the clauses violated antitrust law because they were
designed for ``fencing out competitors'' who might otherwise buy
one of the papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's plainly an anti-competitive device,'' said Alioto, who
has argued that Hearst used the provisions to strike a deal to buy
the Chronicle at below-market cost.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge disallowed the restrictions and ordered the
Chronicle put up for resale, companies owning papers within 60
miles could bid for the Chronicle, Alioto said.
</P>
<P>
   These include Knight Ridder, owner of the San Jose Mercury News;
the New York Times, owner of the Santa Rosa Press Democrat; and the
Alameda Newspaper Group, owner of the Oakland Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Halling, a Hearst lawyer, could not be reached for comment.
J. Thomas Rosch, a Chronicle Publishing lawyer, declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's second question asked whether Hearst and Chronicle
Publishing should be allowed to continue their joint operating
agreement, even if Hearst's Examiner could be made into a
financially sound business using changes proposed by the Fang
family.
</P>
<P>
   The Fangs have agreed to buy The Examiner in a deal under which
Hearst would give them a subsidy of up to $66 million over three
years to defray publishing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Fang, publisher of the free San Francisco Independent, has
testified that he believes he can make The Examiner financially
successful by focusing it on city readers and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's question seemed to ask whether a newspaper must remain
a financial failure to continue as a partner in a joint operating
agreement, said David Balabanian, a lawyer for the Fangs.
</P>
<P>
   Balabanian said he believed the Newspaper Preservation Act
specifies only that a paper is failing at the time it enters the
agreement. The Act does not require that the papers continue to be
a failure, he said.

 &HT;    GAME OF POLITICAL CHICKEN LEAVES MEXICANS WONDERING ABOUT
PRESIDENTIAL RACE
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Already buzzing over the hottest election year
ever here, Mexicans have been left guessing whether three fierce
rivals for the presidency will show up for a possible debate Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate most under pressure is conservative party
contender Vicente Fox Quesada, who is running the most successful
opposition campaign in recent Mexican history.
</P>
<P>
   After orchestrating a televised mini-debate with rivals early
Tuesday evening to try to revive a scheduled debate that was
postponed, Fox surprised the public by declaring that he wasn't
sure he would attend a debate his two rivals suggested they hold
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The game of political chicken, some observers here say, could
backfire on Fox if the other candidates show up and he doesn't.
With less than six weeks to go before the July 2 election, polls
are showing that Fox has a shot at defeating Mexico's ruling party,
which has controlled the presidency for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going out to campaign,'' Fox said in a radio broadcast
Wednesday. ``There is no decision yet (on Friday).''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and Institutional
Revolutionary Party candidate Francisco Labastida Ochoa were
supposed to have met Tuesday for the second of two formal televised
debates before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was widely hailed as the winner of the first debate in
April.
</P>
<P>
   The second debate was postponed because neither Cardenas nor
Labastida would agree to Fox's insistence on a more free-wheeling
encounter, with questions from reporters and an improvised speaking
order.
</P>
<P>
   Fox accused Labastida of fearing spontaneity and wanting to
``control'' the debate.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning Fox phoned his rivals while reporters
watched, challenging them to meet personally later that day to
revive the debate. The three showed up at Cardenas' headquarters,
where they squabbled on live television _ an unusually frank event
for Mexico's stodgy political culture.
</P>
<P>
   Fox insisted on going ahead with the debate Tuesday night as
scheduled. ``Today,'' he repeatedly told Cardenas, pointing out
that two television networks pledged to be ready.
</P>
<P>
   But the other candidates said there wasn't time Tuesday to
prepare. If their campaign teams can iron out details, they agreed
to debate Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fox appeared irritated because the president of Mexico's
television-industry association showed up with Labastida to attend
the meeting. The executive, whose group is often criticized as too
pro-Labastida, met privately with Labastida and Cardenas before Fox
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Normally an able spontaneous speaker, Fox appeared stubborn
during the televised meeting, said Joel Estudillo of the Mexican
Institute for Political Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have had some good points, but he wasn't able to get
them across,'' Estudillo said. ``Now he's in a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida attacked Fox's character after the patio debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my years in politics,'' he told reporters, ``I don't
think I've ever seen such a spectacle with such little seriousness
as today.''

FEEDER SCHOOLS IN NORTHEAST FEEL THE PINCH AS IVY LEAGUE
APPLICATIONS RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They attend top high schools in the New York region and the
Northeast, and, within that rarefied group, they are
better-than-average students. Banking on the reputations of their
schools alone, they would most likely have been snapped up by many
of the top colleges they dreamed of attending _ if only they had
applied three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One is a New Yorker about to graduate from a storied New England
boarding school who was rejected by all seven colleges to which he
applied this year _ including Trinity and Tufts _ despite a College
Board score in the high 1300s out of 1,600 and a B-plus average.
</P>
<P>
   Another attends one of the most rigorous prep schools in New
York City, but her record _ a mix of A's and B's and a College
Board score in the mid-1200s _ earned her only one acceptance, at
Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   A third had a straight-A average at a public high school in one
of Long Island's wealthiest communities, a College Board score of
nearly 1400, and extensive volunteer work with the homeless and
disabled, but she was rejected outright, in an early round, by the
University of Pennsylvania. She then applied to only one other
institution, of less cachet, and was immediately accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Though the sting of this exceptionally competitive college
admissions season was felt in homes across the country, it has
often been sharpest in New York, New Jersey and around New England
_ particularly at high schools so well known that their names alone
once provided all the necessary collateral for even a middling
applicant to secure a good spot.
</P>
<P>
   In part, those students most disappointed in the results of
their college quests this year were victims of a simple numbers
problem: applications at places like Harvard, Columbia and
Middlebury are up, but not necessarily the number of seats.
</P>
<P>
   But with the nation's students now able to visit, and apply to,
virtually any college with the click of a mouse, more applications
are streaming into the most prestigious Northeastern universities
from the Midwest, West and South. This is a welcome rain for
colleges looking to broaden their ``geographical diversity,'' but
sometimes it comes at the expense of longtime feeder schools in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were certainly schools that were easier for our students
to get into a year ago that are more difficult now,'' said Carol
Katz, the college adviser at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan,
one of the best public high schools in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are there more disappointments this year?'' Katz added. ``Yes.
What we once thought was a safe school is no longer a good bet. And
what we once thought was a good bet has become more of a long
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz, like her colleagues elsewhere, would speak only in the
blandest generalities about a process that gives so many students
and parents so many sleepless nights. Other advisers would relay
their stories only on the condition of anonymity (theirs and their
students'), given the high emotions involved.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Leana, an education counselor and the former director of
college counseling at Trinity School in Manhattan, said that the
process had become ``a little more pressurized for Manhattanites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When given a choice among equally qualified applicants, these
colleges are more likely to pull in that kid from North Dakota or
the remote part of upstate New York then from the densely
populated, highly qualified New York City pool,'' he said. ``It's
just a different ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, such hand-wringing is as regular a part of each
spring as the emergence of the crocuses, because even the most
skilled counselors are routinely stymied by their attempts to
outthink a process that is, at its root, often arbitrary, with more
than 10 students applying for each seat in the freshman class at
some institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some New York-area high schools detected little dip in
their college tallies this year.
</P>
<P>
   Montclair High School in Montclair, N.J., for example, reported
that its students had fared better in the admissions race this year
than last, at least as measured by the 11 students, out of a
graduating class of 350, bound for Ivy League colleges.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no denying that the competition from within New
York state alone, which often fills more spots than any other state
at top colleges, has tightened in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the 2,900 applications submitted to Columbia
University by New York State students this year represent an
increase of 53 percent since 1997. And, in a finite game of musical
chairs, those New York students are being pitted not only against
one another but also against more applicants from around the
country and the world, who have become convinced that admission to
a top college guarantees nothing less than success in later life.
</P>
<P>
   It is telling that Carol Gill, a college counselor in
Westchester County whose client base once extended no farther than
the 10-mile radius centered on Dobbs Ferry, now regularly consults
with families in Louisville, Ky., and Cleveland, as well as Athens,
Greece, and London.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have an easier time of it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Bass, the editor and publisher of ``The Private School
Insider,'' a monthly newsletter that reports on schools in the
metropolitan region, says that some New York students whose egos
have been battered by Northeastern colleges have wound up looking
farther from home than their predecessors did _ often to
universities like Emory in Atlanta and Vanderbilt in Tennessee,
which, however well regarded, are not the applicants' first
choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point being made,'' Bass said, ``is that you just can't
say anymore, `This is my safe school.' You have to want to go to
all of the schools.''

&HT;     BIDDERS FOR WOMEN'S SOCCER LEAGUE AGREE TO COMBINE EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHELLE SMITH  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There will be only one women's professional
soccer league going forward after all.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA), which put in its
bid with U.S. Soccer to run the league last winter, will work with
the cooperation of Major League Soccer to get their league off the
ground next spring.
</P>
<P>
   MLS was expected to put its own bid to run a league, but has
backed off that plan and will help the WUSA with their efforts
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came very close and had our bid application ready to go,''
said MLS commissioner Don Garber. ``But at the 11th hour we had a
meeting of the minds that makes sense. This agreement is simple and
practical and the entire soccer community believes this
relationship makes a whole lot of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The two entities will collaborate on marketing, promotion,
scheduling and development of soccer-specific stadium sites. There
are also preliminary plans of joint efforts for expansion and
co-ownership of teams.
</P>
<P>
   The WUSA is scheduled to debut in April 2001 in eight cities:
Atlanta, Boston, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Diego, San
Francisco and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. team member Carla Overbeck spoke for her teammates _ all 20
players backed the WUSA plan from the start _ in expressing relief
that there will be no divisive competition for the right to launch
the women's league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are excited (the WUSA) is the plan that's going through
with help from the MLS side,'' Overbeck said. ``As we've seen with
other women's pro sports, having two leagues is not what's best for
the game or its growth. The plan we were hoping they would sanction
is going to move forward with the experience the MLS brings to the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth of both the men's and women's professional games in
the United States is in the common interest of both parties. MLS is
in its fifth season, and the WUSA hopes to benefit from that
operating experience.
</P>
<P>
   The men's league, on the other hand, would like to take
advantage of the corporate media support the WUSA has amassed. The
WUSA is backed by Time Warner, Comcast, Discovery Communications
and Cox Communications, and already has a television deal in place
with TNT and CNN-SI. The MLS will be offered advertising time on
those media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very mutual agreement with both benefiting from the
strengths of the other,'' said WUSA chairman John Hendricks.
``There is equal value on both sides. We are offering multimillion
dollars worth of media time and we will benefit from the years of
operation of MLS.''

WITH 245 POUNDS TO LOSE, HIS WAY WAS THE SUBWAY

<P>
   Jared Fogle blames fast food, and lots of it, for the extra 245
pounds he lugged around for years.
</P>
<P>
   He credits fast food, specifically Subway sandwiches, for
helping him shed those 245 pounds and go from a 60-inch waist to a
34 in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now known as ``The Subway Diet Guy'' and ``Subway Sandwich
Man,'' Fogle, 22, graduated this month from Indiana University, is
beginning a new job as a pricing analyst with American Trans Air,
has a great girlfriend and is a friendly, self-confident young man.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months after losing all that weight, he's still at the
190 pounds he wants to be and is still surprised at all the
attention he has received since his dieting success made the front
page of his college newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The story caught the attention of ``Men's Health'' magazine,
which published it with a collection of ``Crazy Diets that Work.''
Then someone at Subway's corporate office saw the magazine and
contacted Fogle about making a commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never have imagined people would care so much and be
so interested in me and how I lost the weight,'' Fogle says. ``I
knew my family and friends would be happy about it, but it's become
a craze. I've been interviewed by the BBC and reporters from
Australia and Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogle says Subway ``helped save my life and start over,'' but
those sandwiches were also part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In his fast-food heyday, he lived next door to a Subway shop,
and several times a week would eat his favorite foot-long steak and
cheese sub with double meat, double cheese, heavy on the mayo,
along with regular chips, a large soft drink and maybe a cookie or
two.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that a lot of pizzas, cheeseburgers, french fries and
tacos, and he had a real problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lack of movement and a lot of late-night pizza. It
was never about beer. I never partied,'' Fogle says. ``I never
really had a social life.''
</P>
<P>
   He painfully recalls how he spent a lot of time figuring out how
to avoid anything that might be embarrassing. When he went
anywhere, he parked as far away as he could walk so no one would
see him trying to get out of the car, and he chose college classes
based on the type of seating available.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked into a restaurant, I would scan the seating to
see if there was a place I could fit into or if I should insist on
going somewhere else. I was so scared of being embarrassed,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   One day, when he stopped by the sandwich shop to pick up a
takeout (he couldn't fit into a booth), Fogle noticed a sign
promoting ``Seven Under Six,'' the company's seven subs with less
than 6 grams of fat.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly calculated the fat and calories involved and decided
on a new diet: a 6-inch turkey sub for lunch, loaded with ``tons of
lettuce, green peppers, banana peppers, jalapeno peppers and
pickles, topped with spicy mustard _ no cheese or mayo'' _ with a
package of baked chips and a diet soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   For dinner, he had a foot-long vegetable sub and another diet
drink _ fewer than 1,100 calories each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would switch off between whole wheat and white bread,
deciding on which one had baked up to look bigger that day,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   He knew he was losing weight, but didn't know how much until he
went home to Indianapolis to visit his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hadn't seen me in two months, and they were amazed,''
says Fogle, whose father is a doctor, a general practitioner. ``My
dad took me to his office to weigh, and neither of us could believe
it. There were tears in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   In two months, the Subway Diet Man had lost 95 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   After that visit, he weighed and had blood work done each time
he was home. His cholesterol dropped, and all his other blood
counts remained good.
</P>
<P>
   Fogle began walking to his nearby college classes.
</P>
<P>
   Before the initial loss, he says, he often fell asleep in class
and could barely move around, much less exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard at first. I would get really hungry, but I knew I
was doing something good for myself, and I was determined,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Fogle stuck with the diet, ``cheating'' only a couple of times,
including Thanksgiving Day 1998, when he ate turkey and dressing,
no gravy, and a small dessert.
</P>
<P>
   He says he knew it was time to quit when he reached his goal of
180 _ 245 pounds down from the initial 425 _ and felt he was just
too thin for his 6-foot-2 frame.
</P>
<P>
   He deliberately regained 10 pounds, then went on a cruise to St.
Thomas, St. Martin and the Bahamas to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   He says he still eats several low-fat Subway sandwiches a week,
but he usually doesn't have to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time he completed the diet, in March 1999, he met
his girlfriend, Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be together for quite a while,'' he says.
``She's the greatest reward of all. If it were not for the weight
loss, I might not have ever met her,'' Fogle says. ``I think this
was the way I was supposed to be. I was just hidden while I was
that heavy.''

EVERETT MAKES RELUCTANT RETURN TO NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carl Everett begins the discussion by claiming that he does not
speak to New York reporters, then turns to a befuddled Boston Red
Sox teammate for confirmation that it has been three years since he
did an interview with anyone from New York. When Everett is
reminded of an article in a New York newspaper two months ago, the
new villain for New York Yankees fans insists that he must have
been quoted from a group interview.
</P>
<P>
   As Everett declines to be interviewed, he talks about his
reasoning. It is not totally clear if Everett is serious about
being silent, but he seems rather serious. Finally, Mike Stanley, a
former Yankee, is asked to mediate, and he assures Everett that he
will be quoted accurately. Seconds later, the verbal faucet is on
and Everett agrees to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Everett explains why he despises the Yankees, who drafted him in
the first round in 1990. He explains why the disparaging remarks he
made about Derek Jeter and Paul O'Neill this spring were
misinterpreted, but he still sounds critical of them. He blames
ignorance for the allegations of child abuse levied against Everett
and his wife while he played for the New York Mets in 1997. He
scoffs at the notion that he will be berated when the Red Sox visit
Yankee Stadium on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about that,'' Everett said earlier this month.
``People can say and do whatever they want. But just don't put your
hands on me. That's all. Don't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't touch Everett. Don't ask Everett about his five children.
Don't try to convince Everett that the Yankees have won three of
the last four World Series in part because they have developed
enormous talent in their minor-league system. That will not jibe
with Everett, who was acquired from the salary-dumping Astros and
has helped turn an already dangerous team into even more of a
contender to dethrone the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez is the king of the hill and Nomar Garciaparra is
the king of the lineup, but Everett has made it three kings on the
Red Sox. That is an accomplishment. Everett has arguably been the
most important acquisition of the off-season in baseball and, with
a .328 average, 13 homers and 37 runs batted in going into Tuesday
night, he already has more home runs than Red Sox center fielders
had all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Everett deserves attention for what he does on the field and,
sometimes, for what he says off it, too. He is the perfect fit for
the Red Sox, and he has endeared himself to fans with his hits, his
hustle and his hatred of things New York. The Yankees-Red Sox
rivalry never needs spicing, but Everett might hate the Yankees
more than fans who have endured dreary Octobers for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people wonder why I dislike the Yankees,'' he said.
``There were people there who didn't want to help you. There were
people who didn't want me to succeed in the minor leagues. They
worked for the organization when I was there. They were envious
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett did not specify whom he was referring to, and Mark
Newman, the Yankees' vice president for baseball operations who was
a minor-league coordinator then, did not return a message. But
Everett, who turns 29 next month, said he never wanted to be
drafted by the Yankees out of Hillsborough High School in Tampa,
Fla. Since he never rose above Class A in three years with the
Yankees, he was glad to be picked by Florida in the 1992 expansion
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew if you came up in their farm system, it was slim
or none that you were going to make it,'' he said. ``I wanted to go
somewhere else and show what I could do. It didn't matter what I
did in the Yankee system, it wasn't going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   When Everett was reminded that the Yankees have excelled because
of home-grown players like Jeter, Bernie Williams, Mariano Rivera,
Andy Pettitte, Ramiro Mendoza and Jorge Posada, he shook his head.
Instead, Everett mentioned how it took Shane Spencer nine years to
get to the majors and how Ricky Ledee is ``as good a hitter as
anyone'' and cannot get established.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you weren't there,'' he said, ``you might not understand
how I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Understanding Everett can be a challenge. Less than a month into
spring training this year, Everett said the Yankees win even though
they do not have superstars. When a reporter asked about Jeter,
Everett said Jeter is not a superstar because he does not change
games in an instant. Everett listed Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey
Jr. as superstars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want to misinterpret me saying he's not a superstar,
go ahead,'' Everett said. ``He's a great player, a good player.
But, if I'm a pitcher, I'm not worried about him hitting a
three-run homer or changing the outcome of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter handled Everett's barbs with aplomb, saying: ``Everyone is
entitled to his opinion. But what about the stuff he said about
O'Neill?''
</P>
<P>
   Everett ran his finger across his throat in a slicing motion in
March as his way of saying the 37-year-old O'Neill was done. But
Everett tried to recant his criticism of O'Neill, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said when a guy is getting at the end of his career, he has
to work harder to get where he wants,'' he said. ``That was left
out, and it looked like I was dogging O'Neill.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill chuckled over the criticism and said he cared only about
what Manager Joe Torre said about him. Still, O'Neill, a proud
player who has become more age-sensitive, might have been playing
coy, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everett is having a great year for them,'' he added. ``Isn't
he?''
</P>
<P>
   He is. Everett is immersed in Boston and is happy that he signed
a three-year, $21 million contract extension. He usually stops
outside the players' entrance at Fenway Park and signs autographs.
Four other Red Sox players breezed by without signing autographs
earlier this month, but Everett signed and posed for pictures for
15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every place I've played, Boston outweighs them in terms of fan
support,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As chatty as Everett eventually was, he was brief when asked
about having allegations of child abuse brought against him and his
wife, Linda, in 1997. A child-care worker at Shea Stadium noticed
bruises on one of Everett's children, Shawna, who was 5 years old,
and she and Carl, who was 4, were placed in city custody while
Everett and his wife went to Queens Family Court.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled that Linda, Shawna's stepmother, used
``excessive corporal punishment'' and that Carl failed to take
``appropriate action.'' The couple had to attend parenting classes
and undergo mental health evaluations before their son was returned
to them, but Shawna was ordered to live with a grandmother. Everett
blames that situation on New York, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people do things to hurt others, and they don't care,''
he said. ``Even if they were wrong, they say, `Oh well.' That was
the case with me in New York. That's what people did to me. I had
to deal with all of that garbage when I was in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett visits again this weekend, but only because he must.

&HT;     MILITARY INTRODUCES A NEW, HIGH-TECH `TEXAN' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Texan is back.
</P>
<P>
   Decades after the AT-6 ``Texan'' was used to train Army Air
Corps and Navy pilots during World War II, a new plane with a
similar name landed Tuesday at Randolph Air Force Base in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The T-6A ``Texan II'' was billed as a cheaper, quieter and
friendlier aerobatic alternative to the aging T-37 ``Tweet,'' a
small jet-powered craft that has been the service's prime trainer
the past 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aircraft is very student-friendly, it's very
instructor-friendly, and it's very environmentally friendly,'' said
Gen. Lloyd W. ``Fig'' Newton, head of the Randolph-based Air
Education and Training Command.
</P>
<P>
   The T-6A was unveiled before a crowd of 350 at Randolph. A T-37,
the original T-6 and a Navy T-34 were parked on a runway ramp
behind the dais, with a model of the new T-6 flanking the podium.
The audience cheered as the plane buzzed over the runway and banked
to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Michael Bucchi, chief of naval air training at Corpus
Christi Naval Air Station, called the plane ``the perfect trainer
for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department has ordered 740 T-6As at a total cost of
$4 billion. The planes will replace the T-37 by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Built in Wichita, Kan., by Raytheon Aircraft, the T-6A sports a
single turboprop engine, a pressurized cabin, stepped tandem
cockpit, all-digital avionics and ejection seats that can be used
on the runway _ vast improvements over the T-37, AETC spokesman
Dave Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to read across the cockpit like in the Tweet
and start switching knobs,'' said Lt. Col. Steve Van Sciver, an
18-year Air Force veteran who began his career with training in the
T-37. ``Everything's right in front of you or easily within reach
for the biggest and the smallest person.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texan's cabin is flexible, capable of accommodating men and
women of all sizes, a major development given the growing role of
women in the services.
</P>
<P>
   If it feels like a luxury car in the cabin, the T-6A is a fuel
miser on the road. The old T-37 has a range of 460 miles and
guzzles 152 gallons per hour. The T-6A, though, can fly 1,000 miles
on one tank and burns just 71 gallons per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The plane will be jointly used by the Air Force and Navy, which
have ordered 372 and 339 Texan IIs, respectively. Another 29 T-6As
have been ordered for use in Air Force-Navy navigator training
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bucchi said the Texan would boost the ``confidence and
competence of its warriors'' as they learn to fly. But the T-6 is
likely to be noticed less as instructor pilots learn their trade at
Randolph, thanks to its quiet Pratt &AMP; Whitney engine.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the Tweet's high-pitch, the Texan had a warm, even
pleasant buzz the crowd could talk over.

NEW YORK TO ASK JUDGE TO SUSPEND TOUR BUS LINE AFTER FATALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By C.J. CHIVERS and JUAN FORERO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City officials said Tuesday that they would
ask a judge to suspend the license of New York Apple Tours
immediately, a day after one of its double-decker tour buses
fatally struck a 71-year-old pedestrian in Midtown, an accident
that once again set off concerns about a company with a long record
of environmental, safety and traffic violations.
</P>
<P>
   New York Apple Tours, which operates scores of buses out of
Midtown Manhattan, rapidly increased its business during the city's
tourism boom of the 1990s, operating a sort of London-on-the-Hudson
tour of New York from its familiar red double-decker buses.
</P>
<P>
   But as the company has expanded, it has been the subject of a
growing number of complaints, and since October the city's
Department of Consumer Affairs has been trying to revoke its
license, citing a pattern of abuses of city, state and federal
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota said Tuesday that at the next
regularly scheduled hearing in the matter, set for Thursday before
Administrative Law Judge Judith Gould, the city would seek the
immediate suspension of the company's license, pending the outcome
of the case. In the accident on Monday, the driver was not licensed
to operate a bus and was driving on a residential street where
buses are generally not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were moving against them because of the number of traffic
violations and the number of accidents they have had,'' Lhota said
Tuesday. ``The tragedy yesterday is provoking us to take the
revocation hearing that we are going for and ratchet it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's promise of action came as a second driver for the
company was cited by the police for driving without a license in a
case separate from the accident on Monday, which killed Randolph
Walter, an actor.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Dwyer, a lawyer for Apple Tours, said, ``Our hearts go
out to the family and friends of the victim.'' The company could
not discuss specific allegations, Dwyer said, but he said Apple
Tours was cooperating with investigators looking into the accident.
He also said the company adheres to safety regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York Apple Tour buses are inspected regularly and pass New
York state Department of Transportation safety inspections every
six months,'' he said. ``We have an excellent safety record, and
our drivers go through a rigorous training course which includes a
driving test, written test, video instruction and medical test.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the city's move to halt the company's operation
immediately was welcomed by those who have long battled Apple
Tours, many of them questioned why the administration took so long.
</P>
<P>
   In its nine years of operation, the company has been the source
of continuous neighborhood and consumer complaints. Since 1996, the
company has received 1,800 nonmoving violations and been in 140
accidents, Lhota said.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been cited by the state for circumventing vehicle
safety inspections, and it pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court
last fall to claiming falsely that 70 double-decker buses imported
from Britain did not have to comply with federal safety and
environmental standards because the vehicles predated those
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a pitched battle since they started to do business
in the City of New York,'' said state Sen. Thomas Duane, who as a
city councilman first proposed legislation in 1994 to keep the
buses off residential streets. ``They've broken every rule and
regulation they could possibly break. They have lied to the
community and us. They've broken every promise. But the city
continued to reward them, with more stops and more permits.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, since residents of Greenwich Village first complained in
1993 about the noise and pollution caused by the company's fleet,
the list of objections has continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1995, the City Department of Consumer Affairs ordered
the company to take all its buses off the streets after the company
was accused of illegally switching permits at state inspections.
The company's buses were back on the road after it paid a $100,000
fine and agreed, among other things, to remove its vice president,
Harry Grant, as an officer.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in September, the company admitted to the U.S. attorney's
office in Newark, N.J., that it had lied about the ages of its
vehicles to avoid meeting federal safety and environmental
standards. The company, which was then based in Fort Lee, N.J.,
pleaded guilty to falsifying documents with three federal agencies,
the Customs Service, the Department of Transportation and the
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Tours had told the agencies the buses were made in 1967
and were therefore exempt from federal safety and emissions
standards, but the buses were actually newer. In a plea agreement,
the company pledged to pay an $800,000 fine and bring its buses
into compliance with federal emissions and safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   However, the company has not paid the fine. Under the plea
agreement, the penalty is to be paid upon sentencing by U.S.
District Judge John Bissell, but the company has not been sentenced
because it has continued to dispute the terms of its plea
agreement, said Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for the U.S.
attorney's office in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Past and current city officials said that the case in New Jersey
gave the city the grounds to begin trying to put the company out of
business, and that the accident strengthened its case.
</P>
<P>
   Jules Polonetsky, who was the city's commissioner of consumer
affairs last fall when the case began, said New York Apple Tours
had been the source of complaints for years. But he said many were
about pollution, parking or traffic violations, and because the
department's mandate is to protect consumers, the complaints did
not directly fall under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   But when the company admitted falsifying documents, he said, it
allowed the city to assemble a much stronger case, incorporating
the federal action with the hodge-podge of city and state
complaints to show that the company was irresponsible and
deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new evidence of their smuggling buses into the county gave
the department grounds to begin a serious license revocation
action,'' Polonetsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing this action, Lhota said complaints from the community
about the city's pace in seeking to close the business were
unfounded. ``The long and the short of it is we actually are in a
revocation hearing right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that in response to Randolph's death, the
city's Traffic Control Division deployed a bus inspection team near
Columbus Circle Tuesday, and the officers arrested Richard Burks,
32, saying he was driving the double-decker bus with a suspended
license.
</P>
<P>
   Burks, who was taken into custody at 3:10 p.m. as tourists were
stepping off the bus at Central Park South and Seventh Avenue, was
held overnight pending an arraignment Wednesday on charge of
aggravated unlicensed operation of a vehicle, said Officer Louis
Cruz, a department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The company also faces the possibility that it will be forced
out of the city's tourism agency, which it joined in 1992 and to
which it has been paying dues ever since.

A COLLEGE LEADS THE WAY IN REQUIRING ONLINE APPLICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By LISA GUERNSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using the Internet to apply to college has become a popular
option among high school seniors over the past few years. But
online applications have always been just that _ an option.
</P>
<P>
   If students wanted to rely on typewriters or their own
handwriting, they could fill out paper forms.
</P>
<P>
   Now at least one undergraduate institution is doing away with
paper applications. Starting this fall, West Virginia Wesleyan
College will be requiring applicants to fill out and send in their
forms online.
</P>
<P>
   A few graduate schools have the same requirement, but according
to Embark.com, the company that is providing the online service,
West Virginia Wesleyan is the first college to make online
applications mandatory for undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   Most colleges have shunned such a requirement because they do
not want to exclude students who do not have easy access to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody may not have equal access to this technology,'' said
Joyce Smith, director of the National Association for College
Admission Counseling. ``There may be some students who are
disadvantaged by the requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials at West Virginia Wesleyan, a private liberal arts
college of 1,500 students in Buckhannon, W.Va., said they were
confident that the requirement would not be a limitation. The
university receives about 1,600 applications a year.
</P>
<P>
   The requirement, university officials said, is part of the
college's push to be technologically advanced.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the college provides laptop computers to every new
student and plans to provide wireless Internet access on campus
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Haden, the college's president, said that admissions
counselors who visit high schools would make their laptop computers
available to students who wanted to fill out applications and that
alumni might be able to provide computer access. He expected that
computers in churches, public libraries and high schools would also
be available.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us the comfort that we can have this requirement
and not have it be a barrier to access,'' Haden said.
</P>
<P>
   The college does not require essays, and officials expect that
most students will be able to fill out the applications in less
than half an hour. Most of the supplementary material included with
admissions applications, like high school transcripts and teacher
recommendations, will still be completed on paper and sent through
the mail, Haden said.
</P>
<P>
   The college has already been criticized by some advocates for
people with disabilities. Some say that online applications have
not been built to work with screen-reading software for the blind
and that they cannot be easily filled out by people who are unable
to operate a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Haden said that the college would find alternatives
for students who could not fill out the online applications because
of disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will work to find solutions to such a situation,'' he said.

UAL TO BUY US AIRWAYS FOR $4.3 BILLION IN CASH 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER FRIEDLIN   
 c. 2000 N.Y. Times.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UAL (UAL:NYSE), parent company of the world's largest airline,
United Airlines, said on Wednesday that it had agreed to acquire US
Airways (U:NYSE) for $4.3 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, UAL will pay $60 a share for all
the outstanding shares of US Airways, the nation's sixth biggest
airline. That represents a premium of 130 percent based on US
Airway's closing price of 26 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of US Airways shot up 23 9/16, or 90 percent, to 49 7/8
in pre-opening trading, according to Instinet. Shares of United,
which closed at 60 3/8 on Tuesday, were not active.
</P>
<P>
   UAL will also assume $1.5 billion of US Airways debt and $5.8
billion in aircraft operating leases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of United and US Airways will deliver
significant benefits to millions of passengers and hundreds of
communities throughout the United States,'' the companies said in a
joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   In order to assuage any concerns regarding the possibility of
diminished competition in certain markets, United said it has plans
to sell some of its assets to a US Airways board member, Robert
Johnson. Johnson, the founder, chairman and chief executive of BET
Holdings II, would then create a new airline, to be called DC Air,
which would operate out of Washington Reagan National Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The companies did not disclose how much Johnson would be paying
for the carrier's assets.
</P>
<P>
   UAL and US Airways said they expected to complete the deal in
2001. The purchase will be accretive to United's earnings in the
second year following the closing, the companies said.

MERRILL LYNCH TO PAY SUMITOMO $275 MILLION SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUSTIN DINI   
 c. 2000 N.Y. Times.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch(MER:) said Wednesday it would pay Sumitomo, the
Japanese banking company, $275 million to settle losses run-up as a
result of unauthorized copper trades made by a chief copper trader
at Sumitomo. The deal marks the end to a long-running dispute
between the two companies. ``We are very pleased to be able to
resolve this matter without resorting to extensive and protracted
litigation,'' the companies said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, in which Merrill admits no
wrongdoing, Sumitomo will release the financial services giant from
any further claims stemming from the roughly $2.6 billion in losses
the bank suffered from unauthorized trading. Sumitomo has sued four
other companies -- UBS AG, Chase Manhattan Bank(CMB:NYSE), JP
Morgan &AMP; Co.(JPM:NYSE) and Credit Lyonnais Rouse -- for more than
$1.7 billion, contending they knew or should have known about the
unauthorized conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Sumitomo did not sue New York-based Merrill Lynch. Last year,
Merrill agreed to pay $15 million to settle a complaint in the case
brought by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission without
admitting or denying the charges. The firm also agreed to pay $10.5
million to resolve a similar action brought by the London Metal
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement stems from the trading in copper
futures by Yasuo Hamanaka, the Sumitomo rogue trader known as ``Mr.
Five Percent'' for his rumored control of that percentage of the
world's copper market. Hamanaka is now serving an eight-year term
after pleading guilty to criminal charges for forgery and fraud in
Japan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Sumitomo sent the price of copper plunging when it
disclosed the unauthorized trading by Hamanaka.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill said the $275 million that it agreed to pay Sumitomo
will not have a material impact on second-quarter earnings because
``it has substantially provided for the settlement.''

GOD SAVE THE QUEEN, AND ALL OF HER SCREENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHAEL POLLAK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Want to peek at a family Web site crammed with murder,
treachery, blood-lust, centuries-long feuds, torture, insanity and
whole dungeonfuls of assorted other skeletons? The British monarchy
is just the ticket (www.royal.gov.uk).
</P>
<P>
   Not the current entries, of course. Since the royal family
entered cyberspace in 1997 to help satisfy the public's insatiable
curiosity, its official Web realm has compiled a ream's worth of
stars and garters, palaces and Plantagenets. But there is more on
the site about the two-penny Tyrian plum stamp of 1910 in the royal
philatelic collection than about Sarah Ferguson. (Only one canceled
copy of each is known to exist.)
</P>
<P>
   The pages devoted to Diana, Princess of Wales, are suitably
prominent, reverential and respectful. The pages detailing a
typical day in the life of the queen depict a very wealthy, very
earnest, very busy woman. But the mountains of minutiae seem to
highlight the obvious omissions, and to make them more poignant.
Duty. Dedication. Few tears. Little joy.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Insight, the site's online magazine, highlights important
engagements of the month. It will not be mistaken for a tabloid.
(May's feature: visiting the Chelsea flower show.) There is enough
data about castles, remodeling, acreage, equerries, swan upping,
royal mews and queen's beasts to put even the most ardent
monarchist to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The casual viewer who scans the site quickly for the trivia will
unearth some gems:
</P>
<P>
   Prince William began his education at Mynor's Nursery School in
September 1985, at age 3.
</P>
<P>
   The last Welsh Prince of Wales was Llywelyn ap Gruffyd
(1246-82).
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's oldest child, Victoria, the Princess Royal, was the
mother of Kaiser Wilhelm II.
</P>
<P>
   The royal train has two locomotives. They are named Prince
William and Prince Henry.
</P>
<P>
   The royal stamp collection (beloved especially by George V)
includes what is believed to be the personal stamp album of the
murdered Czarevitch Aleksei, heir to the Russian throne. The
brightly illustrated child's album was stolen by a Bolshevik
soldier and sold to an employee of a British company in the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Britannia was the 83rd royal yacht.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth I attended the premiere of ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   George III's interest in botany earned him the nickname Farmer
George. (No mention of the nicknames he was given on this side of
the pond.)
</P>
<P>
   The site also has some unintentionally funny writing. ``George
III is widely remembered for two things: losing the American
colonies and going mad. This is far from the whole truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the royal site is the deep past, starting with
the Anglo-Saxon kings of Wessex. There are longer profiles of
notable monarchs like Alfred the Great, William the Conqueror,
Henry VIII (who wrote a best seller defending the Roman Catholic
Church, before all that marital unpleasantness changed things) and
Charles I (he stammered). As a capsule British history, the site
isn't bad, as long as you don't look for too much information on
how the common people lived.
</P>
<P>
   But for incomparable mayhem, nothing beats the history of the
Scottish crown. Here is a sample from 962 to 1005: Dubh was killed
by Culen who was killed by Riderch, king of Strathclyde, whose
daughter he had seized. He was succeeded by Kenneth II, Dubh's
brother, who killed Culen's brother and was killed by Culen's son,
Constantine. Constantine's reign was short; he was killed, probably
by Kenneth III. Kenneth was killed and succeeded by Malcolm II.
</P>
<P>
   The glory of Britain isn't its pomp, but its language and its
ideals. The speeches of some of its monarchs ring out from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth I to her army on the eve of the Spanish Armada: ``I
know I have the body of a weak, feeble woman; but I have the heart
and stomach of a king _ and of a king of England, too.''
</P>
<P>
   James I proclaims an attitude: ``Kings are justly called gods,
for that they exercise a manner of resemblance of divine power on
earth.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of Parliament at the time of the Glorious Revolution of
1688, on the importance of making William and Mary and future
monarchs financially dependent on the legislative body: ``When
princes have not needed money, they have not needed us.''

EUROPEAN UNION DECIDES TO CONTINUE BAN ON SOME U.S. BEEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The European Union decided Wednesday to
extend its ban of beef produced with growth hormones, rejecting
demands by the United States and the World Trade Organization to
lift the prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   The decision re-ignites an ideologically charged battle between
cattle ranchers in the United States, most of whom use hormones to
speed up beef production, and European consumers who generally
distrust the use of hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three years ago, the World Trade Organization ruled that
the European prohibition was illegal because it was not based on
scientific evidence that hormones endanger human health.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, European officials in Brussels, Belgium, released
a new review of scientific studies that concluded that one popular
hormone causes cancer and that others are ``likely'' to pose
increased health risks.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with that opinion, European trade and health officials
proposed a new ban on hormone-treated beef that they said would
satisfy the global trade authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this proposal will bring us into line with the
WTO's findings and definitively resolve this dispute,'' said
Anthony Gooch, a spokesman for the trade ministry of the European
Commission, the European Union's executive body.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they were not impressed with the Europeans'
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were of the view from the beginning that they didn't have
the science to back them up, and we don't see any new science
now,'' said a U.S. official in Brussels Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is currently imposing punitive tariffs of $117
million a year, an amount the World Trade Organization says is
equal to the lost U.S. beef exports, on European products ranging
from Danish ham to Italian tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to ratchet up the pressure, President Clinton recently
signed legislation requiring U.S. trade officials to rotate the
penalties to different industries every six months.
</P>
<P>
   There is little likelihood the two sides will reach an accord
any time soon, in part because many Europeans have a deep mistrust
of anything that smacks of genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, farmers from Scandinavia to Britain and Italy
found themselves in the middle of a political uproar after a
company admitted that it had accidentally mixed a small percentage
of genetically modified rapeseed from Canada into seed shipments
sold across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Genetically modified crops are common in the United States and
Canada, and only about .4 percent of the seeds mixed into the
shipments that arrived in Europe appear to have been genetically
modified. Nevertheless, the slip infuriated officials in several
countries, and Swedish farm regulators went so far as to order
farmers to destroy the tainted crops.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over beef hormones could easily become a major test
case in future trade disputes based on real or perceived health
risks.
</P>
<P>
   Under international trade agreements, countries are only allowed
to impose trade restrictions based on health concerns if those
concerns are backed up by scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. trade officials, echoing the views of U.S. cattle farmers,
have argued that there is no evidence that beef produced with
hormones poses special health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, they argue that growth hormones are
naturally present in beef and other foods and that two pounds of
hormone-treated beef has about the same amount of growth hormone as
an ordinary egg.
</P>
<P>
   European officials, prodded by persistent anxiety among
consumers, have argued that there are many reasons to be worried.
After protracted hearings, the World Trade Organization ruled that
European officials had not made their case and deemed the ban
illegal in 1997.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wednesday's report, from a scientific committee organized by the
European Union, said there is evidence that high doses of the
hormone 17 beta oestriadol has carcinogenic effects and that five
other hormones may have effects on the development of sexual
organs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation proposed Wednesday, the European Union
would impose a permanent ban on beta oestriadol and ``provisional''
bans on the other five hormones, pending the outcome of future
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists acknowledged that the evidence of health risks is
based on exposure to very high doses of hormones. But they also
warned that there is ``no compelling evidence suggesting that these
effects do not also occur at low doses.''
</P>
<P>
   They said continuous exposure to low doses of hormones is likely
to add to long-term health risks but that this risk ``as yet,
cannot be quantified.''

 &HT;    13-YEAR-OLD IS A WORLD CLASS CHAMP IN NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC BEE
 &HT;    By MIRIAM GARCIA
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He hasn't traveled widely, but the 13-year-old
winner of the National Geographic Bee proved Wednesday that he
knows a lot about the world.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Peng of Guilford, Conn., took first prize _ a $25,000
scholarship _ by correctly naming the three largest sections of
Denmark: Jutland, the nation's mainland peninsula, and Sjaelland
and Fyn, its two largest islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel relieved. It's finally over,'' Felix said after waving
the scholarship check in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Felix said that during the final rounds, he felt as stiff as the
answer cards he held in his hands as he battled two other
finalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to do any more tie-breakers. I was nervous,''
Felix said.
</P>
<P>
   Second place winner George Thampy, 12, of suburban St. Louis,
received a $15,000 scholarship and third place winner Jonathan
Janus, 13, of Ravenel, S.C., won a $10,000 scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   The final round had been narrowed to 10 male contestants from
the 55 who started Tuesday, of which only two were female. The
11-to-15-year- old students represented the 50 states, the District
of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Pacific
Territories and schools at U.S. military bases around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The National Geographic Society created the contest 12 years ago
to reawaken the nation's interest in geography and increase its
curriculum in American schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not geography nerds, these are bright multitalented
students,'' said Alex Trebek, the emcee of the competition who
hosts the popular television program, ``Jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Felix's interest in geography was ignited at the age of two when
he began to open books, said his father Richard Peng, a 47-year-old
dentist. ``He started looking at books and maps before he could
even talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Felix's parents were born in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Felix placed 19th last year and was determined to take the first
prize this year, his father added.
</P>
<P>
   In this week's competition, contestants sometimes answered
questions before Trebek was finished asking them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows a great deal. I have respect for the kind of
education the kids are obtaining,'' Trebek said.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the final contestants were home-schooled, including the
second and third place winners.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-place finisher Robert Schleifer, 14, of Gillsville, Ga.,
is among those home-schooled. His mother, Tina, a microbiologist
and homeschool teacher, said she worked extensively with him to
ensure his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children have been able to concentrate on the areas they
want and (they) excel. We just want to give them the best education
we can,'' she said.

   It was the smell I missed the most. That delicious, woodsy,
slightly acidic odor that flooded my memory with images of printing
presses and the ratcheting clatter of teletype machines and the
sight of a newsroom littered with cups of stale coffee and lazy
clouds of swirling cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   I know. I know. Newspapers now have separate printing plants.
Teletype machines have long been gone. And smoking is a major
no-no.
</P>
<P>
   But those feelings and memories, caught up in the smell of
newsprint, were what I missed the most in the past five months. On
Jan. 1, as an experiment, I canceled my newspaper subscriptions. I
usually read a local weekly, a local daily and, from the newsstands
a few times a week, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.

<P>
   I also limited my exposure to regular television news during the
experiment. I'd occasionally catch the network news and snippets of
my local news while I ate dinner, but not much more. I frankly
didn't miss television at all. But then, even though I work in
television, I have seldom watched it. Television is too passive. I
just don't have time to stop everything and sit still for a TV
newscast.
</P>
<P>
   From Jan. 1, until recently, I surfed the Web several times a
day, reading the electronic editions of my regular papers and
several others.
</P>
<P>
   Let me tell you: For a guy who has devoted the last few years of
his professional life preaching new media and the Internet, I am
amazed at how frustrated I was without my printed newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   I missed it. The crinkly feel of it. The sheer enjoyment and
relaxation it brought me when I would sit in my big, comfy blue
leather chair and read it by a crackling fire. I can't tell you how
many times I wished I had had it with me in the bathroom, too.
</P>
<P>
   All those things are subjective. I guess I'm a lot more of a
touchy-feely guy that I thought I was.
</P>
<P>
   On an objective level, in terms of the main goal of my decidedly
unscientific but personal experiment, I can say with certainty that
after five months of consuming only online news, I didn't miss very
much.
</P>
<P>
   I read all I wanted and then some about Elian. I probably have a
better sense of the ups and downs of the markets because of the
immediacy of online market coverage. I know about the corrupt cops
in Los Angeles. I'm well aware that Rudy Giuliani has prostate
cancer and that Matt Drudge released the e-mail addresses of 300
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But still, there was this gnawing concern that I had somehow
missed something. For five months I had this vague, restless worry
that I was ignorant. Online news left me unsatisfied. Incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Every day I would try to read _ if that's what scrolling up and
down a computer screen can be called _ the online editions of The
New York Times and The Washington Post, as well as CNN.com,
ABCNews.com and the Web edition of my local papers, The Detroit
Free Press and The Detroit News.
</P>
<P>
   I subscribed to a free news-alert service from MSNBC that beeps
and flashes a little red dot on the computer screen whenever major
news breaks. The Saturday morning that Elian was taken by
immigration service agents, the beeping woke me up and I trudged in
the dark to my home office to read, at 5:50 a.m., what all the
commotion was about.
</P>
<P>
   I used a service called AvantGo to download news from a variety
of other sources directly onto my Palm handheld computer. The only
time I found it worthwhile was when I was on an airplane, jammed in
the middle seat between two huge businessmen. There was no room to
turn the pages of a real newspaper, let alone a magazine.
</P>
<P>
   So I whipped out my Palm and, with my arms all scrunched
together, tap-tap-tapped with the stylus to make my way through the
news I had downloaded before leaving home. The guy on my right
wasn't very happy. ``Do you have to keep making that noise?'' he
grumbled. There was the slightest little beep every time the stylus
hit the scroll bar, and it apparently kept him from sleeping. On my
shoulder. Tough. I kept tapping.
</P>
<P>
   I also tried reading online news on a wireless Qualcomm phone
billed as Web-enabled. It was ridiculous. The screen is so small
that at best, you can read half a headline. ``Firefighters race''
(turn the thumb-wheel) ``high winds'' (turn the thumb-wheel) ``in
Los Alamos'' (turn the thumb-wheel) ``blaze.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew. To read the morning paper on one of these is to risk a
repetitive stress injury to the thumb. Besides, as with the Palm
VII wireless communicator that I also experimented with, it often
took three to four minutes to make a wireless connection to the
news server, then a couple of minutes longer to download the Web
pages. By then, it was barely news anymore. I don't have the
patience for wireless news.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I couldn't get online:
</P>
<P>
   _ Local news: Even though I read the online editions of the
local papers, they didn't feel local. I had to really hunt to find
articles of local interest. On a computer screen, with just links
of a uniform size for navigating, there is a lack of perspective
about what's important. And it's often hard to distinguish between
local and world news on a computer screen. My wife, who is very new
to the Internet, never did get the hang of finding local news.
``It's all a big jumble,'' she said, clicking off the Net in
disgust one night. I sometimes had to resort to printing out
articles from the online edition of my local paper to appease her.
</P>
<P>
   _ Serendipity: I really missed the surprise of a newspaper.
Leisurely turning the pages of a newspaper and finding delightful,
fascinating little articles that are just, well, there. Articles I
just ran across, instead of having to click on. Sometimes I found
that online. But not often. I logged on for quick hits of
information and then clicked off. Reading on the Web may be called
``browsing,'' but it always seemed hurried to me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Advertising: This was a real issue with my wife. She missed
several big sales at the local department store. Flower Day at the
local farmer's market happened without her this year. Newspaper
coupons that would have saved her money at the supermarket went
unclipped. I am convinced that this is why newspapers need not
worry about becoming extinct. Advertising is more than just ads.
Coupons are a sort of currency. Advertising is just as much news as
a bylined article. I don't think I ever found a banner ad on an
Internet site that interested me enough to click on it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Convenience: There is no getting around the fact that reading
news online is cumbersome. You have to sit down at a computer, log
on to the Net and click and scroll, all the while sitting in a
chair that is not nearly so comfortable as the easy chair out in
the family room. Online is too formal, I have decided. With a
newspaper, it's right there. Put it down. Go to the fridge for a
Diet Pepsi. Come back. Pick it up. Put it down. Stuff it in your
briefcase. Rip out an article and paste it on the family bulletin
board.
</P>
<P>
   _ Impact: This is tough to describe. Somehow, I remember stuff
better when I read it on paper. That is probably the result of my
conditioning and may not be a problem with younger people raised on
the Net. But with a newspaper, it's easier to go back and reread an
article that you saw last week, if it hasn't been used to wrap up
the garbage or been tossed in the recycling bin. I bookmarked some
interesting Web articles, but they were never as easy to find as my
stack of newspapers used to be. And whenever I used to look at the
stack of newspapers piled on the lower shelf of the end table in my
family room, I felt secure, deep down, that if I needed
information, it was there.
</P>
<P>
   Again, this experiment was personal and anecdotal. I have
resubscribed to my old papers, starting June 1. I can't wait to
walk down the driveway at sunup once again, serenaded by the birds,
and pull the morning daily out of the bright yellow tube next to my
mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing I'll do is put it to my nose and inhale. Deeply.
Maybe, if I'm lucky, it will even leave a familiar black smudge on
my nose.

MOLECULES ENGINEERED WITH AN INKJET PRINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By IAN AUSTEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When scientists want to build very tiny structures on silicon
chips or other surfaces, they usually have to figure out how to
nudge atoms and molecules into the right shape _ and that can mean
building a special factory for $100 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists at Sandia National Laboratories say they have
found a way to do the same thing by putting molecules into a
solution that is squirted onto various surfaces with an inkjet
printer to form patterns designed by a computer. Once on the
surface, the molecules assemble themselves into the desired shapes,
with no prodding necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The Sandia scientists call their transparent solutions
``intelligent ink,'' and their approach may turn out to be a
practical way to build the tiny molecular scaffolds called
nanostructures.
</P>
<P>
   Nanotechnology, the production of these tiny structures, could
someday have as big an impact on technology as silicon-based
microelectronics has. Such extremely tiny creations could lead to
the making of computer chips that would be thousands of times more
powerful than the chips available now. They could also lead to
chips that merge biology and microelectronics to create, in effect,
biochemical labs no bigger than a microchip that could analyze
drops of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligent ink could put such technology within the reach of
researchers without big budgets, said Dr. C. Jeffrey Brinker, the
senior scientist who leads the Sandia research team. ``I wanted to
make it a power-to-the-people sort of thing,'' said Brinker, a
materials scientist who is also a professor at the University of
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Nanotechnology researchers work on building objects that are 1
to 100 nanometers wide (a human hair is typically 10,000 nanometers
thick or less). To outsiders, they may seem to be trying to build
ships in a bottle, but their motivation is more practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``This work is going to pretty quickly come into the health
field,'' Brinker said. His intelligent ink could be used to build
blood analyzers that would be inexpensive enough for home use, he
added. ``You'd put a drop of blood in,'' Brinker said, ``and it
would be able to know everything about your body and send the
results by telemetry to your doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret behind Brinker's ink is that his molecules behave
much like detergent molecules. While not exactly like the molecules
in a box of Tide, Brinker's silicon-based molecules share one basic
property: one part of each molecule loves water, while the other
hates it. ``They're schizophrenic,'' Brinker said.
</P>
<P>
   In a watery solution, the water-hating part of the molecule
immediately reacts by tucking itself into the center of the
molecule, as far from the water as it can get. That leaves the
water-loving part on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   When the solution containing such molecules is sprayed onto a
surface, the liquid evaporates, leaving the molecules locked into
their nanostructure pattern, connected by nanopores, which form
tiny channels. Such channels could provide a path for light to
follow in an optical computer chip or could function as optical
switches. Or they could provide sensor channels for sophisticated
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Sandia, a Department of Energy laboratory operated by a
subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, may use Brinker's work to create
ultrasensitive sensors for detecting nerve gas and biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Brinker could write out designs using a fountain pen
filled with self-assembling molecules, although the results would
be fairly crude. Instead, he first created patterns for the
nanochannel structures by using PowerPoint software on a personal
computer. He replaced the conventional ink cartridge on a
Hewlett-Packard printer with one holding the self-assembling
molecules in solution. The printer was modified so that it would
print Brinker's patterns on silicon wafers rather than on paper.
</P>
<P>
   The next step for Brinker's research will be to move up to a
color inkjet printer. While his solutions are not really inks, he
will be able to mix and match solutions of different molecules by
using an inkjet printer with four cartridges instead of one. Using
several solutions at a time will let Brinker create complex
structures with tiny pore channels of different sizes.
</P>
<P>
   But the most ambitious goal for Brinker and his printer is an
attempt to marry the biological and digital worlds. His team of
researchers is trying to use the water-loving and water-hating
parts of molecules to surround yeast cells; the entire assembly
could then be printed onto chips.
</P>
<P>
   The pores created by the molecules could be used to deliver food
to cells and whisk away their waste products. Such
biological-digital hybrids could one day be used as exquisitely
sensitive detectors for various molecules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could develop devices with lifelike properties, incredible
sensory abilities,'' Brinker said. While cells inside such gadgets
might live for only a few weeks, the ability to create inexpensive
replacements with printers would make that less of a concern, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   For those who may be inspired to do a little nanostructure
creation at home, a word of warning: Brinker believes that using
his intelligent ink voids all inkjet printer warranties.

&HT;     U.S. ARMY HONORS CREATOR OF `BEETLE BAILEY' CARTOON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Army, often the butt of jokes by the
cartoon strip ``Beetle Bailey,'' awarded its top civilian honor
Wednesday to the cartoon strip's creator, Mort Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Army Secretary Louis Caldera bestowed on Walker the service's
decoration for distinguished civilian service and celebrated the
50th anniversary of the popular strip.
</P>
<P>
   Before presenting the award, Caldera said the cartoonist's
``ingenuity in portraying the Army in a humorous manner has
contributed to the morale of soldiers, past and present, throughout
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The award recognizes not only his comic view of the Army but
also his contributions to the military through the years,'' Caldera
said. ``We also want to recognize his distinguished service in
World War II and his support of the effort to build a World War II
Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who said he was ``deeply honored'' by the award, asked,
``Who said the military doesn't have a sense of humor?''
</P>
<P>
   He said most of the strip's characters ``are based on real-life
people and experiences'' from his service days from 1943 to 1946.
``So I guess I also owe the Army a debt of gratitude for giving me
so much inspiration and fertile material to work with over the
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who lives in Stamford, Conn., and Boca Raton, Fla.,
started the cartoon strip in 1950. Beetle Bailey then was just a
college cut-up, but he stumbled into an Army recruiting station in
1951 and became a military cut-up.
</P>
<P>
   Circulation first began climbing when the Tokyo edition of the
Stars And Strips newspaper, which reports on military news, dropped
the cartoon because it supposedly encouraged a lack of respect for
officers. After the U.S. news media attacked the move, the Bailey
strip quickly added another 100 newspaper clients, according to
King Features, which syndicates the cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, when African-American Lt. Jack Flap appeared as a major
character with Bailey, some southern papers dropped the cartoon,
but, again, 100 more papers signed on, said Caludia Smith, a
spokeswoman for King Features.
</P>
<P>
   The strip's characters _ including Sarge, Gen. Halftrack, Zero
and Miss Buxley _ have inspired dozens of games, toys, puzzles and
greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   The strip, which originally ran in 50 newspapers, is now
distributed by King Features, a part of the Hearst Corporation, to
more than 1,800 newspapers.

   Proliferating knowledge about the Holocaust can cause
horror-overload and shock-fatigue. Historical information and
images intended to deepen our awareness of the horrors sometimes
have a conversely desensitizing effect.
</P>
<P>
   But the very special ``The Last Days,'' an Academy Award-winning
documentary having its TV debut Wednesday night on HBO, breaks
through this barrier. It goes straight to the heart with its
searingly intimate and often poetically detailed and charged
remembrances of five Holocaust survivors. Confronted with this
first feature released by Steven Spielberg's Shoah Foundation, we
can't turn away from even the most ghastly acts of sadism and mass
murder. To do so would seem tantamount to denying the humanity of
the remarkable, resilient men and women at the core of it.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider Renee Firestone's vivid girlhood memories. In a
concentration camp where she had been deported, Renee is given
eyedrops by a Nazi doctor, then confined in a dark dungeon with
other girls. The groundwater rising to their ankles serves as both
latrine and well. The eye medication that blinds some of the young
people for days turns out to be part of a failed experiment in
altering human eye color.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, another Holocaust survivor, California Congressman
Tom Lantos, explains how at the end of the war, the Nazis
constructed special burn pits ``using Jews' own fat as fuel'' to
expedite the Reich's hurry-up killing schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Days'' is the story of the rapid, rabid late 1944
Nazi assault on Hungary's Jewish population. Even as they were
staring at defeat, the Germans speeded up efforts to erase Europe's
remaining Jews. With the aid of indigenous Nazis and cooperative
noncombatants, Hitler's killing machine did to Hungary's Jews in
four months what had taken more than a decade to do to Germany's
Jewish population.
</P>
<P>
   The substance of this unforgettable film is the on-camera
recollections of five Hungarian survivors, all now Americans. The
specificity of personal detail gives their horror stories a
puzzled, deeply human face that wrenches them out of history and
into reality. Never, for example, have the death camp-bound trains
jammed with Jewish families seemed so immediate. A woman remembers
the stink in her bolted-shut and darkened cattle car: The pail
serving as a toilet overflowed with human waste.
</P>
<P>
   There is an unselfconscious eloquence to the way each survivor
expresses him- or herself in accented English, conceivably having
something to do with their shared native tongue. ``They took away
my parents; they took away my identity; they took away my
possessions,'' is Irene Zisblatt's starkly rhythmic recounting of
her one-woman revolution against Nazi oppression. ``There is
something that they want from me, and then I thought of my soul _
and I said, `They're not going to take my soul.' '' She then vowed
to herself to fight and ``not become ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Her resistance was solitary and interior. Lantos and Bill Basch
speak of more conventional, though no less courageous, acts of
resistance. Both worked in the Budapest underground aiding Swedish
diplomat Raoul Wallenberg's efforts to save Hungarian Jews. Both
endured Nazi captivity. Basch, like so many other survivors, is
haunted by his good fortune. ``Why did God spare me?'' he says,
pondering the day he and a friend stepped away from another pal
when told by a Nazi guard either to take a bullet with him or let
him suffer execution alone.
</P>
<P>
   Extraordinary vintage footage _ some of it never seen before _
is woven into ``The Last Days'' to forceful effect. The survivors
describe the almost hallucinatory unreality of their liberation. In
one instance, American soldiers delivered up some German captors
for wobbly death camp survivors to dismember. The five ``Last
Days'' survivors revisit the hometowns from which they were
expelled, often as neighbors heckled them, and they inspect the
painfully familiar death camps they miraculously managed to endure.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the 90-minute film is artfully filmed and
seamlessly edited, and some of the encounters in it will chill you
to the bone. In one, Renne Firestone meets with the German doctor
who in all likelihood subjected her sister Klara to fatal Nazi
medical experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the enormous power of this documentary seems to surge
directly from the survivors themselves, from their almost primal
eloquence and the wisdom they brought back from what one calls,
simply, ``a madman's hell.''

IBM'S NEW THINKPADS: THE LAPTOP BECOMES AN SUV 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a world where nearly everything seems to be getting
miniaturized, the new IBM. Thinkpad T20 portable computer is
traveling in the other direction. If it were any larger, IBM could
have equipped this impressively redesigned laptop with folding legs
and offered it as a card table.
</P>
<P>
   It would be an expensive card table, to be sure, given that the
fastest model starts at about $4,000, not counting the broad array
of options that IBM. is offering for it. But hey, thanks to the
games built into the Windows operating system, this is a card table
that comes with its own game of solitaire.
</P>
<P>
   But in a neat bit of sleight-of-hand, IBM trumps the generous
proportions _ 12 inches by 10 inches, to accommodate a 14-inch
display screen _ by making the T20 surprisingly thin and light, at
about five pounds, including its DVD-ROM drive. And it is not even
the biggest or the most expensive of the new ThinkPads. That honor
goes to the ThinkPad A20p ($3,900), a high-performance portable for
the expense-account crowd, with a 15-inch screen that adds an inch
to the computer in both width and depth.
</P>
<P>
   Another model, the A20m, is aimed at a more budget-conscious
audience, with prices starting at $1,800.
</P>
<P>
   The T20 and A20p models have powerful Intel mobile Pentium III
microprocessors operating at 650 or 700 megahertz, making them
among the most powerful laptops on the planet. (The A20m comes in
models with either an Intel Celeron or Pentium III chip.)
</P>
<P>
   The new ThinkPads really ought to have been called ReThinkPads
because it is clear that in revamping and streamlining its entire
line of laptops, International Business Machines spent considerable
time rethinking the idea of the portable computing device.
</P>
<P>
   On one level the new models represent the next evolutionary step
in a venerable, popular and award-winning line of notebook and
laptop computers. On another level, however, IBM has recognized
better than most PC makers that a laptop is not just a desktop
computer that has been squeezed to fit into a briefcase and rigged
to run on batteries. Instead, it is a mobile information device
with peculiar requirements and capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the T20 that I tested has a new array of
color-coded buttons just above the keyboard that trigger specific
mobile applications, including a ThinkPad button that automatically
connects the user to an Internet-based service center, assuming the
laptop is connected to a network, of course. The idea is to harness
the power of the Internet to improve the overall experience of
working with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   The online services include animated demonstrations and a lot of
the reference materials that IBM left out of the rather
disappointing user's manual. There are also tips for maximizing
battery life, for adding and removing software features and even
for how to create a better PowerPoint presentation _ as if the
world needed more PowerPoint presentations.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has also created an online area where ThinkPad users can
share tips and experiences. The ThinkPad site has links to all
sorts of practical travel information, which is an unexpected but
logical step, considering that the ThinkPads are often used while
traveling.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how the average ThinkPad user will benefit from
tales of exotic computing adventures in Tibet or the polar regions,
or the knowledge that there are two million saunas in Finland, but
it shows that IBM is literally thinking outside the box _ thinking
about the customer, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of this is in the keyboard design. The ThinkPad
keyboards were already the best of any laptops, but IBM has added a
feature called ThinkLight, which uses a subtle light-emitting diode
to illuminate the keyboard when the user is working in dark rooms
or airplanes. The glow from the screen itself illuminated the
keyboard almost as well as the ThinkLight, but the lighted keyboard
is indicative of IBM's attention to detail. It's the thought that
counts.
</P>
<P>
   Volume controls for the CD or DVD drive are also conveniently
placed on the keyboard, a feature not unique to ThinkPads but
executed well. Travelers like to use their laptops to listen to
audio CD's or to watch DVD movies. Besides controls to turn the
volume up and down, there is also a mute button.
</P>
<P>
   The ``T'' in T20 officially stands for ``thin' _ the model is
less than an inch and a half thick _ but it could also stand for
titanium, the strong, lightweight metal that is used along with
carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic in the body of both the T20 and
A20.
</P>
<P>
   The titanium composite shell armors the ThinkPads against two of
the laptop's natural enemies: clumsy handling and the unexpected
attack when the person in the airplane seat in front of you
suddenly reclines. Many laptop screens have been crushed to death
on airplanes, but the new ThinkPads are designed to be more
tolerant of rough handling than most.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the fact remains that the size of the new ThinkPads
makes them unsuited for use in the coach class of airplanes _ even
in the Exit row, which is where I tested the T20.
</P>
<P>
   While portability is the main reason that someone would spend so
much money for a computer, the new T20 and A20 ThinkPads are also
worthy of consideration as replacements for desktop computers,
especially when equipped with an optional docking station ($499) or
port replicator ($149).
</P>
<P>
   With these ThinkPads, IBM has introduced an Ultrabay 2000
expansion bay that allows the user to add an extra battery or a
variety of optional drives, including a DVD-ROM or CD-ROM drive or
an Imation SuperDisk 120-MB removable drive that doubles as a
floppy drive. The Ultrabay devices can be used with both the T and
A series laptops and with IBM's new line of NetVista desktop
computers.
</P>
<P>
   An UltraPort connector above the center of the ThinkPad screen
allows the integration of an optional USB digital camera (about
$100), which can be used for capturing quick still images or as a
simple video camera for videoconferencing. IBM says the UltraPort
will also be used for short-distance, wireless radio networking
technology called Bluetooth when a Bluetooth module becomes
available later this year. Bluetooth is expected to become a
standard for wireless connections to printers, cellular modems,
handheld computers and other devices, replacing cables.
</P>
<P>
   A Communications Bay on the bottom of the ThinkPads can be used
for a variety of connectivity options, supplementing the built-in
Ethernet and phone connectors.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of other specs, the T20 I tested came with 128 MB of
memory, 8 MB of video memory and an 11.2-gigabyte hard disk. The
lithium-ion battery ran about three and a half hours between
rechargings, which is impressive given the level of work it does.
It is more than sufficient for watching a DVD movie on the big (for
laptops, at least) screen.
</P>
<P>
   The screen has a maximum resolution of 1024 by 768, which
translates, depending on how you calculate pixels, to hundreds of
thousands of screen elements. So if just two of the pixels were bad
_ as they were on the machine I tested _ it would presumably be
hard to complain. But the two bad pixels manifested themselves
annoyingly as perpetually white dots in the center of the screen.
Laptop makers have varying standards on what constitutes a bad
screen, but generally two bad pixels are not enough to fail the
screen or warrant a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The chip in the flagship 700-MHz-model T20, which is expected to
be available in about a month, will be modestly faster than the
650-MHz Pentiums, which until now were the fastest
portable-computer chips in the Windows world.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has made a big deal out of the SpeedStep technology in its
new Pentium portable chips, which operate at maximum speed when
connected to an external power source but ratchet down to a slower,
more energy-efficient speed when running on battery power. The
Apple Powerbook has had the same technology for years.  &QL;

DIVINITY SCHOOL GRADUATES SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT CHURCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Bennie Braddick is interviewing for a family
_ a church family.
</P>
<P>
   The recent divinity school graduate has begun a search that she
hopes will end not just in a job, but also a community of faith.
And although she soon may be weighing benefit packages,
congregation sizes and locations, she will ultimately rely on God
to lead her to the right church, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you just have a feeling, and you know whether or not
it's where you belong,'' Braddick said.
</P>
<P>
   For Braddick _ and all those who will collect ministerial
degrees this year _ job prospects are good. With clergy shortages
that verge on critical in some mainline Protestant denominations,
those entering church ministries often have choices.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble for some is finding the right fit, rather than any
fit at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the job market is very, very good for ministers,''
said Stephen Sprinkle, who teaches theology and helps graduates
find jobs. ``We are producing more ministers than we have ever
produced before, but we cannot meet the demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Brite Divinity School at Texas Christian University
in Fort Worth graduated 26 students. Nineteen of those students
plan to enter jobs in church ministry, Sprinkle said. Some already
have jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Across Fort Worth, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary
graduated 387 students May 12. Dallas Theological Seminary awarded
189 degrees April 29, and Southern Methodist University's Perkins
School of Theology expects to confer 86 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those numbers, opportunities abound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the gifts of the people to match the jobs is tough,''
said Richard Faling of the Baptist General Convention of Texas, who
oversees the staff information service, a resource for job
candidates and church leaders. ``But there are a lot of jobs out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, many jobs are available for students willing to
move into small-town churches, seminary placement directors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had 100 people who wanted rural churches, I could plug
them in all over the place,'' said Bob Kaumeyer, director of
placement at Dallas Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of Kaumeyer's job-seekers already have a post,
he estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Some students enter the seminary with a job already lined up.
</P>
<P>
   Take David Mallory, pastor of First Christian Church of Albany,
Texas, a town of about 2,000 just east of Abilene.
</P>
<P>
   When Mallory was getting ready to leave his job as the
administrator of a Tyler clinic to attend Brite Divinity School,
the Albany church was looking for a part-time youth minister, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, I had the same qualms as everyone else,'' Mallory
said. ``I had no interest in going to West Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   But the church invited Mallory, his wife and two children out
for an interview. In pursuit of a weekend getaway, the Mallorys
accepted the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   And they decided to return.
</P>
<P>
   After Mallory served three months as youth minister, the pastor
resigned and the leadership called on Mallory to take the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be in a church where it is a good fit, where we can
do ministry together, where I like their style and they like my
style,'' Mallory said.
</P>
<P>
   The move to Albany has meant four years of driving 122 miles one
way to classes at Brite Divinity School. But Mallory will already
have a job when he completes his degree in December.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting to life in a small town was not that hard, Mallory
said. Sure, fast-food restaurants were scarce, but his children
could play in the neighborhoods without fear and his wife easily
found work as an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd liked the Piney Woods'' Mallory said, referring to East
Texas. ``But we've realized that there really is a sunset, and
there is a sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no intentions of coming here in the first place, but at
this point in time, I have no intentions of leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right pastor/church fit sometimes requires that the
job applicant cast a wider net.
</P>
<P>
   For Howard Wayland, a recent graduate of Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary, the search for a place to found a church took
him from Florida to Oklahoma and finally to a job offer at Life Way
Baptist Fellowship in Atoka, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and my wife picked all the states we would go to and prayed
about it,'' Wayland said. ``Tennessee was not one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   When Wayland, his wife and three children arrived, Life Way
Baptist Fellowship was nothing but an idea founded and funded by
the Tennessee Baptist Convention and First Baptist Church in
Covington, the nearest big town.
</P>
<P>
   Although familiar with small-town life from a stint living in
rural Arkansas, the Waylands grew up in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our case, we weren't going to an established church, and we
didn't know what to expect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee, the Waylands are surrounded by cotton and wheat
about 40 miles north of Memphis, Wayland said.
</P>
<P>
   Although they knew few people when they arrived in town, the
Waylands set to work building a congregation and community, Howard
Wayland said. They hosted fish fries, Bible studies and burger
dinners. Wayland prayed in each of the neighborhoods and knocked on
doors, introducing himself to the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little harder for the children,'' Wayland said. ``...
It is hard for them to make friends, because they were new.''
</P>
<P>
   Matching pastor and pulpit is no easy feat for church leaders,
said Robert Montgomery, an elder at First Christian Church of
Albany, where Mallory is the pastor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this time of healing whatever the reason was that the
minister left,'' Montgomery said. ``Then you have a new
relationship to build, and that trust isn't just immediately
there.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mallory willing to move into the pulpit, the church leaders
knew they had someone who fit in with the ``personality'' of the
congregation, Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is kind of like a marriage,'' he said. ``There are only a
handful of people who are going to fit the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Braddick, 30, will soon move from Brite Divinity School to the
pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, she serves as a youth minister at a Christian Church
(Disciples of Christ) congregation in Longview, Texas. She will be
ordained in the denomination as a minister next week and hopes to
become pastor of a church with an average attendance of more than
100.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need help _ they need a spiritual link in their
lives,'' Braddick said. ``I want to be a part of that. I want to
help people live the best possible life they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Braddick would like to find a post near a large city in
a church that has growth potential, she said. But that could lead
her away from the state she has called home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the scary part,'' said Braddick, who grew up in Port
Arthur. ``I don't know where I will go. I may not even stay in
Texas.'' .MDBR/.MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services on

MUSEUM GETTING A FASTER WAY TO DETECT WHEN STARS COLLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer-game players know that a graphics card is a necessity
to give a game a realistic look.
</P>
<P>
   Astrophysicists who study the behavior of globular star clusters
_ dense masses of a million or so stars that are scattered through
galaxies like so many lumps in a heap of mashed potatoes _ need a
graphics card of their own.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than shaping the contours of Lara Croft's face, their
card must calculate the gravitational interactions among all the
stars in the cluster. It is a daunting proposition. To make such a
calculation for any point in time requires on the order of a
million million individual operations.
</P>
<P>
   Such a card exists, and next week the astrophysicists at the
American Museum of Natural History in New York will receive the
latest version. Known as Grape6, the card is a specialized
processor that can perform only one kind of operation _ calculating
the gravitational attraction between two bodies. It can do this
work at a speed of about half a teraflop, or half a trillion
floating point operations, per second.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it among the faster computers in the world even
though, unlike a general-purpose computer, it is of no use to
anyone outside of astrophysics.
</P>
<P>
   Those limits are part of the machine's beauty, said one of its
designers, Piet Hut, a professor of astrophysics at the Institute
for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it can do only one thing,'' Hut said, ``but it is
exactly the thing you want it to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Grape (which is short for ``gravity pipeline'') originated about
15 years ago, when Hut was hanging out, as he described it, with
computer scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
One of the scientists, Gerald Sussman, had created a
special-purpose machine to calculate the evolution of the solar
system. Hut thought the same concept could be applied to star
clusters.
</P>
<P>
   But a computer used to calculate star clusters would need to be
much faster than a solar system machine (the solar system, after
all, only has 10 bodies, not a million, and at 4.5 billion years
old is less than half the age of the typical cluster).
</P>
<P>
   So with the help of a Japanese graduate student, Jun Makino, Hut
set out to design a special-purpose chip. ``It was a gravity card,
so to speak,'' he said, ``that would set Newtonian calculations in
silicon and let the data stream through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Their first board, developed like the others at the University
of Tokyo, had a peak speed of about 240 megaflops. They broke the
gigaflop barrier in 1991 with Grape3, and speed increases have
continued since.
</P>
<P>
   The Grape6 board that is being donated to the natural history
museum is among the first of several hundred that are being
produced by Toshiba. Sometime next year, about 200 boards will be
combined at the University of Tokyo to make a machine with a speed
of 200 teraflops.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has been promised computing time on that machine, but
in the meantime will use the board, which is about a foot square
and connects to a regular, though rather powerful, PC, in its
studies of what happens when stars in a cluster collide. (The board
is being donated during a conference on stellar collisions at the
museum's Rose Center for Earth and Space.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a million stars whizzing around, some of them
run into each other,'' said Michael Shara, curator and chairman of
the department of astrophysics. ``And near misses are just as
important as collisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the brute that it is, the board just provides raw data for
this kind of work. ``All the Grape does is let you calculate where
the star is, how fast it's moving,'' Shara said.
</P>
<P>
   From that data, it becomes clear that two stars will pass near
each other, or collide. ``Then you take a completely different
computer and study what happens to the stars,'' he said.

COMPUTERS QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I use Windows 98 and at times I have several windows open on
screen. Is there any simple way to close them all at once instead
of clicking the X on the window bar or repeatedly pressing Alt-F4?
</P>
<P>
   A. Although Macintosh users can close all open windows on screen
by pressing the Command-Option-W keys, Windows users do not have
such an easy time of it. As you have found, pressing Alt-F4 will
close each active window one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   To minimize everything that is open quickly, including open
programs and windows, press the Windows key and M on your keyboard.
Pressing Shift-Windows-M will undo the minimization. Another option
is to press Windows-D, which will minimize all the open windows and
reveal your desktop.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least a couple of shareware programs that will let
you close all the windows with a click of your mouse.
</P>
<P>
   If you are interested in a software solution, you might want to
try Closer, a $10 program that will let you maximize, minimize and
close all windows with one click on your taskbar. (Pressing
Control-Windows-Tab will let you jump from the Start menu through
the Quick Launch bar to the System Tray, and the left and right
arrow keys will then move you from item to item.) You can download
Closer at www.coolest.com.
</P>
<P>
   Another option, also named Closer, is freeware that can be
found &QC; at www.chat.ru/(tilde)anddch/closer.html.
</P>
<P>
   Keyboard shortcuts can save time and energy, and if you want to
learn more of them, search for ``keyboard shortcuts'' in your
system's Help feature, which you can get by pressing F1 on your
keyboard. You can also find a list of keyboard shortcuts in the
support area of Microsoft's Web site
(search.support.microsoft.com/kb), by searching for article No.
Q126449.
</P>
<P>
   Mac users can find a list of keyboard shortcuts by searching in
the Tech Info Library on Apple Computer's Web site
(til.info.apple.com) for ``keyboard shortcuts.'' A list of common
shortcuts can also be found in the Apple Guide, (the Mac's Help
file), which users can usually find under the question mark icon in
the Mac's menu bar or by pressing the Help key.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I change the picture that appears on my screen when
the computer starts up?
</P>
<P>
   A. Adding a touch of personalization when you start your
computer is fairly simple to do for either a Windows or Macintosh
machine, as long as you save the picture file in the right format.
A Windows user needs to save the desired picture in the BMP
(bitmap) format so the system can read it, while a Mac owner should
save the files in the PICT format.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have image-editing software on your computer, many
shareware sites on the Web have sections devoted to alternative
start-up screens and graphic converter programs that will help you
get personal pictures into the right format for either platform.
</P>
<P>
   Windows users should first rename the existing Windows logo file
by typing Control-F to call up the Find utility and typing LOGO.SYS
in the Named box. The file should be in the C: drive, so click Find
Now. Once the file pops up, right-click on it, select Rename and
call it something different, like LOGO.OLD, to disable it. Find the
picture file that you want to use and change the size to 320 x 400
pixels, with 256 colors or less. Rename it LOGO.SYS and save it on
your hard drive (the default C: drive, in most cases), then reboot.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to change the screens that appear when you shut down
your computer _ ``Please wait while your computer shuts down'' and
``It's now safe to turn off your computer'' _ you can do that by
renaming the old files and replacing them with your new choices.
LOGOW.SYS is the ``Please wait'' screen, and the ``It is now safe''
message is LOGOS.SYS in the Windows folder.
</P>
<P>
   A Mac user who wants to change the start-up screen should change
the name of the desired PICT file to -StartupScreen (just one
word). Put that file into the System Folder and restart the Mac.
</P>

WITH 245 POUNDS TO LOSE, HIS WAY WAS THE SUBWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jared Fogle blames fast food, and lots of it, for the extra 245
pounds he lugged around for years.
</P>
<P>
   He credits fast food, specifically Subway sandwiches, for
helping him shed those 245 pounds and go from a 60-inch waist to a
34 in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now known as ``The Subway Diet Guy'' and ``Subway Sandwich
Man,'' Fogle, 22, graduated this month from Indiana University, is
beginning a new job as a pricing analyst with American Trans Air,
has a great girlfriend and is a friendly, self-confident young man.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months after losing all that weight, he's still at the
190 pounds he wants to be and is still surprised at all the
attention he has received since his dieting success made the front
page of his college newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The story caught the attention of ``Men's Health'' magazine,
which published it with a collection of ``Crazy Diets that Work.''
Then someone at Subway's corporate office saw the magazine and
contacted Fogle about making a commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never have imagined people would care so much and be
so interested in me and how I lost the weight,'' Fogle says. ``I
knew my family and friends would be happy about it, but it's become
a craze. I've been interviewed by the BBC and reporters from
Australia and Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogle says Subway ``helped save my life and start over,'' but
those sandwiches were also part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In his fast-food heyday, he lived next door to a Subway shop,
and several times a week would eat his favorite foot-long steak and
cheese sub with double meat, double cheese, heavy on the mayo,
along with regular chips, a large soft drink and maybe a cookie or
two.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that a lot of pizzas, cheeseburgers, french fries and
tacos, and he had a real problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lack of movement and a lot of late-night pizza. It
was never about beer. I never partied,'' Fogle says. ``I never
really had a social life.''
</P>
<P>
   He painfully recalls how he spent a lot of time figuring out how
to avoid anything that might be embarrassing. When he went
anywhere, he parked as far away as he could walk so no one would
see him trying to get out of the car, and he chose college classes
based on the type of seating available.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked into a restaurant, I would scan the seating to
see if there was a place I could fit into or if I should insist on
going somewhere else. I was so scared of being embarrassed,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   One day, when he stopped by the sandwich shop to pick up a
takeout (he couldn't fit into a booth), Fogle noticed a sign
promoting ``Seven Under Six,'' the company's seven subs with less
than 6 grams of fat.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly calculated the fat and calories involved and decided
on a new diet: a 6-inch turkey sub for lunch, loaded with ``tons of
lettuce, green peppers, banana peppers, jalapeno peppers and
pickles, topped with spicy mustard _ no cheese or mayo'' _ with a
package of baked chips and a diet soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   For dinner, he had a foot-long vegetable sub and another diet
drink _ fewer than 1,100 calories each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would switch off between whole wheat and white bread,
deciding on which one had baked up to look bigger that day,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   He knew he was losing weight, but didn't know how much until he
went home to Indianapolis to visit his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hadn't seen me in two months, and they were amazed,''
says Fogle, whose father is a doctor, a general practitioner. ``My
dad took me to his office to weigh, and neither of us could believe
it. There were tears in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   In two months, the Subway Diet Man had lost 95 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   After that visit, he weighed and had blood work done each time
he was home. His cholesterol dropped, and all his other blood
counts remained good.
</P>
<P>
   Fogle began walking to his nearby college classes.
</P>
<P>
   Before the initial loss, he says, he often fell asleep in class
and could barely move around, much less exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard at first. I would get really hungry, but I knew I
was doing something good for myself, and I was determined,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Fogle stuck with the diet, ``cheating'' only a couple of times,
including Thanksgiving Day 1998, when he ate turkey and dressing,
no gravy, and a small dessert.
</P>
<P>
   He says he knew it was time to quit when he reached his goal of
180 _ 245 pounds down from the initial 425 _ and felt he was just
too thin for his 6-foot-2 frame.
</P>
<P>
   He deliberately regained 10 pounds, then went on a cruise to St.
Thomas, St. Martin and the Bahamas to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   He says he still eats several low-fat Subway sandwiches a week,
but he usually doesn't have to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time he completed the diet, in March 1999, he met
his girlfriend, Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be together for quite a while,'' he says.
``She's the greatest reward of all. If it were not for the weight
loss, I might not have ever met her,'' Fogle says. ``I think this
was the way I was supposed to be. I was just hidden while I was
that heavy.''

BOYS WILL BE BOYS, AND SOMETIMES GIRLS, IN ONLINE COMMUNITIES

<P>
   It may be true, as a well-known cartoon in The New Yorker
claimed, that on the Internet, no one knows you are a dog. But
according to the first studies of gender switching on the Internet,
everyone probably has a pretty good idea of what kind of dog you
are.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the current issue of the journal Information,
Communication and Society said that 40 percent of participants in
online communities have engaged in some form of gender switching,
the practice of pretending to be someone of the opposite sex. Of
those, about half have given up the practice. The authors of the
study say the results show that gender switching is, in fact, far
less popular than some social scientists had claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that if someone tells you online that they're female,
they probably are,'' said Dr. Malcolm Parks, an associate professor
of speech communication at the University of Washington and a
co-author of the study. ``What we found was that gender switching
wasn't nearly as common a phenomenon as people had thought. Most of
the people we studied hadn't tried it, and those who did didn't do
it for very long.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, titled ``The Social Geography of Gender-Switching in
Virtual Environments on the Internet,'' surveyed 400 participants
in online communities called MOOs (multiuser object-oriented
systems). Sixty percent of participants in the study said they had
never engaged in gender switching online and had no intention of
doing so. Nineteen percent had previously dallied with gender
switching but had stopped. The remaining 21 percent were actively
posing as a person of the opposite sex at the time the study was
taken. But the majority of active gender switchers spent only about
10 percent of their online time disguised as the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   The figure that 40 percent of online users have masqueraded as
the opposite sex could strike many people as alarmingly high, not
low. Parks conceded that the results are up for interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can probably take these numbers several ways,''
Parks said. ``I don't find it remarkable that many people take
advantage of the Internet to experience life as the other gender.
It's just that it tends to be a temporary experience and not a
comment on their offline sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Gender switching became a popular topic because of what
academics and Internet commentators believed it said about
sexuality. For some Internet anthropologists, gender switching was
an example of how fluid the idea of identity has become in the
modern world. Some feminists saw it as another way of breaking down
socially constructed gender roles. At the other end of the
political spectrum, some critics of the Internet regarded the
practice as a threat that every 14-year-old online girlfriend is
really a 45-year-old ex-convict with three-day stubble.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the anecdotal evidence about gender switching, no
one had produced hard numbers, Parks said. ``I was skeptical of the
extreme speculation on all sides,'' he said. ``A lot of pundits had
talked about it, but nobody had done any research. We tried to get
a more systematic handle on what was really going on, rather than
just take part in an ill-informed debate.''
</P>
<P>
   To collect data, Parks and Lynne Roberts, a doctoral candidate
at the Curtin University of Technology in Australia, conducted two
random samples of participants in two MOOs, one dedicated to
socializing and the other to role-playing. They wrote to users by
e-mail, asking them to fill out a questionnaire on a protected Web
site. Parks said they sent out 2,200 requests and got 400
participants, a response rate of just under 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that people tended to assume other sexual
identities for what Parks called ``benign reasons.'' The most
common reasons were that the respondents were in role-playing MOOs
or that they switched genders out of curiosity, for fun, to avoid
sexual harassment or as a challenge to their online acting skills.
</P>
<P>
   The most common reasons that respondents did not want to assume
other sexual identities were that they had no interest, that they
found the practice of gender switching to be deceitful and that
they wanted to present their real selves online. A reason given
slightly less often was doubt about being able to pull off the
ruse. ``It's a little like that line of Mark Twain's: It's always
easier to tell the truth, because you don't have to remember what
you said,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   The most common reason for people to drop the practice of
switching sexual identities was that it stopped being interesting
or that their curiosity had been satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found little difference between those who
practiced what has been called ``online transvestism'' and those
who had not. Switchers and nonswitchers showed no significant
differences in the categories of shyness, extroversion or
neuroticism. The main predictors of switching seemed to be the
amount of time a person had spent in a MOO, but not the amount of
time spent on the Internet overall.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Haynes, a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas
who has studied and created MOOs, said she was not surprised by the
numbers. ``It is something people experiment with but do not
continue with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes, who met her husband at an educational MOO, said gender
switching received a disproportionate amount of attention because
of fears about pedophiles roaming chat rooms in disguise. ``I don't
dismiss that it happens in rare cases,'' she said, ``but that kind
of press misrepresents most people's experiences online.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Annette Markham, a professor of communication studies at
Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va., and the author of ``Life
Online,'' said the study may in fact overstate the phenomenon
because gender switching is currently in vogue. ``Whenever you are
asking people to respond via a survey,'' she said, ``you're going
to get mixed findings.''
</P>
<P>
   She agreed, however, that most gender switching is temporary.
``It's a popular belief that people get lost in their online
personas,'' she said. ``But that doesn't really hold up when you
really study what people are doing online. They have a lot more
balance than we think they do.''

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DORA GALITZKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grumpy When Moved
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a garden in eastern Long Island. It gets sun
three-fourths of the day, and the soil, which has been improved
over the years, drains well. I have an Oriental poppy, which has
not bloomed since I planted it two years ago, and a Baptisia
australis, which did not bloom last year. The baptisia was divided
the year previous. Can you tell me what the problem is, and what
can be done to make them bloom?
</P>
<P>
   A. Descriptions of Baptisia australis may vary in how they rave
over the indigo-blue flowers or pea-like, blue-green leaves, but
the one phrase you'll always find is ``slow to get established.''
That's horticulture-speak for grumpy, stubborn or resentful plants,
those that don't appreciate being transplanted, divided or having
their roots disturbed and show their resentment by refusing to
bloom for a year or two. Or three.
</P>
<P>
   Impatient gardeners wish everything worked on the same timetable
as annuals. While an annual is always in a hurry, perennials take
their time settling in and getting to know the neighborhood before
they commit to something as energy-sapping as a flower. Assuming
your baptisia and Oriental poppy have decided that this is home,
you should see flowers this summer or next.
</P>
<P>
   Any time you divide, plant or transplant something whose
descriptions include phrases like ``a challenge to transplant'' or
``slow to take hold,'' always do a little research so you can move
it at the proper time. Take a big ball of soil with it, to disturb
the roots as little as possible, and prepare to wait it out.
</P>
<P>
   Among the challenges are platycodon (balloon flower), helleborus
(hellebore), dictamnus (gas plant), aconitum (monkshood) and
asclepias (butterfly weed).
</P>
<P>
   When Mulch Is Too Deep
</P>
<P>
   Q. My community hires a landscaping company to take care of
gardening for all residents. There are many trees 8 to 10 years
old, and they pile dirt about 10 inches high around the trunks. My
question is, is that a good idea?  &QL; 
A. No. Covering a tree trunk with soil, or even a too-thick layer
of mulch, frequently leads to problems. Both soil and mulch will
retain moisture, and if the trunk is constantly damp the bark will
eventually weaken and rot. When the moist bark freezes and thaws in
winter, it expands, contracts, and eventually splits. Both the
rotting and the splitting let insects and diseases invade the tree.
And the pile protects those insects from their predators.
</P>
<P>
   With mulch, the answer is easy _ just pull it back to leave a
space between it and the trunk. But piling soil on can lead to
another problem. Roots, which we think of in their role of
absorbing water and nutrients or as an anchor so the tree doesn't
fall over when you lean against it, also absorb oxygen that filters
down through the soil from the air. Every tree has an optimum depth
for its roots _ deep enough to protect the roots and let them
anchor the tree, shallow enough to get both the air and the water
it needs.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a tree is as old as yours are, it has established
itself and gotten comfortable. Pile extra soil on, especially over
the area where the roots meet the trunk, and it no longer can get
all the oxygen it needs. You won't hear gasping or choking sounds,
but gradually its health and vigor decline, reducing its ability to
fend off diseases and increasing its susceptibility to insect
attack. It may die, or it may just suffer in silence, depending on
how sensitive the species is. Maple, beech, oak and willow are
especially resentful of being smothered.
</P>
<P>
   The same advice applies to mulch. Three or four inches is fine,
because mulch isn't as dense as soil, but more than that can lead
to problems in the long run. And the long run is what trees are all
about.
</P>
<P>

43rd Street, New York 10036, or by e-mail to

STORMING THE LAST CIVILIZED SANDBOX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla. Conn., Britain)   By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYFORD CAY, the Bahamas _ Paul Hallingby Jr. loves this
Caribbean enclave's coral-colored houses, its worn chintz, engraved
stationery and imported household help. He treasures what he calls
his ``old-fashioned beach house'': a $9 million, 6,500-square-foot
villa with two circular driveways and a private beach.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the always-reassuring sight of the neighboring
Lyford Cay Club, a pink mansion with Tara-style white columns,
where Hallingby, a managing director emeritus of Bear, Stearns &AMP;
Co., has been a member for 16 years. He and his friends Sandra
McConnell, an Avon heiress, and Bill Paley Jr., a son of William S.
Paley and the beautiful Babe Paley, appreciate the club's
conservative prohibitions. Couples must be married to stay
overnight, public displays of affection are frowned upon and
bikinis cannot be itsy-bitsy. Everybody still chuckles at the
scolding Sir John M. Templeton, the British philanthropist,
received for wearing white bathing trunks that went transparent
when he hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very pleasant social life,'' Hallingby said of this
thousand-acre gated resort community 12 minutes from Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   Here on ``Lifeless Cay,'' as many residents have called it,
there are no stores, no restaurants, no Manolo Blahniks. At least,
not at the moment. But the clicking of those sky-high heels is
getting closer. The worlds of fashion, celebrity and shiny new
money, are invading this part of the paradise where the Duke of
Windsor once reigned as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Where reasonable-size villas once ruled, 50,000-square-foot
houses are springing up. ``Who needs that?'' Hallingby said. He is
considering selling up and moving out.
</P>
<P>
   Is the last bastion of civilized society in danger of becoming
extinct? Like Southampton, N.Y., Greenwich, Conn., and most
recently Palm Beach, Fla., Lyford Cay is being invaded by the young
and the feckless. Almost nobody likes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This always happens to gated communities,'' said Elliott
Sclar, director of the Urban Planning Program at Columbia
University. ``The middle class always ruins the upper class' fun.''
Especially, he added, when the middle class has money.
</P>
<P>
   So habitues of this Eisenhower-era retreat for the uber-moneyed
set _ Nicholas F. Brady, the former secretary of state; the Bacardi
family _ now confront party-hearty spillover from nearby Paradise
Island. That's where Sol Kerzner, a South African developer, has
built Atlantis, a gaudy $850 million resort, and revitalized the
Ocean Club, an estate once owned by the Old Guard grocery heir
Huntington Hartford. Beaches where Hartford once sunned in Bermuda
shorts now host Leonardo di Caprio, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan
and the thong-clad Gloria Estefan.
</P>
<P>
   There, Lyfordians complain, goes the 'hood.  &QL; 
``I have my own set of values,'' said a newcomer, Peter Nygard,
whom some call the Canadian Hugh Hefner. His hotly debated home is
a 150,000-square-foot ``hut'' _ a Polynesian village by way of Club
Med with flocks of 300 peacocks, parrots and cockatoos free-ranging
indoors and out, and a lagoon through the house. The spread is
growing; he's pumping sand daily to expand his stretch of beach on
his five acres.
</P>
<P>
   The typical Lyfordian blue blood, ``is afraid to step out of the
box,'' Nygard said, adding, ``I'm part of a new generation.'' It is
taking root inside the gates, just half a mile from the Lyford Cay
Club. Nygard, who is a self-made clothing designer, said he grew up
in poverty in Finland, the son of a mother who was a seamstree and
a father who worked in a bakery. Now, he is worth more than $500
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no choice whether to be old money or new money. I'm new
money, based on a new set of values, and that's based on merit,''
he said, looking over a stream of purple steam belching from two
40-foot urns. Hospitality chez Nygard is eye-popping, too. Where
Hallingby's housekeeper offers a cocktail to guests, Nygard offers
a masseuse. He has four housemen who cavort on trampolines anchored
in the ocean. He has a 40-foot dining room table that drops down to
become a disco dance floor once dinner (and bird droppings) are
cleared. On karaoke nights, scantily clad young women dance while
he sings ``I Did It My Way'' (his favorite song) until 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nygard Cay is a perfect neighbor for Lyford Cay,'' he said,
standing on his beach with a red and green parrot on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the rich and famous certainly think so. Prince Andrew
and Sarah Ferguson came by two weeks ago. So did Robert DeNiro.
Michael Jackson has dropped by. And George and Barbara Bush, whose
photograph adorns his office. ``I've built them a presidential
suite,'' Nygard said, pointing to a cabana built into artificial
cliffs some 60 feet high. No, the former first couple haven't
stayed over.
</P>
<P>
   Like his tony neighbors, he favors classical music but prefers
to blast it through his compound. Each day at sunset, Cocoy, a
houseman, has orders to time the last chord on a CD so it crashes
to a finale just as the sun slides into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Nygard bought his mother a house a few miles away. He calls it a
``boring house,'' suburban in style, with a portrait of his parents
(who were married for 57 years) hanging over the fireplace. ``Men
are used to traditional women, but women, they are not traditional
anymore,'' said Nygard, who has seven children with four different
women. Not an unusual occurrence even in Lyford Cay, but there's a
major difference: only one made it down the aisle with him. As for
today's breed of independent woman, he says, ``I don't know how to
deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Lyford Cay, where rules matter, no matter how outmoded they may
seem, is at a loss over newcomers like Mr. Nygard.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   E.P. Taylor, a Canadian brewer and racing magnate, bought Lyford
Cay in 1954 from Sir Harold Christie, a powerful Bahamian
developer, for the purpose of creating the ultimate international
country club. Then he hired Henry Montgomery of Britain's
Bass-Charrington brewery fortune, who had serious European
connections, to offer lots to the right people: Prince Rainier III
of Monaco, Stavros Niarchos of Greece, Henry Ford II, the Aga Khan.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor ran Lyford like his own private club until 1971, when he
sold it to the members, ensuring that its standards would continue
after his death. His dictatorship was replaced by committees on
everything from croquet to decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the land is governed by the Lyford Cay Property
Association. It can put restrictions on new development, but there
are rogue parcels whose fate is not governed by anyone. That
includes a piece where a developer is building _ horrors _
condominiums. Nygard bought his prime acreage through a silent
auction, much to the chagrin of club members, who have vowed not to
sell him more. Lyfordian property owners say Nygard's loads of
landfill have caused their own neighboring beaches to erode. As for
his personal style, it is not in the spirit of their Cay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a building boom in the last four years,'' said
Anne Smith of the Lyford Cay Real Estate Co. ``A lot of people have
never heard of this place, and many people would like to keep it
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   They include Samantha Gregory, a Manhattan socialite, who has
spent holidays here since she was 8. ``It's like the 1950s,'' said
Gregory, who was born in 1974. Fifties is code for ``really
boring,'' she admitted. Still, she added, ``it's a timeout.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She, too, has noticed cracks in the pink-stucco facade. At the
club, where she sees the same people who have been serving her ice
cream since she was a little girl, she also notices a lot of faces
she doesn't recognize and a lot of un-Lyford-like behavior.
</P>
<P>
   As one 30-something member of the club put it, ``The newer
people can be very aggressive, very loud and really mean to the
staff.'' Not to mention, they seem lightfingered. Last year, more
than $30,000 worth of towels bearing the club crest were stolen.
(The total hasn't come in yet on purloined club-crested glasses.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happened everywhere,'' said Letitia Baldrige, the maven
of manners, who first visited Lyford Cay in the '60s. ``Palm Beach
certainly. Greenwich. Conn., Southampton. I shouldn't be so
regional. The Riviera, my goodness _ when I first knew it, it was
very straight-laced, well behaved and well manicured. Now, thanks
to the new colony and the nouveau riche, anything goes _ nudity,
sex in public.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, many Palm Beach residents, worried that their own
sandbox was becoming overcrowded, headed for the rigid structure of
Lyford Cay, where club membership has grown to 1,000, from 100 in
the 60s. Even if they can patiently handle the two-year waiting
list and afford the $65,000 entrance fee, plus $7,000 a year in
dues, the Floridians aren't entirely welcome. Old Guard Palm Beach
just isn't Old Guard enough for Lyford Cay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting much more like Palm Beach,'' sniffed Elizabeth
Moffett, a septuagenarian who vacationed here with two husbands and
is now a frequent guest. In the early days, ``everyone had money,
and no one talked about it,'' she said, adding, ``Now, it's who has
the most caviar and the biggest bottle of Champagne.'' Her host,
who asked not to be identified, said she saw visitors from Palm
Beach renting houses in the compound for $5,000 a day. ``They were
all overdressed, wearing all their gold jewelry,'' he said, ``and
always asking where the next charity party was.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, life is purposefully low key, in a way that seems oddly
normal and strangely suburban given the trust-fund babies lurking
behind every bush. People set great store by the club's greasy
hamburgers and slow service. There are family barbecues and limbo
parties, and members travel the roads by golf cart.
</P>
<P>
   Michelangelo is the only hairdresser at the Lyford Cay Club, and
he is booked months in advance. The new people are getting around
that problem, however; along with their mounds of luggage (FedEx-ed
ahead) they bring their own beauty gurus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason people are fleeing back to Lyford from Palm Beach
is because of the infusion of vulgarity that's creeping up from
Miami and down from the newly rich New York crowd,'' said R. Couri
Hay, a Couristan carpet heir and the society editor of Palm Beach
magazine and Hamptons magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Hay acknowledged, ``it's the only haven of gentility and
etiquette and family life left.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong words, but perhaps true. Why else would the tempestuous
actor Nicholas Cage drop by, pulling up to Hallingby's driveway in
a white stretch limousine accompanied by beefy bodyguards. Cage was
house hunting in the Bahamas, and if the vehicle didn't make his
outsider status perfectly clear, his Rodeo Drive wardrobe did:
orange pants dripping with crystals, a lime-green shirt and a straw
sombrero.
</P>
<P>
   Hallingby said he was certain the actor wouldn't buy. He said,
``We're not happening enough for someone like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet.

DEATH OF STUDENT PROMPTS PROTESTS AT UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The rape and murder of a student at Beijing
University, China's most prestigious university, has set off
student demonstrations, in defiance of a general ban on public
protests.
</P>
<P>
   The school, long an oasis for liberal ideas, was the
intellectual epicenter of the huge pro-democracy protests on
Tiananmen Square in 1989 that ended violently when troops dispersed
the protesters, killing hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are ever wary of student movements at the university,
and the current protests come just two weeks before the June 4
anniversary of the 1989 crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening, after the university belatedly announced the
death Friday of a first-year student, Qiu Qingfeng, hundreds of
students held a vigil filled with songs and chants and staged a
sit-in outside an administration building. They demanded to speak
with top university officials. At one point, a few students forced
their way into the building.
</P>
<P>
   The students resumed that protest Wednesday, ultimately forcing
university officials to let them set up a memorial altar that they
covered with candles and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the core of the demands focused on campus security and
the university's responsibility for the death, the protest also
gave students an opportunity to vent their anger on issues like
rising tuition and attempts to limit student expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't stay silent,'' read a poster on campus on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Student demonstrations are rare in China and require government
permission. Students from Beijing University and other local
institutions were allowed to protest against the NATO bombing of
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last year, and that resulted in
demonstrations outside the U.S. Embassy here. But more recently,
students were denied permission for rallies to protest independence
for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Through posters and meetings with student leaders, university
officials urged students Wednesday ``not to do anything excessive
or emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer bulletin boards at the university were closed
Wednesday, but the anger quickly spilled over to more popular chat
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've tried so hard to fool students for 11 years,'' one
person wrote on Sina.com, a reference to the the 1989 protests.
``You should not use the lie of `being rational' to cheat students
from mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   Another message posted at the site asked, ``They are enrolling
more students and making more money, so why don't they improve the
facilities?''
</P>
<P>
   Qiu lived at a secondary campus on the outskirts of Beijing, an
hour's bus ride from the main campus. That branch, in rural
Changping, has housed some first-year students for much of the last
decade. Some students said it was to have been closed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Qiu was raped and killed while walking from a public bus stop to
the branch campus. She was on her way back from the main campus,
where she had taken an examination.

` DIANA MOSLEY: DANCING AROUND FASCISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1936 Diana Mitford Guinness married Oswald Mosley, Britain's
foremost fascist, at the Berlin home of Josef and Magda Goebbels.
The bride wore yellow silk. A guest at the small ceremony was her
special friend Adolf Hitler, whose wedding gift was a large
photograph of himself in a silver frame adorned by the two-headed
German eagle. For years the Mosleys displayed this keepsake in
their drawing room even though it prompted ``discomfiture,'' in the
words of Diana's biographer, Jan Dalley, among ``some'' of their
guests.
</P>
<P>
   But as Dalley makes clear, Diana was not one to fret about the
delicate feelings of others. When she created a stir, not long
before the wedding, by raising her hand in a fascist salute in Hyde
Park during the singing of ``God Save the King,'' she said: ``I
simply wanted to give my opinion like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   When she began humiliating her first husband, an heir to the
Guinness brewery fortune, by conducting an affair with Mosley, she
supposed that Mosley would probably not mind. ``What difference
would it make?'' she later wondered, congratulating herself on the
set of happy remarriages that ensued.
</P>
<P>
   When, after World War II, she and Mosley found themselves
somewhat ostracized in the Wiltshire countryside, Diana's patrician
diffidence remained supreme. ``The local colonels did not come to
call,'' she observed. There was no love lost between the Britain
that had imprisoned the Mosleys during World War II and two people
who clung unapologetically to their polarizing political views.
``What else was there?'' Diana asked late in life, by way of
explaining how her fascist allegiances were born.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Mosley's detachment, and the glaring degree to which her
biographer becomes complicit in it, resonate throughout this
morally tone-deaf book. It's clear that this dauntless creature,
now on the eve of her 90th birthday, has always exerted a
powerfully seductive pull. She was part of the much-documented
Mitford brood of beautiful, headstrong sisters (Dina, Dana, Bodley,
Honks, Cord and Nard were all childhood nicknames for Diana _ and
that was just within the family) and thus came equipped with
attributes that make her a hagiographer's dream. A biographer ready
to describe Oswald Mosley, the founder of the British Union of
Fascists, as ``handsome in the Rudolph Valentino style then in
fashion, elegant, witty and very charming to women'' is well
equipped to celebrate her subject's social and cosmetic virtues.
</P>
<P>
   Diana was a cousin of Winston Churchill's, a darling of Evelyn
Waugh's (who dedicated ``Vile Bodies'' to the Guinnesses) and an
unlikely friend of Lytton Strachey's and Dora Carrington's, even if
she found Bloomsbury tastes ``dreary'' and ``middle-class'';
Diana's own aesthetic ran toward pink, blue and gold luxe. It's
possible that she might have led a life devoid of controversy
without Mosley's influence, even though one of her grandfathers was
one of Hitler's favorite Germanophiles and her father hatched a
gold-mining scheme in a Canadian locale called Swastika. But Diana,
as Dalley sees it, ``had an idealistic tendency to hero-worship
that welcomed the idea of a single, strong leader who would
accomplish wonderful things.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalley regards Diana's political conversion as a positive step
in character development. ``Most people rebel from the workaday
aspects of life toward the more lighthearted,'' she writes. ``In
choosing Mosley and fascism, Diana rebelled away from the frivolity
of her socializing life into `seriousness of purpose.'''
</P>
<P>
   At least her purposes were more serious than those of her sister
Unity Mitford, whose groupie tactics (she was known to stake out
Hitler's favorite lunch spot in Munich, quivering in hopes of an
autograph) were treated as Mitford family foolishness. (``She was
still a handful at home; at least now she was interested in
something,'' says Dalley, of the period in the early 1930s when
Unity made herself a fixture with the German high command.) The
book argues that Diana could be helpful to Mosley by forming close
contacts in Hitler's circle, and that she was characteristically
oblivious when it came to war-mongering in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diana's enthusiasm for Germany was not dimmed by reports of
the Night of the Long Knives,'' Dalley reports, in a book that uses
the phrase ``the Jewish question'' in passing. There is much more
about what Diana either did not notice or did not mind. Dalley is
careful to attach a veneer of principle to such thoughts, as in
explaining how Diana still managed to have several Jewish friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Diana shared the same sense of deep differences
between races and nationalities, and would unashamedly admit to
racialism'' (``I am not fond of Jews,'' she unsurprisingly told a
government interrogator in 1940, ``she would put a personal
friendship before all that. But her liking for an individual would
not change her views about the mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Not often does the book address ``the breathtaking illogic'' of
Diana's thinking. Nor does it raise much of an eyebrow at Diana's
selective memories. (Hitler was capable of ``marvelous drollery''
and did a delightful Mussolini impersonation.) Dalley prefers to
laud her subject for the way ``a laconic irony _ always coolheaded,
effective both in attack and defense _ seemed bred in the bone.''
</P>
<P>
   She also makes unsubstantiated claims for Diana's writing
talents based on ``A Life of Contrasts,'' the memoir upon which
this book draws. Only in citing how Diana ``showed great agility
for dancing around what she called `the tricky bits''' does Dalley
deliver a compliment that sounds deeply deserved.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mosleys' wartime incarceration, in a jail whose sooty
soil Diana remembers as wonderful for growing fraises des bois,
Oswald turned his attention to opposing black immigration, although
``his oratorical style got the better of him when he was in full
flood from the back of a lorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana wrote her memoir and a book about a kindred spirit, the
Duchess of Windsor. Oswald, who died in 1980, had a memoir of his
own published in 1968 and was subjected to ``very very hostile''
questioning when he came to New York to promote it. As Diana
remembers it, ``he didn't mind.''

&HT;     JUSTICE OFFICIAL DENIES RENO PRESSURED HIM TO ABANDON PROBE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Contradicting the sworn testimony of an FBI agent,
a Justice Department prosecutor on Wednesday denied that Attorney
General Janet Reno had pushed him to abandon the federal
investigation of 1996 Democratic fundraising because her job might
be at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Career prosecutor Lee Radek, called before a Senate subcommittee
to explain remarks he made about the investigation during a 1996
meeting with FBI officials, told the panel that he didn't remember
the disputed conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Radek, chief of the Justice Department's Public Integrity
Section, headed the department's initial investigation into
allegations that President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore may
have violated campaign finance laws. During the investigation,
Clinton was still weighing whether he would retain Reno as attorney
general in his second term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have said that I got pressure from the attorney
general to do a thorough job, to do it vigorously and to do it well
but I would never have linked that pressure and my decision on the
investigation to the attorney general's job,'' Radek told a Senate
Judiciary Committee panel investigating 1996 campaign finances.
</P>
<P>
   Radek's comments differed sharply from testimony from FBI
Assistant Director Neil Gallagher, who also was present at the Dec.
6, 1996, meeting in the office of the FBI's then-deputy director,
William Esposito, to determine whether the FBI should be brought
into the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher told the panel that Radek made clear during the
meeting that the investigation was ``extremely sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were comments that there was pressure on the Public
Integrity Section and that the pressure was because the attorney
general's job might be hanging in the balance,'' Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he was sure of his memory, Gallagher
answered, ``Quite sure,'' and proceeded to describe where each man
was sitting during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Radek's disputed comments first came to light as part of a memo
by FBI Director Louis Freeh, turned over belatedly to Senate
investigators last week.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 memo included remarks from Esposito regarding the
department's campaign finance probe. In the memo, Freeh, who was
not at the meeting, recounted Esposito's description of Radek's
comments, saying ``that there was a lot of `pressure' on him ...
regarding this case because the attorney general's job might hang
in the balance (or words to that effect).''
</P>
<P>
   Freeh wrote the memo to Esposito after reportedly meeting with
Reno about the investigation. In the memo, Freeh said he told the
attorney general about Radek's comments and suggested ``on that
basis'' that she and Radek step aside from the probe.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the memo said that the Justice Department's Public
Integrity Section could not conduct a thorough investigation and
that the department should name aggressive outside investigators _
whom Freeh called ``junkyard dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the subcommittee, read
the memo at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Under lengthy questioning from Specter and other Republican
senators, Radek repeatedly said he could not ``remember'' the
meeting with Esposito but that he was ``sure'' he would not have
made the comments attributed to him.
</P>
<P>
   Following leaks of the memo last week, Reno said she never bowed
to political pressure. ``I call it like I see it, regardless of the
consequences. I've got a month-to-month lease on my apartment, and
I've been prepared to go home from the beginning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno added that she did not recall Freeh briefing her on Radek's
purported remarks or ``talking about pressure because of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Reno rejected the appointment of an
independent counsel to investigate fund-raising phone calls by
Clinton and Gore. Reno reached her conclusions after probing
allegations that campaign finance practices went awry in the 1996
race, including accusations that China tried to influence American
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Both the president and vice president were questioned under oath
about their fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's case, Reno said investigators examined 68 donors
who they suspected could have been telephoned by the president.
Reno said investigators found only three instances in which Clinton
made fund-raising related calls.Twice he made thank-you calls. A
third involved solicitations, but those were made from the White
House residential quarters, which is not considered to be official
government property under a 114-year old law prohibiting officials
from soliciting contributions for their re-election campaigns from
federal offices. In Gore's case, investigators found that the vice
president had placed about 45 fund-raising calls from his White
House office. But Reno said Gore believed that each of the calls
was intended to raise money for general party purposes, known as
soft money. Reno said that Gore did not know that some of the money
was transferred into what are known as ``hard money'' accounts used
to pay for direct re-election efforts _ something Reno had said
previously might be illegal.  &UR;  &LR;  &QL;

IT'S DANGEROUS DOWN UNDER _ AND DANGEROUSLY WELCOMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Bryson might just be the most popular unknown writer in
America. His wry, Everyman-in-over-his-head musings are savored in
much of the world, but the travel writer/humorist only recently
scaled the bestseller lists in his native land.
</P>
<P>
   After taking readers on tours of Europe (''Neither Here Nor
There,'') the United States (''The Lost Continent,'') England
(''Notes From a Small Island'') and the Appalachian Trail (''A Walk
in the Woods''), Bryson continues his wanderings in his latest
book, ``In a Sunburned Country'' (Broadway Books, $25), which
chronicles his meanderings through Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Like his previous books, this one (which arrives in bookstores
June 6) combines sharp-edged humor with history and more than a few
insights on ecology and endangered species. Bryson's challenge has
always been to strike a balance between entertaining and educating
his ever-growing ranks of fans, most of whom feel by the end of his
books that they are the author's close, personal friends.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson, 49, touched on many subjects in an early-morning phone
interview from his home in New Hampshire. Despite being jet-lagged
(he had returned from England the night before), he was quite
chatty, his unique hybrid Midwestern/British accent crackling
cheerfully over the wire. (Bryson spent much of his adult life
living in England before moving his family back to America five
years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: In the last few years, you've evolved from cult
favorite to bestselling author, especially with ``A Walk in the
Woods.'' Any idea why?
</P>
<P>
   BRYSON: It's tough for a writer to gauge, as opposed, say, to a
television celebrity. I mean, if you stopped 100 people in the
street, how many do you really suppose would know John Updike or
someone like that? I think it may be more a matter of travel
writing being a literary genre in America whose time has arrived.
Why it took so long, I don't know. Maybe Americans are traveling
more, getting away from the ``me''-obsessed '90s when they were
engrossed in piling up money.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, why did you pick Australia as the subject of the new
book?
</P>
<P>
   A: It began when I went there 10 years ago, to a literary
festival. I didn't expect to be drawn to Australia in any big way,
but it is absolutely a delightful country very few non-Australians
seem to know much about. It has a great climate, the people are
extraordinarily extroverted and welcoming, and Australia has all
this amazing stuff about it: natural wonders, barren deserts,
reefs.
</P>
<P>
   I really knew nothing about Australia before I went out for this
book. It is such an astonishment to be there and to look around, to
learn about its landscape and history and the problems presented to
people settling there. It was, and is, a hard, hard country to
conquer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Quite a bit of ``In a Sunburned Country'' concentrates on all
the things in Australia that can kill you, from snakes to
undertows. Did survival take up a lot of your attention?
</P>
<P>
   A: My first rule in Australia was to touch nothing. I was
careful to always stay on concrete. My thinking was, don't lean
your hand against a tree so something won't bite it. You have to
remain alert. But, really, the people there think of the snakes and
such things like I used to think of terrible storms when I lived in
the Midwest. Yes, these are things that can kill you, but you can
also go your whole life without running into one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Despite the deserts and snakes and riptides, ``In a Sunburned
Country'' makes it clear you ended up loving Australia.
</P>
<P>
   A: You know, it is such an exotic place, and yet also familiar.
You drive out of the city and within minutes are in the middle of
totally alien, very fierce Death Valley-type stuff, where if you
get lost you could die within hours. Yet afterwards you drive back
into town, stay at a very normal motel, go to a pub or a restaurant
and eat steak and french fries, all familiar things. To me, exotic
and familiar at the same time is very appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Longtime readers might think there's less humor and more
education in this new book. Is that accurate?
</P>
<P>
   A: For the first couple of travel books I did, I was learning my
way as a writer. I felt, reading these books later on, that there
were perhaps too many jokes, that I was trying too much just to
make people laugh. I think people want something more solid amid
the frothiness. They want to put down a book feeling they learned
something as well as being entertained. And Australia was such a
fascinating subject in so many ways that I often found myself
getting sidetracked on some topic or another, to the point where
sometimes I lost interest altogether in making jokes. But I hope
there are still lots of places where people will laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that ``In a Sunburned Country'' is about to be published,
what book will you work on next? Or, should we say, what country is
next?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have a couple amorphous ideas, but they will have to wait.
The way publishing works these days is, you spend a year or 18
months researching a book, a year writing it, and a year on the
road selling it. For most of the next year, I will be promoting
``In a Sunburned Country.'' The year 2000 will not be productive
for me in terms of research and writing.
</P>
<P>
   But I'd like my next book to have a sort of ``whole Earth''
theme, taking our planet as a global entity. I want to view us as a
space alien would. You see, travel writers are always looking for
differences _ ``Here I am in France or China, and the people are
quite curious.'' Well, I believe all human beings, whatever their
nationality or race, would look essentially the same to a Martian.
We mostly have things in common. I would like to write about that.

   Independent bookstore. Say it, and the words conjure up a dusty
place with a tumble of books, an owner with a passion and a small
staff with a love of literature and an uncommon knowledge of it, at
times even a snobbishness about what is considered good enough to
be displayed in the window, which of course fronts on a tree-lined
Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   Is this romance in book publishing over? Not quite, but at a
moment when there is a lot of continuing and justifiable
anxiousness over small, independent general bookstores being sucked
down one at a time in the whirlpool of the large chains, it would
seem quixotic, if not outlandish, to get into the independent
bookstore business.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in 1995 the American Booksellers Association, the
trade group of the independents and the small chains, had more than
5,500 members with about 7,000 stores; now it has 3,100 members and
4,000 locations. Mostly the disappearing stores have been X'd out
by the arrival in the neighborhood of a Barnes &AMP; Noble or Borders
store. (The sale of books on the Internet hasn't helped either.)
</P>
<P>
   But nonetheless Peter Greeman, 68, a retired advertising
executive, has bucked the trend _ a sort of bookish equivalent of
``man bites dog'' report _ and has purchased a barely surviving
independent in the New York City suburb of Larchmont. And while he
doesn't see this as an act of intellectual expiation _ ``it's
almost like a charity,'' he said _ he is pleased with what he has
done, and so, too, are his neighbors. So just why has he leaped
onto eroding terrain and bought Anderson's Book Shop?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a place in my heart for this particular bookstore,''
Greeman said. ``I grew up in Larchmont, and so did my father, and
the bookstore was there, and Mr. Anderson wrote my college
recommendation. I wanted to do Larchmont a favor. All my friends
and acquaintances bemoaned the fact that they thought it would go
under, and the store's manager,'' Annabelle Siegel, ``lives across
the street from me, and she's a dear friend.''
</P>
<P>
   If the book business is full of people cradled in the arms of
Morpheus, Greeman is confident he is not one of them. This new
entrepreneur said that that the man he purchased his store from,
Jim Miller, had owned it for 10 years and that it wasn't bankrupt.
Greeman added: ``Jim was making a living but didn't have much to
invest in the future. Maybe he thought there wasn't any future to
invest in in this business. I said to myself there can be
exceptions, particularly in a town like Larchmont where people like
to shop locally.'' Greeman said he planned to renovate the store
and increase its inventory from the 15,000 titles it has now to the
40,000 it had during its best years, a good percentage of the
accretion to be in children's books. And there won't be a coffee
shop in his store.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not this works commercially in the Darwinian world,
the salvaging of Anderson's Book Shop, although it is but one, is
celebrated by book publishers. Independent bookstores still have an
importance beyond the actual number of titles they sell. The best
marketing for books remains word-of-mouth passion, and often the
first mouths to send the word with fervor are the independent
bookstores, particularly for literary fiction and literary
nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   Independent bookstores ``are littered with people like Mr.
Greeman who have made them a second career,'' said Oren Teicher,
the CEO of the booksellers' association. ``They share a passion for
their product, which sets them apart from people who own drugstores
and hardware stores. They are teachers and librarians and
bankers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Liebmann, director of independent bookselling for Random
House, explained: ``The indies are where lots of books start.
They're actively looking for books to fall in love with, and they
share that passion with their customers. They are tremendous
readers, and they can generate a lot of talk in the life of a book,
early on.''
</P>
<P>
   An example: Three weeks ago her department sent out several
hundred reading copies to independent bookstores of ``Driving Mr.
Albert'' (Dial Press), the true story by Michael Paterniti of the
transporting of Albert Einstein's brain in two Tupperware
containers in the trunk of a car in the 1990s from Princeton to
California. ``Within four days, it was read, and e-mails were
flying around the country, and suddenly there there was huge
excitement about a book nobody had heard of four weeks ago,''
Liebmann said. ``That chemistry can get a book started.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is scheduled to be in stores in July with a first
printing of 25,000 copies. It has already been sold to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   The independents are involved in their own sort of jihad against
the large chains and have a court case pending in California in
which they charge the chains with making special promotional
allowances and other deals with publishers. This in turn allows the
large chains to reduce their costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's axiomatic that this will drive small stores out of
business,'' Teicher said. Still, the association has made a
settlement with the publishers, all of whom now claim that the
playing field for independents and small chains has been leveled.
</P>
<P>
   Are things looking up for the independents? Perhaps. Their
association, which is holding its annual convention in Chicago next
month, reinstated at its last gathering its classes for people who
want to learn how to operate an independent bookstore. This year 45
people have signed up for the course.
</P>
<P>
   Greeman said he was confident that there was no commercial space
in Larchmont for a large chain branch, and that at any rate the
population (6,200 in the 1990 census) was too small.
</P>
<P>
   But across Westchester County from his store is the Mount Kisco
Book Co. in Mount Kisco, population 9,100. It was not just a store
that sold books and such but also a community gathering place so
popular that local residents banded together to bring it back from
a fire four years ago. A two-minute walk away is a shopping center
and a Borders. The Mount Kisco Book Co. will close on Saturday.

   The Democratic National Committee expects to set a one-day
fund-raising record, taking in about $25 million thanks in part to
unions, lobbyists and others with issues before the government. The
total will beat the Republicans' $21.5 million of last month. In a
preview of the gala at the MCI Center in Washington, President
Clinton thanked about 60 of the party's biggest donors for raising
the money that he said will put Al Gore and the Democrats on even
footing with the Republicans. Just a few blocks away, at the
Washington Convention Center tonight, the Republicans' expect to
bring in $11 million at their annual Senate-House dinner, topping
the $8 million raised at last year's affair. Helping to raise money
for the congressional Republicans will be Bob Dole, the party's
1996 presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   NO, NOT THAT KIND OF DISARMAMENT
</P>
<P>
   Responding on a Washington radio show today with something
between a chuckle and a snicker to the National Rifle Association's
recent declaration of war, Al Gore said he has ``no intention of
proposing or supporting policies or allowing policies that disarm
America.'' At last weekend's NRA convention, Charlton Heston lifted
a musket above his head and challenged Gore, saying the weapon
would have to be pried ``from my cold dead hands.'' Reminded by
NPR's Diane Rehm of that scene, Gore replied with a laugh that ``I
would not do what he accuses me of planning.'' Gore had racked up a
pro-gun voting record in his days in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   THE HIGH-TECH MONEY RACE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is trouncing Al Gore in the race for high-tech
donations, according to an independent group that tracks campaign
contributions. Between January 1999 and March 2000, Bush received
about $815,000, and Gore about $363,000 from the computer industry
and ``dot.coms'' that sell products and services, the nonpartisan,
Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics reported. Reform
Party contender Pat Buchanan received nearly $17,000.
</P>
<P>
   STEP ASIDE? NOT EXACTLY
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to media reports the past few days, Howard Phillips
says he's not offering to step aside as Constitution Party
presidential candidate in favor of Alan Keyes. This, according to a
party e-mail sent to media outlets. The Constitution Party is
wooing the Republican presidential candidate, who has vowed to
leave the GOP if it should choose a vice presidential candidate who
is pro-choice on the abortion issue. The Constitution Party,
formerly known as the U.S. Taxpayers Party, had opened its arms to
the former envoy to the United Nations, saying he could be
considered a running-mate for Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   INTERESTING FOOTSTEPS TO FOLLOW
</P>
<P>
   Idaho's four-term lieutenant governor won the Republican primary
and the right to run for the House seat held by ultraconservative
GOP Rep. Helen Chenoweth-Hage. Lt. Gov. Butch Otter, a millionaire
businessman, trounced Dennis Mansfield, who co-founded the
religious-right Idaho Family Forum with Chenoweth-Hage, 48-26
percent. Six other Republicans split the rest. Chenoweth-Hage, who
fulfilled a campaign pledge to retire after three terms, built her
career on opposition to big government and ``environmental
extremism.'' Her remarks after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing were
viewed as sympathetic to militias. She also once claimed that
minorities don't like northern Idaho because it's too cold.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE RUNOFF IN ARKANSAS
</P>
<P>
   A crowded field of Arkansas Democrats hoping to challenge
embattled GOP Rep. Jay Dickey failed to produce an outright winner.
There'll be a runoff June 13. State Sen. Mike Ross drew 44 percent,
but second-place was less clear, with two candidates at 22 percent.
With 99 percent of precincts reporting, ex-TV reporter Dewayne
Graham had 20,838 votes, ex-state Rep. Judy Smith, who lost to
Dickey in 1998, had 20,288. A fourth candidate got 11 percent of
the vote. To avoid a runoff, the winner had to get more than 50
percent. Dickey was criticized earlier this year for telling black
farmers he could do little to help them because they didn't support
him politically.
</P>
<P>
   SAME GENDER, DIFFERENT RACES
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, state Rep. Eleanor Jordan defeated two candidates
to win the Democratic nomination to challenge two-term Republican
Rep. Anne Northup in a district that is 2-1 Democratic. Jordan, the
only black woman in the state Legislature, hopes to become
Kentucky's first black member of Congress. Northup had no primary
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   LET'S START THE FEUD!
</P>
<P>
   A Republican pro-abortion rights group, whose leadership
includes top backers of George W. Bush, is trying to turn the
abortion battle into a Bush family feud. ``Listen to your mama,''
says the punchline on a radio ad, noting that former first lady
Barbara Bush wants the GOP to drop the anti-abortion plank from its
national platform. The ad, produced by Republicans for Choice, will
run in Philadelphia, site of the Republican National Convention, as
the summer event draws near. Bush has said he favors maintaining
the GOP plank calling for a constitutional amendment banning
abortion, though it differs with his position that abortion should
be permitted in cases involving rape, incest or endangerment of the
mother's health.
</P>
<P>
   UNION CHIEF LOOKS AT NADER
</P>
<P>
   With the House approaching its hard-fought vote on granting
China permanent normal trade relations, one labor leader suggested
that the Green Party's Ralph Nader would be preferable to Al Gore.
By supporting the China bill, Gore is siding with ``multinational
corporations against workers here and abroad,'' said United Auto
Workers President Stephen Yokich. ``It's time to forget about party
labels and instead focus on supporting candidates ... who will take
a stand based on what is right, not what big money dictates.'' The
UAW had declined to choose between Gore and Democratic rival Bill
Bradley, and so far is not choosing between Gore and George W.
Bush.

   SUBWAY RIDE TO RECOGNITION

   While Hillary Clinton attacked her new Senate opponent on gun
control and taxes, Rick Lazio rode the New York subway in search of
votes _ and name recognition. Lazio criticized Clinton for tooling
around in ``chauffeured limousines.'' ``This is the way most New
Yorkers travel,'' he said as he rode the No. 6 train uptown. Lazio
shook hands in Grand Central Terminal, then took the subway up to
East Harlem and went on a walking tour. ``Hi, I'm Rick Lazio. Hope
I can count on your support,'' he said over and over.

<P>
   ATTACKING THE MESSENGER
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to cost, mean-spirited verbiage and manipulation
by out-of-state interests, Michigan nay never have seen a race like
the current one for the Senate between the incumbent freshman
Republican, Spencer Abraham, and his Democratic challenger, Rep.
Debbie Stabenow. The contest, which could be crucial in deciding
control of the Senate next year, is so hot and tight that even the
latest poll, showing Stabenow taking a 4-point lead, has become an
issue. Abraham's take: The pollster, Edward Sarpolus, can't be
trusted because he once worked for some Democrats. Sarpolus' reply:
Most pollsters have done some work for candidates, and the senator
is being ``childish.''
</P>
<P>
   IS IT LISTED ON THEIR RESUMES?
</P>
<P>
   Top aides to members of Congress have long helped raise campaign
funds for their bosses, but
</P>
<P>
   their activity reportedly is intensifying. Interviews with more
than 20 House chiefs of staff by The Hill indicated that the
practice is widespread, even as many members employ full-time
fund-raising professionals. And for many chiefs of staff and
administrative assistants, it's one of the most common requirements
of their jobs _ but also the least discussed. They say they raise
campaign funds out of the office, and it usually doesn't occupy
more than 10 percent of their work schedule.

   Restrained. Cerebral. Experimental. Pearl Jam? Believe it.
Grunge's last men standing defy expectations on their sixth studio
album by turning down the volume and dropping the angry-youth
ranting that defined PJ's early '90s anti-pop. ``Binaural'' rarely
engages the white-hot fury unleashed on '97's ``Yield.'' Most
tracks cultivate a smoldering angst that never quite catches fire.
Prog-rock atmospherics and acoustic guitars enhance the mood as
Vedder's fog-cutter vocals ruminate on such grown-up concerns as
mortality, loss and Columbine. Nods to rockabilly
(``Breakerfall''), Eastern folk (``Of the Girl'') and art-rock
(``Nothing as It Seems'') may rankle fans hoping for another
``Evenflow.'' But ``Binaural'' should be recognized for what it is:
a natural evolution for a band that's outgrown the mosh pit.

   The late Jeff Buckley was a mesmerizing live performer, and
``Mojo Pin'' and several other tracks make that clear. That magic
often eludes capture on tape, though. On a couple of tracks, his
usually powerful, free-flowing voice sounds tired. Leonard Cohen's
``Hallelujah,'' which was bone-chillingly beautiful on ``Grace,''
is particularly disappointing, even with the insertion of a snippet
of the Smiths' ``I Know It's Over.'' Get ``Grace'' for a fuller
understanding of what we lost when Buckley drowned in 1997.

 &HT;    Best of three worlds turn out a soulful gem
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This new collaboration between members of three super groups
puts incredible organic grooves first and lyrics, well _ who dances
to lyrics?
</P>
<P>
   Real cool hip-moving is the priority for Raphael Saadiq, front
man of one of the few successful R&AMP;B bands of the past two decades,
Tony Toni Tone. By his side are Dawn Robinson, the powerful singer
who neared Aretha Franklin's sassiness in model R&AMP;B quartet En
Vogue, and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, the smart beat provider for the
pioneering hip-hop act that melded rap and jazz, A Tribe Called
Quest.
</P>
<P>
   Not that those two weigh too heavily here.
</P>
<P>
   Saadiq's indelible, soulful and yet nasal voice makes this
melange of memorable hooks (``Dance Tonight'') and clear '70s Sly
Stone influences (``Every-day,'' ``Hollywood'') sound like one of
the better Tony albums. At other times it feels like an acid jazz
album by the Brand New Heavies that these three are just
guest-appearing on.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of which does much for creating an identity. But as for
a soundtrack to a Saturday get-together, you could do worse than
having this in the living room.

 &HT;    Rhubarb season means more pie for the asking
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rhubarb was just a tart memory late last July when
Ruth Weaver of Lawrenceville, Ga. wrote asking for a recipe for
Strawberry Rhubarb Pie. We remembered her request, though, and
hoped to find a good one to publish before rhubarb's May-June local
season came and went again.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, this Strawberry Rhubarb Galette, served recently at the
20th annual Napa Valley Wine Auction, arrived in time, and our
tester says it was well worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry-Rhubarb Galette
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 30-40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Standing time (filling): 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Chilling time (dough): 2 hours to overnight
</P>
<P>
   For the galette dough, chilled:
</P>
<P>
   1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup corn flour (masa)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon sea salt
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) very cold unsalted butter, cut into
1/2-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1/2 to 3/4 cup ice water, divided
</P>
<P>
   For the filling:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup cornstarch, sifted
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   4 cups rhubarb, cut into 1/2-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup dried cherries
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   4 cups sliced fresh strawberries
</P>
<P>
   1 egg yolk, beaten
</P>
<P>
   Large crystal sugar for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   To make the dough: Position a rack in the lower third of the
oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, masa, sugar and salt.
Add half the butter to the flour mixture and work it with your
fingertips until the dough has the texture of coarse oatmeal.
</P>
<P>
   Add the remaining butter, quickly working it into the flour
until the largest pieces are about the size of large lima beans.
</P>
<P>
   Add about 1/2 cup of the ice water in several stages, tossing
and mixing between additions. Don't try to dampen all the dough
evenly. Stop adding water while there are still a few bits of dry
flour remaining in the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Gather dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic wrap,
pressing down to shape the dough.
</P>
<P>
   Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 16-inch
circle that is about 1/8 inch thick. Lift often, using enough flour
to keep from sticking. Gently fold the dough in half, then in
quarters. Center the folded tip on the prepared baking sheet and
open.
</P>
<P>
   Place in the refrigerator and keep chilled until filling is
ready.
</P>
<P>
   To make the filling: In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar,
cornstarch and salt. Whisk in the water and continue whisking until
sugar has dissolved. Add the rhubarb and dried cherries and allow
to sit for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a slow
boil, stirring often. Simmer for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
Remove from heat, add butter and stir until melted. Remove filling
from the pan to a dish and allow to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Add the strawberries to the cooled filling. Spread the filling
in the center of the dough, leaving a 3-inch border. Fold the edges
over toward the fruit, overlapping as you go.
</P>
<P>
   Brush the top surfaces of the dough with the beaten egg yolk,
being careful to avoid the filling. Generously sprinkle the large
crystal sugar on the dough.
</P>
<P>
   Place in oven and bake until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and let the galette
rest on the sheet for 10 minutes. Using a wide spatula, slide the
galette to a cooling rack.
</P>
<P>
   Serve warm or at room temperature with creme fraiche, whipped
cream or vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Per serving: 454 calories, 4 grams protein, 20 grams fat
(percent calories from fat, 40), 66 grams carbohydrates, 78
milligrams cholesterol, 260 milligrams sodium, 4 grams fiber.

 &HT;    As summer cookout season gets under way, it's time to turn up
the heat to medium under a juicy, inch-thick steak for a royally
good time
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now, the grill has been pulled from its winter cover and
scrubbed. Some backyard chefs have already smoked theirs up a few
times, grilling ribs or burgers or maybe some fish.
</P>
<P>
   But Memorial Day weekend is the official coronation of the
grilling season, so it's time for the king of the grate _ the
steak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beef is still the meat of choice,'' said Tom Perini, author of
``Texas Cowboy Cooking'' (Time Life Books, $24.95). ``And if it's a
special occasion, then it's got to be steak.''
</P>
<P>
   Perini would be a bit partial. For 17 years, he's operated the
Perini Ranch Steakhouse in Buffalo Gap, Texas, which is about 15
miles south of Abilene. ``Just get on I-20 and head west,'' he
urged in a recent interview, as if driving halfway across the
country is nothing when there's a good steak waiting at the end of
the road.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, folks from Dallas often make the 3 1/2-hour trek to
Perini's ranch for his beef. He started as a rancher, developed
cooking skills operating chuckwagons for his crews and then quit
ranching and started cooking full time.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation sizzled as each steak was served. He's cooked for
Texas Gov. George W. Bush and taken his chuckwagon kitchen on the
road to special events across the country and across the ocean to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to great steaks? Great meat, for starters. Perini
recommends USDA prime or choice meats for grilling. Prime is the
top grade, but ``choice is really fine for home cooks. That's (the
best possible grade) most will find in their grocery stores,''
Perini advised. Look for cuts of beef labeled USDA choice, which
are sometimes pre-packaged but often kept at the meat counters of
finer grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Next, choose a cut that grills well. ``The sirloin is an
excellent family steak. You can cook two _ one at medium rare, one
at medium _ cut up and serve,'' Perini suggests. ``And the ribeye
is my personal favorite for grilling because of the marbling of
fat. Some marbling is important for flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Perini also recommends the porterhouse/T-bone cuts, both of
which have a loin and a tenderloin side separated by bone. (The
porterhouse will have a bit more meat on the tenderloin side than
the T-bone.) Perini doesn't like flank steaks or round steaks
because they demand some attention ahead of time (for marinating).
He prefers a quick rub and then to the grill.
</P>
<P>
   But for many, a marinated chuck, round or flank steak can be an
economical crowd pleaser. ``They can be very juicy or tender, but
they do require a different type of cooking than a ribeye or
loin,'' said Jennifer Dunn, nutritionist and spokeswoman for the
Georgia Beef Board. ``If you marinate them for 4 to 6 hours, it
will break down some of the connective tissue and make them more
tender. And they can be full of flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference in cost may be worth the extra effort. A quick
check of prices on webvan.com showed top round steaks and flank
steaks ranging from $3.77 a pound to $4.57 a pound. The cost for a
New York strip was $6.27 a pound and for a ribeye $6.87 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Thickness also is important. Dunn did a master's degree research
project on how the thickness of steak affects cooking. She prefers
a 1-inch thickness; superthin steaks are likely to be overcooked,
and a very thick steak can take a while and be trickier to cook
evenly.
</P>
<P>
   The debates over charcoal, wood or gas apply to steak as to
anything else. Perini prefers wood, but no matter what's used, it's
important to start with an even heat that's fairly high so the meat
will sear. But not too high, unless you like black char on the
outside and cold meat in the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go with a medium-high heat. Place your hand 3 inches above the
coals. If you can keep it there five seconds without pulling back,
you're ready,'' said Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   Both Perini and Dunn warn that the most common mistake is
overcooking. ``When you start cooking a steak above medium, you are
in harm's way,'' said Perini. The harm, of course, is not a food
safety concern, but rather a flavor concern. Steaks cooked past
medium become tough and dry. Inside, we offer some tips for getting
it right _ but the best advice is to practice, practice. (A meat
thermometer can really eliminate the guesswork.)
</P>
<P>
   Pull the steak off the grill before it's perfect. ``If it's
perfect on the grill, then it will be overdone when you are ready
to eat it,'' Perini said. That's because of ``hangover heat,'' as
the cowboy describes it. The heat from the exterior is going to
continue to cook the interior. A steak can cook another five
degrees once it's pulled off the grill. So the final step _ and do
not overlook this _ is to let the steak rest five to 10 minutes
before serving. It completes cooking and allows the juices to come
together.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, we share Perini's steak rub, along with methods for
cooking several cuts of steaks and pairings with delicious
marinades, sauces, condiments and sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be afraid to grill steaks. Enjoy it,'' Perini urges.
``And always cook a little extra. Cold leftover steak is great for
sandwiches and salads.''
</P>
<P>
   THE FIVE SECRETS OF GREAT STEAK
</P>
<P>
   1. Buy prime- or choice-grade meats.
</P>
<P>
   2. Marinate tougher cuts.
</P>
<P>
   3. Cook over an even, medium-high heat.
</P>
<P>
   4. Pull steak off the heat just before it reaches desired
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   5. Let it rest 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The young man, whose dapper mustache and
cream-colored Prada raincoat proclaimed him to be a seeker of the
most up-to-the-minute design truths, was transfixed. ``It's so
exciting,'' said David Kimelman, 22, a student at Pratt Institute.
``This is design based almost purely on body language. The paint
job is so beautiful, but the gestures are what's really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't talking about any of the new furniture being
introduced this week at the International Contemporary Furniture
Fair, or the experiments in techno-gel, felt or polyester open cell
foam on show there. He was enthusiastic about a breakthrough of a
different order: 18th-century porcelain figurines.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of 8-inch figures elaborately costumed in gold-trimmed
waistcoats, floral dirndls and other exotic garb and flashing coy,
dimpled glances, mock surprise or drawn daggers were capering on
the tables at Moss, the SoHo design shop and purveyor of
avant-garde modernism. ``I was definitely taken aback when I first
saw them,'' Kimelman said. ``That was the best part.''
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture that could be interpreted as either the last straw
for minimalism or an inspired embrace of refined product design,
Murray Moss spread out several hundred pieces of porcelain, which
were conceived in the 18th century at the Nymphenburg factory in
Bavaria and remain in production.
</P>
<P>
   The pairing itself was provocative: Moss, the high priest of
modernist retailing, dressed as always to code in solid black and
white (``I haven't worn a pattern in years and years!''), and those
exquisitely high-priced rococo knickknacks favored by German
aristocrats for 250 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, about 200 design fans arrived at the opening of
Moss' paean to porcelain, ``White Gold, a Fragile Eccentricity.''
The exhibition, which also features contemporary works in porcelain
by Ted Muehling and Konstantin Grcic, will be on display through
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Muehling's Nymphenburg collection is on display at Bergdorf
Goodman, and the work of another designer, Bodo Sperlein, from
Germany, is being featured at Breukelen at 68 Gansevoort Street in
Greenwich Village. But only Moss is showcasing the classic
figurines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I surprise myself by liking them,'' said Robert LaValva, 36,
an architect, peering at a mincing masked harlequin figurine robed
in orange and yellow striped pajamas overlaid with black and blue
diamonds. ``They're so well crafted, so clearly from another era,
but also so timeless. The intense colors remind me of the Sistine
Chapel after it was cleaned.'' First produced in 1747, Nymphenburg
porcelains are not as famous or as collectible as those from
Meissen, an older and larger porcelain works in Germany. But from
the start, Nymphenburg's figurines, plates and table services have
been laboriously handmade, some pieces taking six weeks to
complete. Each ribboned bow is added with tweezers; each colored
glaze is fired separately at a different temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The Nymphenburg Porcelain Factory can claim one of the greatest
porcelain artists ever to have worked the complex mixture of china
clay, quartz and feldspar known as white gold: Franz Anton
Bustelli. He made porcelains for only eight years, until his death
in 1763, but it is his creations (in reproduction) that are being
celebrated at Moss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was Nymphenburg's key modeler,'' said Jody Wilkie, head of
European ceramics and glass at Christie's. ``His figures are
wonderfully alive. There's a very distinctive elegance and
sophistication to Bustelli pieces. Once you've seen one, they pop
out at you as different from anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, $75,000 Bustelli originals and $2,900 newly painted
porcelain plates are not an easy sell in these days of mass
production and low, low price points. Besides, collecting figurines
is for ``a rather old-fashioned taste,'' as Wilkie put it. ``Every
time I organize a sale I wonder, Who am I going to find to buy this
stuff?'' she added, noting that 18th-century pieces rarely come on
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when Egbert Freiherr von Maltzahn took over as
president of the factory, he set out to woo a younger crowd. ``We
can't live anymore off the old aristocracy,'' he said, sipping a
glass of Champagne at the Moss opening. ``We have to find more
customers, like Gucci did.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, he started commissioning young designers, like
Muehling of New York and Grcic of Munich, to make their own designs
at the factory, which is on the grounds of the 17th-century
Nymphenburg Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked to see that these remarkably graceful things
were still in production,'' Muehling said. ``The part that isn't
kitschy'' is extraordinary, he added.
</P>
<P>
   After almost two years of learning, among other things, how to
shape a single egg that wouldn't collapse when baked at 2,500
degrees, Muehling has brought forth a 17-piece porcelain collection
with near-transparent shell-shaped dishes, spoons that look like
bleached, porous coral and blue oval vases so like eggs that they
might fool a robin. (They're available for $70 to $700).
</P>
<P>
   Nymphenburg's interest in such designers dovetails nicely with a
new generation discovering the handmade. Marcel Wanders, the Dutch
designer often associated with Droog, the hypermodern design
collaborative, said he wants to start working at Nymphenburg soon.
He blanched, however, when asked about the inherent conflict
between a royal factory created to serve the king's court and
modernism's high-tech, available-to-all agenda. Don't they cancel
each other out?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not coming from our generation!'' he said. ``Our
generation wants to do the full gamut, from plastic to handmade
porcelain.''
</P>
<P>
   As designers raised on injection-molded plastics start exploring
the incandescent beauty of things handmade, Moss is at the ready to
be their bald John Ruskin, the 19th-century aesthetician who
glorified English crafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I miss in today's object culture is narrative, things
that have a story to tell,'' Moss said, as he showed a guest a back
room where his stock of Nymphenburg porcelains (white plates, $91;
commedia dell'arte figurine with ornately painted bodice and skirt,
$23,000) are stored draped in notes saying, ``Do not touch, or
die!''
</P>
<P>
   Moss explained his newfound passion for the porcelains: ``I
reached a point where I have things around me with no surface
decoration, no emotional qualities. It's all indestructible
stainless steel, carbon-fiber, techno-materials. I'm looking for
things with more humanity, things that are fragile and not so
replaceable. Why not have some things that if they broke you would
feel a personal loss? Why not own something that you love and that
if it weren't there you would be sad? We do it with people _ why
not with an object?''
</P>
<P>
   Von Maltzahn would be content to see his company's stagnant
sales climb. As the crowd threatened to overwhelm the plates spread
out as they once were for royalty along a long white lacquered
table at the center of Moss, the president of the Nymphenburg
porcelain factory remained sanguine. No matter that a figurine or a
plate, painted by an artisan free to express a flower or bee
slightly differently from the last, might not make it through the
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything breaks, it's OK,'' von Maltzahn said. ``They're
insured.''

 &HT;    Perfectly done steak a sizzling summer treat
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   How can you tell if a steak on the grill is done?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just make a little cut in it and peek,'' suggests Mumbo Jumbo
chef Shaun Doty. ``It's OK to do that. Really. Just don't make too
many cuts or it will end up looking like Freddy Krueger,'' he
advised, referring to the horror film character in ``Nightmare on
Elm Street.''
</P>
<P>
   His advice serves a larger purpose _ to remind home cooks to
relax and use a little common sense when grilling steak. Witness
the information on cooking times below. There are a number of ways
to tell, from exact (meat thermometer) to thereabouts (the thumb
test). Experiment with them all and see which way works best for
you.
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for the turning rule. Most recipes and directions
advise turning only once for all but the largest cuts. I probably
always turn twice, searing both sides and then moving the steak to
a bit lower heat to finish cooking. Works for me. You'll know what
works for you when you get the ``perfect'' steak by your standards.
The trick is to pay attention while you are grilling, and then jot
down what you did.
</P>
<P>
   We give you plenty of scrumptious steak ideas below to aid in
your summer research project. So get sizzling.
</P>
<P>
   How to tell if steak is done
</P>
<P>
   There's so much advice out there on how to tell if a steak is
``done,'' it's enough to make your brains sizzle. Seems the easiest
way is simply to get a meat thermometer _ 140 degrees for rare, 160
degrees for medium and 170 for well-done.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the steak will continue cooking for a few minutes after
it comes off the grill. I like to take the steak off when it
registers 145 degrees so that the final cooking temperature will be
about 150 degrees, somewhere between medium-rare and medium.
Instant-read meat thermometers can be picked up at most grocery
stores for just a few bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe you'd prefer a Therma-fork, which is a battery-operated
steak fork with a light that will read medium-rare, medium, etc. We
spotted them at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $9.99.
</P>
<P>
   Many experienced cooks can tell when the steak is ready by
touch. One guide is to touch your index finger to your thumb,
forming an O. Turn palm side up and, with a finger of your other
hand, feel the firmness of the thumb muscle by poking at the base
of the thumb. This is what a raw or barely cooked steak will feel
like.
</P>
<P>
   Now, touch the other three fingers to the thumb one at a time
and notice how the thumb muscle firms up. The middle finger is
rare, the ring finger is medium-rare and the pinkie is medium to
well-done. A rather inexact method, but one some pros swear by.
</P>
<P>
   Time charts also can be helpful, but they are only a guide.
Below, we provide the chart from Weber grills, found at
www.weberbbq.com. But as Weber points out, the guide is based on a
70-degree day with no wind. How often do we have those in Atlanta?
Certainly not in June. So that's why all cooking times on charts
are approximate.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, the time varies greatly, depending on the heat of
the grill. Try the hand test _ it's ready when you can leave your
hand 3 inches above the heat for 4-5 seconds before pulling away.

<P>
   Learning the cuts of steak
</P>
<P>
   Tom Perini, author of ``Texas Cowboy Cooking'' (TimeLife Books,
$24.95) offers this take on the different cuts of steak.
</P>
<P>
   Flank/London broil: A popular cut, but can be very fibrous and
tough if not properly prepared. It's best to marinate, to tenderize
and season. Better not cooked rare or well-done. Slice across the
grain.
</P>
<P>
   T-bone/porterhouse: A classic cut of steak that's a little like
having two steaks in one. There's a bone running down the middle,
and on one side you have the strip and on the other the filet.
There is some fat and flavor around the bone, while the steaks
themselves are lean. Look for a good 1 1/2 inch thickness.
</P>
<P>
   Strip/top loin: The strip is a lean cut from the top loin that's
quite popular. Because it has less marbling, it also can have less
flavor. A great choice for those watching fat content. Usually sold
an inch thick or more.
</P>
<P>
   Sirloin: A larger cut of steak with wonderful flavor because the
bone is in. Cooks nicely on the grill, then can be divided into
smaller servings or sliced, so it's nice for a family.
</P>
<P>
   Ribeye: A cut with quite a bit of marbling (and Perini's
favorite for the grill). It's really the same cut as the prime rib,
only it's cut into steak for the grill (instead of roasted and
sliced). The marbling gives flavor and tenderness.
</P>
<P>
   Tenderloin/filet mignon: Cut from the tenderloin, the filet is
the leanest cut of meat. It takes a little longer to cook because
it's the thickest cut. Because of the leaness, it can lack flavor,
which is why they are often wrapped in bacon. For cooking
medium-well or well-done, butterfly the steak first.

   Beef and Romaine Salad With Blue Cheese and Anchovy Dressing
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings Preparation time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Steak and blue cheese have a surprisingly wonderful affinity for
each other; the tart greens and tomatoes help cut their richness. A
great way to use up leftover steak, it's also impressive enough to
serve for company.
</P>
<P>
   For the dressing:
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove
</P>
<P>
   4 anchovy fillets
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano or 1 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   For the salad:
</P>
<P>
   1 large head romaine lettuce, washed, outer bruised leaves
removed and discarded, remaining leaves torn into small pieces
</P>
<P>
   2 vine-ripened tomatoes, cut lengthwise into wedges
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces blue cheese, such as Danish blue, Maytag blue or
Roquefort, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   1/2 to 1 pound cooked steak or roast beef, cut into
1/4-inch-by-1-inch-wide strips
</P>
<P>
   Chopped chives or green onions
</P>
<P>
   To make the dressing: Put garlic and anchovies in a food
processor and process to a paste. Add mustard, vinegar, oregano and
pepper. With the motor running, pour the oil through the feed tube
to make a creamy dressing.
</P>
<P>
   For the salad: Pour dressing over the romaine and tomatoes and
toss with the cheese to coat the leaves. Lay the beef strips on top
and garnish with chives or green onions; serve. _ From: ``The

   Although usually flank steak, the term London broil can be used
for any thin cut of meat that is broiled or grilled and sliced on
the diagonal, or bias.
</P>
<P>
   2 cups tomato juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons prepared commercial horseradish
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons dry sherry, vodka or pepper vodka

</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon crumbled dried basil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 pounds London broil, about 1 1/2 inches thick, trimmed
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil cooking spray
</P>
<P>
   Stir together tomato juice, Worcestershire sauce, horseradish,
sherry, marjoram, basil and pepper in a small bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Place steak in a single layer in a glass or ceramic dish. Spoon
the tomato juice mixture over the meat, spreading to cover. Turn
the meat to coat the other side. Cover and refrigerate at least 2
hours or set aside at room temperature for no longer than 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a charcoal or gas grill. Lightly spray the grill rack
with vegetable oil cooking spray. The coals should be moderately
hot to hot.
</P>
<P>
   Lift the meat from the marinade. Discard the marinade. Grill the
steak for 8 minutes. Turn the steak and grill for 7 to 10 minutes
longer for medium-rare, or until it reaches desired doneness.
</P>
<P>
   Let the steak rest at room temperature for about 5 minutes
before slicing on the diagonal into thin strips. _ From: ``Prime

   When the fire is hot enough for you to hold your hand at grill
level for only 5 seconds, place the steak on the grill and sear one
side until nicely browned, about 3 minutes. Turn and sear the
second side for 3 minutes. Move the steak, to keep the tenderloin
away from the most intense heat, cover the grill and cook for 3
minutes. Then turn and move the steak again. Season the steak with
salt and cover the grill. Cook for 3 minutes, turn it, season with
salt. Cook, covered, for 2 minutes more for medium-rare or 5
minutes more for medium.

   There are debates about whether to salt a steak before or after
cooking. The concern is that salt can drain the juices from the
meat. Here, the salt comes at the end of cooking. But most chefs we
asked said it's OK to salt ahead, but just a moment before the meat
goes on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 plump garlic cloves, chopped

   4 (14- to 16-ounce) strip steaks, about 1 1/2 inches thick, at
least choice grade
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt or other coarse salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Sprigs of fresh herbs such as rosemary, sage, thyme or parsley,

</P>
<P>
   At least 2 1/2 hours and up to 6 hours before you grill the
steaks, combine vinegar, oil and garlic in a medium bowl. Place
steaks in a plastic bag or shallow dish, pour marinade over them
and refrigerate. Turn occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Fire up the grill for a two-level fire capable of cooking first
on high heat (1 to 2 seconds with the hand test), then on medium
heat (4 to 5 seconds with the hand test). Remove steaks from
refrigerator and drain, straining the marinade into a small,
nonreactive saucepan. Let the steaks sit uncovered at room
temperature for 30 minutes. Bring marinade to a boil over
medium-high heat and boil vigorously until reduced to 1/2 cup
syrupy glaze. Blot the steaks and sprinkle both sides with salt and
pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Grill steaks uncovered over high heat for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per
side. Move the steaks to medium heat, turning them again, and
continue grilling for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side for medium-rare.
The steaks should be turned a minimum of three times, more often if
juice begins to form on the surface. Brush the steaks with the
glaze in the last few minutes of cooking on each side. If grilling
covered, sear both sides of the meat first on high heat uncovered
for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes; finish cooking with the cover on over
medium heat for 5 to 6 minutes, turning the steaks once midway.
Brush the steaks with glaze when you turn them and again when they
come off the grill. Serve the steaks hot, garnished with herbs. _

   A sirloin is a crowd-pleaser, and this sauce really gives it
some zip.
</P>
<P>
   For the steak:
</P>
<P>
   3 3/4 to 4 pounds boneless sirloin, about 2 inches thick
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon crushed cumin seed
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil cooking spray
</P>
<P>
   For the sauce:
</P>
<P>
   6 fresh Anaheim green chiles
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, halved and thinly sliced crosswise
</P>
<P>
   1 large clove garlic, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons cream cheese
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons sour cream
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the steak: Trim the outer fat from the steak, or ask
the butcher to do so. Rub entire surface of the meat with olive
oil. In a small bowl, combine the cumin, oregano, thyme, garlic,
salt and pepper. Using your fingers, rub evenly on both sides of
the steak and place the steak in a shallow glass or ceramic dish.
Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the sauce: Prepare a charcoal or gas grill or preheat
the broiler. If using a grill, the coals should be moderately hot.
</P>
<P>
   Set the chiles over the heat or under the broiler and grill or
broil for about 5 minutes on each side until lightly charred and
fragrant.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from the grill or broiler and set aside in a paper bag or
cover with paper towels to cool.
</P>
<P>
   When cool enough to handle, peel the skin using your fingers or
a dull knife. (Do not peel the chiles under running water or their
flavor will be diluted.) Cut off and discard the stems and caps.
Slit the chiles, scrape out the seeds (don't worry if a few remain)
and slice the chiles. You will have about 1 cup of chiles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prepare a charcoal or gas grill for the steak.
Lightly spray the grill rack with vegetable oil cooking spray. The
coals should be moderately hot to hot.
</P>
<P>
   Heat canola oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and
garlic and cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes, or until the onions
are softened.
</P>
<P>
   Add the chiles and cook for 3 to 4 mintues longer, or until
fragrant.
</P>
<P>
   Increase heat to medium-high and add the half-and-half. Cook,
stirring, for about 10 minutes, or until the sauce is reduced by
half. Cover and set aside to keep warm while grilling the steak.
</P>
<P>
   Grill the steak for 10 to 12 minutes. Turn and grill for 10 to
12 minutes longer for medium-rare, or until it reaches desired

   Tom Perini, author of ``Texas Cowboy Cooking'' (TimeLife Books,

_ the ribeye _ and thought it delivered a robust black pepper
flavor. The ribeye, by the way, was a prime cut from Star
Provisions that was about $17 a pound. It was probably the most
tender and flavorful steak I've ever eaten. We had plenty of rub
left over for future steaks. (Keep extra in a plastic baggie in the

 &HT;    `Hollow' filled with shivery fun
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heads up: Tim Burton is back. The director's latest is a blend
of scary swordplay, witchcraft and self-spoofing humor served with
tongue planted firmly in cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Depp is geekily effective as Ichabod Crane, who's sent to
investigate a series of beheadings in 1799 Sleepy Hollow. But the
real star is the extraordinary art design; most of the movie was
shot on London sound stages. The movie's steady comic relief is a
useful balance for the Headless Horseman's single-minded attacks,
which spare no one.The DVD ($29.99) includes wide-screen
presentation and Burton's amiable, giggly commentary; you won't
learn a whole lot from his comments, except how much he loved the
old Hammer horror flicks.

   OTHER RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Mighty Peking Man'' (PG-3) _ This cheesy 1977 Hong Kong
``King Kong'' knockoff is a delirious, nonstop 90 minutes of
no-budget camp. In this '70s spectacle of lousy special effects and
howlingly rotten dialogue, the putative star is the guy wearing the
ratty ape suit, but Evelyne Kraft steals the movie. As Peking Man's
nature-girl protector Ah Wei, she's a dumb blonde whose
nearly-not-there costume made of animal skins is itself worth
renting the tape for. Awesomely awful! Grade: B+

<P>
   &QR;  ``American Movie'' (R) _ Meet the man who's the Ed Wood of
independent filmmakers. Chris Smith's documentary is alternately
hilarious and horrifying as it chronicles Mark Borchardt's attempts
to make his autobiographical magnum opus, ``Northwestern.'' The
30-ish Borchardt _ a high school dropout with three kids who still
lives with his mother _ is a portrait of the artist as a
not-so-young, incredibly selfish film geek. The movie never
comments on Borchardt's choices; it simply records them. Which
makes ``American Movie'' funny, scary and as compulsively watchable
as a train wreck. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Eye of the Beholder'' (R) _ Boredom, like beauty, is in the
eye of the be-holder. What begins as a hypnotic riff on the
surveillance classic ``The Conversation'' ultimately veers off into
nowhere. Too bad, because the film is as stylishly acted as it is
directed. An isolated British surveillance agent (Ewan McGregor)
be-comes more involved than he intended in the case of a diplomat's
son and a mysterious femme fatale (Ashley Judd). Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Source'' (unrated) _ This impressionistic look at the
Beat is best appreciated by those already in the know. Chuck
Workman's film documents how the Beat poets changed not only the
way America wrote, but the way we lived, with their works ``On the
Road,'' ``Howl'' and ``Naked Lunch.'' But as the film be-bops from
film clip to dramatic reading to off-the-cuff quote, its jazzy,
improvisational approach becomes wearying. (Priced to buy: $19.98
VHS, $24.98 DVD.) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Train of Life'' (R) _ Another wish-fulfillment comedy with a
Holocaust theme. In 1941, some Eastern European Jews decide to beat
the Nazis at their own game. They create a train and stage their
own deportation, fooling the Nazis into thinking they're headed for
a concentration camp. The cast overacts, and much of the plot is
worthy of a ``Hogan's Heroes'' episode. But the premise is
inventive, and there's a kick-in-the-gut coda that makes up for
much that went before. In French with subtitles. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   DVD SPOTLIGHT
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Blue Velvet'' (R). There's no commentary or special goodies
on David Lynch's bloody 1986 classic. But the new release presents
the psychosexual thriller in its original wide-screen format,
restoring the full effect of Lynch's creepy compositions,
previously butchered by the pan-and-scan format. Suggested retail
price: $24.98.

 &HT;    How to relive school days, painlessly
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Diplomas and proms. Caps and gowns. Smells like teen spirit to
me. There's nothing like the end-of-school days to bring out the
nostalgia _ the fear and loathing? _ in anyone who's been through
it or is going through it. Here are some films that may bring it
all back _ from a safe distance.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Carrie'' (1976): The prom-night movie. Sissy Spacek, buckets
of blood, flying sharp objects, a pre-breakthrough John Travolta.
Plus a whammy of a finale that's been ripped off so many times
since that it's gone from gimmick to classic movie moment.
``Carrie'' itself went through a similar transformation, from
slightly trashy horror flick to cultural phenomenon. Both Spacek
and Piper Laurie, who plays her spacey mother, earned Oscar
nominations. The film grossed 15 times what it cost, earning
director Brian De Palma a place as a Hollywood contender. Which, in
another context, was the first step in a long road leading to last
spring's abyssmal ``Mission to Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Prom Night'' (1980): The other prom-night movie ... sort of.
Well, not really. Actually, it's just one of a dozen or so splatter
movies that drenched theaters in the early '80s. Riding the crest
of her newfound scream-queen fame as the star of ``Halloween,''
Jamie Lee Curtis once again let herself get chased around by a mad
slasher. The climax _ on prom night, natch _ has everything from
Jamie Lee doing a Travolta imitation to a decapitated head rolling
on the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``American Graffiti'' (1973): George Lucas' movie has
virtually become synonymous with senior year swan songs. The year
is 1962; the place, small-town California. The streets are filled
with cruising teens. Among them: Ron Howard, Cindy Williams,
Richard Dreyfus, Candy Clark, Paul Le Mat, Charles Martin Smith,
McKenzie Phillips and, in a small role, Harrison Ford. The film's
tone is one of unabashed nostalgia and affection _ a kind of
willfully blinkered innocence that, hitting theaters in the
not-so-innocent early '70s, captivated audiences and critics. It
still does.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``If ... '' (1968): Lindsay Anderson's explosive film captures
the anti-authoritarian spirit of the late '60s with breathtaking
ease. Malcolm McDowell _ soon to become an emblem of disaffected
youth in Stanley Kubrick's ``A Clockwork Orange'' _ leads some
fellow British schoolboys in a revolt against the system as
embodied by the power structure at a tony boarding school. Their
actions move from antic to all-out anarchy, culminating in an
end-of-term massacre that, in light of Columbine and its ilk, seems
eerily prescient. The difference is, Anderson's characters are
acting out a kid revolutionary's fantasy engendered by a moralistic
anger. Sort of, flower power packing heat. ``If . . . '' is about
bucking the system _ the system as it existed in the '60s; it's not
an endorsement of personal revenge scenarios. Still, the resonances
are unavoidable and disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dazed and Confused'' (1993): Set on the last day of school
in 1976, Richard Linklater's movie isn't about graduation per se,
but about the agendas, rituals and mega reefer use of two distinct
groups of students: the fresh-out-of-junior-high kids who will be
freshmen the next fall and the soon-to-be-seniors of the class of
'77 who plan to make their lives hell. Like a toked-up ``American
Graffiti,'' the picture follows an amazing assortment of characters
and, like the Lucas film, it has a kind of strange innocence.
Mostly, it just lets us hang out in the ultimate hang-out decade.
When one young idealist declares that the '80s will be
``radical!!,'' it's very funny. And somehow very sad.

Graffiti'': www.filmsite.org/amerg.html

 &HT;    SHOPPING DESTINATION: Parrott
 &HT;    Take it easy in town where `past meets present'
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARROTT, Ga. _ If you find yourself in this speck-on-the-map
town off Ga. 520 between Columbus and Albany, you'll swear you just
stumbled onto an 1890s movie set of the Old West.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome, partner. You're in Parrott, population 186.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, ``The Long Riders'' _ the film based on the
exploits of the Jesse James gang _ was shot in this sleepy hamlet,
featuring the acting brothers Quaid (Randy and Dennis), Carradine
(David, Keith and Robert), Guest (Christopher and Nicholas) and
Keach (Stacey and James).
</P>
<P>
   Parrott, named for John Lawson Parrott, a Confederate veteran,
planter and businessman, was chosen as one of the sets because
nothing had changed since the town's founding in 1889. This
included the blood-red brick buildings with tin roofs, the raised
sidewalks, the wooden train depot and the dirt streets.
</P>
<P>
   Today, after much restoration, the turn-of-the-century
drugstores, cotton warehouses, banks and grocery stores have
morphed into 17 antique shops, restaurants and art galleries. The
streets are paved. Petunias and geraniums grow in baskets and the
tiny town in Terrell County is now living up to its slogan ``where
the past meets present.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most intriguing shops in this easygoing town about
155 miles from Atlanta is Sound Play, featuring musical
``playscapes.'' Owner Bond Andersen designs and builds permanent
outdoor installations of tuned musical instruments. His playscapes
and sound sculptures are found in parks, museums, back yards and on
school grounds, including the Greater Atlanta Christian School in
Norcross, Webb Bridge Park in Alpharetta and Holy Innocents School
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Other stores _ Mollie Jane's, Dunn Roam'n, James Bridges, the
Mint Julep _ are must stops for antique lovers, while Small Wonders
features dolls, doll houses and miniatures for kids of all ages.
And Stamp Your Art Out, owned by Kim Curry, carries rubber stamping
supplies for scrapbook enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the newest shops is the Pottery Depot, located in the old
train depot. Self-taught potter Huey Wheeler does the throwing, and
his wife, Anne, handles the artwork, which ranges from functional
dishes to decorative totems. You can also admire his one-of-a-kind
containers in the Inn Lobby at Callaway Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Ed Wade and his wife, Kathy, have been one of
the driving forces behind the town's rebirth. A native of Parrott,
Ed moved his family to Atlanta, where he worked for Delta Air
Lines, after graduating from Georgia Tech. But the family always
loved returning to Parrott for visits. In '93, they came back _ for
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were afraid the whole town would be torn down,'' says Ed.
So he began buying up buildings and restoring them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He bought me the drugstore for our 13th wedding anniversary,''
says Kathy, who grew up in Dawson, about 10 miles from Parrott.
``It was my grandfather Arnold's at one time.'' The couple owns and
operates Maridean's Marketplace, which rents to dealers who sell
antiques, art and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   The Wades credit Bill Russell of the University of Georgia's
Small Business Development Center for putting Parrott back on the
map. ``He helped develop a marketing plan and kept us focused,''
says Ed Wade. ``And he brought in people from Georgia Power who
also gave us guidance and who are currently printing brochures for
the Terrell County Welcome Center.''
</P>
<P>
   Another longtime backer is Mary Sue Alston, who was born and
raised in Parrott. ``I love Parrott,'' says the owner of the
building that houses Country Charm gift shop. ``The pace is slow
and I know everyone on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are getting an influx of new people and visitors, which
is good for our little town.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists are discovering Parrott because it sits right on Ga.
520, a major route for those traveling north from Florida. That's
how Ernie LoPreste and her friend from Hamburg, Germany, Gudren
Hemme, found themselves at Deborah Ann's Antiques and Gifts on a
recent Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am from Jacksonville, Fla.,'' says LoPreste, ``and Gudren
and I were driving to Callaway Gardens. We saw this cute little
main street from the highway and thought, `Isn't that neat. Let's
stop.'''
</P>
<P>
   If you need a breather from shopping, a must stop is Miss Nan's
Ice Cream Shop. Proprietor Nan Riegle, who also owns Emporium
Antiques &AMP; Collectibles, is known for yummy scoops of Moose Tracks,
butter pecan and mint chocolate chip.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to come in with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   A sign in Riegle's shop window reads, ``If you are grouchy,
irritable or just plain mean, there will be a $10 charge for
putting up with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Quips Riegle: ``I've had several people come in and say, `I
think I owe you some money.'''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Take I-85 south to I-185 to Exit 1 at Columbus.
Then proceed east on U.S. 280 and follow signs to Cusseta. This
will become Ga. 520 East, which takes you to Parrott.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Most shops are open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Tuesdays-
</P>
<P>
   Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Ample free parking.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: Available in shops; also public restrooms behind
City Hall on College Street.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Accessibility: Wheelchair accessible.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: Chamber of Commerce 912-995-2011; or Maridean's
Marketplace, 912-623-4123.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Chinaberry Cafe: This down-home restaurant in the former post
office might dish up fried chicken, roast beef or salmon croquettes
with real mashed potatoes, okra and tomatoes or steamed cabbage
(one meat and one veggie, $3.95). For lighter appetites, try the
homemade chicken salad served with lime fluff, pear salad or copper
pennies (carrots) for $5.50. And if you're lucky, local baker Mary
Perry will have made her caramel cake (a slice is $1.50). Also
tasty: the peanut butter and pecan pies (each slice, $1.50). Owners
Mabel Knight and Jean Jones keep refills of sweetened or
unsweetened tea coming to the tables. 11 a.m.-3 p.m. Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Sundays; 11 a.m.-9 p.m. Fridays-Saturdays. 118 E.
Main St. 912-623-2233.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nothin' Fancy: The name says it all. It's located in Leary,
about 23 miles from Parrott, out in the middle of nowhere. But it's
well worth the trip for Paul Cassels' fried catfish, oysters, fried
or boiled shrimp, mullet and chicken strips. If you like catfish,
opt for the fillets ($10). Shrimp lovers can have their shrimp
fried or boiled ($10). All dinners are served with light-as-air
hush puppies and two sides: cheese grits, fries, slaw, onion rings
or baked potato. Save room for a piece of homemade cake ($1.50).
The napkins are paper and the utensils plastic but the restaurant
is first-class. Expect to wait for a table. 4-9:30 p.m.
Thursday-Saturdays. At the corner of Ga. 55 and 234, Leary. Call
Paul Cassells for directions. 912-792-6420.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Twin Palms Bed and Breakfast Motel: Take a trip back in time
and stay in this utterly cool '50s motel. The former Parrott motel
has been painted a bright yellow by owners Alan Wilson and Al
Seely. They refurbished the 11 rooms _ with private baths and air
conditioning _ in retro style with authentic lava lamps, blond
laminated furniture and vintage fabrics. Note: No TVs are in the
rooms. In the morning, you'll be served a huge country breakfast of
eggs, sausage or bacon, homemade biscuits and bread and a fabulous
grits casserole that even non-grits eaters will like. $65-$125. On
Ga. 520 East in Parrott. 912-623-4820, twinpalmsbandb.com.

<P>
   Q: About two years ago in Buyer's Edge, you featured a collar
that can be worn around your neck _ to cool you off. Wal-Mart
carries one in cloth but it's not too durable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rajgopal Sashti, Columbus, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: The lightweight aluminum collar that soon will ring your neck
is a wearable air conditioner. You simply fill its two chambers
with a few ounces of water, rest it on your neck and switch it on.
A quiet, tiny fan moves air across the water, cooling the area
around you up to 20 degrees. The flexible sides hold the cooling
plate against your neck _ and you feel cool all over. It weighs 16
ounces filled. It's $49.95 at Sharper Image stores _ in Lenox
Square (404-261-8388) and Mall of Georgia (770-271-1890). The S-M
size is SI528; the L-XL size is SI558. You can also order from the
company catalog: 1-800-344-4444.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Listermint mouthwash. It is one of the few
that is alcohol-free and the only one my husband likes. Eckerd
carried it at one time but no longer has it in stock.
</P>
<P>
   _ Martha Lewis, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   And another mouthwash query: I have been looking for Lavoris
mouthwash for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Penny Keith, Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Now you can both eat all the garlic you desire. We found
Listermint Alcohol-Free Mouthwash (32-ounce bottle, $3.99) and
Lavoris (32-ounce bottle, $3.19) at Drug Emporium, 4000 LaVista
Road N.E. at Northlake (770-939-2860). Mint-flavored Listermint
contains no fluoride, while mint-flavored Lavoris comes enhanced
with vitamin C and herbs (sage, thyme, echinacea).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I cannot find a rubber hot water bottle. Recently we had a
power outage at our home but still had hot water. A hot water
bottle would have helped to warm the feet of my paralyzed husband.
Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teresa Rigby, Dunwoody, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We found Sunmark's deluxe water bottle _ the 2-quart capacity
bag is $8.68 _ at King's Drugs, 2345 Peachtree Road N.E.
(404-233-2101). You can use this ribbed surface water bottle for
warm or cold application, to soothe muscle aches and pains and warm
cold feet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you help me find Land O'Lakes Country Morning Blend light
in the plastic tub? It is the best margarine I've found and
actually tastes like butter (well, almost!). I used to be able to
buy it at Kroger and at Publix. Now, no one has it anymore. Most
stores carry the higher fat version, called Country Morning Blend.
</P>
<P>
   _ Becki Seddon, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Spread this around. We found your Country Morning Blend ight
at Publix, 2868 Peachtree Road N.W. (404-848-0330). Very few stores
in Atlanta carry it. A 1-pound tub is $1.79. This blend, says the
manufacturer, has 65 percent less saturated fat than butter. Other
crucial info: Country Morning Blend has no cholesterol and 2 grams
saturated fat. Butter, on the other hand, has 30 milligrams of
cholesterol and 7.7 grams of saturated fat.

RICHARD MEIER BUILDS IN MANHATTAN. AT LAST. 
</HEADLINE>
   By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard Meier, the world-renowned Pritzker
Prize-winning architect, is promoting a glassy new condominium in
Greenwich Village _ his first building in Manhattan in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is there an apartment in New York City with four
exposures and these views,'' he asked, gazing at a building model
showing floor-through multimillion-dollar apartments. ``Uptown to
the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Over there is
Westbeth ...''
</P>
<P>
   Westbeth? Not perhaps a stop on every tourist's itinerary. But
certainly a landmark for Meier. In the late 1960s, he transformed
the old Bell Telephone Laboratories into low-cost rental housing
and work space for artists, which in turn helped make the far west
Village a community and the young Meier a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, all of New York was about to lie at his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Except that it didn't. Although his office was in Manhattan, the
telephone calls came from other places entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why hasn't anyone asked me?'' he said. ``I've lived and worked
here all my life. I've designed buildings in Italy, Spain, France,
Luxembourg, Holland. Look at New York City: bar none, the greatest
city in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But in New York, he said, ``architecture is not high on the
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   He marched a visitor to a window in his sixth-floor office, with
its sidelong view of 11th Avenue and the Hudson River. ``Look at
that,'' he said, gesturing toward mundane, red-brick-banded
apartment skyscrapers still under construction. ``That's what's
being built now.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused. ``I look out the window, and it hurts me,'' he said.
``There is such constant change. There is no city in such
extraordinary flux. What an opportunity! Another opportunity
missed! It hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Trump has periodically talked about hiring Meier for
one of his mega-projects. ``Yeah, he told me, too,'' Meier said.
``I'm still waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is not waiting for Trump anymore. Meier is, in a sense,
coming home.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of next year, he hopes to have overseen completion of
a pair of 14-story condominiums, with 28 apartments in all, on one
of the most coveted corners in town.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Born, Ira Drukier and Charles Blaichman, three relative
unknowns in the rough world of New York real estate, are the main
developers of the $50 million project, although Meier will own a
piece of the pie (less than 10 percent, he said).
</P>
<P>
   Given two relatively narrow sites that flank Perry Street at
West Street, Meier has designed gleaming white buildings with huge
expanses of clear glass, punctuated by frosted-glass balconies.
Although they are the same height, one is slimmer and consequently
more delicate, to accommodate a narrower lot.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the floor, the prices will range from $2 million to
$8 million. The condominiums will be delivered with open, loftlike
floor plans, but Meier flipped through blueprints to show more
refined, partitioned spaces, saying buyers could hire his firm to
finish them off.
</P>
<P>
   Meier, still selling, said there would be amenities galore: a
couple of concierges, a cafe on the ground floor of one building,
parking in a building right behind, maybe even a health club. (An
earlier plan for a hotel on top of the garage is in abeyance, and
the future of a proposed restaurant, run by Jean-Georges
Vongerichten in the cafe space, is uncertain, the architect said.)
</P>
<P>
   While designed to be glamorous, the buildings are far from
Meier's biggest commission: he has done courthouses and museums.
The Getty Center in Los Angeles, a vast white complex of buildings
high over the San Diego Freeway, has come to be regarded as the
epitome of Meier style, a tourist attraction of the first order.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people wanted to put me on the shelf after the
Getty,'' he said. ``Well, the Getty is great, but you move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Even during those 13 years, he said, there were other things
going on: ``the city hall in the Hague, the Museum of Contemporary
Art in Barcelona and a lot of other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, his firm's most highly publicized project is probably
the Church of the Year 2000 in Rome (which, the architect said
wryly, he hopes will be finished by the end of the year 2000).
There is also a single- span bridge he has designed for
Alessandria, Italy, to be started in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are ... the twin towers. Well, maybe not towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tiny project,'' Meier said. ``Instead of 14 stories,
I could be doing something 10 or 20 times bigger with the same
amount of effort.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least it's a beginning, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope so,'' he said. ``It's a beginning of the next
phase, a phase that will deal with urban issues.''
</P>
<P>
   On Perry Street, four- and five-story brick walk-ups abound,
along with short, stubby warehouses. A few blocks north, Meier's
first New York venture, Westbeth, is about the same height as the
Perry Street buildings. But Meier's materials will be different: so
polar white, so glossy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the big developers were afraid to hire him, sure that
they would get a ``Richard Meier'' signature building _ with white
metallic-looking walls and glass grids _ which might or might not
blend in.
</P>
<P>
   Meier nodded; he's heard it before. ``But contextuality doesn't
mean it has to look like what's around it. The scale and materials
can be appropriate, but it doesn't have to be a clone. That's why I
think these new buildings are contextual. They may not match what's
around _ thank goodness. They are more contextual than some
pastiche.''
</P>
<P>
   The towers will be built ``as of right,'' which means that the
developers don't have to ask the city for special zoning favors, so
there is no official place in the process for neighborhood input.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the neighbors turn out to be unhappy about the
buildings' juxtaposition of white glass to faded red brick and gray
cinder block _ their Meiericity, so to speak _ the buyers don't
seem to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of the apartments are already spoken for,'' Meier said. &QL;

THINGS ARE DECEPTIVELY NORMAL IN THE ART OF ARTIFICE
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
``Natural Deceits''
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Normally, mendacity does not flatter
artistic expression. After all, one measure of great art is its
ability to serve as a vessel for inspired truths. And yet, such is
the effectiveness of ``Natural Deceits,'' the current exhibit at
the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, that half-truths actually
become subversive and humorous mirrors to what is painfully real.
</P>
<P>
   United by a penchant for slightly disturbing narrative, the 11
Texas artists whose works make up the exhibit employ a range of
media that is never less than intriguing. From familiar photography
and drawing to the sublimely wacky use of a refrigerator and a
whole turkey, ``Natural Deceits'' makes the medium not just the
message but the star.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long time since one actually climbed a scaffolding
ladder to participate in, and observe, an art installation. But
it's not every day that Leandro Erlich sets up ``The Swimming
Pool.'' This 1998 bit of aquatic whimsy suspends 2 inches of water
on a clear platform above a backyard pool. Visitors are encouraged
to walk on the bottom of the pool and stare up through the scrim of
rippling water. At that moment, it is perfectly ambiguous as to who
is on the inside looking out and vice versa. The exposition's first
deceit has been launched.
</P>
<P>
   Erlich's pool has been installed near Francesca Fuchs' faded
brown tulip mural, which conveys all the sensuality of a hospital
ICU unit. Other examples of Fuchs' painting style replicate the
tight web design of cheap pool furniture. The entire installation
smacks of a seemingly innocuous suburban back yard, a strip from
Pleasantville in which deception lies in the sinister normalcy
sneering underneath blades of artificial grass. It is in just this
sort of landscape that the epoxied flies of Vernon Fisher's
``Eclipse'' would thrive, looking so jarringly real yet clearly
manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natural Deceits'' is an edgy, darkly witty show, pushing the
boundaries of ``mixed media.'' An inventory of materials used by
Helen Altman for ``Snowhead'' includes ice, a bloated snowman's
head, a gnarled carrot for a nose, and a beat-up electric freezer.
Appliances continue to play a central role in Altman's ``Phoenix,''
in which a vintage refrigerator is left open to reveal an uncooked
turkey sitting in a roasting pan.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no artist takes the theme of faux nature to its mocking
edge better than Bill Davenport. His ``Alpine Lake Replica'' has
the artistic probity to sell itself as a ``replica'' of a natural
setting. But then Davenport undercuts all the candor by offering a
grove of foam pine trees bordering an aluminum-foil lake. At first,
one giggles at the hubris of passing off a piece of childlike art
as social commentary.
</P>
<P>
   But then the giggles stop. Davenport's simple expression begins
to make ``Natural Deceits''' more sophisticated point that we have
contented ourselves with ersatz nature, and that even the most
remote concoction of reality has become a mollifying substitute.

</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the final terrifying moments of Alaska Airlines
Flight 261, which crashed off the southern California coast Jan.
31, a pilot warned Los Angeles air traffic controllers that the
plane was veering in and out of control, according to audio tapes
released Wednesday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are, uh, in a dive here,'' the pilot, clearly winded, told
controllers about 10 minutes before the crash. ``We're out of
26,000 feet. We're in a vertical dive, not a dive yet, but, uh,
we've lost vertical control of our airplane,'' he said, almost in a
gasp.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a note of hope, he added, ``Yeah, we've got it back
under control there.'' But seconds later, he reported, ``No we
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing earlier this year, National Transportation Safety
Board Chairman Jim Hall said the plane's flight-data recorder
showed that when the crew first lost control of the plane, it
plummeted at 7,000 feet per minute, more than three times the
normal rate of descent for a commercial aircraft.The audio tapes
underscored the struggle by Capt. Ted Thompson, 53, and First
Officer William Tansky, 57, to correct what they had reported
earlier were problems with the jet's vertical stabilizer, a
wing-like horizontal portion of the tail responsible for ensuring
level flight.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are probing the possible failure of the
so-called jackscrew, a key part of the plane's tail stabilizer
system. After the crash, the FAA ordered immediate inspection of
all jackscrews in all similar aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261, bound from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San
Francisco, crashed off California's Ventura County coast, killing
all 88 passengers and crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes showed that shortly after the plane fell from about
26,000 feet to 23,700 feet, the pilots regained level flight for
several minutes. The pilot reported that the MD-83 jet was ``kinda
stabilized. We're slowing down here and, uh, we're going, uh to do
a little troubleshooting. ''
</P>
<P>
   About five minutes before the crash, the pilot told controllers
that the plane had dropped to 22,500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a jammed stabilizer and we're maintaining altitude
with difficulty,'' he said, asking permission to land at the Los
Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   But the pilot, concerned about whether the jet could stay aloft
as he maneuvered toward the airport, also asked if he could start
his descent over water. He said he wanted to ``make sure I can
control the jet and I'd like to do that out here over the bay if I
may.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, about four minutes before the crash, when controllers had
cleared the jet to descend to 17,000 feet, the pilot sent his final
transmission to the control tower. At that point he appeared calm
and said only, ``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   However, about a minute before the crash, other pilots in the
area witnessed the jet's horrifying dive into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   One of those pilots radioed: ``That plane has just started to do
a big, huge plunge.'' He added that the distressed jet was
``inverted,'' that is, flying upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of another plane, a Sky West Aviation jet, told
controllers that Flight 261 was ``nose down'' and ``descending
quite rapidly definitely out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the audio tapes was the voice of a Navy air controller
from the Point Mugu, Calif., Naval Air Weapons Center, who started
calling out the altitude of the jet caught in an accelerating death
spiral. ``He's at 7,600 feet He's currently 12 miles southwest of
the airport. He's at 5,700 (feet) right now 4,600.''
</P>
<P>
   About five minutes after Flight 261's final transmission, both
of the other planes' pilots said they saw the jet splash down. ``He
hit the water,'' one said. ``He's down.''
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials declined to name the Flight 261 pilot whose voice
was heard on the tapes. They also declined to comment on the tapes
and referred questions to the National Transportation Safety Board,
which is probing the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Williams, an NTSB spokesman, declined to elaborate on the
audio tapes. ``This is still an ongoing investigation,'' he said.

&HT;     STATUE OF SPANISH EXPLORER TO GET NEW HOME IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RACHEL GORDON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It has taken 224 years for Spanish explorer Juan
Bautista de Anza to make his way back to Mission Dolores.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, the tenacious scout for colonial Spain won't be
arriving at the old mission on horseback. Most likely he'll get
there on a flat-bed truck. Oh, and in the form of an 8,000-pound
bronze statue cast in his likeness.
</P>
<P>
   The statue of Juan Bautista de Anza, presented to San Francisco
in 1967 by Luis Encina, then-governor of Sonora, Mexico, has spent
the past few years locked in an Arts Commission storage room since
the Embarcadero roadway project forced its removal from Justin
Herman Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   But now, a new home for the 11 1/2-foot-tall statue has been
found: the grassy median strip in front of Mission Dolores at
Dolores and 16th streets.
</P>
<P>
   The location is fitting, since it was Anza who helped pick the
site for the mission in 1776 _ the same year the founders of the
United States of America, busy on the other side of the continent
thinking their revolutionary thoughts, declared independence from
the British throne.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the bronze Anza on the median strip will be King Carlos
III, the Catholic monarch of Spain (in statue form, of course). The
king ordered the building of the mission and the Presidio in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Like the statue of Anza, the one of King Carlos III _ a
2,000-pound gift to San Francisco from Spain's King Juan Carlos I
in 1976 _ also got the boot from Justin Herman Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Lehane, program director of the civic art collection for
the San Francisco Arts Commission, is excited that the statues will
land in a more appropriate setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting away from `plop' art, just plopping it down
somewhere. These (statues) have a relationship to Mission Dolores,
a connection to San Francisco history,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The venue change will cost taxpayers about $56,000 to pay for
the move and construction of new concrete foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Guire Cleary, curator of Mission Dolores Basilica,
approves of the plan.
</P>

   ``The relocation of these statues,'' he said, ``will help
celebrate a 224-year relationship between this, the oldest intact
Franciscan Mission in California, and our Spanish heritage.''

 &HT;    UNCERTAINTY ALONG THE ISRAELI-LEBANON BORDER, ABOUT THE FUTURE
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW

   KFAR KILA, Lebanon _ Crowds of euphoric Lebanese Wednesday
taunted Israelis through the barbed-wire fence that now separates
them, defining the new boundaries of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours earlier, the last convoys of Israeli troops sped out
of southern Lebanon, ending nearly two decades of occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The nonviolent confrontations at the fence posed the question of
whether Israel's northern border will be peaceful even though its
army has left the so-called ``security zone'' buffer. And, whether
southern Lebanon will finally see peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enjoy your celebrations for a couple of days. But enough is
enough,'' shouted an Israeli taking pictures of the opposing crowd
through the wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you born here?'' countered Avdel Kareem Shour, 42, from
the Lebanese side. ``Go back to your fatherland!''
</P>
<P>
   Steps away, a uniformed Hezbollah guerilla, fully equipped with
his M-16 rifle, scope and laser sight, paid no heed to the Israeli
army vehicles passing beyond the fence just 12 yards away. Some
were just curious to see their adversaries up close. Some
video-taped their neighbors, and a few scolded a youth who lobbed a
rock through the fence, saying that it wasn't necessary today.
</P>
<P>
   Israel controlled both sides of the fence before a pre-dawn
withdrawal on Tuesday. Now, Israeli troops and civilians stay to
the south on a border patrol road and Lebanese stay to the north
gawking.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first day of a new and uncertain Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese guerillas staged impromptu military parades with the
abandoned tanks they managed to start.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lebanese civilians waved flags and posed for pictures
by signs marking cities from which they had been separated for
years. A proud father posed his 3-year-old son on the barrel of an
abandoned tank. Artillery posts and fortresses that had held the
population in fear just the day before were toured by parents and
children as if they were museums.
</P>
<P>
   The new-found freedom also allowed for solemn reminders of the
darkest aspects of the occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-inmates returned to the Al Khiam prison where they had been
tortured and beaten by the Israeli-paid militia, the South Lebanon
Army. The SLA had abandoned the controversial prison, cited for
years by human rights advocates, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   For Israelis, it was a day of anxiety and controversy. They had
long ago tired of the casualties their soldiers faced in their
``security zone.'' Prime Minister Ehud Barak promised to end the
occupation by this July. However, the SLA disintegrated earlier
this week and Israel hurriedly removed its last few hundred troops
who were followed to the border by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, the leader of the opposition Likud Party and
director of Israel's 1982 Lebanon invasion, called the withdrawal a
``shameful retreat.''
</P>
<P>
   But some were just happy to have the troops home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prayed for this day,'' said Orna Shimoni, a leader of the
``Four Mothers'' grassroots movement that led the push for a
unilateral withdrawal, and whose own son Eyal was killed in Lebanon
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Barak tried to calm public anxiety about Hezbollah's new
proximity with a stern warning Wednesday that any over the border
attacks would be met with retaliation unprecedented in its
severity, and would be felt ``across Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on the Lebanese side there were tensions. Hezbollah
searched Wednesday for remaining members of the SLA, many of whom
were still surrendering themselves to Lebanese government
officials. Some gathered in churches for protection during their
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government, with a mixed Christian-Muslim make-up,
considers the SLA traitors deserving trial.
</P>
<P>
   And there was sad reflection.
</P>
<P>
   At the hilltop Al Khiam prison, the corduroy hoods that had been
used to blind and stifle inmates for days at a time, were still
scattered near the dark and fetid booths used for solitary
confinement. Hezbollah sheiks, government officials and families
came to look Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Kussan, a paunchy middle-aged man, spent two years in the
prison during the 1980s without ever being charged or tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bitter, harsh, experience. It was beyond the
imagination,'' he said. ``I just came to remember how much I
suffered, because this is something that is unforgettable in the
first place.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the director George Lucas and the producer Rick
McCallum recently shot screen tests for ``Star Wars: Episode II,''
there was a problem. At the end of the successful shot, McCallum
said, Lucas couldn't use the traditional director's cry of ``Cut!
Print!'' because he was shooting on digital videotape, not film.
After a moment's hesitation, McCallum said, a new finale was
proposed: ``Cut! Can we take a quick look at it?''
</P>
<P>
   When ``Star Wars: Episode II'' starts production next month in
Australia it will be the first major motion picture created mostly
using high-resolution digital videotape rather than film. And while
McCallum is reluctant to declare that the all-digital Jedi warriors
will bring death to film, he is confident that the production is
the beginning of a major shift in movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be pretty brain dead to be involved in film at
this time and not realize that we are going through a very serious
evolutionary step in how we acquire images,'' he said. If
everything goes according to plan, the move by Lucasfilm Ltd. to
digital imaging should go unnoticed by theater audiences, who will
still view the goings on in ``a galaxy far, far away'' the
old-fashioned way with projected film.
</P>
<P>
   But those results will be closely scrutinized within the film
world, where the decision by Lucasfilm has sparked an intense
debate. Steven Poster, a director of photography and vice president
of the American Society of Cinematographers, said he thought the
technology still wasn't good enough for the big screen. For one
thing, digital images contain somewhat less detail than traditional
film images. ``We've seen through Imax how audiences are just
thrilled with a big, more visceral experience,'' he said, referring
to the jumbo-screen, film-based movie technology. ``There is a very
positive use of this digital technology in television. But when it
comes to motion pictures, we're adopting a technology that hasn't
been audience tested. If you start with less of an image, you wind
up with an even lesser image on screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without digital cameras, the ``Star Wars'' films have
increasingly become products of digital imaging. For example,
nearly all of the 2,200 shots in ``Episode I: The Phantom Menace''
were scanned into a computer for editing. Lucas had decided to use
fully digital cameras in 1997, after viewing demonstrations of
high-definition digital systems that Sony designed for television.
Officers at Sony in Japan had contemplated a similar digital system
for the big screen, ``there were sections of the company that
weren't entirely sure that there would be a marketplace of any
size,'' said Laurence Thorpe, vice president for acquisition
systems at Sony Electronics' broadcast and professional products
group.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas told Sony that if the company created a digital system for
theatrical films, he would use it to make ``Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the nudging factor,'' Thorpe said. ``Having a luminary
give us encouragement spurred us into action.''
</P>
<P>
   The equipment was called the Sony Digital Film System, but that
name is slightly misleading. The system actually uses videotape
cassettes, slightly smaller than VHS tapes. The camera captures an
image with its lens then passes it through a prism that breaks it
down in red, green or blue light. Three light-sensitive digital
chips then analyze the image, and the data is converted into
digital form and recorded on the tape (although, in theory, the
data could be stored on any digital recording media, like a hard
drive, for example). Once on tape, the images are transferred to
the hard drives of specialized computers for editing and special
effects. When all the post-production is finished, special laser
printers expose the image onto photographic film used to generate
prints for theater projectors.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a digital system for movies was not a straightforward
proposition. To start with, Sony had to design its system to
operate at 24 frames per second _ the rate of movie theater
projectors _ rather than the 60 frames per second used in
television. In addition to the cameras, that re-engineering project
involved the equipment needed to edit, adjust and manipulate the
images.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was probable that future productions would still mix
in conventional film with digital images, Sony _ working with
Lucas' film effects company, Industrial Light and Magic _ also had
to write software to make the digital images match the appearance
of various types of film.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's greatest shortcoming, however, was not electronic but
mechanical. The new motion picture system (now known as 24P) was
based on the design of a camera, intended for television news
crews, that outwardly looks little different from the Betacams made
by the company since the 1980s. Not only were its viewfinder system
and controls unsuitable for feature film crews, but the weight of
film production lenses was enough to rip the front off the camera.
None of those lenses could be used in any case. Because the
camera's light-sensitive charged coupled device is smaller than the
format used for 35-millimeter films, exceptionally precise optics
had to be developed.
</P>
<P>
   The delays meant that the new camera would not be ready for
``Phantom Menace.'' To solve its mechanical and optical problems,
Sony partnered with Panavision, which designs, builds and rents
film cameras and lenses. The two companies had collaborated in 1989
on a digital film camera that was unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   In January Panavision delivered the first prototype camera to
Lucasfilm and Industrial Light and Magic. For four months,
technicians shot technical tests with conventional film cameras
rolling beside the digital upstart. The digital images were then
converted to 35-millimeter film using three techniques: a Sony
laser printer that writes directly onto film, an in-house process
developed by Industrial Light and Magic and a laser printer made by
E-Films, a Los Angeles company. The conventional film was also put
through all the steps it would encounter during actual production.
</P>
<P>
   The results were shipped to Lucas for side-by-side projections
at the Skywalker Ranch's private theater in Marin County, Calif. On
March 10, Lucas blessed the digital results despite having some
misgivings about the camera design. Thorpe recalled Lucas saying:
``I'll accept the physical limitations of the camera, as you've got
to start somewhere. I hope you'll listen to me when you design your
next generation of camera.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several kinds of scenes that will still require film
cameras in ``Episode II'' because the Sony system in its current
form will operate only at 24 frames per second. Most of the
trademark ``Star Wars'' light-sabre battle scenes are shot with the
camera running more slowly than normal to make the action appear
faster and presumably more swashbuckling when projected on the
screen. Stop-action animation (the frame-by-frame manipulation of
three-dimensional models to simulate movement) is also impossible
with the digital system.
</P>
<P>
   But the digital system has some significant advantages. For
``Episode I,'' McCallum estimated that it cost upward of $1.7
million to buy, process and transfer film to digital tape for
post-production and special effects. For ``Episode II,'' he is
budgeting $15,000 for tapes. Similarly, a film camera races through
a standard 1,000-foot film magazine in 11 minutes. Each digital
tape can store up to 50 minutes of images. And fewer production
steps could mean less deterioration in image quality. ``Film is
alchemy,'' McCallum said. ``Every time a print is made, the quality
is less and less.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Lucas' endorsement, both Sony and Panavision emphasize
that the digital system is a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that someone like George Lucas has made such a strong
commitment to this technology gives it credibility it would
otherwise have to earn,'' said John Galt, Panavision's senior vice
president for advanced digital imaging. ``But I'm still of the
opinion that we have to prove that it works.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether that will improve the quality of what moviegoers see
at the local multiplex is still an open question. McCallum said:
``Digital is just a tool. It doesn't mean that films are going to
get any better.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans would have you believe that the
Clinton administration has gutted the U.S. military. Citing a
``severe drop in overall military readiness,'' Rep. Duncan Hunter
says U.S. forces are being pushed ``to the breaking point'' and
``could not fight and win against Iraq today as we did in 1991.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott alleges a similar ``downward spiral.'' Sen. Bob
Smith and others complain of a ``readiness crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans are wrong. On a per-person and per-weapon
basis, U.S. armed forces are very good, and by some measurements
they've never been better. Readiness levels have dropped a bit from
their historic peaks during the Bush administration, and strains on
troops are excessive in some cases. But overall, readiness remains
comparable to the levels of the Reagan years and far superior to
the 1970s, when Gen. Shy Meyer warned about the nation's ``hollow
military.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to evaluate the day-to-day preparedness of the
armed forces is: 1) to track the individual indicator _ the
intensity of training for most units, experience and aptitude
levels of personnel, the state of repair of equipment, accident
rates during exercises and deployments, recruitment and retention
statistics, etc.; and 2) to assess the military's performance when
deployed abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics from the Pentagon's February budget briefings show
that training is as demanding as ever for front-line and
rapid-reaction forces, and almost as rigorous for other units.
About 70 percent to 80 percent of all airplanes and tanks and other
major systems are typically ``mission capable'' at any time _ not
ideal, and not as good as the early '90s when rates were often 10
points higher, but comparable to percentages during the '80s Reagan
buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Too many qualified people are leaving the military, partly out
of frustration with excessive demands of the job. And the strong
economy has hampered recruitment. But recent military pay
increases, better recruiting ad campaigns, and increased efforts to
make overseas duty easier on families have helped arrest these
negative trends.
</P>
<P>
   Today's forces are the most experienced we've ever fielded, and
the aptitude test scores of the average new recruit in the late
'90s are higher than those of his or her '80s counterpart,
according to the Department of Defense report Population
Representation in the Military Service.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the high skill of these troops, as well as
rigorous equipment maintenance and careful safety policies,
military accident rates have never been lower, despite the
continuous deployments of troops and the preponderance of aging
equipment. (See the Department of Defense's annual report from the
Directorate for Information Operations and Reports, Worldwide U.S.
Active Duty Military Personnel Casualties.)
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, troops sent overseas by the Clinton
administration have distinguished themselves, even the forces that
waged the fateful firefight in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993.
Civilian and military leaders mishandled that mission, not the
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Operations in the Balkans, ranging from the muscular
peacekeeping mission in Bosnia to the air war last year over
Kosovo, have been handled with extraordinarily high professionalism
throughout the ranks. The same applies to the no-fly-zone missions
over Iraq, carrier deployments in the Persian Gulf and near Taiwan,
and the deterrent mission performed by U.S. troops in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans have overstated their case, they still
deserve some thanks for forcing President Clinton to pay attention
to the U.S. military's aches and pains. This political pressure has
led to increases in military pay and other compensation, which,
when corrected for inflation, are now as good as they have ever
been. For most personnel, they are also generally competitive with
comparable private sector positions, according to studies from the
General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   Republican scrutiny has also led to better overseas deployment
polices, largely by making them more predictable, spreading the
workload around more parts of the military, increasing the number
of certain types of especially busy military units (such as those
flying specialized aircraft), and reducing superfluous demands on
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite their positive contributions, Republicans have taken
their hypervigilance about readiness to pernicious extremes. Most
recently, they have suggested (with the help of Democratic Sen.
Robert Byrd of West Virginia) that U.S. forces should leave Kosovo
next year, even if that means allowing Slobodan Milosevic to again
brutalize the ethnic Albanian people, and have made it politically
unthinkable to consider sending even a couple of thousand Western
troops to tragedy-prone Sierra Leone. Don't give them too much
credit.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the big picture of military readiness, could the
United States satisfy the ``two-war strategy'' by defeating two
distinct foes _ most likely Iraq and North Korea _ at the same
time? This is a complex subject, but the short answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States would have a hard time fighting two
simultaneous wars as demanding as Desert Storm, it could probably
wage overlapping wars against Iraq and North Korea for these
reasons: The threats from those two countries have declined over
the '90s; the South Korean military has continued to improve; and
materiel pre-stationed near Iraq and North Korea by the Clinton
administration has enhanced military preparedness. Also, as the
Pentagon's January report on the Kosovo war demonstrates, many
American weapons have improved in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The current two-war requirement may have us overpreparing for
the threats we know and underpreparing for those we do not see as
vividly, but that's a question of strategy, not readiness. On this
matter, the Clinton administration's record is more mixed. It has
acquitted itself reasonably well by developing a missile defense
(albeit largely at Republican prodding), improving chemical
protective gear and anti-mine technology, and reorienting some
National Guard forces to deal with domestic terrorism and other
emergencies. Its record falls short, however, when it comes to
military research and development, which is being cut. And it's
also taking a leisurely approach in some other policy arenas--as
one example, it is failing to substantially increase antibiotic
stocks to protect civilian populations in the event of biowar.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's inaction on these fronts leaves
plenty of room for vigorous debate on matters of American national
security, and particularly on broad matters of strategy. But when
Republicans shout that the U.S. military isn't ready, and that it
is only a shadow of its former self, it is their claim that is
hollow.

WHERE THE HOUSE ITSELF LOLLS AT POOLSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARTHA BAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Windsor, a planned community created here in
1989 by the husband-and-wife planning team of Elizabeth
Plater-Zyberk and Andres Duany, is meant to encourage outdoor
living. But unlike Celebration and Seaside, other Florida planned
communities where leisure time is spent on front porches and
stoops, Windsor is a place where outdoor time is lived out back, in
courtyards and on loggias, patios and verandas.
</P>
<P>
   Windsor's large houses, built to the edges of their property
lines, are set on deep, narrow lots. But the homes hardly offer
typical suburban living, with chats over the backyard fence. Nor
are swimming pools segregated in their own fenced-in patios.
Following the model of Spanish and Italian homes, these spaces are
cloisters, shielded from neighbors by wraparound houses and walled
gardens. Their pools, above, lap right up to the loggia or offer a
fantasy of Venice.
</P>
<P>
   In these Windsor courtyards, the distinction between indoors and
outdoors blurs and ultimately disappears. Plants move inside,
antiques move out and fireplaces are, as in the Southwest, welcome
indoors and out. It is a way of living that, come Memorial Day,
would appeal to almost any householder, even on a small scale.
</P>
<P>
   One veranda, shown at right, was designed by Clemens Bruns
Schaub, the architect for many of the homes here. The house, also
below and at far right, was built on a double lot with a large
courtyard, considered by the owners to be the principal living room
of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Moving indoor elements outdoors _ tables, chairs, a coffee
table, fans, light fixtures, cushions, even a daybed and a
footstool _ gives a warm, old Mediterranean feel. The veranda,
which spans the property, has a high ceiling and a large masonry
fireplace, making it feel both intimate and spacious. From it, a
lawn leads down to an Olympic-size pool edged with intricately
paved brick walkways, which carry the eye to the far end of the
courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   Schaub has said that his ambition at Windsor was to satisfy
``the needs, desires and fantasies of its owners.'' Sometimes
homeowners' fantasies include a quiet family oasis, meant for
private lolling.

 &HT;    Building a BETTER burger
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The first burger of summer is a pleasure on its
own. Grilled until crisp on the outside and still juicy inside,
with its hint of smoke, all the burger needs is a simple toasted
bun.
</P>
<P>
   Says who?
</P>
<P>
   We want to start summer with a bang, and Memorial Day is the
unofficial beginning of the season in this part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The hamburger has to be memorable. So we rounded up some
favorites with additions that will bring big flavor to that patty
of plain ground beef.
</P>
<P>
   Before going any further, let's make that ground chuck _ not
ground beef. In taste test after taste test, ground chuck wins the
hamburger championship.
</P>
<P>
   Figure on three hamburgers to a pound for the best, juiciest
varieties. Don't handle the patties much; just form lightly with
your hands and press gently to flatten to about one inch thick,
which is an adult-sized hamburger. Approximate cooking time is
about five minutes per side, but grill fires are variable.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that those who like their hamburgers medium or medium
rare are choosing to ignore well-publicized health concerns. That's
their choice, but for the record, 160 degrees is the recommended
interior temperature for safe burgers. That translates into gray _
not pink _ meat that is medium well to well done.
</P>
<P>
   For kids' safety, make their burgers thinner and cook them
longer, until well done. And for taste's sake, keep theirs plain
and let them add the condiments.
</P>
<P>
   But for the grown-ups, it's time to experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The basic formula is a teaspoon of salt and a half-teaspoon of
pepper per pound of beef. Here are a half-dozen winning variations:
</P>
<P>
   _ This one suits the seasons, for the secret ingredient is one
big Vidalia onion. No, not sliced or diced. The onion is run
through a blender until it's chopped to a mush. Combine the onion
with a pound of ground chuck, season with salt and pepper, and
grill. The onion adds moisture as well as flavor; some caramelized
onions on top will double the pleasure. Make them ahead of time:
Just heat a half-and-half mixture of butter and oil in heavy
skillet, add sliced onions and cook slowly over medium low heat for
about 30 minutes, stirring often, until they are a deep caramel
color. You can splash a cup of red wine into the onions and let
them cook down to a marmalade consistency. Or go for simplicity and
just slather the onion burger with gutsy Dijon mustard, which is a
perfect partner for onion.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Blue Burger is a classic and requires just a little
advance preparation. Blend a cup of crumbled room-temperature blue
cheese with a tablespoon of softened butter and use it to stuff
hamburgers before grilling. You can skip the butter if you use
soft, melting blue such as Saga or Cambozola. An optional addition
is 1/4 cup of finely minced green onion. Spread at least a
tablespoon between two thin patties, then seal them together.
Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper, then refrigerate until
ready to grill. Up the ante and make a double-blue burger by adding
a dab of blue on top just before serving. Let it melt in and taste
the testimony that excess can be good.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take the same approach with Turkey Burgers. Season the ground
turkey with salt and pepper and tuck a tablespoon of herbaceous
Boursin cheese in between two thin patties. Seal them well,
pressing the edges with your fingers, and grill. Now that will give
that boring turkey some flavor. For toppings, try grilled onion
slices. Brush thick slices with oil and herbs and grill alongside
the burgers. Thread a wooden skewer all the way through so the
rings don't separate. Put the grilled onion on the turkey burger
and pull out the skewer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mushrooms are perfect with beef, but we're not talking those
slices of canned mushrooms. Here's a secret ingredient that will
bump up the flavor: dried wild mushroom powder. OK, you can't find
it at the neighborhood convenience store, but when I do spot it I
stock up and keep it in the pantry. Just sprinkle a tablespoon of
mushroom powder over a pound of ground beef, season with salt and
pepper, and mix lightly with a fork. Form into patties and grill.
The obvious topping is fresh mushrooms cooked in butter with a bit
of garlic. Even better is real Italian Fontina, which melts
beautifully, and is not to be confused with the domestic product.
Place a slice on top for the last couple minutes of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chipotle peppers will give burgers a smoky flavor even if it's
too rainy to cook them on the grill. Chipotles canned in adobo
sauce are widely available in supermarkets. Mince one or two with a
little of the sauce. Combine with a tablespoon of cream to help
disperse the flavor and pour over a pound of ground chuck. Season
with salt and pepper and stir with a fork before shaping the
patties. Grill, broil or pan-fry. After turning, top with slices of
smoked cheese such as smoked Gouda and let it melt while the
burgers finish cooking. You'll swear the burger was cooked over an
open fire.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Portobello Burger is everybody's answer for vegetarians,
but you can improve on it. Portobellos can suck up the
vinegar-based marinades used in many restaurants. Skip that step.
Instead, squeeze a clove of garlic through a garlic press and mix
it with some olive oil. Brush that on the mushrooms while grilling,
about 3 minutes to a side. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Now
that's the burger, but you need more. A half a roasted red pepper _
available ready-to-eat in jars and some supermarket delis _ can be
laid on the bun to add another meaty dimension. Spread the other
side of the bun with lemony mayo (just blend some lemon zest, about
a half teaspoon into a 1/4 cup of mayo and add snipped fresh herbs
from the garden.) Or, if the taste of tomato is what you want, run
some oil-packed dried tomatoes through a mini blender with a dash
of balsamic or sherry vinegar and spread that, sparingly, over the
inside of the bun.

TEAR STAINS ON THE EASY CHAIR, AS SCOTCHGARD FADES AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn.)   By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While experts argue the efficacy of building America's
space-based Strategic Defense Initiative, here on Earth one of the
nation's most trusted defense systems will, by year's end, be
dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   Scotchgard, the soil-retardant and stain-repellent spray made by
the 3M Co. of St. Paul, Minn., is being ``phased out,'' the company
announced on May 16, because of environmental concerns about a
chemical used to make it, perfluorooctanyl. The same stuff that
makes it easy to lift a blob of chip dip off a carpet is, it turns
out, harder to get off the planet. Scotchgard stain prevention
products do not decompose.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   As Prof. Ned Brainard, played by Fred MacMurray in the 1961
movie ``The Absent-Minded Professor,'' said of flying rubber, or
Flubber, ``It's a substance whose behavior is disturbingly
nonclassical.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The company's move to discontinue Scotchgard was voluntary, but
the Environmental Protection Agency said on May 18 that it had been
poised to remove it from the market if the company had not taken
action. Manufacture will not stop for some months, 3M says;
availability will depend on store inventories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would advise consumers to adopt a precautionary approach,''
said Stephen Johnson, deputy assistant administrator for the
agency's office of prevention, pesticides and toxic substances.
``Given the agency's concerns about long-term exposure, people
should exercise judgment as to whether to use the materials.''
</P>
<P>
   The dirt of the ages appears to have won a round. Though there
are other protective products, including DuPont's Stainmaster, the
Scotchgard announcement left many vendors and consumers unprotected
from the vision of a future without soil retardance or stain
repellence in clothing, home furnishings and floor coverings: three
huge textile categories (with an estimated $45 billion in annual
sales, according to the Census Bureau) in which the product is
ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   With an air of national emergency, Heloise, the syndicated
household-hints columnist, was scrambled like a fighter pilot by
the ``Today'' show for a not very reassuring appearance two days
after 3M's news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked around my hotel room that night,'' she said, reached
on a car telephone in Texas. ``Carpeting, drapes, bedspread _
probably all fabric protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Heloise, who had previously advised Bryant Gumbel and Matt Lauer
to use fabric protector on favorite neckties, found herself
confronted with an anxious public after the show. ``Everyone from
my CPA to flight attendants has said: `Oh, we saw you. Are they
taking it away?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The news will only get worse, the columnist hinted darkly, her
voice crackling from the highway. ``The first ramification is that
the can is going away,'' she said, speaking of the home-application
sprays available in hardware stores. Those three products are
Scotchgard's Protector for Fabric and Upholstery, Protector for
Rugs and Carpet and Protector for Leather. (Scotchgard cleaning
products are not affected.)
</P>
<P>
   Scotchgard, which represents $300 million, or 2 percent, of 3M's
$16 billion in annual sales, is more typically applied
commercially, at the industrial level. ``In the manufacturing
process, if you're going to get a new couch, and you have three
kids under the age of 10,'' Heloise asked, ``are you going to be
out of luck?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question.
</P>
<P>
   From popular midpriced furniture manufacturers like La-Z-Boy to
Hickory Chair, which licenses collections from decorators like
Thomas O'Brien and the late Mark Hampton, soil and stain protection
is prevalent in upholstered products. Ninety percent of La-Z-Boy's
stain-preventive fabrics are treated with Scotchgard. The company
has called 3M in for a meeting to discuss the strategy and
timetable for withdrawing Scotchgard and for assurances about the
product's safety, said Greg White, vice president for merchandising
at La-Z-Boy.
</P>
<P>
   In a spectacular piece of bad timing, 3M introduced a national
magazine advertising campaign late last year extolling the
Scotchgard-protected life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got a life? Gotta ask for Scotchgard,'' the ad reads in the
current issue of Martha Stewart Living. In the picture, a child
playing on a carpet is spilling juice on her doll.
</P>
<P>
   The Scotchgard brand enjoys the highest consumer recognition of
any protective finish, according to a 1999 survey of brands by HFN,
a home furnishings industry publication. DuPont's Teflon was No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Teflon's chemistry, which does not include the perfluorooctanyl
in Scotchgard, is the effective agent in DuPont's competitive
product, Stainmaster, a popular carpet fiber with protective
chemicals integrated into the fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Wolk, DuPont's vice president and general manager for
global flooring and nylon in North America, said that despite
Scotchgard's withdrawal, the company has no plans to introduce
home-application protective sprays, which are not now a part of
DuPont's product line.
</P>
<P>
   Scotchgard, which has a toll-free telephone service center that
answers consumers' questions on its products and warranties (for
``Scotchgard Soil and Stain Release'' carpet protection, a
five-year guarantee against common food and beverage stains,
including bearnaise and hollandaise sauce), reported an increase in
queries, and concerns about both supply and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Housekeeping experts, including Heloise, agreed that there are
no traditional recipes for similar soil and stain protection _ only
wisdom about stain removal.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In an informal experiment, an unpeeled white potato that was
sprayed with Scotchgard on one side but not the other displayed
admirable, indistinguishable soil water and stain repellence on
both sides, suggesting that, apart from environmental and toxicity
issues, Scotchgard's absence will be bad news for couch potatoes,
but not potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the peace of mind promised by products like
Scotchgard was invented with them in the 1950s, by laboratory
researchers like Patsy Sherman, who got the idea for a
stain-prevention product when a colleague at 3M accidentally
splashed a fluorochemical-latex emulsion on her tennis shoes. The
doused shoes repelled water and solvents. (Presciently, the team
never discovered a way of getting the gunk off the shoes.)
Scotchgard was introduced to consumers in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Sheep could be the big winners in a world without it. Wool is
water- and stain-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``With wool it's not an issue,'' said Mark Saley, marketing
director of floor coverings at ABC Carpet &AMP; Home in New York.
``It's inherently stain-resistant, because of the lanolin in the
wool. And it repels dirt, because it's porous, not solid fiber like
nylon. It's mostly a nylon issue.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Wolk at DuPont, which could be the other clear winner with
Scotchgard's demise, estimated that nylon carpet manufacturing was
a $6.4 billion a year business.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Salant, the owner of the Budget Plastic Cover Co. in the
Bronx, which has made plastic slipcovers for 30 years, believes in
his product but isn't waiting for history to reverse itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impervious to anything,'' he said of a plastic slipcover.
``Stain protection isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Salant said that the introduction of fabric protectors never
affected his sales. ``Certain people are plastic slipcover
people,'' he said. ``I see very little impact.''

UNITED NATIONS AND CAMBODIA NEARER TO DEAL ON KHMER ROUGE TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ After months of often acrimonious exchanges
over who should ultimately control war crimes trials for the Khmer
Rouge, the United Nations has conceded to Cambodia the right to
appoint one of two prosecutors. The compromise appears to have
surmounted a major hurdle in eventually bringing former leaders of
the Khmer Rouge to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups immediately criticized the deal under which
either the Cambodian or a co-prosecutor appointed by the United
Nations could proceed with a case if a five-judge tribunal does not
block it. The groups said the United Nations had compromised its
requirement that the trials be conducted impartially.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to allowing co-prosecutors, the deal also stipulates
that the tribunal will include three members from Cambodia and two
nominated by the United Nations. Usually, the panel would have been
run entirely by the United Nations and been modeled on the war
crimes tribunals used in the Balkans and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was arrived at in part last month through the
intercession of Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who discussed the urgency
of establishing a tribunal with Cambodian leaders, and a long
series of negotiations between a U.N. team and Cambodia's prime
minister, Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   The deal must be approved by the Cambodian legislature before
the tribunal can be involved in cases against former members of the
Khmer Rouge, an extreme leftist movement that decimated Cambodian
society in the 1970s. More than 1 million people were executed or
died from hard labor, dislocation, starvation and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the deal signaled that Hun Sen, himself a former
lower-ranking Khmer Rouge official, had given up having total
control over the tribunal. The United Nations had opposed his
efforts because of the weakness and political vulnerability of the
Cambodian judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, U.S. and U.N. officials said, the two
prosecutors would be backed by the five judges. If the two
prosecutors cannot agree on an indictment, the five judges would
act as arbitrators. But for an indictment to be derailed, four of
the five judges would have to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary-general considers the prime minister's response
a positive development,'' said Fred Eckhard, the spokesman for U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. But the United Nations is refusing to
discuss the agreement, and plans to send its legal counsel, Hans
Corell, back to Cambodia to work out details. In the past, Hun Sen
has changed his position and undercut agreements.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials here and in Cambodia said that the Clinton
administration, with few foreign policy breakthroughs to its credit
as it enters its final months, strongly backed the deal, apparently
finalized this week in an exchange of letters between Hun Sen and
Annan.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, Bruce Broomhall, the
international justice coordinator, said that this provision is a
welcome development, but overall he remains skeptical of the
agreement ``because in our assessment it is a
lowest-common-denominator solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This rewards political intransigence by compromising on the
integrity of the tribunal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said in
an interview that he sees many pitfalls in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're afraid that this is a precedent that will come back to
haunt the U.N. elsewhere,'' Roth said. ``The U.N. has been a very
firm custodian of fair trial standards, and prosecutions have been
conducted with scrupulous regard for due process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This arbitration panel sets a terrible precedent, because it
suggests that a U.N.-appointed international prosecutor can't be
trusted to make independent, clear decisions. This sends precisely
the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   ``This compromise really only addresses the big issues of who
gets indicted and who gets acquitted or convicted,'' Roth, a former
prosecutor, said. ``In those big decisions, there is a sort of
check-and-balance system put into place. But there are dozens of
ways, apart from those big decisions, that the Cambodian government
can still sabotage the prosecutorial process. These are just not
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other unresolved issues, Roth said, there seems to have
been no clear decisions on what to do about amnesty deals that Hun
Sen has made with several high Khmer Rouge officials who are now
living openly in Cambodia _ some of them with government jobs.

<P>
   &UR; BY IRA CARNAHAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Priceline, the leading name-your-own-price Web site (the one
with those William Shatner TV commercials), will be selling
gasoline beginning May 20. You tell them how much you're willing to
pay for a certain number of gallons _ and give them your
credit-card number in advance.
</P>
<P>
   If they accept your offer, they immediately charge your credit
card. You then go to a nearby gas station and ignore the price at
the pump.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline's founder, Jay Walker, describes this new offering in
the messianic language characteristic of Web hype. ``It's the
battle of the titans,'' he said recently. ``The global Internet vs.
global gas prices. OPEC was a force to increase the cost of gas.
Now, the Internet is the new counterforce to lower it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. But before you decide Priceline is the consumer's
best friend, you ought to know a little about how it works. Start
with Priceline's biggest selling point: You name your price.
Priceline's conceit is that it has reversed the traditional balance
of power. Usually, the seller sets the price, and the buyer must
then decide whether to take it or leave it. At Priceline,
supposedly, it's the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Only, it doesn't quite work that way. When you name your price,
the seller has already told Priceline what minimum price he is
willing to accept. The difference from traditional retailing is
that you, the buyer, don't know what that price is. That's a
breakthrough, all right. For sellers. Priceline offers them a
clever way to charge different prices to different customers, based
on their willingness to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Economists call this price discrimination. To work, it has two
requirements. One is a way to smoke out the different amounts
different people are willing to pay. The second is a market that is
at least somewhat uncompetitive. (Otherwise, competition inevitably
will drive down the price, even for people who would be willing to
pay more.)
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are a classic example. On a typical flight, a big
airline may charge dozens of different fares. The key task for the
airlines' large staffs of pricing specialists is sorting the
price-sensitive fliers from those who aren't. To do that, the
airlines have come up with a maze of advance-purchase and stay-over
requirements that keep business fliers from buying the cheap seats
offered to leisure travelers.
</P>
<P>
   While this system of ``yield management'' has been a great
success, it could still work better. About 30 percent of seats fly
empty (never the seat next to you, of course). The extra cost of
flying those seats with bodies in them is almost nothing, so a
ticket sold at almost any price will be profitable _ as long as
other customers who are paying a lot more can be kept away.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Priceline. It finds out how much each customer is willing
to pay by the brilliant technique of asking. And it keeps the
higher-paying customers away from the bargains by making the
process such a pain in the ass.
</P>
<P>
   With Priceline, you have to give your credit-card information
and agree to be charged before you know whether you've even got a
deal. You don't get to choose the airline that you'll fly. You
don't get to specify the time of day you'll leave or whether you'll
make an intermediate stop. These hassles are not an unfortunate
byproduct. The burdensome process is essential to making price
discrimination work.
</P>
<P>
   In a traditional market where everybody pays the same price,
almost every buyer actually would have been willing to pay more,
and almost every seller would have been willing to take less.
Charging different prices to different people is a way for sellers
to occupy more of this no man's land. Outlet malls and traditional
discount ticket brokers are other methods of price discrimination.
But Priceline's name-your-price allows price discrimination to be
far more fine-tuned.
</P>
<P>
   An outlet mall separates those who'll pay $150 for a dress from
those who'll drive 30 miles to get it for $119.96. The seller is
still losing $4 from the outlet customer who would have paid
$123.96, and losing entirely the customer who would have paid
$118.96. Priceline has a different price tailor-made for each
customer.
</P>
<P>
   In the premiere issue of eCompany Now, Time Warner's new
business magazine, a reporter tells of bidding _ and prepaying _
$75 for a room in a South Dakota hotel where the most expensive
regular rate is $54.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline's system also improves on older methods of price
discrimination by hiding the discount. There are no posted special
rates that might spark a mutually defeating price war. The secrecy
also permits forms of price discrimination that are positively
baroque.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports reported that when it first tried Priceline's
grocery service, ``We successfully bid the minimum for everything
on our list, saving more than 40 percent overall ... Four days
later, when our reporter again bid the minimum for the same items,
the offers were uniformly rejected. At the same time another
staffer, registering as a first-timer, got the entire market basket
for the minimums.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Priceline is good for sellers doesn't make it bad
for buyers. After all, the premise of capitalism is that voluntary
transactions are good for both sides. But the fact that no one is
forced to deal with Priceline doesn't prove that it's good for
consumers or for society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Some airline seats (and hotel rooms, etc.) that would otherwise
go empty are sold to people who otherwise couldn't or didn't care
to pay more. A plus for sellers, a plus for buyers, and therefore a
plus for society.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who would have bought seats through traditional
methods buy from Priceline (and its rivals) instead. Most probably
pay less as a result, but a few pay more. This is a zero-sum game:
The buyers' gain is the sellers' loss. So call it a net plus for
buyers, a net minus for sellers, and a wash for society.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who buys through Priceline pays a cost in time,
inconvenience and uncertainty. There is no equivalent gain to
sellers. A minus for buyers, a wash for sellers, and a minus for
society.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't use Priceline or other discount opportunities
almost certainly pay more, since sellers know they're not looking
for a bargain. This might be because they're well off. But it could
also be because they're short of time, because they don't know
lower prices are out there, or because they're unable _ say,
because they lack an Internet connection _ to take advantage. This
is a minus for buyers, a plus for sellers, and a wash for society.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line? Who knows. We can assume it nets out a plus for
sellers, or they wouldn't be doing it. As for consumers, it's
probably a net plus, but far from the pro-consumer revolution of
Priceline propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   One final economic question is raised by Priceline's latest
move. If successful price discrimination depends on a lack of
competition, how can it possibly work for gasoline? The retail
gasoline business features thousands of sellers, often two or three
at the same intersection; a homogeneous product (how many people
care what brand of gas they get?); and prices are prominently
displayed and easy to change. If this isn't a competitive market,
you would think, nothing is.
</P>
<P>
   And the answer may be, in fact, that nothing is. A study of
Boston-area gas stations by Stanford economist Andrea Shepard found
that price discrimination added at least 9 cents a gallon to the
average price of full-service gas.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, 9 cents of the difference between full-service
and self-service has nothing to do with the added cost but is
simply a result of people self-selecting themselves for the
privilege of paying more. And despite the seemingly competitive
nature of the retail gasoline business, this 9-cent premium doesn't
get competed away.
</P>
<P>
   So if you can tolerate the hassle, go ahead and give Priceline
gasoline a try. But don't think for a moment that you're actually
in the driver's seat.

   Priceline, the leading name-your-own-price Web site (the one
with those William Shatner TV commercials), will be selling
gasoline beginning May 20. You tell them how much you're willing to
pay for a certain number of gallons _ and give them your
credit-card number in advance.
</P>
<P>
   If they accept your offer, they immediately charge your credit
card. You then go to a nearby gas station and ignore the price at
the pump.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline's founder, Jay Walker, describes this new offering in
the messianic language characteristic of Web hype. ``It's the
battle of the titans,'' he said recently. ``The global Internet vs.
global gas prices. OPEC was a force to increase the cost of gas.
Now, the Internet is the new counterforce to lower it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. But before you decide Priceline is the consumer's
best friend, you ought to know a little about how it works. Start
with Priceline's biggest selling point: You name your price.
Priceline's conceit is that it has reversed the traditional balance
of power. Usually, the seller sets the price, and the buyer must
then decide whether to take it or leave it. At Priceline,
supposedly, it's the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Only, it doesn't quite work that way. When you name your price,
the seller has already told Priceline what minimum price he is
willing to accept. The difference from traditional retailing is
that you, the buyer, don't know what that price is. That's a
breakthrough, all right. For sellers. Priceline offers them a
clever way to charge different prices to different customers, based
on their willingness to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Economists call this price discrimination. To work, it has two
requirements. One is a way to smoke out the different amounts
different people are willing to pay. The second is a market that is
at least somewhat uncompetitive. (Otherwise, competition inevitably
will drive down the price, even for people who would be willing to
pay more.)
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are a classic example. On a typical flight, a big
airline may charge dozens of different fares. The key task for the
airlines' large staffs of pricing specialists is sorting the
price-sensitive fliers from those who aren't. To do that, the
airlines have come up with a maze of advance-purchase and stay-over
requirements that keep business fliers from buying the cheap seats
offered to leisure travelers.
</P>
<P>
   While this system of ``yield management'' has been a great
success, it could still work better. About 30 percent of seats fly
empty (never the seat next to you, of course). The extra cost of
flying those seats with bodies in them is almost nothing, so a
ticket sold at almost any price will be profitable _ as long as
other customers who are paying a lot more can be kept away.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Priceline. It finds out how much each customer is willing
to pay by the brilliant technique of asking. And it keeps the
higher-paying customers away from the bargains by making the
process such a pain in the ass.
</P>
<P>
   With Priceline, you have to give your credit-card information
and agree to be charged before you know whether you've even got a
deal. You don't get to choose the airline that you'll fly. You
don't get to specify the time of day you'll leave or whether you'll
make an intermediate stop. These hassles are not an unfortunate
byproduct. The burdensome process is essential to making price
discrimination work.
</P>
<P>
   In a traditional market where everybody pays the same price,
almost every buyer actually would have been willing to pay more,
and almost every seller would have been willing to take less.
Charging different prices to different people is a way for sellers
to occupy more of this no man's land. Outlet malls and traditional
discount ticket brokers are other methods of price discrimination.
But Priceline's name-your-price allows price discrimination to be
far more fine-tuned.
</P>
<P>
   An outlet mall separates those who'll pay $150 for a dress from
those who'll drive 30 miles to get it for $119.96. The seller is
still losing $4 from the outlet customer who would have paid
$123.96, and losing entirely the customer who would have paid
$118.96. Priceline has a different price tailor-made for each
customer.
</P>
<P>
   In the premiere issue of eCompany Now, Time Warner's new
business magazine, a reporter tells of bidding _ and prepaying _
$75 for a room in a South Dakota hotel where the most expensive
regular rate is $54.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline's system also improves on older methods of price
discrimination by hiding the discount. There are no posted special
rates that might spark a mutually defeating price war. The secrecy
also permits forms of price discrimination that are positively
baroque.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports reported that when it first tried Priceline's
grocery service, ``We successfully bid the minimum for everything
on our list, saving more than 40 percent overall ... Four days
later, when our reporter again bid the minimum for the same items,
the offers were uniformly rejected. At the same time another
staffer, registering as a first-timer, got the entire market basket
for the minimums.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Priceline is good for sellers doesn't make it bad
for buyers. After all, the premise of capitalism is that voluntary
transactions are good for both sides. But the fact that no one is
forced to deal with Priceline doesn't prove that it's good for
consumers or for society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Some airline seats (and hotel rooms, etc.) that would otherwise
go empty are sold to people who otherwise couldn't or didn't care
to pay more. A plus for sellers, a plus for buyers, and therefore a
plus for society.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who would have bought seats through traditional
methods buy from Priceline (and its rivals) instead. Most probably
pay less as a result, but a few pay more. This is a zero-sum game:
The buyers' gain is the sellers' loss. So call it a net plus for
buyers, a net minus for sellers, and a wash for society.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who buys through Priceline pays a cost in time,
inconvenience and uncertainty. There is no equivalent gain to
sellers. A minus for buyers, a wash for sellers, and a minus for
society.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't use Priceline or other discount opportunities
almost certainly pay more, since sellers know they're not looking
for a bargain. This might be because they're well off. But it could
also be because they're short of time, because they don't know
lower prices are out there, or because they're unable _ say,
because they lack an Internet connection _ to take advantage. This
is a minus for buyers, a plus for sellers, and a wash for society.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line? Who knows. We can assume it nets out a plus for
sellers, or they wouldn't be doing it. As for consumers, it's
probably a net plus, but far from the pro-consumer revolution of
Priceline propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   One final economic question is raised by Priceline's latest
move. If successful price discrimination depends on a lack of
competition, how can it possibly work for gasoline? The retail
gasoline business features thousands of sellers, often two or three
at the same intersection; a homogeneous product (how many people
care what brand of gas they get?); and prices are prominently
displayed and easy to change. If this isn't a competitive market,
you would think, nothing is.
</P>
<P>
   And the answer may be, in fact, that nothing is. A study of
Boston-area gas stations by Stanford economist Andrea Shepard found
that price discrimination added at least 9 cents a gallon to the
average price of full-service gas.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, 9 cents of the difference between full-service
and self-service has nothing to do with the added cost but is
simply a result of people self-selecting themselves for the
privilege of paying more. And despite the seemingly competitive
nature of the retail gasoline business, this 9-cent premium doesn't
get competed away.
</P>
<P>
   So if you can tolerate the hassle, go ahead and give Priceline
gasoline a try. But don't think for a moment that you're actually
in the driver's seat.

DINOSAURS FROM THE DAWN OF MOVIE TIME TO THE PRESENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the dawn of history, or at least the dawn of movies,
dinosaurs have intrigued filmmakers _ from some of the earliest
animators to the makers of the new mega-movie ``Dinosaur.'' Since
nothing puts us in a mind to think about evolution more than these
Mesozoic megaliths, we present the evolution of dinosaur movies.
</P>
<P>
   THE PIONEER EPOCH
</P>
<P>
   1914
</P>
<P>
   ``Gertie:'' Newspaper cartoonist Winsor McCay, who has already
done a couple of animated films, decides to animate a dinosaur to
prove that his drawings are moving. He incorporates the film into
his vaudeville act, interacting with Gertie, who eats, drinks,
plays and even cries.
</P>
<P>
   1925
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lost World:'' Willis O'Brien, director of some early
dinosaur-related shorts, brings his stop-motion animation to full
flower as the special-effects supervisor on this adaptation of an
Arthur Conan Doyle story about a professor who discovers dinosaurs
living in a remote section of Africa. No relation to Steven
Spielberg's ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   1933
</P>
<P>
   ``King Kong:'' O'Brien also did the effects on this, which
although most notable for its impressive stop-motion animation of
the title ape, also includes some cool dinosaur fights.
</P>
<P>
   1939/40
</P>
<P>
   ``One Million B.C.:'' Showman Hal Roach is credited with
directing this caveman saga, which pits the ugh-sayers against
dinosaurs and one another. Although it's mediocre, it's dazzling
(for the time) special effects provide stock footage for dino
movies for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCHLOCK EPOCH
</P>
<P>
   1951
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lost Continent:'' Considering that the cast includes Cesar
Romero, Hugh ``Ward Cleaver'' Beaumont and cultural curiosity
Acquanetta, maybe this B-movie featuring fake-looking dinos and a
lot of rock climbing is an example of dinosaur-movie de-evolution.
</P>
<P>
   1966
</P>
<P>
   ``One Million Years B.C.:'' Stop-motion whiz Ray Harryhausen
provides some great-looking dinosaurs, who are upstaged by
fur-bikini-clad poster girl Raquel Welch.
</P>
<P>
   1975
</P>
<P>
   ``The Land That Time Forgot:'' Poor production values (and
not-very-convincing special effects) hurt this adaptation of an
Edgar Rice Burroughs story about German and British troops who
discover dinosaurs on a South Pacific Island during World War I.
</P>
<P>
   THE WARM-AND-FUZZY EPOCH
</P>
<P>
   1988
</P>
<P>
   ``The Land Before Time:'' In a plot that sounds suspiciously
similar to that of ``Dinosaur,'' a young orphan dinosaur must
travel with the herd to a verdant valley, and meets several pals
along the way. The difference is that this is a cartoon directed by
Disney refugee Don Bluth, whose 'toons always seem to lack that
``something special'' that puts Disney 'toons over the top. But it
spawned a video series that keeps kids entertained.
</P>
<P>
   1992
</P>
<P>
   ``Barney &AMP; Friends:'' He's the warmest, fuzziest dino of 'em all
_ largely because he's made out of some sort of fabric. The big,
purple galoot is a hit with small children and their parents,
doubling as a teacher of values and an ersatz baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPUTER EPOCH
</P>
<P>
   1993
</P>
<P>
   ``Jurassic Park:'' Scientists and paleontologists fool with
Mother Nature, and the Industrial Light and Magic and Stan Winston
Studios fool us with computer-generated visual effects that present
the most realistic movie dinosaurs to this point.
</P>
<P>
   1998
</P>
<P>
   ``T. Rex: Back to the Cretaceous:'' IMAX, probably the only film
format than can do full justice to dinosaur size, gives us a big,
green eating machine in this typically enlightening and lightweight
entry.
</P>
<P>
   APRIL 2000
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking With Dinosaurs:'' Picking up where ``Jurassic Park''
(and its 1997 sequel, ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'') left off,
this Discovery Channel documentary uses computer-generated imaging
to detail the story of the prehistoric critters. The DVD is
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   MAY 2000
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur:'' Like ``Walking With Dinosaurs,'' this places
computer-generated dinos in real-life locations. But it also
bestows them with human qualities: i.e., they can talk, they can
feel, and they have the most expressive eyes in animation history.
They're so awesome-looking that you might not care that their story
is ... well, prehistoric. &QL;

HOW TO WRITE A BOOK ON WOMEN IN HOLLYWOOD

<P>
   &UR; BY JUDITH SHULEVITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first rule of book reviewing is: Review the book that was
published, not the one you wish had been written. I will now
violate that edict.
</P>
<P>
   Premiere magazine writer Rachel Abramowitz's ``Is That a Gun in
Your Pocket? Women's Experiences of Power in Hollywood'' is a long,
gossipy, blow-by-blow account of seemingly every single career move
ever made by the first two generations of women to succeed in
Hollywood, including studio chiefs Dawn Steel and Sherry Lansing,
agent Sue Mengers, actress/director Jodie Foster, director/writers
Nora Ephron and Elaine May, and producer Paula Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ITAGIYP isn't terrible, exactly, but it is the kind of book that
induces in the reviewer such weighty thoughts as, ``Ought this kind
of book to exist? Does the world require more proof that all
humans, male or female, have a propensity for deal-making,
backstabbing and power worship? Can Abramowitz really justify the
effort on the grounds that she's written a history of female
consciousness in the movie industry?''
</P>
<P>
   The answers to those questions are no; probably; and of course
not. The replies would have been different, though, if the book had
been independent-minded instead of worshipful and not written in
the gee-whiz jargon of celebrity profiles.
</P>
<P>
   There is, in fact, an interesting case study to be written about
women and Hollywood. Complain all you like, but as industries go,
the movie industry is relatively open to women and other outsiders.
Sure, Hollywood looks white and male, given the frat-like male
bonding that goes on in film crews and the networking that tends to
shut out minority executives, but that appearance is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to, say, brokerage firms, studios tend to be places
where people are judged more on their work product _ their
box-office results _ than on their sex or social profile. That
means Hollywood can often assimilate new networks _ black,
Hispanic, female, Australian, subcontinental Indian _ before other
businesses can. The process is slow and fraught, obviously, and
people from one network may have difficulties striking up the
necessary relationships with people from another. But the existence
of movies like ``Thelma &AMP; Louise'' tells us something of how far
women have come.
</P>
<P>
   You get a sense of how movie studios differ from other
workplaces when Abramowitz tells the tale of Marvin Davis, the
Denver oilman who bought Fox and couldn't grasp, on first meeting
Sherry Lansing, that she was Fox's head of production.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the oil business we only work with guys,'' he explains. ``I
never worked with a broad. So I thought she was supposed to get the
coffee.'' In other words, Hollywood looked like the land of radical
feminists from where Davis was sitting.
</P>
<P>
   In the book about women and Hollywood that people should read,
the writer's main task would be to disentangle sexual
discrimination (a structural flaw) and the clash of personalities
(which can happen in any group at any time). Unbundling the two
would be as rewarding in literary terms as it would be helpful
politically.
</P>
<P>
   Conflating them, on the other hand, as Abramowitz tends to do,
has the effect of reducing the larger-than-life qualities of
foul-mouthed telephone-slammer studio chief Dawn Steel or the
vulgar ball-busting agent Sue Mengers into something suitably
female, like insecurity, anxiety, the need to out-shriek the men,
or lack of socialization.
</P>
<P>
   Did their careers swing up and down because they were women,
because Hollywood is just like that, or because they were capable
of being completely, deliriously intransigent? What would it take
for a woman to gain recognition for being as big a monster (or
genius) as Samuel Goldwyn, Irving Thalberg, or Louis G. Mayer,
anyway?

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, hail and damaging winds affected parts of the
interior Northeast as a potent jet stream disturbance swept across
the region. On Thursday, a cool front associated with the
disturbance will intercept a humid air mass, setting the stage for
more storms over the Carolinas and southern Appalachians. Farther
west, the front will become stationary, causing recurrent
thunderstorms in the southern and central Plains. Local flooding is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Gusty breezes will direct drier air into the Northeast. Amid
plentiful sunshine, daytime temperatures will reach seasonably warm
levels from Washington to New York City. However, moist air
circulating around low pressure will bring showers to New England
early Thursday. Sunshine will return to coastal sections Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest will stay hot. Spotty thunderstorms will form over
some of the peaks of the southern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WET AND DRY
</P>
<P>
   While concerns about drought are increasing in parts of the Deep
South, Binghamton, N.Y., has had the wettest start of any year on
record. Through Wednesday morning more than 22 inches of rain had
been recorded there. Typically, Binghamton gets about 15 inches of
rain in the first five months of the year. While areas that have
been exceptionally wet or dry always garner more attention, most of
the nation east of the Mississippi River is within the normal
historical range of precipitation this year.

   &UR; BY MICHAEL KINSLEY &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Einstein makes an unexpected appearance in George W. Bush's
Social Security proposal: ``Because of the impact of compound
interest, which Albert Einstein called the most powerful force in
the universe, diversified personal retirement accounts can be
expected to earn nearly 6 percent after inflation _ almost three
times what Social Security now provides.''
</P>
<P>
   Einstein was wrong, of course. The most powerful force in the
universe is stupidity. Then comes political spin. Compound interest
may be third.
</P>
<P>
   Class, who would like to point out the error in George's
statement? That's right: Compounding affects the amount of return
but not the rate. Bush can compound 2 percent as often as he likes,
but when he stops, it will still be 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the rate of return from about 2 percent to about 6
percent is the essence of Bush's plan to ``save'' Social Security.
He would do this by allowing people to invest privately some
fraction of what they now pay into the Social Security Trust Fund.
Six or 7 percent is the historic long-term return on stocks. This
is not, as Bush seems to think, guaranteed by the magic of
compounding.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose it happens _ not just on average, but for every
individual participant. The numbers still don't add up.
</P>
<P>
   First, the comparison between 2 percent and 6 percent is phony.
If you think of Social Security taxes as an investment and benefits
as the return, it may work out to 2 percent. But that's because
current workers are paying for current retirees, not because of
where what's left over is invested.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, the Social Security Trust Fund, in the year
ending March 31, earned $56 billion of interest on assets of about
$850 billion, which is more than 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush presumes that all the money you put into his ``diversified
personal retirement accounts'' gets to compound away just for you.
But he doesn't say how he'll replace the money you're now paying to
cover current retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Bush promises to put the current annual Social Security
surplus in a ``'lock box' ... to be preserved solely for Social
Security _ unlike the current administration, which has spent $295
billion of the Social Security surplus on other programs.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know what this means. The surplus currently is
invested in government bonds. One of Bush's six so-called
``principles'' is that ``Government must not invest Social Security
funds in the stock market.'' So would he put it in real estate?
Lotto tickets? Does he imagine literally stuffing $2 trillion cash
in a safe somewhere?
</P>
<P>
   With the government running an overall surplus, it's no longer
even metaphorically true that the Social Security surplus is being
spent on other current programs. It's being used to finance past
deficits _ mostly those of President Clinton's two Republican
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Bush spends his putative privatization bonanza again and
again. The first thing it must do, of course, is cover its own
cost. Assume, as he does, that people may divert 2 percent of
income into their private funds. That's about one-sixth of Social
Security tax revenues, or $80 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the arrangement has to close the gap between what the
system expects to bring in and the benefits it currently promises.
Bush says that gap is $2.9 trillion. But Bush also promises to
raise the effective rate of return _ or, in other words, to provide
a bigger payoff than current benefits. And he says his plan will
allow even low-income people to ``build significant wealth'' that
they can ``pass on to their children.''
</P>
<P>
   This last notion is Bush's ``compassionate conservatism'' in
self-parody: a government program to divert tax dollars so that
every American child can inherit money from her parents. Are yacht
stamps next?
</P>
<P>
   But if that nest egg is supposed to make up for reduced
benefits, it can't be left for the kids. And if benefits aren't
reduced while tax revenues are diverted, we've made the solvency
problem worse, not better.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, what happens when $80 billion or more each year that
used to be lent to the government is invested in the private sector
instead? The government must close this $80 billion gap. It could
cut spending or raise taxes, but Bush mentions nothing about that.
So we must assume that the government simply borrows the $80
billion from someone else. Total government borrowing would remain
the same and so would total private capital. The economy would be
at best the same size as if the program didn't exist. That means
the promised bonanza for Social Security recipients must come at
the expense of someone else. Who?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: It is the genius who listens to the president say that
government bonds are a terrible investment and stocks are a sure
thing and then sells his stocks to buy government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously there is no such single person. But Social Security
privatization schemes all do implicitly assume that for every
dollar they rescue from the pit of poor returns, the market will
supply another dollar eager to jump in. And that this will happen
without lowering the return on stocks and raising the return on
government bonds, thus defeating the point of the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Both politically and economically, then, Social Security
privatization depends on the most powerful force in the universe.
Not compound interest.

SHOWTIME FIGURES YOUR BRAIN NEEDN'T GO ON HOLIDAY THIS WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stories are as different as black and white, but the similar
themes running through ``Dirty Pictures'' and ``On the Beach'' stir
up the gray matter like few films ever do on the big networks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the movies isn't even that good. But both manage to
instigate those little scholarly debates that rage inside the head
like a personal arts-and-lectures series whenever a provocative
idea is presented. It's what smart TV is about, and a tribute to
Showtime and its ``No Limits'' slogan, which apparently isn't just
a piece of advertising fluff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty Pictures'' is a gritty exploration of the obscenity case
involving the Cincinnati museum director whose decision to display
a controversial exhibit of photographs by the late Robert
Mapplethorpe made him the darling of First Amendment champions a
decade ago. ``On the Beach'' is a 1999 remake of the 1959 film
about people in Australia who have survived a nuclear war but
pretty much know their demise from radiation poisoning is only a
matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   Airing them a day apart may seem an odd choice, but Showtime
often does this sort of thing if only to prove that its programmers
are indeed interested in engaging the viewer's intellect. A concept
as foreign to the major networks as humility is to Frasier Crane,
it only makes Showtime look that much smarter on a holiday weekend
when the networks assume no one is watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   The jewel in this unlikely pairing, Saturday's ``Dirty
Pictures,'' features James Woods as Dennis Barrie, director of
Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center during the Mapplethorpe
dustup. His commitment exacted the kind of personal toll that
usually goes unnoticed when people are thrust into the spotlight
for standing on principles not shared by everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie believed Mapplethorpe's exhibit, which included
photographs of naked children and scenes depicting homoerotic
activity, should not be censored or shut down simply because it
offended people. His defense of a person's right to see the
exhibit, free of intervention by the government or any group bent
on playing community guardian, caused him and his family
considerable harassment at the hands of bullies incapable of civil
discourse.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is enormously effective as a reluctant crusader torn
between storming the battlements and running from the fray. Diana
Scarwid is even better as Barrie's wife, Dianne, a woman wondering
if her staunch support of her husband against obscenity charges
will ultimately mean the loss of their home and irreparable harm to
their two young sons.
</P>
<P>
   Intercut with documentary-style interviews of prominent figures
on both sides of the issue, ``Dirty Pictures'' offers a keen
observation of what it takes to demonstrate courage, compassion,
honor and loyalty, and an even keener realization that noble
virtues don't always fit conveniently into the same jar on the
shelf of family values.
</P>
<P>
   Though far less successful as a dramatic piece, Sunday's ``On
the Beach,'' a three-hour Australian production, places the same
issues in an even more frightening setting. Anyone who can stay
with the over-theatrical presentation to the end should at least
come away with a stimulating set of ``what would I do?'' and ``with
whom would I do it?' questions if he or she were facing certain
death from nuclear fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Updated to 2006 to give currency to a concept most of us see as
an outdated vestige of the Cold War, the three-hour film remains
generally faithful to the original Nevil Shute novel about the last
days of civilization on this planet.
</P>
<P>
   Armand Assante plays Dwight Towers, the stony American submarine
commander thrust into post-apocalyptic Australia, the only place
where the bombs didn't hit. Dealing with the knowledge that his
family back in the States has been vaporized, Towers tentatively
tests the roiling waters of a relationship with a boozy floozy
named Moira Davidson, who likes him back but keeps her options open
with former flame Julian Osborne, one of Australia's best and
brightest and not ashamed to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be an Aussie film without Rachel Ward (Moira) or
real-life husband Bryan Brown (Julian), but neither manages to lift
``On the Beach'' off the carpet. The best performance comes from
Jacqueline McKenzie, who plays Mary Holmes, Moira's married sister,
with the only emotion that seems convincing and not shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``On the Beach'' poses tough, relevant questions about
personal obligations and choices, which isn't a bad reason for
remaking a movie.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Nondrinking customers finally get a financial break at wine
dinners
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _
</P>
<P>
   Triple-tiered kudos this week:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lo those many years ago, when I started this wine-writing gig,
I tried to go to as many of the wine dinners around town as my
wallet would allow. And sometimes, depending on the menu and the
venue, I would persuade my wife _ who likes neither the taste nor
the effect of wine _ to join me, even though it meant paying the
full wine-and-food price for someone who was only going to consume
the food.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, emboldened by the awesome prestige that comes
from this position, I suggested to a few select organizers of these
wine dinners that perhaps they should offer a slightly discounted
price for nondrinking friends and spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Without exception, they looked at me as if I had just staggered
off a spaceship. I got the message and ceased my whining.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine my surprise when I saw the notice for Fairfield Wine's
upcoming $48-per-person wine dinner that included the following
addendum: For nondrinkers or designated drivers the cost is $35.
</P>
<P>
   Fairfield Wine proprietor Dennis Hall said he got the idea for
the two-tier pricing from customers whose spouses don't drink or
whose wives are pregnant and abstaining.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure that small restaurants with a limited number of seats
for a wine dinner might have to charge full freight for every seat
to ensure the event recoups its costs. Still, it's nice to not feel
discriminated against because my dining companion chooses not to
drink. Maybe other folks will pick up on this suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, I guess, ideas _ like grapes _ just need time to
ripen.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Miami Valley's only four-star restaurant is making it
easier for customers to taste some of the finest wines in the
world. L'Auberge has launched what it calls its ``Four-Star
Spectator Wine Bar'' that offers bottles, glasses and tastes of
highly rated wines from 1997 Chalk Hill Chardonnay ($14 a glass, $7
a taste) to 1996 Robert Mondavi Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon ($35 a
glass, $18 a taste). Proprietor Josef Reif developed the idea, and
customer response has been overwhelmingly positive, according to
l'Auberge General Manager Alex Mchaikhi. The restaurant expanded
the selections this week, adding a California zinfandel, a
Washington State riesling and a ``real'' red Burgundy from _ yes _
France.

 &HT;    JUDGE MOVES TO BREAK UP MICROSOFT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON A federal judge Wednesday abruptly wrapped up the
Microsoft antitrust trial, setting the stage for a swift appeal of
a likely order to splinter the world's largest software company
into two or more parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not contemplating any further processes,'' U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson told John Warden, the lead defense
counsel, at the end of a four-hour remedy hearing called in
response to Jackson's sweeping April 3 ruling that Microsoft had
stifled innovation and harmed consumers by its anti-competitive
monopolistic practices.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson asked David Boies, who had prosecuted the case for the
Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general: ``How quickly
can you get me a final judgment in a form that reflects what
happened in court today?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could have it in your hands by Friday,'' Boies
replied.
</P>

   Jackson then granted Microsoft's request for 48 hours to comment
on the final government draft.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers must now decide how best to revise their
April 28 plan to cleave the software giant into two separate firms:
an applications arm that markets such popular products as Office
and a Windows arm that markets the flagship Windows operating

<P>
   During the hearing, Jackson repeatedly praised what he termed an
``excellent'' 65-page friend-of-the-court brief recently submitted
by two trade groups, the Software and Information Industries
Association and the Computer &AMP; Communications Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   It proposed creating yet a third firm that would control
Microsoft's Internet businesses, such as Microsoft Network and its

separate monopolies,'' Jackson said. ``Tell me how that would
effectively inspire competition?''
</P>

   ``If you were to divide the company into three Windows clones,
you would not have the kind of competition that would produce
innovation,'' Boies said. A two-way division would end Microsoft's

it used ``to protect each franchise,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two-part divestiture is also simpler to implement,'' Boies
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would appear to me that this is anything but simple to
implement,'' Jackson retorted. ``...Do you think Microsoft would be
a willing participant?''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson retains the freedom to craft his own set of remedies
under a timetable of his own choosing.
</P>
<P>
   But a shaken Microsoft team emerged from the courtroom convinced
that Jackson would issue has final order swiftly and that it would
track closely with, if not entirely reflect, the amended government
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``From everything that was said and done today it would appear
that's the way the judge is headed,'' said Mark Murray, a Microsoft
spokesman who had sat through the 78-day trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very near the appellate phase of this controversy,''
Microsoft general counsel William Neukom said. ``On appeal,
Microsoft will be raising challenges to the procedures used
throughout this trial, including the remedy phase. We will be
challenging the findings of fact, the conclusions of law, and the
nature of any relief the judge might enter.''
</P>
<P>
   In spurning Microsoft's plea that it be granted up to six more
months to hold, in effect, another trial focused on the remedial
impact, Jackson noted tartly that ``this case has been pending for
two years.'' He found it ``ironic'' that the firm was asking for
more time in court instead of moving quickly to get to an appeals
court.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, the judge rose from the bench to end the
proceedings, prompting Murray, the Microsoft spokesman, to say:
``That's it. We're going to the (U.S.) Court of Appeals. We always
knew we'd end up there anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I submit this remedy is so extreme ... it will go a very long
way to ensure that Microsoft is the one company that won't win''
the next round of competition in the software industry, Warden had
argued.
</P>
<P>
   On major financial markets, Microsoft shares closed up $2.38 at
$65.56.

 &HT;    JUDGE MOVES TO BREAK UP MICROSOFT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON A federal judge Wednesday abruptly wrapped up the
Microsoft antitrust trial, setting the stage for a swift appeal of
a likely order to splinter the world's largest software company
into two or more parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not contemplating any further processes,'' U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson told John Warden, the lead defense
counsel, at the end of a four-hour remedy hearing called in
response to Jackson's sweeping April 3 ruling that Microsoft had
stifled innovation and harmed consumers by its anti-competitive
monopolistic practices.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson asked David Boies, who had prosecuted the case for the
Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general: ``How quickly
can you get me a final judgment in a form that reflects what
happened in court today?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could have it in your hands by Friday,'' Boies
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson then granted Microsoft's request for 48 hours to comment
on the final government draft.
</P>

EMPOWERING WOMEN WITH PRACTICAL WELFARE-TO-WORK HELP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It's been a long time since Rochelle Bunch
felt hopeful about the future.
</P>
<P>
   But when the 38-year-old mother of three encountered Lovie
Anderson recently at the Texas Department of Human Services,
Bunch's outlook on life changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard her say something about empowering women, and that got
my attention,'' Bunch said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Bunch was in the midst of an on-again-off-again
relationship with the state welfare system that had lasted nearly a
decade. Without public assistance, she could barely eke out a
living.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with help from Anderson's More Than Conquerors
organization, the Fort Worth mother is hoping to end her dependence
on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit More Than Conquerors organization seeks to
encourage economically disadvantaged women to improve their lives
by providing support. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bunch is one of more than 50 women enrolled in More Than
Conquerors. Anderson, a former welfare mom, started the group in
1994 shortly after she and her husband separated after 10 years of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a single parent with a son, living in Kansas, far from
her home in Temple, Texas, Anderson returned to school. ``I wanted
to become self-sufficient,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After earning a bachelor of science degree in sociology from
Kansas State University, Anderson took a job with the university
working with single parents and displaced homemakers.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to Fort Worth to be near her father, who was ill. A
supervisor at Cook Children's Medical Center encouraged her to get
her license in social work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to do something to help empower women,'' said
Anderson, who has since reconciled with her husband. ``I felt like
if I could do it, they could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of her own experiences on welfare, Anderson said, she
could motivate women to make the move from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   Since More Than Conquerors began in 1994, nearly 200 women have
received assistance through the organization's Support Network or
Success Boutique. The boutique provides free business suits to
women facing a Catch-22: They need appropriate clothes to get a
good job but cannot afford the clothes without a job.
</P>
<P>
   Women can also participate in Project SALES, (''Successfully
Activating Leadership and Employable Skills''), a professional
image and retail sales training program.
</P>
<P>
   The Support Network, Anderson said, helps participants overcome
a variety of obstacles, among them substance abuse and
dysfunctional family relationships.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, nearly a dozen women have gathered in a room at
J.A. Cavile Place, where the retail-training arm of the program is
held. They will hear from representatives from Mervyn's department
store and Kentucky Fried Chicken about the fine points of landing a
job.
</P>
<P>
   What do companies like these look for in prospective employees?
How important is experience? Appearance? What kind of benefits do
the companies offer? And most important, are they hiring?
</P>
<P>
   Jade Grasmeyer, who receives Aid for Families with Dependent
Children to help support her 6-year-old son, said she hopes to get
a managerial position in the retail business.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old single mother enrolled in the program in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to further my education and have better self-esteem,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bunch, who works as a data clerk and assistant dispatcher, said
that $7 an hour is the most she has ever earned, not nearly enough
to support her three children. Her husband is in prison, she said,
so public assistance has been as necessary as breathing.
</P>
<P>
   But with the help of More Than Conquerors, Bunch said, she
realizes she has more skills than she imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managing my three children, being able to make and keep
appointments are little things I never saw as strengths,'' she
said. ``Being able to grocery shop and budget your money is a
skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Because substance abuse has devastated her family and community,
Bunch said, her long-term goal is to become a drug and alcohol
counselor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen drugs destroy so many people, especially where I
live,'' she said. ``I want to educate people about addiction. Maybe
I can help empower someone else.'' .MDBO/.MDNM/ (Visit the

CREATIVE USE OF MUSIC ENLIVENS FILMS AT CANNES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France _ When the film festival here features as many
major directors taking their work in new directions as this year's
did, that's notable.
</P>
<P>
   The collection included a soulful action film by the master of
comedy of manners, Ang Lee, ``Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,''
which featured Chow Yun Fat brimming with physical grace and was
held together by an ethereal calm as its battlers soared through
the air. There was ``Nurse Betty,'' a comedy with a warm touch by
the director-provocateur Neil LaBute.
</P>
<P>
   And there were movies from three major filmmakers that tried to
expand the horizons of the musical: Lars Von Trier's ``Dancer in
the Dark,'' Wong Kar-wei's ``In the Mood for Love'' and Joel and
Ethan Coen's ``Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou?'' Two of those musical
departures, ``Dancer'' and ``Mood,' received major recognition from
the jury at the festival, which ended on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancer,'' which won the Palme d'Or and the best actress award
for its star, Bjork, in her acting debut, is a melodrama with
musical elements. For Von Trier, trying something new did not seem
to cause the slightest furrow in his brow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely sure I'm doing wonderful things,'' he said, a
nervous smile playing around the corners of his mouth. ``That's
because my mother always said I was doing wonderful things. Even
Napoleon's mother said: `No, no. You're tall!'''
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time that Von Trier has used musical scenes in a
film, and he disturbed some conventions of the form. Except for the
musical numbers that erupt from the imagination of Bjork's
character, the film has no music, not even an underscore. Such
music irritates him, he said, calling it cheap manipulation. ``I'm
cheating people in smarter ways,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancer'' had its first public showing here, and the movie, in
which Bjork plays Selma, a woman slowly going blind and working
several shifts to raise money for an operation that can save her
son's sight, left the audience sobbing. The film has plot gambits
that would have seemed shameless even in the silent era. Selma
plays the leading role in her small town's production of ``The
Sound of Music'' _ it's one of the few things that keeps her going
_ and she stars in big musical numbers in her imagination.
</P>
<P>
   This could be Von Trier's ``Pennies From Heaven,'' the BBC
series by Dennis Potter in which full-scale musical numbers
exploded in the characters' minds as a way of relieving the gloom
of their existence. But Von Trier said: ``I wasn't fond of
`Pennies.' I don't like making fun of genres, which maybe he was.''
</P>
<P>
   The character of Selma in ``Dancer'' carries on the tradition of
the suffering female protagonist. ``She loves Technicolor musicals
and human beings with flaws,'' Von Trier said. The decisions she
makes send her spiraling into tragedy. ``From a logical point of
view, the women have a choice,'' he added. ``From their point of
view, they don't have a choice. It's a very romantic thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Trier may have found his battles with Bjork neither romantic
nor logical. She submerged herself so deeply into the character
that she seemed to feel he was her torturer. The director said he
had feared that the strains would wreck his career and his
marriage. As a line goes in a song she sang with her old band, the
Sugarcubes: ``This wasn't supposed to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bjork is evidently as controlling and stubborn as he is, though
in ``Dancer'' she chose to play a character with no control, one
whose life contrasts with her own powerful and affirming pop music.
Perhaps the most striking thing about her speaking voice is how
similar it is to her singing.
</P>
<P>
   The picture introduces Selma and others rehearsing ``My Favorite
Things.'' It's a moving, rough-hewn opening that will feel like a
new Bjork demo to her fans. To the uninitiated it will be a
riveting insight into Selma's fervor. Von Trier has an instinct for
drawing audiences into his work.
</P>
<P>
   NO MONOLOGUES
</P>
<P>
   For LaBute the Cannes festival provided a rare chance to present
a film that he hadn't written. ``Nurse Betty'' received the writing
award for its script by John C. Richards. ``I read it and thought
it was more charming than anything I'd write,'' the director said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Betty'' is a road comedy starring Renee Zellweger as a
traumatized woman who believes she's a character from her favorite
soap opera and who heads west to meet the show's star, played by
Greg Kinnear, while being followed by a pair of hit men, played by
Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. ``This movie has the first girl
character in one of my movies who's not a victim, and maybe that's
because I didn't write it,'' LaBute continued. ``I liked that
aspect and didn't want to muddy the waters by getting my hands in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   This film has a thematic similarity to LaBute's ``In the Company
of Men'' and ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' in that the
protagonist is looking to change her life and intent on finding
what she needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true, everyone is searching for an ideal in this one,''
he said. ``It's something I see in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute said he was intrigued by the script because the central
character, Betty, was an innocent who survived because of her
purity, embodied by Zellweger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie really is so much Renee,'' he said. ``I know it's a
cliche, but that is who she is. But it's also so much Morgan, who
tests you, and in the best way, I think. He doesn't suffer fools,
and I don't either.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute said he had felt he needed to take on someone else's
material for a change. ``Directing a script I didn't write is less
emotional and more analytical for me,'' he added. ``I was much more
able to look at it and see what worked. There are no monologues in
this movie, and I'm known for that in my work. I checked that
impulse and cut scenes that had them. I like movies that push
buttons, and `Nurse Betty' will push a set of different ones: `Is
he a sell-out?' Oh, it's nice. Maybe I was wrong about him.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A NEW GRAMMAR
</P>
<P>
   ``Betty'' wasn't the only likable and noteworthy comedy here.
The director Roy Andersson's stylized, eccentric and funny ``Songs
From the Second Floor'' won one of two Jury Prizes. This deadpan
comedy is built around beautifully composed frames captured by a
stationary camera: It's a series of bleak but comic vignettes about
faith and alienation that might have been conceived by Gary Larson,
creator of the ``Far Side'' newspaper cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the major moments at the festival came from directors
engaging in sudden twists and turns. There were a number of
noteworthy Iranian films, including ``Blackboard,'' which won the
other Jury Prize. This drama, with flickers of comedy and startling
flashes of violence, is the work of a young director, Samira
Makhmalbaf.
</P>
<P>
   There were several impressive sophomore efforts: ``Requiem for a
Dream,'' adapted from Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel by Darren Aronofsky,
and ``The Yards,'' directed by James Gray with a stately moodiness
and a socialist punch right out of Visconti.
</P>
<P>
   And there was ``In the Mood for Love,'' the director Wong
Kar-wai's gorgeous romantic drama, which won the best actor prize
for its star, Tony Leung. Wong thinks with a camera and with each
film he seems to be inventing a new grammar for the medium. No one
can cut within a scene the way he can, using edits to express
shifts in feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Cannes had such an intriguing range of films that, by the final
night, when the awards were handed out, there was no consensus
about the Palme d'Or. People were divided between ``Dancer,'' which
won the prize, and ``In the Mood for Love.'' Both films were highly
anticipated and made the biggest impact here. Both, not
incidentally, wrung new twists from the use of music to delineate
the melancholy of the characters.
</P>
<P>
   The festival was proof that a director's vision can resuscitate
any genre. Already the buzz is that westerns will be the next to be
rescued, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

&HT;     VIEQUES RESIDENTS SEEK DAMAGES FROM NAVY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A lawyer representing residents of the Puerto Rican
island of Vieques said Wednesday his clients are seeking at least
$40 million in damages from the Navy, which has used the island as
a target range for decades.
</P>
<P>
   John Arthur Eaves Jr., a lawyer from Jackson, Miss., said he is
filing more than 200 claims this week asking the Navy to repay
residents for years of bombings that the attorney alleges have
contributed to higher rates of cancer and other illnesses among
residents than among inhabitants of nearby islands.
</P>
<P>
   If the Navy does not agree to compensate the residents within
six months, Eaves said, his firm will file a lawsuit to recover
damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to Vieques, every family in some way has had to deal
with cancer,'' Eaves told a news conference in Washington. ``The
60-year bombings on Vieques are causing these people to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaves said he expects the U.S. government will pay his clients
between $200,000 and $15 million each in damages for lost health,
future medical monitoring and pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is working with Congress to provide
$40 million in economic development assistance to Vieques, plus
another $50 million if islanders approve a referendum to resume
live-fire training at the bombing range. Currently, the military is
limited to inert munitions in its training exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has used Vieques as a training ground since 1941,
firing live ammunition and dropping bombs on the eastern part of
the island and in the water along its coast.
</P>
<P>
   The 9,300 residents of Vieques live on about one-third of the
island, removed from the military site.
</P>
<P>
   Residents have long claimed that the bombings churn up dust
contaminated with toxins that are blown onto the inhabited portion
of the island.
</P>
<P>
   But the Navy says Vieques, to the east of the main island of
Puerto Rico, is the only viable site in the region that allows for
realistic combat training.
</P>
<P>
   However, Vieques was closed to the military in April 1999 after
a Marine-piloted plane dropped two bombs off target, killing a
civilian security guard employed by the Navy and wounding four
other civilians. The Navy reopened the range earlier this month to
renew military exercises after federal agents removed protesters
from the training site.
</P>
<P>
   Eaves urged the military to vacate the island permanently, but
said such a step would not be sufficient compensation for
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``These families have sacrificed more than their fair share of
freedom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eaves suggested the Navy had targeted Vieques because of it is
part of the commonwealth of Puerto Rico and not one of the 50
states and because its inhabitants are predominantly Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would the residents of Long Island, Miami Beach or Martha's
Vineyard tolerate this bombing?'' he asked. He charged that
``environmental racism'' is the only reason the Navy has chosen
Vieques.

</P>
<P>
   Two-year-old Milivy Adams Calderon and her parents, Jose and
Zulayko, joined Eaves and two physicians at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Zulayko said through a translator that his daughter was
born with cancerous tumors and has undergone several courses of
chemotherapy. He said she has already had a brain operation and
still needs another operation. Jose blamed the Navy for dangerous
conditions on the island that led to his daughter's illness.
</P>
<P>
   Eaves is seeking more than $15 million from the Navy for the
girl, including money for medical monitoring, personal injury and
``fear and fright.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carmen Ortiz-Roque, one of two physicians appearing with
Eaves, said residents of Vieques had higher cancer rates and
incidences of heart disease, liver disease and hypertension than
residents of mainland Puerto Rico and the nearby city of Fajardo.
Although she admitted the areas are not comparable in size, wealth
or quality of medical care, she said the differences in instances
of illness so large that ``this is not a chance event.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neftali Garcia-Martinez said he discovered larger amounts of
harmful substances such as lead in soil samples on the military
part of the island and in lowlands where sediments accumulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the evidence points to the Navy,'' he said.

 &HT;    Last season's winners and losers
 &HT;    By Kevin Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _
</P>
<P>
   TV WINNERS
</P>
<P>
   Who wants to be like Regis? Everyone!
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' : Huge ratings, Reege's GQ-ish
suits, easy questions. ABC's monster game show and the season's
most-watched program single-handedly saved ABC and made ``Is that
your final answer?'' the nation's hottest (and most tiresome) catch
phrase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm in the Middle'' : Not only did Fox's killer comedy
revive a stale genre, it made me howl in laughter each week. It
also earned my instant respect by daring not to play by the
standard sitcom rules. After all, how often do you see hairy, naked
dads getting shaved in front of their kids? Or asthmatic,
wheelchair-bound black kids playing . . . hockey?
</P>
<P>
   ``WWF Smackdown!'' : More than 7 million viewers tuned in to see
``The Rock &AMP; Co.'' each week. With a jaw-dropping combination of
sex, soap and in-your-face physicality, Smackdown! put the
directionless UPN on the network map.
</P>
<P>
   James Marsters: As the acid-tongued, blond-haired Spike on
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' the scene-chewing Marsters is often
sharper than one of Buffy's stakes. Cheers to the WB for beefing up
Spike's role.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Locklear: She's blonde, beautiful and surprisingly
funny. Who knew? As the Mayor's bumbling campaign manager on ``Spin
City,'' Locklear proved to be a dead-on comedienne.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of ``Friends'' : A serious pay raise at a staggering
$750,000 an episode for two years. Need I say more?
</P>
<P>
   TV LOSERS
</P>
<P>
   Why did anyone want to marry Rick?
</P>
<P>
   Rick Rockwell and Darva Conger: C'mon . . . is an explanation
really necessary? The ``stars'' of ``Who Wants To Marry A
Multi-Millionaire?'' made even reality TV programmers embarrassed.
And that's hard to do!
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Love Hewitt: Despite her nice impersonation of Audrey
Hepburn in a TV movie, ratings for Hewitt's dismal ``Time of Your
Life'' were smaller than Mini-Me. But Hewitt gets a second chance
when ``Time of Your Life'' _ ugh! _ returns June 14.
</P>
<P>
   WB: OK, so ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel'' are two of
TV's best shows. But this once rising network lost serious ground
to UPN _ UPN, for crying out loud!
</P>
<P>
   Teen shows: ``Freaks and Geeks,'' ``Wasteland, D.C.'' and
``Brutally Normal'' were booted. ``Felicity'' and ``Roswell ``
almost were, and ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Popular `` struggled. See
a trend here? TV shows should grow up and stay out of high schools.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of ``Falcone'' : Unfortunately, CBS' fine mob drama
fell victim to unfavorable comparisons to ``The Sopranos'' and the
network's questionable programming strategy. This show deserved a
better fate.
</P>
<P>
   Minority actors: I see white people. Once again, the networks
left actors of color woefully underrepresented on television. After
getting blasted by TV critics and the NAACP, producers of such
shows as ``The West Wing'' scrambled to add more black and Latino
actors to their casts.

   CHINA-TRADE (Washington) _ In one of the most significant and
hotly debated foreign policy decisions that Congress has faced, the
House voted Wednesday to grant China permanent normal trading
relations, handing President Clinton a major foreign policy
triumph. After an intense debate that encompassed human rights,
protection of American jobs and national security, the House voted
237-197 in favor of the bill. By Eric Schmitt and Joseph Kahn.

</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TRADE-ASSESS (Washington) _ With his narrow victory
Wednesday on trade with China, President Clinton has finally
defined his imprint on U.S. foreign policy: As the president who
conducted the post-Cold War experiment of using American economic
power to foster political change among America's neighbors and its
potential adversaries. It is a path he set out on in 1993, when 10
months into his presidency he defied his own party and pushed
through the North American Free Trade agreement with Mexico and
Canada. A news analysis by David E. Sanger.

<P>
   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST (Washington) _ The federal judge trying the
Microsoft antitrust case raised serious questions about the
government's plan to break up the company during a court hearing
Wednesday, but seemed to be suggesting that he did not think the
plan went far enough. By Joel Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   LEBANON-SCENE (Marjayoun, Lebanon) _ This hillside Christian
village, with its church spires and sweets shops, was the
picturesque military center of the Israeli occupation of southern
Lebanon for two decades. Before noon Wednesday, the morning after
the occupation zone prematurely collapsed, its stores were
shuttered and its cobblestone streets nearly empty but for two
young men with a clipboard. By Deborah Sontag.

</P>
<P>
   REFORM-PARTY (Tucson, Ariz.) _ The growing likelihood that Pat
Buchanan will become the presidential nominee of the Reform Party
is producing a backlash from some party members and leaders around
the country. Efforts are under way to derail him, and even those
who recognize the inevitability of it all wonder what the party
will look like in the future. Some want Ross Perot to run again,
although that appears unlikely; some like Ralph Nader, and some
think the party should have no nominee at all this year. By Michael
Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-PINOCHET (Lima, Peru) _ A Chilean appeals court has
stripped the immunity of retired Gen. Augusto Pinochet, removing an
important obstacle to his possible trial on charges that he was
involved in the kidnapping, murder and torture of thousands during
his 17 years as Chile's dictator. The decision is subject to a
Supreme Court reversal and it could take years of legal wrangling
before any trial could begin. The decision, voted in private
Tuesday but leaked to the local media, demonstrates that Chile's
courts are willing to take independent stands. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   NY-SCHOOLS-TURNOVER (New York) _ Shante Proctor, a fifth-grader
at PS 190, has had four teachers this year. In four years, her
school has had three principals. Her classmates have also changed
regularly. Poverty _ in the guise of evictions, job changes,
assignment to homeless shelters _ has kept them on the move. For
every 10 students at PS 190 who started with Shante in September,
four were gone by June. Low-performing public schools are often
criticized for flabby curriculums, petty politics and lack of
rigor. PS 190 is no exception. But mobility has become a growing
concern for school systems across the country as housing costs
rise, families immigrate or change neighborhoods, and teachers
leave the profession or shift schools. By Lynette Holloway.

</P>
<P>
   He's met with Tony Blair and shaken hands with the queen. Ted
Turner has come to pay his respects, and so did Sandy Berger:
Vladimir Putin, the new Russian president, even greeted Berger by
speaking of the ``warm, friendly, personal, and business
relations'' they had enjoyed when both were heads of their
respective countries' national security councils.
</P>
<P>
   Berger responded in kind. Putin, he replied (joking, one
assumes), had become a ``model for all national security
advisers.''
</P>
<P>
   The joviality will doubtless continue when President Clinton
himself arrives in Moscow at the end of next week _ and no wonder.
Although an official economic plan hasn't been published yet, words
like ``tax reform'' and ``foreign trade'' have lately been tripping
blithely off the president's tongue.
</P>
<P>
   His new prime minister, Alexander Kasyanov, is known in the West
as a competent debt negotiator. His new trade minister, German
Gref, is a self-confessed economic liberal. Oil prices are up, and
Western bankers in Moscow have been looking cheerier than they have
in quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   Skip the upbeat headlines and read the stories buried deep
inside the ``world news'' sections, however, and you will see why
not everybody shares this optimism. In the past two weeks alone,
masked Russian ``tax police'' wielding machine guns have raided the
offices of the MOST group, the one media company whose newspapers
and TV stations have not wholeheartedly supported the president.
</P>
<P>
   A local Moscow TV station controlled by the mayor of Moscow,
another cowed Putin opponent, looks set to be shut down, as does
one of the main Internet servers. There has been rumbling about the
revoking of licenses to foreign broadcasters who portray Russia,
and especially its war in Chechnya, in a less than favorable light.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, Putin declared himself ready to fire elected
provincial governors and dissolve regional parliaments if they fail
to toe Moscow's line.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those who don't care much about press freedom or the
sanctity of local government (and, to be honest, most Western
bankers don't) there are other worries. A few weeks ago, Russia's
most prominent business newspaper, Kommersant, published an
authentic-looking document that it claimed was the president's real
economic program: This version advocated greater control over
foreign exchange, greater control over imports and exports, greater
control, even, over foreign food aid, which had, in the words of
one commentator, allowed the Americans to ``gather information
about our agriculture and our regions,'' the better to ``keep
Russian agriculture on a level which would allow the United States
to expand into our food markets.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Russia's president appears to be zigzagging back and
forth between authoritarianism and liberalism, that is hardly an
accident: Putin has in fact hired two very distinct teams of
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   One group is best described as ex-KGB thugs, among them Viktor
Cherkyesov, the man who was formerly in charge of arresting
dissidents in St. Petersburg, Putin's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   The other group consists of what the Russians call ``young
reformers'' of the type admired abroad and despised at home.
</P>
<P>
   The two have neatly divided up the ruling of Russia: Shutting
down newspapers is the work of the former group, while chatting up
Ted Turner is the task of latter.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow analysts speculate endlessly as to which group represents
the ``real'' Putin: Either the thugs are being forced upon the
well-meaning, mild-mannered president by powerful ``interest
groups,'' or the reformers are a facade to cover up the real
thuggery. Just as likely, however, is that Putin simply intends to
keep both sets of policies running indefinitely, either because he
doesn't see the contradictions _ nobody ever said the man is a
genius _ or because he thinks that this clumsy method is the best
way to do a General Pinochet imitation, running an authoritarian
regime and a free-market economy.
</P>
<P>
   If that is his aim, he'll have plenty of support. If those
lending money to Third World basket cases invariably come down with
cases of ``donor fatigue,'' those dealing with Russia are now
suffering a distinct case of ``democracy fatigue.'' A senior Moscow
diplomat told a friend of mine, approvingly, that he fully expected
Putin's regime to resemble Ataturk's ``educative dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin will find plenty of people in the West _ not only bankers
but ambassadors, politicians, even presidents _ who prefer
``stability'' to genuine reform, however short-lived that stability
may turn out to be.

ECONOMIC SCENE: RETHINKING THE ECONOMICS OF IMMIGRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor of Economics and
Public Affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of
Economic Perspectives.) 
 By ALAN B. KRUEGER

<P>
   The inscription on the Statue of Liberty is quietly being
rewritten: ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free; I'll also take your skilled employees
under the temporary visa program, H-1B.''
</P>
<P>
   The H-1B visa was established in 1990 to permit foreigners with
a college degree or higher to work in the United States for a
renewable three-year term for employers who petition on their
behalf. In 1998, the program was expanded to allow 115,000 workers,
up from 65,000, to enter the United States in fiscal years 1999 and
2000. Demand for H-1B visas by employers is high, particularly
among high-technology companies. This year the limit was reached
just six months into the year. President Clinton and many members
of Congress would like to increase the limit to 200,000 a year the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of temporary work visas should be evaluated in the
context of overall immigration policy. But immigration reform,
replacing Social Security, has become the new third rail of
American politics. So instead of tackling the issue head on,
Washington has come to rely on temporary work visas as a substitute
for addressing the economic and social shortcomings of current
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is in the midst of a second great migration.
The first occurred between 1880 and 1924, when 26 million
immigrants arrived on our shores. The second began in the late
1970s: more immigrants have come to the United States since 1980
than in the previous 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   Workers admitted under the H-1B program are not immigrants, but
experts in the field expect that most of them will end up staying
permanently in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to workers with H-1B visas, hundreds of thousands of
other foreigners are admitted to work temporarily in the United
States under visa categories covering intracompany transfers,
individuals with extraordinary ability, registered nurses and
nonprofit religious organizations. A fast-growing category is the
NAFTA TN visa, which offers an unlimited number of temporary visas
for professional workers from Canada and soon Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In a new book, ``Heaven's Door,'' George Borjas, a Harvard
economist, proposes that the United States adopt a Canadian-style
point system, in which applicants for visas are assigned points on
the basis of characteristics like their ability to speak English,
work-force skills, family ties, refugee status and ethnic
diversity. Those whose total points exceed a certain threshold
would be admitted. Going even further, Borjas favors setting the
threshold so that the number of immigrants entering the United
States falls from about 900,000 to about 500,000 a year. The total
number can be debated. If nothing else, this policy would be
transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Who should become an American? The question is profound,
involving more than economics alone. But economic considerations
obviously play a role.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, the economics of immigration is straightforward.
If more workers are admitted to the country _ as permanent
immigrants or temporary workers _ the earnings of native American
workers competing with them for jobs should fall. At the same time,
they price of goods and services they produce should decline _ and
the profits of businesses should rise.
</P>
<P>
   The winners are employers, consumers and the immigrants
themselves. The losers are workers in the same job market as
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Economic research has not been able to estimate with any
confidence the wage decline for native workers that results from
immigration. Much research finds no effect. This suggests to me
that any effect is likely to be small.
</P>
<P>
   Borjas' evidence indicates that the skills of legal and illegal
immigrants have slipped relative to that of native Americans since
the 1970s. A third of employed male immigrants are high school
dropouts. At the same time, the labor market increasingly demands
more high-skilled workers, as suggested by the long-term rise in
the number of workers with college degrees and their sharply
increased pay compared with that of those with high school degrees.
Therefore, it would be economically beneficial to admit relatively
more highly skilled permanent immigrants _ not to mention that
skilled immigrants are less likely to take advantage of the safety
net.
</P>
<P>
   If immigration reform is off the table, it makes economic sense
to increase the number of skilled immigrants by issuing H-1B visas
_ through what might be called heaven's backdoor. Yet economic
principles also suggest that the playing field between H-1B workers
and the rest of the work force should be leveled.
</P>
<P>
   American workers are protected from exploitation on the job by
three defenses: exit, voice and regulation. Exit entails the
ability to move to a better job if one becomes available; voice
results from representation by labor unions and other
organizations; and regulation is a labyrinth of standards enforced
by government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   These protections are deficient for H-1B workers.
</P>
<P>
   They cannot easily switch jobs because they must find another
employer willing to petition the Immigration and Naturalization
Service on their behalf. Even if they manage to do that, they must
wait months for a reply. H-1B workers are also unusually beholden
to their employers, the ones who can sponsor them for permanent
immigrant status.
</P>
<P>
   They lack voice because no organization effectively represents
them.
</P>
<P>
   And they have less regulatory protection than other workers
because the Labor Department is precluded from investigating their
conditions of employment unless a complaint is filed.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence suggests H-1B visa holders suffer as a consequence.
Even though 70 percent of H-1B workers are in well-paid
computer-related and engineering fields, a 1996 report by the Labor
Department's inspector general found that 19 percent of them are
paid less than the salary they were promised.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to increase the number of H-1B visas should provide
protection from exploitation. This also would help native workers
and improve economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   What could be done? Permit H-1B workers to change jobs freely
after they are admitted to the country. Authorize the Labor
Department to conduct random investigations of their employment
conditions. Finally, require the immigration service to process
applications for permanent, employment-based immigration more
quickly, which would reduce the need for H-1B visas in the first
place.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Coffee drinkers who rely on a regular caffeine shot
to get them through the day may also be protecting their brains
from the effects of premature aging.
</P>
<P>
   Research indicates that the world's most popular beverage not
only provides a temporary boost to mental alertness but may also
help prevent brain degeneration.
</P>
<P>
   After a number of studies suggesting that coffee increases the
risk of heart attacks, the new findings are the first to suggest it
has long-term beneficial effects.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 8,000 middle-aged Japanese-American men in Honolulu
who have been followed for 30 years found those who consumed most
caffeine had the lowest incidence of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Men who drank most coffee _ equivalent to four to five ordinary
cups or two large ones a day _ had one-fifth of the risk of
Parkinson's than those who drank none. A similar relationship was
found for men who consumed caffeine from other sources, including
cola, chocolate and tea.
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine is known to improve short-term memory, boost muscle
power and increase alertness. The link between coffee and heart
disease has been shown but is nothing to do with the caffeine it
contains. Caffeine is broadly thought to be safe but there is
debate about how much is too much and whether there is a real risk
of caffeine addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say that for most people up to 400mg a day of caffeine _
equivalent to four cups of fresh coffee or six of instant _ is
unlikely to cause side-effects. Above that the risk of such
symptoms as anxiety, trembling and headache increases but tolerance
varies widely.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious, nervy people are most strongly affected and some, such
as pregnant women, are slower to metabolize the drug, so that with
repeated doses blood levels rise. Doctors say that to describe
those who regularly consume more than 400mg a day as addicted is an
abuse of the term.
</P>
<P>
   In the new study, published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, researchers from the Department of Veterans
Affairs who analyzed data from the 8,000 men enrolled in the
Honolulu Heart program in the mid-1960s found that by the mid-1990s
102 had Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   It was found that the risk of Parkinson's declined consistently
with increasing quantities of coffee or other caffeine-containing
beverages. ``It appears caffeine may be the constituent responsible
for the observed reduction in Parkinson's disease,'' the authors
say.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers offer two possible explanations for their
findings. The first is that men who drank little or no coffee may
have had an intolerance to caffeine that could be related to a
higher propensity to develop Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The second explanation is that ``regular exposure to caffeine
over many years might counteract the aging-related degenerative
processes that cause loss of dopamine neurons, the brain pathology
associated with Parkinson's disease.'' &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ People seeking a non-drug alternative to
antidepressants should visit their fishmonger, an expert on brain
development said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have long known the benefits of oily fish in the fight
against heart disease but it is just as vital as a brain food,''
Professor Michael Crawford, the director of the Institute of Brain
Chemistry and Human Nutrition at North London University, England,
said.
</P>
<P>
   The world is in the grip of a global epidemic of depression,
which has followed the global epidemic of heart disease, and could
be linked to eating less seafood than previously, Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   He was commenting on a survey commissioned by the British Trout
Association, which shows that one-fifth of the population eat no
oily fish, rising to one-third of those aged 15 to 24. Most people
eat half the amount they would have eaten 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said that the findings were ``extremely worrying.''
Oily fish, such as sardines, mackerel, trout, tuna and salmon,
contain Omega-3 fatty acids, vital for a healthy brain and nervous
system.
</P>
<P>
   A World Health Organization report last year identified
depression as the number one cause of disability in the U.S. and
the third biggest, behind heart disease and strokes, in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In cutting down on fatty foods against heart disease, people
``have got rid of the thing which really protects the brain... oily
fish and seafood,'' Crawford said. &QL;

 MUSICIANS TAKE COPYRIGHT ISSUE TO CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A brief amendment to the copyright law has pitted musicians
against recording companies over the question of who owns
recordings: the companies that finance and market them or the
musicians who perform them?
</P>
<P>
   At stake is control over recordings beginning 35 years after
recordings were first released, when many of them are still
extremely valuable. The debate is highly technical, but it has
inflamed passions and turned musicians into political organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians want the copyright law changed to designate them
the legal authors of their recordings. With this designation they
would be able to reclaim the rights they often granted to recording
companies when they were young and inexperienced and take control
of assets that have generated billions of dollars for those
companies. They could sell the rights to new bidders or exploit
them themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But if the recording companies are held to be the authors _ as
they are under the amendment that was enacted last year _ they will
retain those rights for the full length of the copyright, 95 years.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, which was advocated by recording companies, was
inserted without debate into an unrelated bill in Congress last
November. It has spurred protests by musicians and organizations
like the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which
presents the Grammy Awards; the American Federation of Musicians;
the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which
represents vocalists; and AmSong, a songwriters' organization. A
House subcommittee is to hold hearings on the issue Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The four-line amendment explicitly added sound recordings as a
category of copyrighted materials that can be considered ``work
made for hire'' under the 1976 Federal Copyright Act. To come under
this category, the work would have to be defined that way in
musicians' contracts with recording companies. Although such
language often has been included in contracts _ usually in cases
when fledgling musicians have little bargaining power _ many
musicians and their lawyers have questioned whether the
work-for-hire provisions were ever valid under the copyright law.
The amendment ends those questions.
</P>
<P>
   Works for hire are collective works, like movies or atlases,
that are commissioned by studios or publishers as employers; the
employers have the rights of authors for copyright purposes. Most
recordings are also collaborations; they involve producers,
engineers, packagers and backup musicians as well as the performer
whose name is on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Recording companies had written into typical contracts that
sound recordings are works for hire, commissioned by the company or
made by performers and technicians hired as employees. Otherwise,
they say, contributors to a recording might claim joint authorship
and create a chaos when the copyright reverts to its listed authors
in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   For contracts dated Jan. 1, 1978, the copyright act promised
authors a second chance by allowing them to reclaim their
copyrights after 35 years by exercising what the law calls a
termination right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the new law,'' Marybeth Peters, the register of
copyrights at the U.S. Copyright Office, told the industry
publication Billboard recently, ``artists absolutely had the right
to reclaim them.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters said that with the change in law, ``U.S. recording
artists are the most unprotected segment of the entire world of
copyright.''
</P>
<P>
   But the recording companies' trade group, the Recording Industry
Association of America, contends that the amendment is simply a
clarification of the 1976 copyright bill, which, they say, covered
recordings under the wording ``collective works'' and
``compilations.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Baumgarten, who helped draft the 1976 law, served as general
counsel for the Copyright Office and has represented the industry
association on other matters, said: ``This is not a major change in
the way things have been since 1976. The typical sound recording,
an album, fits precisely the category of collective work, and if
the artist signs a contract acknowledging that it should be treated
as a work for hire, that's the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Goldstein, a professor at Stanford Law School and the
author of ``Copyright,'' a basic legal text (Aspen Law and
Business), supported this view. ``I don't know that the second
chance was there to begin with, given the way Congress designed
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But many musicians and their lawyers disagree. ``This is a
seismic shift in the copyright law,'' said Michael Greene,
president of the academy of recording arts and sciences. ``You
don't do this in the dead of night without participation from the
people who are writing the songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Many musicians' lawyers had assumed that because sound
recordings were not specifically named as a category of works for
hire, performers still retained the rights of authorship even if
they signed contracts that said otherwise. In the event of a
dispute, they expected that a court would resolve the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new amendment, if a musician has agreed to
work-for-hire status in a contract, the recording company becomes
the author. The author of, for example, the next Sheryl Crow album
would be not Crow but Interscope Records. Crow is scheduled to
testify at Thursday's hearing before the Judiciary Committee's
Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Internet has made the music business even more
litigious than usual. In battles with online music companies, the
industry association has presented itself as an advocate for
musicians. But the copyright change points to where the interests
of recording companies and musicians diverge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public needs to understand that the RIAA does not and
never has represented recording artists,'' said the songwriter and
musician Don Henley, referring to the recording industry
association. He is a founder of the Artists' Coalition, a
musicians' trade group galvanized by the copyright change.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment was placed in the unrelated Satellite Home Viewer
Improvement Act in response to an industry request by a staff
lawyer for the House subcommittee. It was attached to an omnibus
spending bill that was passed last November.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Rosen, president of the recording industry association,
conceded that the way that the change was adopted had angered
musicians. ``I am no longer willing to defend the process,'' she
said. ``The issue is about where we go from here on the substance.
People in the record industry have always believed that sound
recordings were eligible as works for hire. That's why this
amendment did not seem outrageous to them. It's not about stealing
authorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1976 copyright law, rights to recordings would begin
to revert in 2013. It is hard to predict how broadly the recording
companies would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 article for ``Entertainment, Publishing and the Arts
Handbook'' (West Group), by Randy S. Frisch and Matthew J. Fortnow,
called the situation a ``time bomb'' for recording companies. It
pointed out that for the labels, sales of older recordings are more
profitable than sales of new releases, since costs have been
recouped and older contracts have lower royalty rates.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment sets out to defuse the time bomb. If the
recordings are works for hire, author's rights would continue to
belong to the recording company for the full term of the copyright:
95 years for a work for hire or 70 years after the author's death.
Depending on whether the amendment is considered a technical or
substantive change _ a matter still undecided _ it will either
cover recordings made after 1978 or since its passage last year.
</P>
<P>
   Crow said that her contract called her recordings works for
hire. But she does not consider herself an employee commissioned by
the recording company. ``As an artist,'' she said, ``I author the
material, I hire my musicians, I book the studio time, I hire my
engineer, I compose the work, I hand it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., chairman of the Subcommittee on
Courts and Intellectual Property, who scheduled Thursday's
hearings, said that all of the conference members _ Democrat and
Republican _ had approved the amendment and that the process had
not been unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, it was my belief that opponents of the
work-for-hire language were overreacting,'' Coble said. ``I may be
wrong; maybe they're not overreacting. I'd like to hear from both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake Seiwert, a White House press spokesman, said that while the
Clinton administration was aware of the issue, it had not yet taken
a position.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians hope to see the provision repealed after the hearings.
``I'm sympathetic with everybody who's unhappy with this,'' Rosen
of the industry association said. ``I'm looking for a way out, but
I'm not sure what that is right now. It would be nice to find a way
not to have people feel so cheated.''

OLDER, HAPPIER DON HENLEY HAS LIGHTENED UP _ JUST A TAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Henley's sincerity was never in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was his determination: The Texas native helped make the
Eagles rock icons and then released three solo records that became
synonymous with radio-friendly, mature pop-rock.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was his talent questioned: There's no denying the care and
craftsmanship that went into songs such as ``The Heart of the
Matter, The End of the Innocence'' or ``The Boys of Summer'' _ or
all those Eagles hits he co-wrote, usually with Glenn Frey.
</P>
<P>
   And there was his commitment to worthy projects: He tirelessly
spearheaded the successful efforts to save Walden Woods, raising
millions through benefit shows and the sales generated by ``Common
Thread: The Songs of the Eagles.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the questions that begged to be asked where Henley is
concerned is: Would he ever just lighten up? Could he?
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, after all, were adept at exposing the ravages of
excess that loomed behind the sun-kissed California good times and
enormous wealth that came with success. Be careful what you wish
for, say their most famous songs, ``Hotel California'' and ``Life
in the Fast Lane,'' because it'll eat you alive if you get it.
</P>
<P>
   And while he could have been basking in his success in the late
'70s, Henley was hunkered down in a recording studio for several
years, giving himself an ulcer while finishing the band's final
studio LP, the tired, strained ``The Long Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley's solo career has made clear that he was largely
responsible for the Eagles' often-dour outlook. With the release of
three solo albums between 1982 and 1989, Henley added a
synthesized, bulked-up, often dance-ready sheen to his tales of
failed relationships and the ennui of aging '70s partyers and
dropped in some pointed references to Ronald Reagan and the
troubles in Central America. Presto! Here was a catalog of smart,
hummable, politically correct music that people in their 30s could
relate to, pop that refused to be dumbed down.
</P>
<P>
   Right down to his trademark style of wearing a lumberjack shirt
loose over a tucked-in T-shirt, Henley became something of an icon
for people picking their way through the realities of growing up
wild in the '70s and trying to become useful _ if still cool _
adults in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   No, Don Henley will never be Mr. Happy-Go-Lucky, and those
looking for everything's-great tunes should look elsewhere than his
new CD, ``Inside Job,'' his first since 1989's ``The End of the
Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this a surprise? No. And Henley knows it. The CD's leitmotif
is ``Everything Is Different Now,'' which details why there's a
(relatively) sunnier outlook on ``Inside:'' Henley's marriage in
May 1995 to his Dallas girlfriend, Sharon Summerall.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, ``Inside'' is the most subdued CD he's ever done.
There are a few danceable tracks _ most notably the opener,
``Nobody Else in the World but You'' _ but many more quieter songs;
one, the countryish ``For My Wedding'' is destined to be played at
wedding receptions from now until, probably, the end of time.
</P>
<P>
   But back to ``Everything.'' The song opens with the lines ``I
hate to tell you this, but I'm very, very happy/And I know that's
not what you'd expect from me at all.'' The catch is, Henley
delivers those lines in a low, almost sneering near-whisper; he
makes the best news he's had in more than a decade sound like he's
daring us to step outside and just try to kick his behind.
</P>
<P>
   Don Henley doesn't trust happiness or easy answers and doesn't
think we should, either. The closest thing to sheer fun on
``Inside'' is ``They're Not Here, They're Not Coming,'' a catchy
little tune whose theme is that aliens aren't going to help us
humans out until we clean up our own mess.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when pop music from 'N Sync to Eminem to Britney to
Christina to Korn caters almost exclusively to people 25 and under
_ often way under _ it will be interesting to see how ``Inside
Job'' fares. After all, critics can sing the praises of mature
singer/songwriters such as Randy Newman, Richard Thompson and Tom
Waits all day, but they don't sell records. Not many, anyhow.
Henley has a leg up on them in terms of pop success and mass name
recognition, but as ``Inside'' hits the shelves there are only two
other solo male artists in the ``Billboard'' Top 30: One is Carlos
Santana, and the other is Dr. Dre.
</P>
<P>
   Henley would seem not to care. Perhaps because he's already very
rich, or perhaps because he feels no need to prove himself again,
``Inside'' makes no concessions to the current rock marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary. The title track, ``Workin' It'' and ``Nobody
Else in the World but You'' look askance at the very
me-me-me/blink-and-you-miss-it culture of chattering cellphones and
surface beauty and on-and-gone pop stardom. Henley sees much of the
populace as disconnected from one other, obsessed with how much can
be bought, never content, unable to sustain anything for longer
than a few minutes, spinning our wheels as America's best days (and
ours as individuals) fade.
</P>
<P>
   All three songs are built on the idea that people are being
force-fed things that are bad for them, that we've become far too
sheeplike. Like Patti Smith on her recent ``Gung Ho,'' Henley rails
against how far we've come to accept letting other people make our
decisions for us.
</P>
<P>
   This is not exactly the kind of material that will fit easily
between ``Oops! ... I Did It Again'' and that thong song. And to be
sure, ``Inside Job'' _ although intelligent, faultlessly
constructed and passionately performed _ has moments when it feels
more stern than hopeful. One or two more upbeat songs would have
done wonders, even something with the nasty aftertaste of a ``Get
Over It'' or ``All She Wants to Do Is Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there's a pleasing, settled maturity of outlook at
work here, one that makes sense if you're growing older and coming
out of your own wild days and content in a long-lasting
relationship. The CD's final song, ``My Thanksgiving,'' winds the
record down beautifully. It's a wonderfully simple song that
celebrates self-knowledge and appreciating each day _ and
recognizing that it's the good and bad together that give a person
character and point of view.
</P>
<P>
   This may be a hard sell to a 20-year-old, but for all of us who
decided to step back from the edge before our bad habits killed us
and who don't equate growing older with a terminal disease,
``Inside Job'' is a record that provides a certain measure of
comfort. As Carl Perkins once said, if there weren't any rocks in
the river, the water wouldn't have no song.

   MOSCOW _ Early in the U.S. presidential campaign, Vice President
Al Gore's attempt to follow President Bill Clinton into the White
House was almost capsized by allegations that he had turned a blind
eye to corruption in Russia despite frequent contact with that
country's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was vulnerable because between 1993 and 1998
he had taken a leading role in formulating U.S. policy towards
Russia as chairman of a joint commission on relations between the
countries. The former Russian prime minister, Victor Chernomyrdin,
was joint chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had boosted the commission as evidence that he was a
serious international statesman and more than a decorative figure
in the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   The claim blew up in his face last year when critics asked why,
if he knew so much about Russia, he only learned from the
newspapers about the scandal over the laundering of $10 billion in
Russian money through the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the vice president over the Chernomyrdin-Gore
commission missed the real target, say sources in Moscow; he was
telling the truth when he said he knew a great deal about Russia.
</P>
<P>
   He could not publicly explain, however, that his knowledge
stemmed from the extraordinary relationship between his father,
Senator Al Gore, Sr., and Armand Hammer, the American
multimillionaire who, after meeting Lenin, became the Soviet
Union's first foreign investor in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer also served, according to secret Soviet documents since
released, as the conduit for laundering money to Soviet
intelligence operations and Communist parties abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American press missed the point over the Gore-Chernomyrdin
scandal,'' a diplomat in Moscow said last week. ``Gore had access
to the Soviet and then the Russian leadership long before he met
Chernomyrdin because of his father's links to Hammer and Hammer's
high-level contacts in the Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is often presented as a wooden and somewhat
simpleminded clone of Clinton. In fact his political background is
far more interesting and complex.
</P>
<P>
   His political career developed out of that of his father,
Senator Al Gore, Sr. of Tennessee, who gave up his position in 1971
to become head of the coal division of Hammer's oil company,
Occidental Petroleum. His annual salary was $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The link between Hammer and Gore, Sr. was intimate and went back
many years to when he was a congressman from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer once said, according to a U.S. source, that he had Gore
in his ``back pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1950, according to Edward Jay Epstein's superb
biography of Hammer, ``Dossier: The Secret History of Armand
Hammer'' (Random House, New York, 1996), he made Congressman Gore
his partner in a profitable cattle-breeding business.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer needed political protection. J. Edgar Hoover, even before
he became head of the FBI, had been tracking him as a possible
Soviet agent. For once Hoover was right, though that only became
clear in 1996 when the Russian government released secret archives
to Epstein. In Congress Al Gore, Sr. helped to keep the FBI off
Hammer's back.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer, who died in 1990, was notorious for advancing his
business interests by the systematic bribery of politicians and
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   He won an important oil concession for Occidental in Libya in
1967 by paying a larger bribe than anybody else. Senator Gore, Sr.
stood beside him on the podium at the oil field opening ceremony
the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, Jr., as freshman senator for Tennessee, inherited his
father's connection with Hammer and Occidental. In 1981, Hammer was
his guest at the inauguration of President Ronald Reagan, just as
he had been the guest of his father at five previous presidential
inaugurations.
</P>
<P>
   The link with Occidental was not broken by Hammer's death. As
recently as 1996 the vice president, according to reports, played
an important role in the privatizing of Elk Hills naval petroleum
reserve in California, later bought by Occidental for $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Unnoticed in the furor over the vice president's association
with Occidental in the U.S. was the degree to which he had also
benefited from Hammer's and Occidental's connections, before 1990,
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The two potential scandals now threatening his presidential
ambitions _ his relationship with Russian leaders and an
overly-close relationship with Occidental _ both originate in his
family's involvement in the business activities of Armand Hammer in
the Soviet Union and the U.S. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Hammer left Moscow in 1929. The Soviet Union no longer needed
him as a showcase foreign capitalist _ Lenin's motive for giving
him the concession to an asbestos mine in the Urals _ or to
secretly fund its agents and sympathizers abroad. He had briefly
owned a profitable pencil factory, but ultimately lost money in the
young Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   His one remaining concession was to act as agent for selling art
treasures now owned by the Soviet state. Even that was not quite
what it seemed. His first attempted sale was of a supposedly lost
Rembrandt painting called ``The Circumcision of Christ,'' which
turned out to be a recent fake.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer returned to Moscow in 1961. Senator Gore, Sr. arranged
semiofficial sponsorship of his trip by the U.S. Commerce
Department.
</P>
<P>
   He met Nikita Khrushchev, then Soviet leader, but it was 10
years later that he really began to do serious business once again
in the Soviet Union. His method of cultivating the Soviet hierarchy
differed little from his approach to political leaders in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow he became a friend of Yakaterina Furtseva, the
well-connected minister of culture, who soon after began to build a
luxurious holiday home for herself. She died in Moscow in 1974
after coming under investigation for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   A former associate of Hammer later testified in the U.S. that
she was paid a bribe of $100,000. During the same period Hammer
also arranged for $54,000 in laundered $100 bills to be paid to the
Nixon White House to help finance the Watergate cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the corruption of officials, the Soviet Union got more
than its money's worth from Hammer. He genuinely wanted to be seen
as an architect of detente.
</P>
<P>
   Before he died, aged 92, he poured enormous sums from
Occidental's coffers into hopelessly uneconomic projects in the
Soviet Union. A vast and ugly trade center, built by Hammer, still
rises beside the Moskva River in central Moscow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 350-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,175) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Soviet and later Russian leaders _ often the
same people _ favor Gore for the presidency as an associate of
their favorite capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Kortunov, president of the Moscow Science Foundation, and
an expert on relations with the U.S., says: ``The traditional
establishment likes the Gore family.'' On meeting Al Gore, Jr. in
Washington in 1985, he recalls being struck by the senator's
knowledge of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was right in saying he knows a lot about Russia, but he is
hardly likely to publicize the reason why. &QL;

GIFTS FOR THE GEN-X GRAD  
 (FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the day you've either been dreading or, perhaps, secretly
awaiting _ the day your baby graduates from high school and leaves
home or maybe comes home again after college. But whether you're
weeping with joy or despair, the gift you give is a great way of
showing your grad how well you understand his or her angst and
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Youth Intelligence recently asked more than 1,000 high school
and college seniors what they'd like for graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the most common requests were for the newest
technology, but there were still a few desired items that don't
need a manual. Here are some of the hottest gifts on the Gen-X hit
list.
</P>
<P>
   PORTABLE DVD PLAYER
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 requested gift (other than cash) was a portable DVD
player. Portable DVD players run on batteries and can go anywhere.
I've even seen people in New York City walking down the street
watching a movie. At a list price of approximately $1,000, this is
a costly purchase, but one I know your grad will love.
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL CAMERA
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to capturing graduation memories, today's seniors
won't settle for old-fashioned photos. More than 65 percent of the
respondents we surveyed wanted a digital camera.
</P>
<P>
   While most adults can't turn one on, the next generations can
have a picture cropped, re-colored and e-mailed to their classmates
before you say cheese. Plan to spend between $300 and $1,500 to
make your grad happy.
</P>
<P>
   MOBILE PHONE
</P>
<P>
   Whether your grad is switching apartments, traveling or just
avoiding the prying eyes of parents, Gen X considers the personal
phone a necessity. Although Nokia ruled the roost with ther sleek,
silver version, Motorola's V series, just out a few months and
priced at around $500, is gaining steam. Hipsters in Los Angeles
and New York carry them, and grads crave the streamlined size and
Internet access. Before you buy any phone, make sure that your
grad's phone carrier can use it _ though if a particular model is a
``must have,'' your grad may prefer to switch carriers.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTY KICKS (shoes, that is)
</P>
<P>
   Air Prestos are the coolest shoes in town. When I recently wore
a pair to a high school in Los Angeles, I was mobbed by teens who
wanted them, and one offered me twice the retail price ($85). Nike
is a trailblazer once again. These athletic shoes weigh almost
nothing (which makes them easy to pack) but provide support and
comfort (which suits the adventurous athlete). It doesn't hurt that
they come in a dazzling array of colors.
</P>
<P>
   CHARM BRACELET
</P>
<P>
   You might have purchased one of these for your daughter on her
fifth birthday and you'd swear she misplaced it by her seventh.
Chances are you'll soon see it emerge from the depths of her
dresser. Charm bracelets are back big time. Young people hunger for
some of the things that previously brought them comfort. In
addition, charms provide ultimate individualization. Each one tells
a story.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONALIZED STATIONERY
</P>
<P>
   In a world of technology and gadgets, instant messaging and
e-mails, young people are telling me that when it really counts,
they'd rather write a letter. Elaborate papers (translucent, in
unique shapes or with pressed flowers,) help them feel that they're
sending something special.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER STUFF
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later your grad will head to the beach and this is a
great way to buy a gift that isn't too expensive. Of course stylish
sunners won't settle for plain old beach towels (so pre-senior).
Instead, they have their eyes on a beach mat. The most coveted are
from a company called Inca (I saw some hot versions at Fred Segal
in Santa Monica a couple of weeks ago), which also have matching
straw bags. When it comes to sunglasses, you can't go wrong with
aviators. The coolest ones are from Stussy and Chloe, but XOXO
offers a less expensive version. The hippest lenses are burgundy,
but make sure they have strong UVA/UVB protection as often the
tinted lenses don't provide it.
</P>
<P>
   CYBER MONEY
</P>
<P>
   If you still don't know what to get, let your grad decide. Buy
some online money from CyberMoola.com, Flooze.com or
Internetcash.com. Each of these sites has multiple online stores
from which the recipient can choose.

   He won an important oil concession for Occidental in Libya in
1967 by paying a larger bribe than anybody else. Senator Gore, Sr.
stood beside him on the podium at the oil field opening ceremony
the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, Jr., as freshman senator for Tennessee, inherited his
father's connection with Hammer and Occidental. In 1981, Hammer was
his guest at the inauguration of President Ronald Reagan, just as
he had been the guest of his father at five previous presidential
inaugurations.
</P>
<P>
   The link with Occidental was not broken by Hammer's death. As
recently as 1996 the vice president, according to reports, played
an important role in the privatizing of Elk Hills naval petroleum
reserve in California, later bought by Occidental for $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Unnoticed in the furor over the vice president's association
with Occidental in the U.S. was the degree to which he had also
benefited from Hammer's and Occidental's connections, before 1990,
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The two potential scandals now threatening his presidential
ambitions _ his relationship with Russian leaders and an
overly-close relationship with Occidental _ both originate in his
family's involvement in the business activities of Armand Hammer in
the Soviet Union and the U.S. &QL;

   Hammer left Moscow in 1929. The Soviet Union no longer needed
him as a showcase foreign capitalist _ Lenin's motive for giving
him the concession to an asbestos mine in the Urals _ or to
secretly fund its agents and sympathizers abroad. He had briefly
owned a profitable pencil factory, but ultimately lost money in the
young Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   His one remaining concession was to act as agent for selling art
treasures now owned by the Soviet state. Even that was not quite
what it seemed. His first attempted sale was of a supposedly lost
Rembrandt painting called ``The Circumcision of Christ,'' which
turned out to be a recent fake.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer returned to Moscow in 1961. Senator Gore, Sr. arranged
semiofficial sponsorship of his trip by the U.S. Commerce
Department.
</P>
<P>
   He met Nikita Khrushchev, then Soviet leader, but it was 10
years later that he really began to do serious business once again
in the Soviet Union. His method of cultivating the Soviet hierarchy
differed little from his approach to political leaders in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow he became a friend of Yakaterina Furtseva, the
well-connected minister of culture, who soon after began to build a
luxurious holiday home for herself. She died in Moscow in 1974
after coming under investigation for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   A former associate of Hammer later testified in the U.S. that
she was paid a bribe of $100,000. During the same period Hammer
also arranged for $54,000 in laundered $100 bills to be paid to the
Nixon White House to help finance the Watergate cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the corruption of officials, the Soviet Union got more
than its money's worth from Hammer. He genuinely wanted to be seen
as an architect of detente.
</P>
<P>
   Before he died, aged 92, he poured enormous sums from
Occidental's coffers into hopelessly uneconomic projects in the
Soviet Union. A vast and ugly trade center, built by Hammer, still
rises beside the Moskva River in central Moscow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 350-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,175) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Soviet and later Russian leaders _ often the
same people _ favor Gore for the presidency as an associate of
their favorite capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Kortunov, president of the Moscow Science Foundation, and
an expert on relations with the U.S., says: ``The traditional
establishment likes the Gore family.'' On meeting Al Gore, Jr. in
Washington in 1985, he recalls being struck by the senator's
knowledge of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was right in saying he knows a lot about Russia, but he is
hardly likely to publicize the reason why. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _
</P>
<P>
   WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?
</P>
<P>
   Networks make dumb moves all the time . . . so do TV stars.
</P>
<P>
   NBC for ever allowing the no-talent Elle Macpherson to
guest-star on ``Friends.'' Stick to the runways, honey, where you
don't have to talk.
</P>
<P>
   CBS for bringing JonBenet's grisly murder to television in
``Perfect Murder, Perfect Town.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Williamson for leaving ``Dawson's Creek,'' a buzz-heavy,
well-acted drama, to create ``Wasteland,'' ABC's laughably
atrocious teen drama. I still have laughing fits whenever I think
about Rebecca Gayheart's horrendous Southern accent.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Priestly for believing he could cut it as a tough
detective in ``Homicide: The Movie.'' Get real. . . Mickey Mouse
could do better interrogations.
</P>
<P>
   ABC for its ill-advised attempt to recapture the magic that
existed between Mary Richards and Rhoda Morgenstern on ``The Mary
Tyler Moore Show.'' The TV movie ``Mary and Rhoda'' didn't make it
after all.
</P>
<P>
   ABC gets another for replacing the irreverent ``Sports Night ``
with the insipid sitcom ``Talk to Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Juliana Marguiles for turning down a reported $27 million to
stay on ``ER `` for two more seasons. Did she miss George Clooney
that much?
</P>
<P>
   Fox for canning the absurdly funny ``Family Guy.'' No other
animated comedy _ and that includes ``The Simpsons'' _ packed more
laugh-inducing yuks in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   THE GUEST IS A STAR!
</P>
<P>
   Some great one-shot appearances:
</P>
<P>
   Jane Alexander was wonderfully delicious on ``Law &AMP; Order'' and
``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit'' as an icy matriarch willing
to do anything to protect her family's good name. ``You come after
me, I'll crush you,'' she barked to McCoy. And, as you know, no one
barks at McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   As a hard-charging ratings consultant, William H. Macy gave the
sagging ``Sports Night `` a much-needed boost. ``I come in, I do my
job, I do it better than anybody else, I get out.'' Too bad he
didn't stay longer.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Coles was always daffy on ``Living Single.'' She was that _
and then some _ as a Roz's you-go-girl radio personality
replacement on ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   Old pro James Garner pumped new life into ``Chicago Hope'' as
the hospital's new CEO. While Garner managed to save the hospital,
unfortunately he couldn't resuscitate the series.
</P>
<P>
   One day Molly Shannon will get her own NBC comedy. She deserves
it after two hilarious stints as ``Will &AMP; Grace's'' wacky neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   BEST AND WORST, ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Best Drama: ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' continues to amuse,
frighten and delight with shocking regularity. From Willow's
lesbian relationship to downright scary voice-stealing demons, no
show reinvents itself better than Buffy.
</P>
<P>
   Best Actor in a Drama: Martin Sheen is so good as President
Bartlet on ``The West Wing,'' if he ran for real, he'd get my vote.
</P>
<P>
   Best Actress in a Drama: Sela Ward for making Lily Manning a
complex, full-bodied (no, I don't mean that literally) character on
``Once &AMP; Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Best Comedy: Sorry, ``Friends'' and ``Everybody Loves Raymond
,'' but no comedy made me lose it as often as ``Family Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Best Actor in a Comedy: ``Will &AMP; Grace's'' Sean Hayes is
considered a supporting actor, but his goofy antics (no one does
off-the-cuff Cher impressions better!) make him the star of NBC's
rib-tickling comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Best Actress in a Comedy: It's about time Patricia Heaton gets
the respect she deserves for her hilarious work as Ray's stressed
wife on ``Everybody Loves Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   Best TV Movie: If you didn't get teary-eyed watching a
wonderfully magnificent Jack Lemmon in ``Tuesdays With Morrie,''
check your pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Best Miniseries: HBO's ``The Corner'' was gritty, realistic and
unforgivingly graphic. A film about the harsh world of drug dealing
was made poignant and funny by making the characters achingly
human.
</P>
<P>
   Worst programming moves: Gosh, there were so many. Two stick
out, though. NBC's bone-headed decision to air ``Freaks and
Geeks,'' the charming teen comedy/drama on Saturday nights. I might
be wrong, but isn't that the night most teens go out? Also, the
WB's decision to move ``Felicity'' to Sundays almost killed the
series. Of course, the blame-shifting network attributed falling
ratings to Kerri Russell's shorter 'do.
</P>
<P>
   Best show to get canceled: ``Action,'' a right-on satirical take
on greedy Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Worst show not to get canceled: Someone on the Popular set must
have blackmail pictures of influential WB suits.
</P>
<P>
   Best show with no buzz: Did you know over 14 million viewers
watch ``JAG'' ? Do you know what ``JAG `` is?
</P>
<P>
   Best sexy star to lose a series: Ah, Gina Gershon. Those lips.
That smile. Those lips. Let's hope the naughty-looking ``Snoops ``
star gets another series real soon.
</P>
<P>
   Best surprise hit: ``Titus.'' Who would've thought that a show
about a boozing dad, an institutionalized mom and an unknown
standup comic would keep viewers in stitches?
</P>
<P>
   Best hot TV couple: The chemistry between ``Roswell's'' Max and
Liz was out of this world. Perhaps that had something to do with
him being an alien, and all. ``Once and Again's'' Rick and Lily
come in a close second.
</P>
<P>
   Worst TV couple: Two worms generate more heat than Greene and
Corday on ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Best naked rear scene: Women nationwide were no doubt screaming,
``Omigod!!!'' while ``NYPD Blue's'' hunky detective Baldwin rolled
around the sheets with a comely newspaper reporter (''Showgirls' ``
Elizabeth Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Best shocking season finale: ``
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files' ``season ender was a doozy. Scully's pregnant!
Mulder's abducted! Cancer Man's dead! Or is he?
</P>
<P>
   Worst miniseries moments: The boyish looking Guy Torry as a
hardened Black Panther in NBC's The '70s; Lisa Nicole Carson
running around an underground subway tunnel. . . . with makeup
intact in CBS' ``Aftershock: Earthquake in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Stupid TV movies that were fun to watch: The absurd Y2K made
little sense, but moved like a speeding bullet; ``Satan School For
Girls'' was one of those campy, guilty pleasure movies no one dare
admit they enjoyed _ even though we know many people did.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Early in the U.S. presidential campaign, Vice President
Al Gore's attempt to follow President Bill Clinton into the White
House was almost capsized by allegations that he had turned a blind
eye to corruption in Russia despite frequent contact with that
country's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was vulnerable because between 1993 and 1998
he had taken a leading role in formulating U.S. policy towards
Russia as chairman of a joint commission on relations between the
countries. The former Russian prime minister, Victor Chernomyrdin,
was joint chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had boosted the commission as evidence that he was a
serious international statesman and more than a decorative figure
in the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   The claim blew up in his face last year when critics asked why,
if he knew so much about Russia, he only learned from the
newspapers about the scandal over the laundering of $10 billion in
Russian money through the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the vice president over the Chernomyrdin-Gore
commission missed the real target, say sources in Moscow; he was
telling the truth when he said he knew a great deal about Russia.
</P>
<P>
   He could not publicly explain, however, that his knowledge
stemmed from the extraordinary relationship between his father,
Senator Al Gore, Sr., and Armand Hammer, the American
multimillionaire who, after meeting Lenin, became the Soviet
Union's first foreign investor in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer also served, according to secret Soviet documents since
released, as the conduit for laundering money to Soviet
intelligence operations and Communist parties abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American press missed the point over the Gore-Chernomyrdin
scandal,'' a diplomat in Moscow said last week. ``Gore had access
to the Soviet and then the Russian leadership long before he met
Chernomyrdin because of his father's links to Hammer and Hammer's
high-level contacts in the Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is often presented as a wooden and somewhat
simpleminded clone of Clinton. In fact his political background is
far more interesting and complex.
</P>
<P>
   His political career developed out of that of his father,
Senator Al Gore, Sr. of Tennessee, who gave up his position in 1971
to become head of the coal division of Hammer's oil company,
Occidental Petroleum. His annual salary was $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The link between Hammer and Gore, Sr. was intimate and went back
many years to when he was a congressman from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer once said, according to a U.S. source, that he had Gore
in his ``back pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1950, according to Edward Jay Epstein's superb
biography of Hammer, ``Dossier: The Secret History of Armand
Hammer'' (Random House, New York, 1996), he made Congressman Gore
his partner in a profitable cattle-breeding business.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer needed political protection. J. Edgar Hoover, even before
he became head of the FBI, had been tracking him as a possible
Soviet agent. For once Hoover was right, though that only became
clear in 1996 when the Russian government released secret archives
to Epstein. In Congress Al Gore, Sr. helped to keep the FBI off
Hammer's back.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer, who died in 1990, was notorious for advancing his
business interests by the systematic bribery of politicians and
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   He won an important oil concession for Occidental in Libya in
1967 by paying a larger bribe than anybody else. Senator Gore, Sr.
stood beside him on the podium at the oil field opening ceremony
the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, Jr., as freshman senator for Tennessee, inherited his
father's connection with Hammer and Occidental. In 1981, Hammer was

he had been the guest of his father at five previous presidential
inaugurations.

an important role in the privatizing of Elk Hills naval petroleum

ambitions _ his relationship with Russian leaders and an
overly-close relationship with Occidental _ both originate in his

the Soviet Union and the U.S. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ The coup attempt in Fiji is a fine specimen of the
``trouble in paradise'' news story. Seen from the other side of the
world, it is opera buffa beneath the coconut palms, set to the
gentle music of the southern seas as they lap the white sands of a
tropical archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   A failed businessman hires a band of gunmen and then takes
hostage the prime minister and half his government, then appears
before the world's press dressed in a traditional sulu skirt to
announce that if Fiji's great council of chiefs so decrees, he will
call the enterprise off.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow these goings-on lack the gravitas of, say, Israel's
withdrawal from south Lebanon, or the future of the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   However, spare a second to consider a few facts.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji belongs to the Commonwealth _ but the same Commonwealth
that gets so exercised when Pakistan, Nigeria or Zimbabwe
misbehaves is silent now.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji may be best known for its rugby team and top-of-the-market
tourist brochures. But almost 1,000 Fijian peacekeepers (more than
a quarter of the country's armed forces) are on duty in the Middle
East, 600 of them with the United Nations in that same south
Lebanon, currently one of the most dangerous places on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji, in short, is more than doing its bit for what the British
Foreign Office sententiously refers to as the ``international
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Its domestic turmoil, therefore, deserves to be taken a mite
more seriously than it has been by that international community.
</P>
<P>
   Events in Fiji are of relevance to us all. However obscure its
exact motives, the coup led by George Speight is yet another
example of racial tensions threatening to tear a country apart; in
this case the resentment of the indigenous Fijian majority, which
Speight claims to represent, towards the ethnic Indian community.
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that the rebellion began on the first
anniversary of the election of Mahendra Chaudhri, Fiji's first
prime minister of Indian ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Worryingly, Fiji's president, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, has hinted
that he may not reinstate Chaudhri, if that is what is required to
secure a peaceful resolution of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Human motives may explain that stance, since President Mara's
daughter is among the hostages. But that would be to sanction a
gangster's challenge to the constitution, and add Fiji to the list
of countries where power issues from the barrel of a gun.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Five of the seven ``super governors'' appointed by
Russian President Vladimir Putin to discipline Russia's regions are
military, police or security service officers, it has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are divided on whether the new Kremlin leader's efforts
to exert central control over the vast country will run into the
provincial mire or whether a police state is being born under their
noses.
</P>
<P>
   Like an old Communist leader, Putin was touring the former
Soviet republics of Central Asia last Friday, leaving the
politicians in Moscow to digest his ``proposals'' for regional
reform and the appointments he made late on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   His choice of Sergei Kiriyenko, a young reformer who was briefly
prime minister, to represent him in the Volga region will encourage
those who trust Putin to use tough methods only as a way of making
Russia ultimately freer.
</P>
<P>
   But other appointments were more disturbing to anyone with
liberal values and prompted The Moscow Times to headline its story
on the subject: ``Men in Uniforms to Rule Districts.''
</P>
<P>
   With the war continuing in Chechnya, it was perhaps
understandable that Putin named General Viktor Kazantsev, currently
commander of Russian troops in the battle zone, to supervise the
new North Caucasus Federal District, which includes the breakaway
region.
</P>
<P>
   But it was less clear why he needed senior officers from the
forces as his representatives in four more of the seven large
federal districts into which he carved Russia by decree last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerned for human rights were likely to be particularly
worried about the appointment of Viktor Cherkesov, first deputy
director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), to oversee the
regions of the northwest from a base in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Former dissidents remember that when repression was going out of
fashion under Mikhail Gorbachev, Cherkesov was one KGB officer who
continued to make enthusiastic use of the laws against
``anti-Soviet'' activities.
</P>
<P>
   Men who built their careers in the army, police or security
services were also sent out to impose Putin's will on the Central,
Urals and Far Eastern Federal Districts. That left Leonid
Drachevsky, the new presidential envoy to Siberia, as the only
other civilian apart from Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
   Former deputy prime minister, Boris Nemtsov, a liberal, said
order should be brought to Russia's anarchic regions but the
country needed good administrators, not generals who would ``bark
out commands.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of the president's men will be to make sure that the
elected governors in all of Russia's 89 regions obey federal law,
so that citizens from Moscow to Vladivostok can count on living in
equal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Under former President Boris Yeltsin, some of the governors
became a law unto themselves, like medieval princes, and often this
``independence'' meant less rather than more freedom for their
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Except the mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, and the president of
Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev, who both protested, most governors
cautiously welcomed Putin's initiative, although privately many
must be planning to sabotage it.
</P>
<P>
   They would have been further angered by the president's call
last Wednesday for constitutional changes to deprive them of their
seats in the upper house of parliament and of their immunity from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   One person who heartily welcomed what he saw as Putin's attempt
to restore the Soviet-era ``power vertical'' going down from the
Kremlin to the regions was Alexander Lukashenko, the authoritarian
leader of Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of society he has built was made clear when a Minsk
court sentenced the former Belarus prime minister, Mikhail Chigir,
to three years in jail, suspended for two years, for ``abuse of
power.''
</P>
<P>
   West European diplomats said the trial was a purely political
process against a man who had dared to oppose Lukashenko. &QL;

CHILEAN COURT STRIPS PINOCHET OF IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ A Chilean appeals court has stripped the immunity
of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, removing an important obstacle in the way
of his possible trial. He faces charges that he was involved in the
kidnapping, murder and torture of thousands during his 17 years as
Chile's dictator.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of the Court of Appeals is subject to a possible
reversal by the Supreme Court, and even lawyers working to
prosecute Pinochet say it could take years of legal wrangling
before any trial could begin, and that is assuming that the
general, now 84, lives that long. He has circulatory problems and a
history of strokes and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless the 13-9 decision by the appellate judges, voted in
private Tuesday but leaked to local reporters, demonstrates that
Chile's courts are willing to take independent stands after decades
of subservience to the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   It also demonstrates the commitment of President Ricardo Lagos,
the recently inaugurated Socialist, to allow the mechanisms of
justice to go forward despite friction with his military commanders
and threats by congressional conservatives to bottle up much of his
program if the prosecution of Pinochet continues.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Salinas, acting legislative director of Amnesty
International USA, said: ``Throughout Pinochet's captivity in Great
Britain, the Chilean government repeatedly insisted that he be
returned for prosecution in Chile. This appears to be the first
step toward the Chilean government making good on its promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's legal troubles began in earnest in late 1998 when he
was arrested in London on a Spanish warrant charging him with human
rights violations. The general, who is a senator for life under a
constitution written while he ruled, and thus has immunity, was
released by British authorities in February after doctors said he
was not physically and mentally fit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet now faces 108 criminal complaints filed mostly by
family members of about 3,000 people who disappeared after his
violent 1973 coup against Socialist president Salvador Allende
Gossens.
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, Pinochet recently said, ``I never ordered
anybody to be killed or tortured.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Juan Guzman, who is prosecuting the retired dictator, has
anchored his case on 19 people who have been missing ever since
they were dragged out of prisons by soldiers led by some of
Pinochet's top aides in the weeks after the coup.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 people _ who were among 75 prisoners believed to have
been summarily executed _ have never been found, but the Supreme
Court has accepted Guzman's interpretation that they should be
considered kidnap victims, rather than dead. If the court
determined they were dead, the crimes would have been covered by a
general amnesty decreed to cover most rights violations committed
during the early years of the dictatorship from 1973 to 1990. But
if they are considered kidnapped, that offers a loophole for the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Pablo Longueira of the Independent Democratic Union
party who is opposed to the general's prosecution, recently called
the legal interpretation behind Guzman's prosecution ``a ridiculous
joke.'' He added, ``We all know those people are dead.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Independent Democratic Union and another conservative party
had been in negotiations with Lagos to rewrite sections of the
constitution that limit the president's appointment powers over
military commanders and that give the military power to appoint
senators. But the talks have bogged down as Lagos refused to
interfere in the judicial proceedings and as government attorneys
joined in the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos has been equally forceful in displaying his resolve as top
military commanders in recent months at various times showed
displeasure with the prosecution of their former commander in
chief. After a high-level lunch of top military and police
commanders on May 15 was interpreted as a show of defiance, Lagos
publicly scolded them in a diplomatic, but pointed statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary to demonstrate the unity of the armed
forces,'' said Lagos, the first Socialist elected president in
Chile since Allende's overthrow, ``since they are united behind the
president of Chile.'' No military commander contradicted him,
perhaps aware that Lagos' standing in the polls has been rising
since his March inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Pinochet case has hardened the military's stand in a
dialogue with human rights lawyers seeking help in finding the
remains of the missing. Just before Lagos' inauguration, the
officers and lawyers appeared close to an agreement that might have
led to the military's organized help in identifying clandestine
burial places for political victims.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this month, military officers offered a much weaker
proposal, closing the possibility that the military would mount a
serious effort at finding missing bodies. The new proposal would
merely open the way for individual military personnel to volunteer
to help find the graves.
</P>
<P>
   Since his return from Britain, Pinochet has been keeping as low
a profile as possible. He is not been attending Senate sessions,
even for important votes, and he has not spoken out on the issues
of the day.

UTOPIAN RULERS, AND SPOOFS, STAKE OUT TERRITORY ONLINE
</HEADLINE>
 By STEPHEN MIHM   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Try locating the Kingdom of Cherusken on a map. Not
able to place it? How about the Grand Duchy of Haren? Or the
Kingdom of Talossa? The Free Republic of Laputa? What? You can't
even find the Dominion of Asphynxia?
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, none of them are in the atlas. All are so-called
micronations, a catch-all term that encompasses the many imaginary
states, model nations and ``counter countries'' that exist only in
the minds of their creators _ and on the Web. They range from the
silly (the Republic of Roadkills-R-Us, for example, whose motto is
``Tread on Me'') to more serious attempts at virtual
nation-building.
</P>
<P>
   Why create your own country? Motives abound, but, as Liz
Stirling, an artist and founder of Lizbekistan, said, ``It's a
great way to explore why people come together, and what things like
community and nation mean.'' Citizens of micronations participate
by voting, writing for their country's newspapers, running
ministries and sometimes waging civil war (by hacking into the site
and shutting it down).
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the micronation movement predates the Internet;
indeed, the impulse to create model countries has a long history.
Writers like Thomas More and Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote
accounts of imagined utopian communities. More recently, groups of
``geo fiction'' enthusiasts have drawn up plans for imaginary
countries complete with their own flags, monetary systems, stamps,
constitutions, legislatures _ in short, all the trappings of a real
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the mid-1990s, the Web has spurred the creation of
hundreds of new ``nations.'' Many have since organized into leagues
or assemblies comparable to the United Nations. Most prominent are
the League of Secessionist States and the United Micronations. But
such democratic assemblies are rare: many imaginary states are the
creations of closet despots nostalgic for the Roman Empire and
various Balkan fiefdoms. It's no surprise, then, that many quickly
disintegrate or fall victim to coups.
</P>
<P>
   While most imaginary nations exist only in cyberspace, a few
originate in or lay claim to territory, like a college campus, a
suburb or an uninhabited island. But attempts at annexation are
usually made in jest. There is more than enough room on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an almanac of some of the more noteworthy nations now
online, along with their coordinates in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   BERGONIA: www.bergonia.org _ An exercise in socialist dreaming,
Bergonia is a fictional island somewhere in the North Atlantic; it
is blessed with a stable socialist democracy and eco-friendly
inhabitants. Bergonia is the creation of Joe Cometti, a lawyer in
West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an on-and-off-again project since I was a kid,''
Cometti said. The name Bergonia comes from a fictional country
depicted in a ``Superman'' television episode from the 1950s. But
its purpose is not so childish; Cometti described his creation as
``my contribution to the reinvention of socialism via the Net.'' It
has nothing to do with what he termed the ``distorted monstrosity
of Red Star commmunism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cometti doesn't view Bergonia as a utopia. ``I want
Bergonia to be plausible,'' he said. ``And that means there will be
corruption, crime and human pettiness.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE PRINCIPALITY OF FREEDONIA: www.freedonia.org _ A country of
libertarian leanings, Freedonia has very little connection with the
Marx Brothers' fictional country of the same name. Its leader, John
Alexander Kayle, is a student at Babson College in Babson Park,
Mass. He is studying for a degree in investment finance and
professes a fondness for the writings of Thomas Jefferson and Ayn
Rand.
</P>
<P>
   Kayle, who uses the screen name John I, and his fellow
Freedonians hope to purchase a chunk of territory in Somaliland and
establish a libertarian enclave. Notwithstanding its homelessness,
Freedonia has minted its own money (silver) and even written a
national anthem that has this refrain: ``Oh, Freedonia, Freedonia
the land that saves, Freedonians never shall be slaves.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE KINGDOM OF TALOSSA: www.talossa.com _ This constitutional
monarchy was founded by Robert Ben Madison in 1979, when he was a
high school student in Milwaukee and declared his bedroom to be a
sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
   Talossa has its own constitution and legislature; it allows
``foreigners'' to become citizens, take part in elections and
formulate policy. Since going on the Web, Talossa has acquired some
60 citizens, most of whom live outside the United States. The
site's citizens claim to have inspired the proliferation of online
micronations. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AERICAN EMPIRE: www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/Surf/6818/aerica.html
_ Aerican, one of the more imaginative sites, refers to itself as
``the Monty Python of micronationalism,'' and its inhabitants
worship a being known as the Great Penguin.
</P>
<P>
   The site warns its readers: ``Aerican places a high emphasis on
silliness. People who cannot act silly are permitted entry only on
a limited basis.'' A smiley-face adorns the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Also amusing is Roadkills-R-Us (www.rru.com), with its riffs on
secession and fallen fauna. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE HOLY EMPIRE OF REUNION: www.reuniao.org _ This micronation was
formed by Claudio de Castro, who has taken the screen name Emperor
Claudio I, and Bernardo Bauer in 1997. Claudio and most of his 780
subjects actually hail from Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   His Imperial Majesty runs the country with an iron hand, and
visitors to the site are greeted with the following disclaimer:
``Reunion is not a Democracy, so you won't be bothered by
candidates and elections.'' Instead, citizens engage in intrigues
that have not been seen since Louis XIV, wielding influence through
Reunion's virtual courts and chambers. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CYBER YUGOSLAVIA: www.juga.com _ This is a political site that is
critical of the extreme nationalism that has led to ongoing
conflict in the areas that made up the former nation of Yugoslavia.
It issues passports and grants citizenship for its virtual version
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A site that also has a political outlook is the virtual nation
of NSK (www.ljudmila.org/embassy), the creation of Slovenian
intellectuals and artists. The site's manifesto declares, ``The NSK
state denies in its fundamental acts the categories of fixed
territory, the principle of national borders, and advocates the law
of transnationality.'' Like Cyber Yugoslavia and many other sites,
NSK offers citizenship and passports. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LIZBEKISTAN: lizbekistan.com _ Until Sept. 9, 1999, Lizbekistan was
one of the most popular micronations. That is when its creator, an
Australian artist named Liz Stirling, blew up the site.
</P>
<P>
   She began work on Lizbekistan in 1996 as part of a larger
project on citizenship and printed stamps and passports for
would-be Lizbeks. Lizbekistan even had its own currency, the
nipple. In its heyday, the imaginary nation had four newspapers,
including The Lizbek Sentinel, which Stirling described as ``the
independent official organ,'' and The Dependent, jokingly known as
``the voice of authority.'' Lizbekistan eventually acquired several
thousand citizens before being consigned to oblivion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees of Lizbekistan can now frequent two related sites,
www.lizbekdiaspora.com and www.lizvegas.com.

   TOKYO _ Yuko Obuchi, soon to become MP for Gunma Prefecture's
Number Five Constituency, may turn out to be an able and dedicated
politician, but from her record so far there is not a single reason
to think so.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 26, Ms. Obuchi is neither an economist nor a
public servant nor an entrepreneur. Her experience of the world is
limited to a short stint as a TV researcher and a few months
working as her dad's secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs show a pleasant-looking young woman, with an elegant
dress sense, neatly cut hair and a nice set of teeth. And yet, in a
month's time, Ms. Obuchi will almost certainly become a legislator
in the second richest country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation is simple: Yuko is the daughter of the late
Keizo Obuchi, the Japanese prime minister who died ten days ago
after a sudden stroke six weeks before.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, officials of Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
announced that they are adopting his daughter as their candidate in
the safe seat he has left vacant.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in the general election expected to be held on June 25 _
barring an unexpected upset _ Yuko Obuchi will become a hereditary
member of the Japanese Diet, one of the most exclusive family clubs
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many other national parliaments contain some second generation
politicians, but few are quite so dominated by them as Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, 38 of the 500 seats in the Japanese Diet's lower
chamber belonged to the children of MPs. Forty years later the
figure has tripled to 122, and it could climb even higher.
</P>
<P>
   In next month's general election, at least 145 hereditary
candidates will stand, among them some of the most powerful
politicians in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The current cabinet alone contains half a dozen second- or
third-generation MPs, and four of the last seven prime ministers
fell into the same category.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's predecessor, Ryutaro Hashimoto, can boast a grandfather
who was an MP, a father who was a minister, and a younger brother
who is a regional governor.
</P>
<P>
   But the phenomenon is not restricted to the LDP and its
coalition partners; the leader of the opposition, Yukio Hatoyama of
the Democratic Party, had a foreign minister father, a prime
minister grandfather, and a great-grandfather who was speaker of
the house.
</P>
<P>
   Among Japanese voters, the idea of hereditary MPs does not
appear strange or improper and second generation candidates do
little to justify their ambitions. The reasons given by Ms.
Obuchi's supporters were feeble.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to choosing Obuchi's successor,'' said one of
his constituency workers, Shichiroji Arikawa, ``we have no choice
but to accept someone from Obuchi's family as the person who would
best inherit his political wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuko herself admitted that she had no interest in politics
before her father's sudden illness. ``I made up my mind when I saw
his face shortly after he died,'' she revealed Tuesday, rather
disconcertingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to decide who to vote for based on who the candidate
is, not what family they are from,'' Japan's most liberal
newspaper, Asahi Shibum, patiently urged last week. But for this
election a more vigorous campaign is afoot to raise the calibre of
parliamentary candidates and hold them to higher standards.
</P>
<P>
   Following the example of a grass-roots movement in South Korea,
a group of activists have set up a group called Wave 21, dedicated
to ``driving out the now rampant abuse of authority, greed and
corruption committed by politicians from the Diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Wave 21's Web site invites visitors to award ``red cards'' to
candidates considered unfit for office, and publishes the results.
They include the new prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, the finance
minister, Kiichi Miyazawa and the veteran opposition leader, Ichiro
Ozawa.
</P>
<P>
   In last month's Korean elections, most of the candidates named
by the campaigners in Seoul lost their seats as a result, although
whether Japan's less fiery voters will react in a similar way
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the likes of Ms. Obuchi will be under scrutiny. ``We
shall expunge such bad politicians whose minds are dominated by
self-preservation, self-interest for power and money,'' reads Wave
21's ferocious manifesto. ``Blacklist (a candidate) with whom you
never ever want to share the same air under heaven!'' &QL;

<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Just to stay in business, Chuba Egolum must
cope with daily annoyances most Americans would confront only
during a natural catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, people who know Nigeria like to sum things up with a
joke: ``What's the difference between Nigeria and a disaster
area?''
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``In a disaster area, the Red Cross will come to help
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Egolum isn't laughing. His time in the United States _ including
three years obtaining an MBA in Atlanta _ taught him to appreciate
basic things longed for in a place like Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I have to deal with whether I'm going to have
electricity,'' he says, sitting at his desk in a striped golf shirt
and tan Dockers trousers. His company drills wells and builds water
distribution systems. ``I have to make sure to pump enough water
into the tank on top of the building so we will be able to flush
the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic in this immense swirling city is impassable at most
hours. ``It is bedeviling,'' Egolum says. ``When I pick up the
phone, most often it is dead,'' he says. ``This is what it is to do
business in Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite it all, Egolum is hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in nearly two decades, Nigeria has a civilian
government. Africa's most populous nation, with 123 million people,
now can carry on without the crushing weight of the corrupt
military regimes that have saddled it for most of its 40 years of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   While the end of military rule is universally praised, a year of
living democratically has been sobering, even disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is a new experience for us,'' says Egolum, who still
considers genuine representative government a distant destination _
a Promised Land. ``We haven't gotten there yet, but we have a
pretty good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   This sentiment is widespread in Nigeria, but it is accompanied
by an uneasy belief that the window of opportunity may shut at any
time. People worry in particular that too much may be riding on the
powers of one man: President Olusegan Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday(5/29), Obasanjo will celebrate the anniversary of his
inauguration as Nigeria's first civilian leader since 1983. A man
who counts among his friends Bill Clinton and former President
Jimmy Carter, Obasanjo, 63, is regarded widely as an honest,
intelligent and dedicated leader. Among his credentials is a period
as chairman of Transparency International, a Berlin-based
organization that promotes honest government.
</P>
<P>
   And by most measures, Obasanjo, a former general who ruled
between 1976 and 1979 before handing power to a doomed civilian
government, has made an auspicious start. He summarily retired from
government crooked military officers, pushed an ethics agenda and
has labored to repair the country's dreadful reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the problems confronting Obasanjo and Nigeria remain both
broad and deep, a perilous combination in a country whose people
have high expectations and little patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigerians are about getting Nigeria fixed,'' said John Muibi
Amoda, the head of the pro-democracy Africa Peace Support
Initiative. Yet, Amoda cautions that people expect too much and
understand too little. ``Just because you have an internationally
monitored so-called democratic election doesn't mean that you have
a democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While reformers demand that Obasanjo do more, the robber barons
who dominated for so long are working to obstruct him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is walking a tightrope with people at both ends
shaking the rope,'' Amoda said.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders are aware of the president's plight but are
eager for him to succeed because they believe Africa's future may
depend heavily on the success of a healthy and democratic Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration identified Nigeria as one of four
''key democracies'' along with Colombia, Indonesia and Ukraine. It
ended the country's pariah status, and is seeking $100 million in
aid. In January, the administration said it would end its ban on
direct flights from the United States to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Obasanjo has pledged to deploy his disused but
still potent military to help bring stability to west Africa. He
offered to send peacekeepers to Sierra Leone, so long as Nigeria
receives foreign support _ particularly from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also has responded favorably, if vaguely, to
Obasanjo's anxious pleas for relief from the country's estimated
$35 billion in international debt, which consumes more than a third
of Nigeria's federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   American policymakers take particular note of Obasanjo's
ambitions of doubling Nigeria's oil output to 4 million barrels a
day. The country already produces about twice as much crude oil as
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Obasanjo embraces the free market and has embarked
on a drive to privatize major industries.
</P>
<P>
   And while Obasanjo's momentum has been stalled by an assertive
Legislature _ which will be a year old in June _ many observers
believe the government is at least learning the deliberative,
power-sharing process.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Nigeria was poised to assume the role of an
African superpower. Today it is a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   For 17 years this vast country _ which is about the size of
Texas, Georgia and Florida combined _ was ravaged by military
juntas that wrecked the economy, impoverished the people and
depleted the national treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of neglect are everywhere. In the primary city Lagos,
skyscrapers stand with broken windows and weedy sidewalks like the
ruins of some flourishing but bygone metropolis. Without reliable
electricity, elevators rarely run in the buildings made stifling by
the lack of air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the commerce in this sprawling urban jumble of 11
million is what economists call ``informal,'' meaning individuals
and small businesses hawk whatever they can for whatever they can
get. In many ways, Nigeria is a nation of hardy and hard-bitten
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   In today's world of e-commerce and automated everything, Nigeria
seems primitive. Banks don't issue credit cards and, with the
exception of the two or three hotels that specialize in fleecing
foreigners, no one accepts them. There are no automated teller
machines and, perhaps most startling, no McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is a constant companion. Hotel doormen panic when foreign
guests suggest taking a stroll. For a fee, heavily armed soldiers
at the airport will stand guard over newly arrived visitors and
their bags until a taxi or friend comes to gather them up.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking any public transport and little traffic enforcement,
roads in Lagos are choked in a hopeless, chaotic gridlock _ known
here as ``slow-go.'' To keep things moving, whip-bearing policeman
apprehend laggardly drivers and administer lashes on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   And even with its vast oil resources, Nigeria must import
gasoline, creating frequent shortages and a thriving black market.
Without the luxury of being able to worry about the environment,
the air has become brown with dust and pollution and roadsides are
covered with layers of litter. Much of the country's hardwood
forests are gone and the oil-rich Niger Delta is a disaster in the
view of many environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to get the impression that nothing works.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians blame the mess on the run of dictators who were inept,
dishonest or both. Over the past two decades, Nigeria developed the
reputation of being perhaps the world's most corrupt country. (In
1998, Transparency International rated Nigeria No. 2 among corrupt
countries,
</P>
<P>
   trailing only neighboring Cameroon.)
</P>
<P>
   To many outsiders, it often seemed as if the entire nation was
on the take. From passport officers to traffic cops, just about any
problem could be resolved with a ``dash'' _ a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian leaders now consider regaining credibility paramount.
``If there is one single thing that has retarded economic
development, it is the issue of corruption,'' said Farouk Lawan,
the chairman of the ethics committee of the Nigerian House of
Representatives. ``We are talking about a situation where the
previous head of state looted vast amounts of money and stifled
</P>
<P>
   the entire economic system of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Sani Abacha, who ruled from 1993 until he died in office in
1998, is accused of personally stealing more than $4 billion. With
the assistance of friendly governments _ including the United
States _ Obasanjo has located several hundred million. But much of
the money may never be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite many small victories, the economy remains in critical
but at least stable condition. Last weekend, Obasanjo announced
that Nigeria was had caught up with $1.5 billion in back payments
to the government's private partners in oil joint ventures,
including Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon-Mobil and Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, economists worry that a recovery may be impossible
given the poor state of the nation's infrastructure, particularly
the power grid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidence in the Nigerian economy cannot be restored
until these basic infrastructure needs are met,'' said Chike
Uchime, the editor of the Nigerian magazine Business &AMP; Finance
Digest. Additionally, the country needs to diversify its economy,
he said. Nearly 90 percent of the country's export revenues and
virtually all its tax income comes from oil.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest internal threat is the continued strife
between Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The flashpoint has been the attempt by leaders in the heavily
Muslim northern states to impose Sharia, conservative Islamic law.
Since February the conflict has claimed thousands of lives in
brutal clashes with machetes the weapon of choice. Obasanjo has
been criticized for reacting too slowly and indecisively.
Politicians from both religions express concerns that
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria will disintegrate if Obasanjo cannot gain control of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With all the problems, most people seem to believe that the
change toward democracy is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   On a particularly hot day recently, T. Bimbo Akande sought
refuge in the breeze made by a fan in his office on the 18th floor
in one of the weary old skyscrapers that haunt downtown Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   Akande believes his import-export business will improve only if
Obasanjo can win the trust of foreign investors. He's skeptical but
modestly hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   However, Akande counts his loss to the years of chaos in
personal terms. In November, his 21-year-old son Dapo Akande came
home in the evening to a dark house. As usual, the power was out,
so he cranked up the diesel-powered generator. It burst flames that
engulfed the young man.
</P>
<P>
   Akande found his son and rushed him to the poorly equipped and
scantily staffed hospital. Four days later, he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my loss to the conditions in Nigeria,'' Akande said.
``He was a huge investment for me that I will never be able to
recover. How many souls have been wasted just this way?''
</P>
<P>
   Akande, whose brother lives in the suburban Atlanta community of
Powder Springs, expressed deep frustration at the wasted potential
_ both in his son and his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've traveled around the world and I know what this country
has to offer, what its people are capable of,'' he said. ``With
good leadership. We should be among the first in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all too obvious, isn't it. There's no going back from
democracy.''

   History: First inhabted in about 500 B.C, but Nok people; many
tribes followed. Islam was introduced in the 13th century. The
British annexed Lagos in 1851 and seized control of the rest of the
region by 1886. Britain created Nigeria and made it a colony in
1914. Nigeria gained independence in 1960. Rioting broke out in
1966, and military leaders seized control. In July, a second
military coup put Col. Yakubu Gowon in power. Also in that year,
Muslim Hausas in the north massacred Christian Ibos in the east,
many of whom had been driven from the north. Thousands of Ibos took
refuge in the eastern region, which declared its independence as
Biafra in 1967. In 1970, Biafra surrendered to the federal
government. Gowon's nine-year rule ended in 1975 with a bloodless
coup that made Gen. Muritala Rufai Mohammed chief of state. Gen.
Olesugan Obasanjo assumed power in 1976 and in 1979 handed control
to civilian government of Alhaji Shehu Shagari. An oil boom in the
1970s buoyed the economy, and by the 1980s Nigeria was considered
an exemplary of African democracy. In 1984, the military seized
power, only to be followed by a coup in 1985. Gen. Ibrahim
Babangida said the country would be returned to civilian rule, but
in 1993 he voided the results of election and Babangida resigned.
In November 1993, Gen. Sani Abacha led a coup to restore military
rule. Abacha's regime was condemned for corruption and inefficiency
as well as a harshly repressive methods. Abacha's rule turned
Nigeria into an international pariah. The hanging of writer Ken
Saro-Wiwa in 1995 was condemned around the world. Abacha died of a
heart attack in June 1998, and was succeeded by another military
ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar. He pledged to step aside for an
elected leader by May 1999. In February 1999, Obasanjo won an
overwhelming victory. He was inaugurated May 29, 1999.

<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Just to stay in business, Chuba Egolum must
cope with daily annoyances most Americans would confront only
during a natural catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, people who know Nigeria like to sum things up with a
joke: ``What's the difference between Nigeria and a disaster
area?''
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``In a disaster area, the Red Cross will come to help
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Egolum isn't laughing. His time in the United States _ including
three years obtaining an MBA in Atlanta _ taught him to appreciate
basic things longed for in a place like Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I have to deal with whether I'm going to have
electricity,'' he says, sitting at his desk in a striped golf shirt
and tan Dockers trousers. His company drills wells and builds water
distribution systems. ``I have to make sure to pump enough water
into the tank on top of the building so we will be able to flush
the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic in this immense swirling city is impassable at most
hours. ``It is bedeviling,'' Egolum says. ``When I pick up the
phone, most often it is dead,'' he says. ``This is what it is to do
business in Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite it all, Egolum is hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in nearly two decades, Nigeria has a civilian
government. Africa's most populous nation, with 123 million people,
now can carry on without the crushing weight of the corrupt
military regimes that have saddled it for most of its 40 years of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   While the end of military rule is universally praised, a year of
living democratically has been sobering, even disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is a new experience for us,'' says Egolum, who still
considers genuine representative government a distant destination _
a Promised Land. ``We haven't gotten there yet, but we have a
pretty good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   This sentiment is widespread in Nigeria, but it is accompanied
by an uneasy belief that the window of opportunity may shut at any
time. People worry in particular that too much may be riding on the
powers of one man: President Olusegan Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday(5/29), Obasanjo will celebrate the anniversary of his
inauguration as Nigeria's first civilian leader since 1983. A man
who counts among his friends Bill Clinton and former President
Jimmy Carter, Obasanjo, 63, is regarded widely as an honest,
intelligent and dedicated leader. Among his credentials is a period
as chairman of Transparency International, a Berlin-based
organization that promotes honest government.
</P>
<P>
   And by most measures, Obasanjo, a former general who ruled
between 1976 and 1979 before handing power to a doomed civilian
government, has made an auspicious start. He summarily retired from
government crooked military officers, pushed an ethics agenda and
has labored to repair the country's dreadful reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the problems confronting Obasanjo and Nigeria remain both
broad and deep, a perilous combination in a country whose people
have high expectations and little patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigerians are about getting Nigeria fixed,'' said John Muibi
Amoda, the head of the pro-democracy Africa Peace Support
Initiative. Yet, Amoda cautions that people expect too much and
understand too little. ``Just because you have an internationally
monitored so-called democratic election doesn't mean that you have
a democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While reformers demand that Obasanjo do more, the robber barons
who dominated for so long are working to obstruct him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is walking a tightrope with people at both ends
shaking the rope,'' Amoda said.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders are aware of the president's plight but are
eager for him to succeed because they believe Africa's future may
depend heavily on the success of a healthy and democratic Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration identified Nigeria as one of four
''key democracies'' along with Colombia, Indonesia and Ukraine. It
ended the country's pariah status, and is seeking $100 million in
aid. In January, the administration said it would end its ban on
direct flights from the United States to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Obasanjo has pledged to deploy his disused but
still potent military to help bring stability to west Africa. He
offered to send peacekeepers to Sierra Leone, so long as Nigeria
receives foreign support _ particularly from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also has responded favorably, if vaguely, to
Obasanjo's anxious pleas for relief from the country's estimated
$35 billion in international debt, which consumes more than a third
of Nigeria's federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   American policymakers take particular note of Obasanjo's
ambitions of doubling Nigeria's oil output to 4 million barrels a
day. The country already produces about twice as much crude oil as
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Obasanjo embraces the free market and has embarked
on a drive to privatize major industries.
</P>
<P>
   And while Obasanjo's momentum has been stalled by an assertive
Legislature _ which will be a year old in June _ many observers
believe the government is at least learning the deliberative,
power-sharing process.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Nigeria was poised to assume the role of an
African superpower. Today it is a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   For 17 years this vast country _ which is about the size of
Texas, Georgia and Florida combined _ was ravaged by military
juntas that wrecked the economy, impoverished the people and
depleted the national treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of neglect are everywhere. In the primary city Lagos,
skyscrapers stand with broken windows and weedy sidewalks like the
ruins of some flourishing but bygone metropolis. Without reliable
electricity, elevators rarely run in the buildings made stifling by
the lack of air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the commerce in this sprawling urban jumble of 11
million is what economists call ``informal,'' meaning individuals
and small businesses hawk whatever they can for whatever they can
get. In many ways, Nigeria is a nation of hardy and hard-bitten
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   In today's world of e-commerce and automated everything, Nigeria
seems primitive. Banks don't issue credit cards and, with the
exception of the two or three hotels that specialize in fleecing
foreigners, no one accepts them. There are no automated teller
machines and, perhaps most startling, no McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is a constant companion. Hotel doormen panic when foreign
guests suggest taking a stroll. For a fee, heavily armed soldiers
at the airport will stand guard over newly arrived visitors and
their bags until a taxi or friend comes to gather them up.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking any public transport and little traffic enforcement,
roads in Lagos are choked in a hopeless, chaotic gridlock _ known
here as ``slow-go.'' To keep things moving, whip-bearing policeman
apprehend laggardly drivers and administer lashes on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   And even with its vast oil resources, Nigeria must import
gasoline, creating frequent shortages and a thriving black market.
Without the luxury of being able to worry about the environment,
the air has become brown with dust and pollution and roadsides are
covered with layers of litter. Much of the country's hardwood
forests are gone and the oil-rich Niger Delta is a disaster in the
view of many environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to get the impression that nothing works.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians blame the mess on the run of dictators who were inept,
dishonest or both. Over the past two decades, Nigeria developed the
reputation of being perhaps the world's most corrupt country. (In
1998, Transparency International rated Nigeria No. 2 among corrupt
countries,
</P>
<P>
   trailing only neighboring Cameroon.)
</P>
<P>
   To many outsiders, it often seemed as if the entire nation was
on the take. From passport officers to traffic cops, just about any
problem could be resolved with a ``dash'' _ a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian leaders now consider regaining credibility paramount.
``If there is one single thing that has retarded economic
development, it is the issue of corruption,'' said Farouk Lawan,
the chairman of the ethics committee of the Nigerian House of
Representatives. ``We are talking about a situation where the
previous head of state looted vast amounts of money and stifled
</P>
<P>
   the entire economic system of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Sani Abacha, who ruled from 1993 until he died in office in
1998, is accused of personally stealing more than $4 billion. With
the assistance of friendly governments _ including the United
States _ Obasanjo has located several hundred million. But much of
the money may never be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite many small victories, the economy remains in critical
but at least stable condition. Last weekend, Obasanjo announced
that Nigeria was had caught up with $1.5 billion in back payments
to the government's private partners in oil joint ventures,
including Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon-Mobil and Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, economists worry that a recovery may be impossible
given the poor state of the nation's infrastructure, particularly
the power grid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidence in the Nigerian economy cannot be restored
until these basic infrastructure needs are met,'' said Chike
Uchime, the editor of the Nigerian magazine Business &AMP; Finance
Digest. Additionally, the country needs to diversify its economy,
he said. Nearly 90 percent of the country's export revenues and
virtually all its tax income comes from oil.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest internal threat is the continued strife
between Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The flashpoint has been the attempt by leaders in the heavily
Muslim northern states to impose Sharia, conservative Islamic law.
Since February the conflict has claimed thousands of lives in
brutal clashes with machetes the weapon of choice. Obasanjo has
been criticized for reacting too slowly and indecisively.
Politicians from both religions express concerns that
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria will disintegrate if Obasanjo cannot gain control of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With all the problems, most people seem to believe that the
change toward democracy is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   On a particularly hot day recently, T. Bimbo Akande sought
refuge in the breeze made by a fan in his office on the 18th floor
in one of the weary old skyscrapers that haunt downtown Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   Akande believes his import-export business will improve only if
Obasanjo can win the trust of foreign investors. He's skeptical but
modestly hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   However, Akande counts his loss to the years of chaos in
personal terms. In November, his 21-year-old son Dapo Akande came
home in the evening to a dark house. As usual, the power was out,
so he cranked up the diesel-powered generator. It burst flames that
engulfed the young man.
</P>
<P>
   Akande found his son and rushed him to the poorly equipped and
scantily staffed hospital. Four days later, he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my loss to the conditions in Nigeria,'' Akande said.
``He was a huge investment for me that I will never be able to
recover. How many souls have been wasted just this way?''
</P>
<P>
   Akande, whose brother lives in the suburban Atlanta community of
Powder Springs, expressed deep frustration at the wasted potential
_ both in his son and his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've traveled around the world and I know what this country
has to offer, what its people are capable of,'' he said. ``With
good leadership. We should be among the first in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all too obvious, isn't it. There's no going back from
democracy.''

   History: First inhabted in about 500 B.C, but Nok people; many
tribes followed. Islam was introduced in the 13th century. The
British annexed Lagos in 1851 and seized control of the rest of the
region by 1886. Britain created Nigeria and made it a colony in
1914. Nigeria gained independence in 1960. Rioting broke out in
1966, and military leaders seized control. In July, a second
military coup put Col. Yakubu Gowon in power. Also in that year,
Muslim Hausas in the north massacred Christian Ibos in the east,
many of whom had been driven from the north. Thousands of Ibos took
refuge in the eastern region, which declared its independence as
Biafra in 1967. In 1970, Biafra surrendered to the federal
government. Gowon's nine-year rule ended in 1975 with a bloodless
coup that made Gen. Muritala Rufai Mohammed chief of state. Gen.
Olesugan Obasanjo assumed power in 1976 and in 1979 handed control
to civilian government of Alhaji Shehu Shagari. An oil boom in the
1970s buoyed the economy, and by the 1980s Nigeria was considered
an exemplary of African democracy. In 1984, the military seized
power, only to be followed by a coup in 1985. Gen. Ibrahim
Babangida said the country would be returned to civilian rule, but
in 1993 he voided the results of election and Babangida resigned.
In November 1993, Gen. Sani Abacha led a coup to restore military
rule. Abacha's regime was condemned for corruption and inefficiency
as well as a harshly repressive methods. Abacha's rule turned
Nigeria into an international pariah. The hanging of writer Ken
Saro-Wiwa in 1995 was condemned around the world. Abacha died of a
heart attack in June 1998, and was succeeded by another military
ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar. He pledged to step aside for an
elected leader by May 1999. In February 1999, Obasanjo won an
overwhelming victory. He was inaugurated May 29, 1999.

 By RICHARD LLOYD PARRY  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   TOKYO _ Yuko Obuchi, soon to become MP for Gunma Prefecture's
Number Five Constituency, may turn out to be an able and dedicated
politician, but from her record so far there is not a single reason
to think so.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 26, Ms. Obuchi is neither an economist nor a
public servant nor an entrepreneur. Her experience of the world is
limited to a short stint as a TV researcher and a few months
working as her dad's secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs show a pleasant-looking young woman, with an elegant
dress sense, neatly cut hair and a nice set of teeth. And yet, in a
month's time, Ms. Obuchi will almost certainly become a legislator
in the second richest country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation is simple: Yuko is the daughter of the late
Keizo Obuchi, the Japanese prime minister who died ten days ago
after a sudden stroke six weeks before.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, officials of Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
announced that they are adopting his daughter as their candidate in
the safe seat he has left vacant.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in the general election expected to be held on June 25 _
barring an unexpected upset _ Yuko Obuchi will become a hereditary
member of the Japanese Diet, one of the most exclusive family clubs
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many other national parliaments contain some second generation
politicians, but few are quite so dominated by them as Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, 38 of the 500 seats in the Japanese Diet's lower
chamber belonged to the children of MPs. Forty years later the
figure has tripled to 122, and it could climb even higher.
</P>
<P>
   In next month's general election, at least 145 hereditary
candidates will stand, among them some of the most powerful
politicians in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The current cabinet alone contains half a dozen second- or
third-generation MPs, and four of the last seven prime ministers
fell into the same category.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's predecessor, Ryutaro Hashimoto, can boast a grandfather
who was an MP, a father who was a minister, and a younger brother
who is a regional governor.
</P>
<P>
   But the phenomenon is not restricted to the LDP and its
coalition partners; the leader of the opposition, Yukio Hatoyama of
the Democratic Party, had a foreign minister father, a prime
minister grandfather, and a great-grandfather who was speaker of
the house.
</P>
<P>
   Among Japanese voters, the idea of hereditary MPs does not
appear strange or improper and second generation candidates do
little to justify their ambitions. The reasons given by Ms.
Obuchi's supporters were feeble.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to choosing Obuchi's successor,'' said one of
his constituency workers, Shichiroji Arikawa, ``we have no choice
but to accept someone from Obuchi's family as the person who would
best inherit his political wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuko herself admitted that she had no interest in politics
before her father's sudden illness. ``I made up my mind when I saw
his face shortly after he died,'' she revealed Tuesday, rather
disconcertingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to decide who to vote for based on who the candidate
is, not what family they are from,'' Japan's most liberal
newspaper, Asahi Shibum, patiently urged last week. But for this
election a more vigorous campaign is afoot to raise the calibre of
parliamentary candidates and hold them to higher standards.
</P>
<P>
   Following the example of a grass-roots movement in South Korea,
a group of activists have set up a group called Wave 21, dedicated
to ``driving out the now rampant abuse of authority, greed and
corruption committed by politicians from the Diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Wave 21's Web site invites visitors to award ``red cards'' to
candidates considered unfit for office, and publishes the results.
They include the new prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, the finance
minister, Kiichi Miyazawa and the veteran opposition leader, Ichiro
Ozawa.
</P>
<P>
   In last month's Korean elections, most of the candidates named
by the campaigners in Seoul lost their seats as a result, although
whether Japan's less fiery voters will react in a similar way
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the likes of Ms. Obuchi will be under scrutiny. ``We
shall expunge such bad politicians whose minds are dominated by
self-preservation, self-interest for power and money,'' reads Wave
21's ferocious manifesto. ``Blacklist (a candidate) with whom you
never ever want to share the same air under heaven!'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even some of the harshest critics of Peter Martins'
regime at New York City Ballet troop eagerly to the annual workshop
performances of his company's academy, the School of American
Ballet. Year after year, in the dancing of the latest crop of
advanced students, the workshops present a glimpse of ballet's
ideals.
</P>
<P>
   In the 17 years since Martins succeeded Balanchine as the
company's ballet-master-in-chief and the school's chairman of
faculty, his every move at the company has been debated. Changes at
the school, however, go pretty much unremarked outside its sanctum
in the Samuel B. and David Rose Building at Lincoln Center. The
move in 1991 to those hushed new quarters, with dormitories for 64
students in the Meredith Willson Residence Hall above, marks the
biggest institutional change in the Martins years.
</P>
<P>
   Today, this academy, established in 1934 to train ballet
dancers, period, publishes its intention to act in loco parentis
for the students and provides things like nutrition counseling.
Beneath the recent revival of curiosity about the private lives of
the school's students, triggered by scenes in Nicholas Hytner's new
dance film, ``Center Stage,'' may lie plain dislike of what Lincoln
Kirstein, co-founder of the school and company, celebrated as
ballet's ``credo of self-denial at the moment when egos are
inclined to feel their first selfhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The school under Martins has also been affected by the death of
Kirstein, in 1996, and of teachers representing the full span of
the Balanchine era _ Stanley Williams, Alexandra Danilova, Muriel
Stuart and Elise Reiman. Martins has brought in guest teachers like
Mikhail Baryshnikov; he recruited retired company dancers,
including Peter Frame and Katrina Killian, and active dancers like
Darci Kistler (his wife), Jock Soto and Peter Boal, for the
faculty; and he asked others, like Kyra Nichols and Damian Woetzel,
to pitch in as guest teachers. Martins himself teaches the advanced
men on Wednesdays. ``When he walks into the studio and takes off
the blazer, it's the most intimidating thing in the world,'' says
one boy.
</P>
<P>
   Martins also made Kay Mazzo, a former partner who taught under
Balanchine, his co-chairman of faculty. ``Kay is a woman whom I
have always adored,'' Martins says. ``She has impeccable judgment,
and she is a very, very fine person.'' The soft-spoken Mazzo loves
her job but can't remember what it's called: ``Titles are for the
birds,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As for the curriculum, such as it is _ the school has no written
syllabus, just an oral tradition _ Martins has added classes in
ballroom dance, mime, contemporary partnering techniques and weight
training for the men. If he has a larger project in view, it seems
to be evolving ad hoc: upgrading the training for men.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Martins began a special program for boys: the school
announces its open auditions to 8- to 11-year-old boys in the
city's public schools; classes in the children's division are no
longer co-ed, and boys under 14 attend tuition-free (this year's
tuition for girls ranged from $1,067 to $2,412); and they are
allowed to wear shorts instead of tights. It is too soon to see the
results of these changes, though for nearly a decade, most of the
boys in the party scene in City Ballet's annual performances of
``The Nutcracker'' have been boys, not the disgruntled little girls
of Christmases past.
</P>
<P>
   A dancer's training takes about 10 years, and SAB, unlike the
state academies abroad, does not have a stable population:
twice-weekly auditions are held at the school year-round, students
outside the United States may send audition tapes, and an annual
25-city audition tour selects some 200 students for the summer
session. There is a constant winnowing (perhaps 20 of the 200
summer kids will be invited to return in the fall). Of the current
group of 29 advanced men, for example, only 7 have trained more or
less exclusively at the school.

   SEATTLE _ Ever since it emerged from its gentle provincialism to
become a powerhouse of the new digital economy, the city of
Seattle, Wash., has worried about becoming just a little too much
like Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   First came the upscale chain stores, then the four-wheel-drive
cars and clogged highways, then _ heaven forbid _ a touch of Los
Angeles-style smog.
</P>
<P>
   And now it turns out Seattle has another thing in common with
California: risk of destruction by a killer earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Like L.A., a city forever on the verge of a seismic breakdown,
and like San Francisco, which is within shuddering distance of the
long, potentially lethal San Andreas Fault, Seattle has developed
its own fear of the Big One.
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes and volatile shifts in geological strata are hardly
unknown in the Pacific Northwest. Seattle, after all, is less than
100 miles away from Mount St. Helens, which erupted to devastating
effect 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And the area has suffered a couple of uncomfortable shakes in
the last half-century: once in the Seattle-Tacoma area in 1965 and
once a little further south in the state capital, Olympia, in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, however, it was believed that the seismic fault
lines were buried either too deep beneath the surface of the earth,
or too far away in the Pacific Ocean, to threaten much more than a
few cracked buildings and a handful of victims in the worst of
cases.
</P>
<P>
   All that has changed with the discovery of the Seattle Fault,
which runs as little as six miles beneath the surface along a
lengthy east-west stretch from Issaquah, in the foothills of the
Cascades, through the heart of Seattle and across Puget Sound to
the old naval shipyard at Bremerton.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have known about this fault for a few decades, but
for a long time refused to take it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the research evidence mounts, they believe it could
trigger a quake as high as 7 on the Richter scale _ the same force
unleashed by last year's devastating tremors in Turkey and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the geological layout of the area, the effect of any
earthquake is actually going to be worse than the Richter number
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Seattle basin is going to have such an extra kick
it's going to shake like a bowl of Jello,'' said Craig Weaver, who
coordinates earthquake monitoring in the Pacific Northwest for the
U.S. Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   What set the alarm bells ringing was the accidental discovery of
an ancient Douglas fir a few years ago during the expansion of a
local sewage works on Elliott Bay. A combination of carbon dating
and geological analysis led scientists to conclude that a
devastating earthquake had struck the Seattle area somewhere
between 900 and 930 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the land, now heavily populated, rose as much as 16
feet. The shores of Lake Washington, site of many desirable homes
including Microsoft chief Bill Gates's, were devastated by
landslides.
</P>
<P>
   And Bainbridge Island, now an affluent bedroom community with
easy ferry links across Elliott Bay to downtown Seattle, was tipped
up so violently that a whole new corner emerged from the deep. The
south-facing ledge is now a nine-hole private golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is understandably perturbed by the revelations. Last
year, about 100 researchers set off depth charges in the city's
watery surrounds _ to the consternation of building dwellers on
shore who felt the tremors _ and concluded there were in fact three
or four sloping faults all feeding into the main Seattle fault.
</P>
<P>
   Just a month ago, scientists postulated the existence of another
deadly fault, this time running north to south from the Hood River
Bridge on the Olympic Peninsula, through several populated areas on
Puget Sound west of Seattle, and down to the port city of Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   A certain paranoia is creeping in. When demolition men came to
knock down the Kingdome, longtime home of Seattle's beloved
Mariners baseball team, in January, seismologists and newspaper
editorial writers felt compelled to assure the populace there was
no danger of the explosions setting off an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, one of Seattle's leading hospitals, the
Harborview Medical Center, came begging for $257 million in public
funds to protect itself against earthquake risk. (Several critics
later accused the hospital of trying to stir up earthquake fears as
an excuse to expand and modernize at the public's expense).
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Northwest may fancy itself as the antithesis of
Southern California in many ways, but fear of the Big One _ and
exploitation of that fear _ is manifesting itself in much the same
way as it does in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, of the Geological Survey, even believes that a quake
along the San Andreas fault could have a knock-on effect reaching
all the way to Seattle in a chain reaction of geological tremors.
</P>
<P>
   If his theory is correct, it provides another demonstration of
an uncomfortable home truth: California is a lot closer than many
locals like to think. &QL;

&HT;     DON'T EXPECT MUCH FROM THE U.S.-RUSSIA SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, May 28)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After the tributes have faded, U.S.-Russian summit
meetings, such as the first formal meeting between Bill Clinton and
Vladimir Putin in Moscow next weekend, become hard-nosed
negotiating sessions at which pledges of cooperation sometimes are
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The participants often contend in the exaggerated language of
joint communiques that they have strengthened the movement toward
peace. The reality is that in the 63-year-history of such summits
sometimes they have and sometimes they have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Clinton) Moscow visit can make progress if it begins the
process of treating Russia as a serious power,'' former Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger said in an opinion-page piece for the
Washington Post on May 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will fail if it becomes the occasion for disquisitions on
Russia's domestic structure or for arms-control schemes doomed to
failure in America.''
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, Kissinger said, the two leaders must begin to
formulate a new U.S.-Russian relationship. Thus, Clinton must not
try to reform Russia's social system, and Putin must not try force
an arms control agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is confronted by additional difficulties that could
prevent the summit from producing serious long-range results.
</P>
<P>
   First, he and Putin, a former KGB agent who is new to the
Russian presidency, have not had the opportunity to know each other
as did Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, or Ronald Reagan and Mikhail
Gorbachev or Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Clinton is a lame duck with a mere eight months left in
office, and Putin undoubtedly understands enough about the American
system to realize that the president cannot make long-range
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Third, any agreement Clinton and Putin might craft on nuclear
arms control probably will be rejected by the Senate because of
opposition from Jesse Helms, the powerful chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a Senate speech April 26, Helms warned that ``this
administration's time for grand treaty initiatives is at an end.''
The 79-year-old senator added that he would be against any arms
agreement that Clinton and Putin might negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton were to bring home such a pact, the duel between the
Democratic president and the Republican Senate patriarch could
become a mini-reincarnation of a bitter battle in 1919. It was
fought between President Woodrow Wilson and Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge,
the Republican chairman of that same committee, over the Versailles
Treaty that ended World War I and created the League of Nations to
protect the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Lodge won the battle when the League was defeated in the Senate.
But history has not been kind to him and it will not be kind to
Helms if he blocks a worthwhile U.S.-Russian arms pact simply
because of his partisanship and dislike of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After Helms' announcement, the administration passed the word to
reporters last week that it expects little progress on nuclear arms
matters at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clinton and Putin achieve any long-term agreements is
probably less important than the fact that they are trying to
strengthen the friendship of recent years between the onetime Cold
War foes. Putin is said to be seeking U.S. help in resuscitating
Russia's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The start of America's rocky relationship with Russia came in
1917 when the communists deposed Czar Nicholas II and killed him
and his family. At that time, Wilson sought to befriend the
Bolsheviks and urged that they adopt democratic principles similar
to those he proposed for the peaceful settlement of World War I.
</P>
<P>
   In his biography of Wilson, August Heckscher explained that V.I.
Lenin, the Bolshevik leader, was contemptuous of Wilson and all
other heads of capitalist countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so the two great polar figures were to stand in fateful
opposition,'' Heckscher wrote, ``at the fork in the road where the
destiny of the 20th century was being decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson refused to grant diplomatic recognition to the Soviet
Union. So did his three immediate successors _ Warren G. Harding,
Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. But in 1933 Franklin D.
Roosevelt established diplomatic relations with the communist
regime.
</P>
<P>
   It took World War II, however, to bring U.S. and Soviet heads of
state together face-to face. That happened in Tehran in 1943 when
Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met with
Josef Stalin to plan their military campaign against Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the war was ending in Europe, they met at Yalta in
February 1945 to plan post-war strategy. It was there that Stalin
promised, at the urging of Roosevelt and Churchill, to restore
democracy to Poland and other countries bordering the Soviet Union.
But when FDR died two months later, Stalin had made no effort to
keep his promise.
</P>
<P>
   Then in July 1945 Roosevelt's successor, Harry Truman, and
Churchill conferred with Stalin in Potsdam. But with the Red army
occupying Eastern Europe, Stalin was not about to permit democracy
to flourish in any country there.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet leader did agree, however, to join the fight against
Japan and he kept that promise.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of World War II, the Cold War began. As
Churchill declared a year later in Fulton, Mo., ``an iron curtain''
had descended across Europe ``from Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste
in the Adriatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, every American president has met with a Soviet
or Russian leader. Each time, hope has soared and then often faded
into disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   Summits are worthwhile because they permit the leaders to take
their measure of each other. They also can produce breakthroughs
toward a more cordial relationship between the two superpowers. The
problem is: We expect too much of such meetings and therefore are
disappointed with the results.

 NEW YORK: the school.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year, many of these hand-picked 14- to 19-year-olds will be
featured in Balanchine's ``Stars and Stripes'' at the workshop
performances June 2 and June 5 at the Juilliard Theater. One recent
afternoon, Suki Schorer, one of Balanchine's appointees and a
former City Ballet principal, was running a rehearsal for the
all-male Second Regiment section (``Thunder and Gladiator'') like a
high-strung drill sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see the whole stage move!'' she shouted above the
rousing Sousa march, sweeping her arm in a huge arc. The soloist
leading the 12-boy regiment was Daniel Ulbricht, a cheerful
16-year-old from Florida now in his first term. He tore across the
studio diagonally like a gymnast heading for a handspring, took off
like a cannonball, hit a pose in midair _ knees tucked up, saluting
briskly _ landed, ran to the far corner, turned smartly and did it
again.
</P>
<P>
   The group ran the taxing six-minute dance straight through and
marched off, eyes right. ``OK,'' said Schorer brightly; then she
turned on a kid who showed up late, and didn't know the
choreography, and was he chewing gum?
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Kirstein likened SAB to West Point with good reason.
These boys work as if there's no tomorrow. Ulbricht describes his
daily schedule: three academic classes at the Professional
Performing Arts School (along with three independent-study
classes); three SAB classes; then rehearsals till as late as 9.
Somehow the plan also accommodates appearances with the company,
like his recent performances as one of the three Court Jesters in
Martins' ``Sleeping Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   For boys who like that sort of life, of course, that's just the
sort of life they like: male enrollment at the school is at an
all-time high, 82 out of a student body of 343. Yet ask Martins
whether he's overhauling the boys' program at SAB, and he replies:
``I'm not. I'm just introducing our time, as one should, updating
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there is nothing revisionist about sweetening the pot
for young men in Balanchine's academy. Just as certainly, however,
male dancing was not Balanchine's first priority; he was a
ballerina man. ``Put 16 girls on a stage, and it's everybody _ the
world,'' he said, famously. ``But put 16 boys, and it's always
nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet not only did important dancers like Edward Villella, Arthur
Mitchell and Ethan Stiefel emerge from SAB; established stars from
Martins himself to his teacher Erik Bruhn to Rudolf Nureyev and
Baryshnikov beat down the door to dance for Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   A belief in the stature of the Balanchine legacy lends both joy
and anxiety to the school's task of preparing dancers to be
civilized members of the ballet world. The charming Andrei
Kramarevsky, a Balanchine hire known as Krammy, lets the top boys,
a tuition-free class of 13 called ``special men,'' try the bravura
steps one of them calls ``the things we see on the videotapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking sharp in shirts, slacks and jazz shoes, they join the
other advanced and intermediate men to do the merengue with the
advanced girls in ballroom class. Courtesy prevails: many teachers
address the boys as ``Gentlemen''; in the courtly Boal's classes,
you can hear a pin drop.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the stylization variously called Balanchine
technique and Balanchine style is enforced at the school is
shrugged off by Mazzo. Hard-line classicists have long said that
SAB dancers overcross positions, overarticulate elbows and wrists,
shift their hips out of alignment to raise the leg in extension and
let their heels off the floor too soon in plie, the luxurious ready
position that gives ballet steps their spring and lilt. ``I'd
rather say it's a way of getting a dancer to move fast and make it
look easy,'' she says. ``Details like how you use your arms are not
even insisted on in B's choreography.''
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere you look at SAB, some danseur-in-the-rough is sorting
out something, watching himself critically in the ubiquitous
mirrors. Waiting for pas de deux class to begin, Ulbricht tries a
pirouette and delivers eight perfect revolutions, then calmly
closes fifth position. In Frame's weight-training class, intended
to help the men avoid injury while partnering, he has them stand,
face front and answer questions about their views on art. Asked
which dancer inspires him, one boy chooses American Ballet
Theater's Julio Bocca, whom he had just seen in the Broadway hit
``Fosse'': ``He was totally transformed. You can use your technique
to do anything.'' And how would he apply this to his own work?
``You have to make every plie the most important thing in the
world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a workshop ballet, he got a chance to make good. Nikolaj
Hubbe, a City Ballet principal, was rehearsing ``Konservatoriet,''
an 1849 ballet by August Bournonville.
</P>
<P>
   The cast _ in this scene, 14 girls and 4 boys _ begins in first
position, bras bas (their arms low and rounded), with a plie. To
teach them the lovely Bournonville arm positions, Hubbe has them
walk through whole passages of choreography, only indicating the
dance steps, but doing the port de bras full-out. ``Don't
allonger'' _ that is, elongate _ ``the arms and fingers,'' he tells
them. They try again. ``Ah, when you do like this _ so, so soft and
gentle _ it's heavenly,'' he responds. ``Now, let's try it with
steps, but still elegant and gentle. Don't kick it!''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the four boys come forward, stand in fifth position and
begin a difficult academic dance: brisk beats; quick, precise
turns. One boy, a dark-haired, sober 15-year-old named David
Blumenfeld, after a few corrections, executes a perfectly balanced
triple attitude turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're hired!'' Hubbe exclaims with a laugh, and the students
join in. It's a joke with an edge because, for the older students,
the workshop serves as an audition for City Ballet or the other
companies that send scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbe is called away for a moment, and while two boys start
trying turns and coax a girl or two into partnering experiments, a
few of the students take the opportunity to lie down on the floor,
like puppies; one girl rests her head on a friend's flank, eyes
open in plain fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We forget they are children,'' Hubbe says later. ``This is
such a rigorous profession.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1930s, when the Swiss developmental psychologist Jean
Piaget quizzed children to find out if they could tell the
difference between living creatures and inanimate objects, he
concluded that they defined life by figuring out which objects
could move by themselves, without an outside push or pull.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 20 years or so, that particular theory of Piaget's
has been almost completely overturned by research showing that
young children are not fooled by things like garage doors that move
by remote control. That is, children can tell the difference
between animals and machines even if the machines appear to move by
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Now children are encountering a new category of objects, things
that seem to possess intentions, preferences and other
characteristics previously reserved for living beings.
</P>
<P>
   What do children think about what it means to be alive? And at
what ages can children distinguish mechanical objects from real
animals or people? Research into these questions is still in its
earliest stages. There was a flurry of interest in children's
reactions when Tamagotchis, virtual pets from Japan, first appeared
a few years ago and then started dying on their young owners. But
the topic is attracting more attention now as seemingly intelligent
toys and other robots appear on the market in increasing variety
and numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Toys, maker of the chatty, needy Furby, will soon
introduce Shelby, a talking clam that does many of the things Furby
does. Tiger also has a new robot dog, Poo-Chi, on toy store
shelves. Panasonic is testing a robotic cat for isolated old
people. And Hasbro, with help from artificial intelligence experts,
has developed an animatronic doll that not only says ``ba-ba'' and
makes babylike facial expressions but can also mimic human
expressions in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proliferation of virtual pets is raising new questions
about what kinds of relationships seem appropriate to have with
nonbiological objects,'' said professor Sherry Turkle, a professor
and psychoanalyst who studies the sociology of science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``This is about a new kind
of relationship that we don't know enough about. We need to
continue to study this very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkle, who studies the relationships between computers and
people, is among the first researchers to stake a claim in this
fertile new area. For the past two years, she and her research
assistant, Jennifer Audley, have studied virtual pets, like
Tamagotchis and electronic dolls like Furbies. They are trying to
understand how interacting with these pet impersonators _ what
Turkle calls ``relational artifacts'' _ affects the way people
think about their human identity.
</P>
<P>
   In a research project still in its early stages, Turkle and
Audley have visited after-school centers in the Boston area to
watch the ways children 5 to 10 years old play with Furbies. They
have also sent Furbies home with children and asked the children
and their parents to keep diaries of the interactions.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Audley said, the researchers have asked the
children: ``Is it alive? Is it like a real pet? Does it know you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Strikingly,'' Audley said, ``often the answer they settled on
was, `It's not alive in a human or animal kind of way, but in a
Furby kind of way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Watching children assign personality and emotion to toys is
nothing new for children, but this category of ``sort of alive''
breaks new ground. It is showing up more and more as a first
generation of children interacts with interactive toys that need
attention and nurturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a doll of 10 years ago said, `I love you,''' Turkle said,
``the children knew that there was a little tape recorder inside.
The language did not come from a relationship of nurturance, of
there being a sense that a consciousness internal to the doll was
processing the quality of the relationship between child and
doll.''
</P>
<P>
   An emerging class of dolls and toys is designed to give exactly
that sense.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro's $100 animatronic infant, called My Real Baby, will be
in toy stores in November. The doll, which Hasbro developed with
the iRobot Corp. of Somerville, Mass., is a complex matrix of
sensors and chips. The result is an object that mimics some of a
real child's moods and needs. To be put to sleep, it must be laid
down or rocked. If it is tickled, it giggles.
</P>
<P>
   The doll also develops over time. When it is first taken out of
the box, it simply stares and coos. After the doll is played with
for a while, it starts asking for things, like its bottle. Over
time, the baby starts to form more complete sentences.
</P>
<P>
   While designing the doll, toy makers at Hasbro hired Dr. Gar
Roper, a child psychologist in Fairfield, Conn., to observe little
girls as they played with it. He noticed that the unpredictability
of the doll's responses confused the children but also fascinated
them.
</P>
<P>
   Roper said the girls seemed to consider the doll more alive than
other dolls they played with. ``They seemed to be aware that this
was a middle ground of some kind,'' he said. ``They desperately
wanted to hold it, but they were very uncertain of how to hold it.
They held it very gently, with uncertain tenderness.''
</P>
<P>
   But professor Alison Gopnik, a developmental psychologist at the
University of California at Berkeley and co-author of ``The
Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains and How Children Learn''
(William Morrow, 1999), cautioned against drawing hasty conclusions
from such behavior.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be true that the children pretended that the doll
was alive, Gopnik said, ``children behave as if practically
everything is alive when they're engaged in pretend play. That in
itself doesn't mean they're confused about what's alive and what
isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Susan Gelman, a psychologist at the University of
Michigan at Ann Arbor, agreed that even very young children could
make a distinction between animals like dogs and inanimate objects
like chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But do they maintain such a distinction even when confronted
with creatures that defy our usual expectations,'' she said, ``that
present what seems to be a fuzzy boundary between animals and
objects?''
</P>
<P>
   Gelman agreed with Turkle that the new digital dolls coming on
the market bent the familiar boundaries between the animate and the
inanimate. She said this area of study was extremely important.
``By looking at lively, responsive robotic creatures,'' she said,
``researchers can test the boundaries of some of our most
fundamental concepts in very new and provocative ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it turns out that robots pose difficulties that self-moving
machines do not, then this would be very interesting indeed,
suggesting that maybe the social, interactive features are
particularly central and salient to children.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of electronic death. The Tamagotchi,
the palm-size screen character from Japan that was hugely popular a
few years ago, demanded continual care and feeding, and it
responded to the quality of care. But no matter how attentive its
owner, Tamagotchis either died or sprouted wings after a couple of
weeks or so, often prompting gloom and guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Furbies evoked similar emotions. Some children panicked when the
toy broke, a sign to its small owners that it had died an untimely
death.
</P>
<P>
   Audley tells of midnight calls from frantic parents whose
children were beside themselves because their Furby had suddenly
gone on the blink. ``I would rush over to the house with a new
Furby, and every single time, the child showed no interest in the
new one,'' Audley recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave lots of indications that they felt betrayed, taken
in and fooled. It had revealed its nature as a machine and they
felt embarrassed and angry. They were totally unwilling to invest
that kind of emotional relationship in an object again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Children are not the only ones grappling with a new type of
lifelike behavior in objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are finding ourselves in a different world from the old
artificial-intelligence debates in which researchers argued about
whether machines could be really intelligent,'' Turkle said. ``The
new objects sidestep arguments about what is inherent in the
machines and play instead on what they evoke in us.''
</P>
<P>
   In that vein, Panasonic is currently testing a furry robotic cat
called Tama and a robotic teddy bear called Kuma, which are
intended to provide companionship to elderly people; each is
expected to cost about $500. Tama and Kuma react to touch and sound
and can be programmed to say a number of things, like reminders to
take medication.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Liao, chief technology officer in Panasonic's U.S. office,
emphasized that unlike Sony's $2,500 Aibo robotic dog _ which
wanders around the room, chases balls and even lifts its leg to
scratch _ the Panasonic creatures were not intended as
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   And what about creatures that seem to be alive but immortal?
Turkle said one woman told her that Aibo was better than a real dog
because it would not die suddenly and plunge its owner into grief.
</P>
<P>
   The comment startled Turkle, she said, putting her in mind of a
1969 story by Ray Bradbury, ``I Sing the Body Electric!'' In the
story, a robotic grandmother was unable to win the trust of a young
girl who had recently lost her mother until the girl learned that
the grandmother could not die.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways throughout the story we learn that the
grandmother is actually better than a human caretaker,'' Turkle
said, ``more able to attend to each family member's needs, less
needy, with perfect memory and inscrutable skills, and most
importantly, not mortal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mortality has traditionally defined the human condition, Turkle
said. ``A shared sense of mortality has been the basis for feeling
a commonality with other human beings,'' she said, ``a sense of
going through the same life cycle, a sense of the preciousness of
time and life, of its fragility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibilities of engaging emotionally with creatures that
will not die, whose loss we will never need to face, presents
potentially dramatic changes in our psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of other lessons learned in the cycle of life, lessons
that are less traumatic than death but still difficult?
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro, for its part, sidesteps those lessons. The company has
gone out of its way to make sure that its new doll, however
lifelike, will not disappoint young customers. Put the doll down
and it may fuss for a while. Continue to ignore it and instead of
working itself up into real screams, it quiets down and drifts off
into a blissful sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day,'' said Helen Greiner, president of
iRobot, ``it's a toy, and we've developed play patterns that don't
upset kids. If you don't change its diaper, after a while it gets
over it.''

<P>
   &UR; BY ANNE APPLEBAUM &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, while in Beijing for the (now forgotten, then
notorious) U.N. Conference on Women, I took a break from the chic
Frenchwomen with their talk of Kristeva, the earnest Germans
arguing about Jung, and the confused Cambodians, who were silently
making a quilt in honor of the great event.
</P>
<P>
   I set out for the countryside, the better to meet some actual
Chinese women, who were pretty thin on the ground at the U.N.
conference, except in the role of ``photographers'' and spies.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours from Beijing, in one of the small factory towns
that feed the city's markets, I found some. They were young peasant
women who had come to make their fortunes, sewing fake Chanel
handbags on rickety machines.
</P>
<P>
   In the workshop I visited, there were about 12 of them. They
worked downstairs, slept upstairs, and were enthusiastic about the
relative wealth and freedom which their new employment status had
conferred upon them. Most were away from their villages for the
first time in their lives, having escaped from mothers,
mothers-in-law _ and, they said happily, Communist party officials:
Moving out of the countryside, they left behind Chinese
totalitarian politics, whose singular achievement is its successful
penetration of people's private lives, personal habits, even
reproductive intentions.
</P>
<P>
   One would be hard-pressed to describe these women as
``liberated,'' in any sense that the chic Frenchwomen and earnest
Germans back in Beijing would have understood.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were they remotely interested in ``democracy,'' in the way
that their contemporaries, the veterans of Tiananmen Square, might
define it.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, crude capitalism, powered by the international
demand for fake Chanel handbags, had created a small space, free of
surveillance, for these women and their employer to inhabit. He had
a bit of money, and therefore more power than local officials. They
moved freely, spoke freely, didn't mind chatting to a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who ever lived (as I did, briefly) in the
pre-Gorbachev Soviet Union, it was a revelation: In Leningrad,
circa 1985, you didn't speak to foreigners on the street.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, the change in the lives of these women is the
only important point at stake in the debate about trade with China,
as far as ``foreigners'' are concerned. All of the other arguments
are really about America; those claiming that trade with China
would be good for Big Business or bad for Big Labor are probably
taking money from one side or the other, and can safely be ignored
in any case.
</P>
<P>
   But the claim that granting permanent most-favored-nation status
to China amounts to appeasement of what remains an extremely nasty
regime is worth taking very seriously indeed _ because if these
women were living in a 21st-century China which still resembled
20th-century Russia, it would certainly be correct.
</P>
<P>
   In a state-controlled, totalitarian economy, an economic boycott
has direct political effects. During the detente years, we were
very, very wrong to sell grain to the Soviet Union, for example: By
doing so, we postponed the inevitable crisis of state-owned Soviet
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   But China is not Russia, and Chinese capitalism has a different
dynamic from Russian state socialism. If you don't believe me,
listen not to what people are saying in Washington, but what
Chinese peasant women say on the outskirts of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly ludicrous to speak, as the Clinton
administration does, of supporting so-called ``reformers'' in the
Chinese political establishment; nor should we fool ourselves into
the self-satisfied belief that by opening trade, we can somehow
export democracy to China. But by importing and exporting people
and products, we can at least extend the sphere of personal freedom
in China, helping to devolve power from the central government to
independent entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Any change in that direction is positive _ and if you still
don't believe me, listen o Dr. Chi Su, chairman of Taiwan's
Mainland Affairs Council, who notes that China's growing tangle of
institutional problems _ unclear property rights, poor contract
enforcement, corrupt bureaucracy _ are gradually heading toward a
crisis: They are irresolvable without the rule of law, and the rule
of law is ``totally incompatible'' with the doctrine of one-party
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Although he also points out that, to date, economic change
hasn't brought about the ``democratization'' of China _ and it
won't, or at least not that crudely _ it has helped ensure that
China is, domestically, developing ``in a manner very different
from the rigidity in her external behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   We should listen to Taiwan for other reasons too _ for the
really craven aspect of U.S. foreign policy in Asia is not the
promotion of trade with China, but the outdated pretense that
Taiwan, an even more dynamic economy and a vigorous democracy,
doesn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   We will not help protect China's religious dissidents or
independent newspapers by refusing to trade with China _ given the
diversity of their economy, the Chinese government simply isn't
susceptible to that kind of boycott _ but there are plenty of other
ways to show our disapproval of the Chinese government's behavior,
most of them involving greater diplomatic recognition of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, boycotts and sanctions should always be directed not
at what people in Washington think matters _ and at the moment,
Americans care a great deal about trade and money _ but what people
in the target country care about.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing tormented white, apartheid South Africa more
exquisitely, for example, than the fact that their cricketers and
rugby players could not compete abroad: No economic sanctions could
even come close. Trade isn't the right lever to use in China.
Promotion of genuine democracy in Asia is.

<P>
   Q: My kitchen faucet leaks around the base where the swivel
spout meets the body of the faucet, and it also drips slightly when
turned off. This is a single handle ball-type faucet that has no
regular faucet washers that need periodic changing.
</P>
<P>
   Can I repair this faucet, or must I call in a plumber to replace
it completely?
</P>
<P>
   A: These faucets can be repaired, but it is sometimes difficult
to locate the precise cause of a leak or drip.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet is to buy a repair kit made for that particular
brand of faucet and then follow the directions supplied to replace
all the parts subject to wear.

   You will need a large pair of pliers to unscrew and remove the
cap under the handle, after which you can lift off the swing spout.
</P>
<P>
   A little tool supplied with these kits will enable you to remove
the cam and cam washer, then use a pair of needle nose pliers to
lift out the inlet seals and springs.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the rubber O-rings around the outside and replace these
with the new ones in the kit. Then install all the new parts as you
reassemble the faucet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have some dark greenish-gray spots on our exterior vinyl
siding and someone told us that this is some kind of fungus like
mildew. We have had a very wet spring, and he says this is what can
cause it.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think this is the problem, and if so, what can we do to
clean these stains off?
</P>
<P>
   A: It could be mildew, which is a type of fungus.
</P>
<P>
   If it is, you can probably remove it by mopping on a solution of
fresh laundry bleach and water (one part bleach mixed with three
parts water).
</P>
<P>
   Apply with a soft brush and allow to dry on the surface, then
rinse off with lots of water. (Also remember to thoroughly hose
down any shrubs or plantings nearby that the bleach may have
dripped on.)
</P>
<P>
   You can repeat this if some stains still remain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our old white bathroom sink has lost much of its gloss and
there are places where the porcelain has actually worn off, showing
dark spots of bare metal.
</P>
<P>
   We do not want to replace this sink, so can you tell me if there
is any way I can restore the glaze?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are two-part epoxy paints you can buy that can be used
to refinish the sink, but you must follow directions exactly _
especially as to the need for thoroughly cleaning the surface
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that once you paint the sink you will probably have to
re-do it periodically, depending on wear. Although, these finishes
often last for years if properly done.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have some old cane chairs I bought recently that are still
in comparatively good condition.
</P>
<P>
   What can I do to protect the caning from the weather and to keep
this material from drying out and cracking?
</P>
<P>
   A: The caning can be painted with an enamel, but most people
prefer a clear finish such as a clear varnish or similar coating.
</P>
<P>
   This will not only protect it from the elements, it will also
help shed dirt and soil, and will protect against fading and
discoloration.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The Countess,'' a drama about a sensational sex
scandal involving three prominent Victorians _ John Ruskin, the
most famous art critic of his day; John Everett Millais, Ruskin's
protege and an artist who would later gain his own fame, and
Euphemia Gray, the beautiful Scotswoman who came between them _ has
quietly defied theatrical convention. With little fanfare and
limited financing it has become the longest-running new drama of
the 1999-2000 season and is now ensconced at an Off Broadway
theater four times the size of the one where it started.
</P>
<P>
   Written by an aspiring New York novelist, produced and directed
by a former English actress who mortgaged her theater to keep it
going and supported by Millais descendants eager to finally realize
the vain efforts of their ancestors to clear their
great-great-grandmother's name, the play, at the Lamb's Theater,
has become a cause in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   This year is the centenary of Ruskin's death at the age of 80. A
demigod in the mid-19th century who dictated artistic opinion in
England, he is still an object of veneration, and thus the play is
causing consternation among devotees loath to see the details of
his unhappy marriage revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Ruskin and his era is evident in the current
celebrated show at the Tate Gallery in London about the work of
Ruskin and the Pre-Raphaelite painters, a movement that Millais
helped found and that Ruskin championed. An exhibit of Ruskiniana
at the Grolier Club in New York ended last month. In September, the
Morgan Library will open its own collection of original Ruskin
manuscripts along with correspondence known as the Bowerswell
Papers _ 100 years of letters by Ruskin, Millais and Euphemia, or
Effie, and their families and friends. A new edition of Ruskin's
``Stones of Venice,'' his third major volume of criticism, has been
published, as has the two-volume biography ``John Ruskin'' by Tim
Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Countess,'' based on historical fact, begins in 1853 as
Ruskin, who had married Effie in 1848, when he was 29 and she 19,
prepares for a trip with his wife and Millais to the Scottish
Highlands. Millais is to paint the critic's portrait. But in their
small cottage, Ruskin indulges in his perverse habit of
compromising his wife by leaving her alone with Millais. The
painter becomes blocked about the portrait and instead sketches
Effie. He is disturbed by Ruskin, a man who can bring audiences to
their feet with his resounding exhortations that ``beauty is in the
ordinary, the raw truth of life,'' but at home demeans Effie,
writing down her faults in his journal to read to his parents, who
dominated the marriage, and finally making Effie believe she was
going mad. Eventually, all that Millais understood was that he was
falling in love with his mentor's wife. What he did not yet know
was that the Ruskins had never consummated their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   On his wedding night, it is possible that Ruskin expected to
gaze upon the embodiment of a marble statue, but when he slipped
off the nightgown of his young wife, he was aghast to see the woman
beneath. ``Though her face is beautiful ... there were certain
circumstances in her person which completely checked passion,''
Ruskin later stated in court papers involving his marriage
annulment. No one, perhaps including Ruskin himself, knew why. That
he was overly fascinated by young girls in the way that another
Victorian author, Lewis Carroll, was, is known.
</P>
<P>
   The play ends as the desperate Effie, back in London with
Ruskin, leaves her husband in 1854. A little more than a year later
she and Millais were married. They would have eight children.
Ruskin never married again. In middle age he fell in love with a
10-year-old girl; her death at 24 would ultimately help plunge him
into the madness of his last years.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is not surprising that scholars have tended to sweep
this material into biographical afterthought, for in his time,
Ruskin's impact, his elegant interweaving of art and social theory,
was so great that he influenced men like Proust, Wilde and Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know that Gandhi could not put Ruskin's book `Unto This
Last' down during a train trip across Africa and said it changed
the whole course of his life?'' asked Dyke Benjamin, a member of
the Grolier Club. A tall courtly man who resembles his hero in
manner and eloquence, Benjamin was cradling a cream-colored book,
``Remembering John Ruskin,'' that he produced using original
Scottish fonts to memorialize Ruskin's most indelible phrases. The
book served as the catalog for the Grolier exhibit, which included
Benjamin's collection of Ruskin material. ``It is a gross injustice
for this genius to be depicted as a strident, shallow misogynist in
some Off Broadway play,'' Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Murphy, the author of ``The Countess'' _ the title comes
from Millais' nickname for Effie _ came upon the story in the book
``Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages'' by Phyllis Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so fascinating,'' said Murphy, who is 48. ``Here was a
man who talked about beauty and art, who married this incredibly
beautiful woman, and then set about trying to destroy her. It's
about the difference between the ideal and reality. I was
interested in finding out the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``Once I discovered that the Bowerswell Papers
were at the Morgan Library, I wanted to look at them.'' Studying
the more than 1,000 letters, Murphy remembered, ``I saw Effie being
damaged year after year, coming to believe that she had some awful
internal disease, watched her handwriting go from a sturdy Scotch
script to a shaky scrawl.'' He added, ``I think Ruskin would have
destroyed her without the help of Millais and Effie's confidante
Lady Eastlake. Eastlake was a writer of the period who was
disparaged for her feminist views. She is in my play because she
was able to unlock the secret of the Ruskin marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the annulment, Effie did not marry Millais for a year
but stayed at her family home in Bowerswell, Scotland. She is
always described as shallow and a social climber. That is
completely fictitious. Ruskin's parents described her that way. But
it persists. She left Ruskin, a very wealthy and influential man,
and married Millais, an artist who was then almost penniless. If
she were a social climber she never would have done that. When
Ruskin partisans talk about his marriage they never address the
issue that Ruskin married her and then refused to sleep with her.''
</P>
<P>
   About five years ago, Murphy had a reading of ``The Countess,''
and one of the actors told Ludovica Villar-Hauser, who owns the
small Greenwich Street Theater in the South Village, about the
play. Villar-Hauser, 39, a tall, reedy Englishwoman of Spanish and
Austrian descent, had directed a number of plays about women and
thought Murphy's play could work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't let it go,'' Villar-Hauser said. ``It stayed with
me. I identified with the script, like many women who come to the
show. I had been involved with a wonderful but very cold man. I
found it just amazing that after 150 years, they are still dragging
the woman down! She happened to be a very talented woman. She was a
pianist and fluent in three languages, but instead of leaving her
mark on the world, she was the backbone for the husbands who did.
Even the encyclopedias dismiss her as a social climber.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminded me of Princess Diana, with Prince Charles under
the spell of his mother, the attempts to keep Diana down and then
to paint her as mad. In Victorian England, it was almost as bad to
be seen to do something bad as to actually do it. I thought it time
to set the record straight.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Villar-Hauser presented the seven-character play in a nonprofit
showcase produced by the Villar-Hauser Theater Development Fund at
her 74-seat theater in March 1999. The cast included the three
actors who are currently in the principal roles: James Riordan as
Ruskin, Jennifer Woodward as Effie and Jy Murphy as Millais. ``Our
audiences were wonderful,'' the director said. ``We had people
crying, asking me afterward whether Ruskin was gay or what was
really wrong with Effie.'' In fact, when Effie was examined by
doctors to ascertain her virginity before the annulment, they
declared her ``naturally and properly formed with no impediments''
to sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became obsessed,'' Villar-Hauser recalled. ``We weren't
filling the house. Any play has a natural death, but this one
wasn't ready to die. What kept us going was the audience response
and the review in The New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The Times, Anita Gates called the play a ``serious
but wonderfully witty period drama'' with an ``excellent'' cast.
</P>
<P>
   Limited by a small advertising budget, Villar-Hauser decided to
build interest by holding weekly Victorian Nights for audiences,
with the cast, the creators, refreshments and a Victorian expert on
hand. She commissioned and displayed in the lobby a portrait of
Woodward as Effie in Pre-Raphaelite style, as well as a copy of the
letter Effie wrote her father asking him to rescue her from her
marriage. Volunteers worked the box office and became permanent
ushers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had gained a kind of cult support group but it was crazy,''
Villar-Hauser said. ``I was working 24 hours a day, seven days a
week as general manager, company manager, producer, director and
ticket seller.'' But audiences continued to grow and on March 19,
at the Samuel Beckett Theater on Theater Row, the company
celebrated its 352nd performance. It had opened there in June 1999
to generally favorable reviews.
</P>
<P>
   When the Samuel Beckett closed in March, along with other
auditoriums on Theater Row, because of construction, Villar-Hauser
decided to see whether she could reopen the play as a commercial
engagement: ``I hadn't had time to go out and meet the right money
people, not that I even knew who or how to meet them anyway. Nobody
wanted to invest in a straight play about an obscure Victorian
without pyrotechnics and dancing and car crashes. I called
everyone, even people I met on a bus.''
</P>
<P>
   Small investments arrived and then one man pledged $250,000.
This enabled ``The Countess'' to move to the Lamb's Theater on West
44th Street. But 10 days before previews were to begin on April 24,
the large donor, hurt by a dip in the stock market, pulled out.
Villar-Hauser took a loan on her Greenwich Street Theater to save
the show.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lamb's, where the play's script is sold, she still
welcomes the audience and chats during intermission. ``We are
trying to create the feeling of bringing the audience into the
play,'' she said. ``The energy has to go back and forth from stage
to audience for this play to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of ``The Countess,'' of course, traveled to England and the
descendants of Effie and Millais. ``We had been told so much about
great-great-Grandma and it was so moving to see her brought to
life,'' said Tara Millais in a telephone interview from London. She
and her brother Joshua saw the play twice at the Samuel Beckett.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bear no grudge toward Ruskin,'' Millais said, ``but as a
family we knew the BBC documentaries and the books did not tell the
truth about her. She was exiled from Queen Victoria's court for
defying the ridiculous moral code that dictated that a woman must
endure in silence whatever her lord and master dealt her.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members have become so involved in ``The Countess'' that
Millais, a film producer, said she was in the beginning stages of
turning the play into a British period costume movie. For his part,
Joshua Millais, a portrait photographer in London, has done some of
the publicity photography for the show and has spoken at several
Victorian Nights.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ruskin, a viewer of the many letters at the Morgan, their
vellum paper shimmering against the mahogany tables, can see the
passionate declarations with which his marriage to Effie Gray, who
happened to be a distant cousin, began. A thrifty Scot, Effie often
``crosshatches,'' writing two pages on one by inscribing in both
directions to save paper, if not the reader's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But some letters hint at the things that would inevitably divide
them. Writes Ruskin, in his thick tight script: ``My own Effie, my
mistress, my friend, my queen, my darling, my only love ... I can't
answer you a word today. I am going into town with my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent Grolier Club dinner celebrating Ruskin, Robert
Parks, the curator of the Bowerswell Papers at the Morgan, spoke
about the marriage. His listeners, a group of cosmopolitan
rare-book collectors, digging into plates of roast lamb, seemed to
agree among themselves that it was unfair to ``diminish'' the
reputation of an unusually complicated man, even if his life
directly contradicted his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What many people don't realize,'' said Benjamin, who was
present, ``is that Ruskin supported many girls' schools and had
very deep friendships with women _ among them Kate Greenaway,'' the
artist and illustrator. ``He championed Kate Greenaway's art and
she was in love with him. He rejected her because she was frankly
not very pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruskin also asked her to send him her illustrations of little
girls stripped of their clothes. She ignored him.
</P>
<P>
   As the Grolier evening ended, Benjamin expressed satisfaction
with at least one development. ``During the exhibition of my Ruskin
collection in April, one day there suddenly appeared little
brochures on a table for `The Countess.' And apparently at the
theater, there were fliers for my exhibition. I registered a mild
complaint to the club management and I don't know what transpired.
All I know is that after that, I never saw any more brochures.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Popeyes to enter Indonesia
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Popeyes Chicken &AMP; Biscuits has signed an agreement
with an Indonesian company to open 56 restaurants within five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Popeyes, a subsidiary of Atlanta-based AFC Enterprises, inked
the five-year development deal with Pop Indo, which operates other
restaurants and manufactures restaurant equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for as many as three Popeyes to open by the end
of the year in Jakarta and Bandung.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fairly aggressive development schedule for
Indonesia,'' said spokesman Scott Hudler. ``Asia is one of our
strongholds in terms of brand presence.'' He said the company is
also targeting Central and South America for further development.
</P>
<P>
   Popeyes, which had 1999 systemwide sales of $1 billion, has more
than 1,425 restaurants in the United States and 21 other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Popeyes, which specializes in Cajun food, also unveiled a new
``Heritage'' building design at an Old National Highway restaurant.
All restaurants developed after July 1 will sport the new look, and
the company expects to convert all its restaurants within six
years, with balconies and other features found in New Orleans'
French Quarter. The chain was founded in New Orleans in 1972 and
acquired by AFC in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Popeyes also operates the Cajun Kitchen and Popeyes Cajun Cafe
concepts.

WESTBETH, A CANVAS STILL TAKING SHAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.D.)  (Eds: also see MEIER-ARCHITECTURE) 
 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two original residents of Westbeth _ the grand
experiment in subsidized artists' housing that opened in 1970 _ sat
side by side on a planter in front of the entrance. One had a long
graying beard and a brown fedora; the other was missing some teeth
and wore a fisherman's hat.
</P>
<P>
   Like them, Westbeth is showing its age.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings, which wrap around Bethune and West Streets, look
seedy: the Corbusian curved balconies seem to be rusting away; the
industrial metal windows whistle; the inner courtyard is bleak. The
fountain on the outer courtyard has been filled with concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, on its 30th anniversary, Westbeth is poised to reclaim its
original vision. As the oldest tenants die or move out, a new wave
of artists are taking their place. A recent residential rent
increase, sanctioned by the federal agency that controls the
property, paid for much-needed roof and sidewalk replacement.
Long-term commercial leases with rents at a fraction of current
market rates _ in one case, $4 a square foot versus $20 now _ are
about to expire, clearing the way for Westbeth finally to earn some
real money.
</P>
<P>
   On the artistic front, the Westbeth Gallery, which is a showcase
for tenants' work, has begun a retrospective series that some
artists say has sparked creative fervor.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just now starting to rethink what it is Westbeth
should be doing,'' said Jack Dowling, a resident for 22 years and
the new director of the gallery. ``There's a lot of stuff happening
here now.''
</P>
<P>
   With real estate agents buzzing around the West Village like
angry hornets in search of a place to land, Westbeth residents, who
pay $350 to $650 a month for lofts with 13-foot ceilings, can count
themselves among Manhattan's luckiest: something comparable nearby
runs at least $2,000 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   When artists first applied, rents were as low as $99 a month. In
those idealistic days, a lot of things were taken on faith _ like
the applicants' verbal agreement with the interviewing committee
that, after a few years, they would move out, clearing the way for
struggling new artists.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone nodded and smiled. Hardly anyone left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be a fool to move out, with these rents and this
location,'' said George Cominskie, a photographer's agent who moved
in 17 years ago to join his partner, an artist, and remained when
his partner left. Now, the tenants' council is debating hiring a
full-time social worker to address the needs of elderly artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was conceived, we hoped Westbeth would be a way
station, an incubator,'' said Joan Kaplan Davidson, whose family
foundation, the J.M. Kaplan Fund, helped create Westbeth and who
served as its first president. ``Artists would get established and
move on. That hasn't always happened.''
</P>
<P>
   A 13-building complex with 383 apartments, Westbeth was the
novel idea of Roger Stevens, the first chairman of the National
Endowment for the Arts, and Jacob M. Kaplan, a Manhattan
philanthropist who had made his money from grape juice. In the late
1960s, the two elderly men combed the city for a site that could be
converted into subsidized lofts for artists to live and work in.
They ultimately found a whole block: the vacant shell of the famous
Bell Telephone Laboratories, where color television and the
transistor radio were developed.
</P>
<P>
   They hired Richard Meier, a friend of Kaplan's son and, at 33,
an architect looking for his big break. Seed money from the Kaplan
Fund, plus a 3 percent, $12 million mortgage from the Housing and
Urban Development Department, would finance the conversion. Artists
would be vetted, and any tenants whose income rose above the limits
would pay a surcharge. HUD would regulate, advised by an
``insider'' council of artists-residents.
</P>
<P>
   Within two years, the adaptation was finished, and the critics
were ecstatic. On May 10, 1970, Ada Louise Huxtable, then the
architecture critic of The New York Times, wrote that Westbeth
``bent (but did not break)'' almost every bureaucratic rule and
called Meier's conversion ``exemplary.'' In an interview last week,
Huxtable said Westbeth, which remains the largest artists'
live-work complex in the world, seemed at the outset ``virgin,
beautiful: both the dream and the architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   But Westbeth at 30, while still innovative in many ways, is no
longer so innocent.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 19 suicides, some tenants say, starting with
Diane Arbus, who slit her wrists in her loft a year after Westbeth
opened. In a 1995 documentary video, ``Westbeth Growing Up,'' by
Allison Prete, one resident called the place ``Death-beth.'' Prete,
who grew up there, taped children of longtime tenants complaining
of Westbeth's ``dark side,'' which included walking to school past
bodies of people who had thrown themselves from the roof.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, others spoke of the ``combustibility'' and
``volatility'' of tenants with artistic temperaments living side by
side. They point to the lawsuits: Within the last decade, TUC
Management, which runs the building, has paid out more than $1
million in legal fees, a significant chunk of it trying to evict a
handful of tenants who didn't pay their rent or who carried out
illegal alterations, and defending the building when these tenants
countersued. HUD threatened to foreclose on the property several
times, because so many tenants were behind on their rent.
</P>
<P>
   Westbeth has not always been in such turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   When the first residents moved in, many left their doors open in
the spirit of community. Artists came together over potluck
dinners; dancers worked out, in the courtyard. But that kind of
love fest ended after a rent increase was imposed in the mid-1970s,
and some tenants mounted a rent strike.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that animosity lingers, aggravated by a mid-1980s plan
to raise money by turning the building into a co-op. The co-op
proposal, which would have allowed tenants to buy their apartments
at low prices, was narrowly defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wrangling over financial matters, Westbeth is in
many ways a success. There is a 10-year wait for apartments, which
under the rules can be rented only to low- and middle-income
artists and their families. The current earnings limit is $34,200
for a three-person family and close to $50,000 for a family of six.
Artists who earn more after they move in are hit with a surcharge
of up to 60 percent. ``There are people earning millions, er, a lot
of money,'' said Bradford Winston, president of the management
company.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the atmosphere, many tenants say, is exactly what it was
designed to be: conducive to creativity.
</P>
<P>
   The Merce Cunningham Dance Company, a commercial tenant since
1971, rehearses on the 11th floor. Hans Haacke, a longtime
resident, set in motion an art-world shock this spring when his
piece for the Whitney Museum's Biennial, ``Sanitation,'' linked
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to the Nazis. The photographer Evelyn
Hofer still lives here. After Joseph Chaikin, the actor and
director and a Westbeth resident, had a stroke in 1984, Sam Shepard
drove cross-country to welcome him home from the hospital, and the
two locked themselves in the bedroom to finish up ``The War in
Heaven,'' a monologue subsequently performed by Chaikin, despite
his aphasia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samuel Beckett came to a reading I gave of `Texts for
Nothing,''' Chaikin recalled in a halting voice. ``That was right
here in this apartment.'' Artists of all ages and degrees of career
success say that although Westbeth has been a significant part of
their creative life, it hasn't eliminated their travails.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been able to make a living doing painting,'' said
Barbara Prete, a painter who raised her three children in a
1,100-square-foot loft. She took on freelance writing and editing
to bolster her uneven income from art. ``The majority of artists
here are still struggling,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ones who are struggling just to get into Westbeth?
``If you've waited eight or 10 years,'' Prete said, ``you're
probably no longer a young artist.''

NEW YORK: young artist.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barton Lidice Benes, 57, is a collagist who has been assembling
found objects in his one-room studio at Westbeth for more than half
of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Although his is not a household name, he has achieved a fair
degree of success: a New York gallery represents him and he
recently attended an opening of a show of his works in a Swedish
castle.
</P>
<P>
   Benes is HIV positive, and although his health is fine for the
moment, some of his most recent work has death as its leitmotif.
Other works stacked in the small space are acid comments on fame.
</P>
<P>
   Within wooden cubbyholes, he has placed symbols of death _
funerary ashes and other reliquaries. In one slot he has placed a
dried rose. The label reads: ``From the Rose Garden, Village of
Lidice, Czech Republic, Destroyed by the Nazis, 1942.'' (He was
born that year and named after the town.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe what people send me: Here's a piece of
O.J.'s famous glove,'' he said, brandishing a well-worn brown glove
sent by Alan Dershowitz, the lawyer. In the master cubbyhole over
his desk, where he stores objects before incorporating them into
final works, there is a piece of Jamie Lee Curtis' string bikini
and a twig from what is said to be the broom that swept Mao's room
when he was a student.
</P>
<P>
   Benes says he has willed his entire apartment _ a mix of his own
work and his friends' and African paintings and masks _ to the
North Dakota Museum of Art in Grand Forks, to be installed in the
museum as a work of art.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, Benes was eking out his artistic existence in
a $400-a-month walk-up apartment on East 18th Street. When he read
about Westbeth in The Village Voice, he jumped at the chance, even
though that part of the West Village was rife with drug dealers and
transvestite prostitutes. At Westbeth, he paid $99 a month. ``We
were only supposed to stay five years,'' he said. ``Thank God they
never enforced it.''
</P>
<P>
   Benes doesn't look for trouble; he doesn't sit on any committee
or enter the fray of Westbeth politics, which can be rugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a loner,'' Benes said. ``I'm friendly, but I'm a loner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, they had big plans _ everyone kept their
doors open and everybody loved each other,'' he continued. ``But it
doesn't happen that way in life, especially life among artists. I
have a nice place to do my work. I'm pretty happy here.'' &QL;

SUMMER BRINGS OPPORTUNITY FOR EYE-OPENING CHURCH YOUTH TRIPS
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike McDonough couldn't believe the poverty he saw in the small
villages outside Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old saw people living in homes that could fit inside
his bedroom. They were without the luxuries of dependable
electricity or supermarkets filled with every food imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they survive and they're happy, the happiest people in the
world,'' said McDonough, 18. ``The material means nothing to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonough and other young people from Woods Chapel Baptist
Church in Arlington, Texas, spent part of last summer putting roofs
on unfinished churches in Kenya during a mission trip.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to go to Nicaragua with his church this summer, joining
the thousands of youth who participate in mission trips in and out
of the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   The mission trips McDonough takes are organized through the
Challengers program, sponsored by Texas Baptist Men.
</P>
<P>
   It's a program for young men in grades seven through 12, said Al
Wise, pastor at Woods Chapel. Churches determine where the greatest
need is and gather volunteers to meet it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time period is a spiritual rite of passage,'' Wise said.
``This is a chance for them spiritually to grow, so when they do
become adults doing missions, it's like breathing. It just comes
naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   Curt Grice, youth minister at First Baptist Church in Arlington,
said the trips prepare young people for a life of service.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us as a church, it helps to train missionaries,'' he said.
``It gives life experience to kids who will be concerned about
their world as adults because they had this experience as
teen-agers.''
</P>
<P>
   First Baptist's high-school-age students will take trips to
Mexico and the border town of Laredo. Its junior-high youth will go
on a weekend trip to Houston, which will prepare them for the more
intense 10-day trips in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Other religious-group youth trips focus on educational
enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish youth often participate in cultural exchanges to Israel
during the summer, said Rabbi Jeffrey Kaye of Congregation Beth
Shalom. The trips are taken through the Jewish Reform Movement.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, high school sophomores join with others from across
the country and spend six weeks in cultural-exchange programs with
Israeli teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally, there are thousands of Jewish teens from all over
the country that participate,'' Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   For teens, trips abroad are important because it exposes them to
different cultures, Grice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious thing is, it causes them to re-examine their
life,'' he said. ``It helps them appreciate what they have. It
helps them realize they don't need everything they want, and it
gives them a concern for the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The trips that Grice's groups take usually center on manual
labor, evangelism and Scripture distribution, backyard Bible clubs
or vacation Bible schools. When the group goes to Mexico this
summer, it will hold a basketball clinic for the native youth, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest work for the group is the construction or
renovation of buildings for church sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year in San Antonio, the junior high kids spent two days
landscaping a little church down there, and that's as hard as most
of them have ever worked in their life,'' Grice said. ``In fact, it
may have been as hard as I've worked in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the stumbling blocks for youth is the cost. The trips can
be as much as $2,500 per person, he said.
</P>
<P>
   First Baptist tries to subsidize its trips. Churches often have
funds set aside for trips and can guide youth toward fund-raising
opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   World Changers, a program under the North American Mission Board
in Georgia, charges $235 for its trips to cities in the United
States and in other countries, Stephanie Lim said. The cost covers
food and lodging while the youth are working, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many churches undertake fund-raising projects throughout the
year to offset the costs. This summer, high school students from
First Christian Church in Arlington will do flood-relief work in
North Carolina for a week. The church recently held a yard sale to
raise money for the trip and other projects.
</P>
<P>
   Working toward a goal, as well as eye-opening experiences with
different cultures, are all part of the spiritual journey, Wise
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reasons we are what we are, because of
missions,'' he said. ``It gives them the opportunity to have
firsthand experience. It helps them to grow.''

CANNES SNUB HAS ITALY AGAIN FRETTING ABOUT FILMMAKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Also moving in `i' category.) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ When Roberto Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful'' won an Oscar
for best foreign film in 1999, many hoped that his success signaled
a renaissance of Italian cinema after years of slump and slumber.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   This year not a single Italian film was selected in the main
competition at the Cannes Film Festival, a rebuff that stirred
outrage, despair and passionate hand-wringing here. Yet even in
Italy domestic films are in decline, selling only a little more
than half as many tickets this year as they did last year.
Thirty-five years ago, Italy produced almost 300 films annually.
Now, the figure is about 100. One in five doesn't find a
distributor, and many of the others are moved out of theaters after
a few days to make way for the latest American blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Italians are talking again, as they have been off and on for 30
years, about the ``crisis'' of cinema, a word usually reserved for
falling governments and train strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a slight difference this time. For years film
lovers have bemoaned the absence of a new generation of filmmakers
who could match the great postwar Italian directors, Fellini, De
Sica, Pasolini, Visconti and Rossellini. Yet in a culture where
even untested directors are reverently treated as ``autori'' and
given free rein, as well as government loans and grants, filmmakers
and critics are beginning to lament the lack of shrewd,
tough-minded producers who can discipline screenwriters and coax a
commercial hit from a director's inchoate vision.
</P>
<P>
   The late Franco Cristaldi, a producer who is perhaps best known
in the United States as a former husband of Claudia Cardinale, is
revered in Italy as a film impresario who, among other things,
trimmed Giuseppe Tornatore's ``Cinema Paradiso'' by 47 minutes,
which helped it win an Oscar for best foreign film in 1990. ``It is
really sad; there are no Cristaldis today,'' said Deborah Young, a
film critic for Variety who is based here. Young, a veteran of
Italian film festivals, said, ``You see the same problems over and
over, the lack of script supervision and executive control.''
</P>
<P>
   Tornatore is still making films, but his latest, ``Malena,'' is
being financed and produced by Miramax studios, a business
arrangement that may signal the studio's interest in Italian films
but also underlines the absence of strong financial and executive
support in Tornatore's homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the relationship between American producers and Italian
directors is always easy. Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of
Miramax, recently told Italian reporters that he found Tornatore
headstrong and joked that he doubted they would ever work together
again. Italian filmmakers once scorned the commercialism of
Hollywood movies. Now younger Italians are complaining about the
self-indulgent and unbusiness-like style of moviemaking
Italian-style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Film in Italy is still seen as an art form, not a commercial
product,'' said Marco Pugini, a young producer whose film company,
Panorama, makes international productions. ``The market is driven
by authors who write their own scripts, and it is hard for the
producer to say, `Sorry, the script isn't working.'''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Italian government gave filmmakers $60 million in
loans and grants. The handout is less generous than French
subsidies, and many film reviewers contend their government should
do more.
</P>
<P>
   Producers like Pugini, however, argue that state subsidies are a
crutch that helps directors avoid the realities of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Even with government grants, Italian film budgets are small,
averaging about $2 million per picture. The result is that Italian
film is mostly restricted to two forms: low-budget art films,
mostly morose coming-of-age-in-the-provinces tales, and big budget,
hugely successful ribald comedies that make ``Dumb and Dumber''
seem smart.
</P>
<P>
   Christian De Sica, the son of Vittorio De Sica, is the king of
the latter genre, an actor and director whose most recent film,
``Christmas Holidays 2000,'' in which he played his usual role, an
antic, hollering husband with a roving eye, was one of the year's
10 top-grossing films. He is among those who felt affronted by the
Cannes Film Festival's rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cannes decision made me angry,'' he said. ``As if the
French didn't also make a lot of stupid movies.''
</P>
<P>
   De Sica conceded, however, that Italian cinema was in a slump:
``Thank God my films are a big success, but there is a crisis.
There is no Fellini, De Sica, Rossellini anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   De Sica complained that Italians do not revere their own
cinematic history, relying on Americans like Martin Scorsese and
Steven Spielberg to restore and preserve the great postwar
masterpieces.

<P>
   De Sica and his brother, Manuel, alarmed celluloid purists when
they restored their father's film ``Miracle in Milan.'' In the
original, famous final scene when all the characters fly over Milan
on broomsticks, headed east in a subliminal suggestion of a
workers' paradise in Russia, the nylon strings holding up the
actors are faintly visible. De Sica's children decided to airbrush
the strings, wiping out one of film buffs' beloved production
errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home, my father always complained about those strings,'' De
Sica said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cecchi Gori Group is one of Italy's biggest movie companies,
an empire that produces or distributes 30 percent of Italian films
and owns 70 screens in 45 theaters. It was founded in 1957 by Mario
Cecchi Gori, a legendary producer who helped bring ``Mediterraneo''
to the screen and wrote screenplays. The company is now run by his
son Vittorio Cecchi Gori, a senator who, in an echo of the media
tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, combines the movie business with politics
and also owns Fiorentina, a Florence soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   Cecchi Gori's television stations are less profitable than the
state channels or Berlusconi's dominant networks, and the company
has run into cash flow trouble, creating payment disputes with MGM
and Miramax, though Cecchi Gori said that those
``misunderstandings'' had been resolved. The Senator, as his aides
call him, is a flamboyant figure, a voluble, staccato speaker who
looks like a young, tanned Rodney Dangerfield and lives in a
sumptuous Renaissance palace built for the Borghese family.
</P>
<P>
   Industry insiders do not view Cecchi Gori as the hands-on
producer his father was, however. It is his wife, Rita Rusic, from
whom Cecchi Gori is now separated, who is credited with producing
the films of Leonardo Pieraccioni, silly farces that in Italy have
outsold many of Benigni's most popular comedies.
</P>
<P>
   The company distributed Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful''
domestically, and it became Italy's top money-making film,
outselling Bertolucci's ``Last Tango in Paris'' and Sergio Leone's
``For a Few Dollars More.'' But Benigni produced the film himself,
and worldwide distribution was taken over by Miramax, which
insisted on deep cuts in the first half to shape it more to
international tastes _ and the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Cecchi Gori was asked in an interview why Italian cinema was in
a slump. ``Because 30 percent of Italian moviegoers go in without
paying,'' he replied sharply. ``I personally verified the receipts
at one of our theaters last summer. There were 2,000 people there,
and 400 didn't pay for their tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   This year a few Italian films veered from the pattern and did
well at the Italian box office, which is dominated by American
blockbusters like ``Runaway Bride'' and ``Mission to Mars.'' One
was ``Pane e Tupilani'' (``Bread and Tulips''), a slight romantic
comedy directed by Silvio Soldini about a housewife who goes to
Venice on a lark to escape her dreary life in Pescara. It was
rejected by Cannes, but shown there out of competition. Last month
it won nine David di Donatello awards, Italy's version of the
Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Another, ``Canone Inverso,'' a Cecchi Gori film directed by
Ricky Tognazzi, the son of the famous comic actor Ugo Tognazzi, is
a more ambitious, international co-production. The film presents a
sprawling love story of Czech violinists caught up in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Neither film can be described as a masterpiece, but the two are
viewed by Italian filmmakers as encouraging departures from the
usual mediocre fare.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Pane e Tulipani' is the best we have right now, but in an
earlier time, it would have been seen as middling, certainly not
excellent,'' said Filice Laudadio, president of Cinecitta Holding,
Italy's best-known studio.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Canone Inverso' is not a great film, but it is interesting
within the Italian context,'' he said. ``For one thing, it is not
about Ricky Tognazzi, and that is already important.''
</P>
<P>
   Laudadio, who has served as director of the Venice Film Festival
and many others, said that Italians, having been spoon-fed silly
comedies, had lost their taste for difficult, troubling movies. He
cited the commercial failure of ``Garage Olimpo,'' a critically
praised film by Marco Bechis, who is half Italian, half Argentine.
The film addresses police torture in Argentina under the military
junta.
</P>
<P>
   Laudadio said that screenwriting was an ailing craft in Italy.
In 1985 he established the Solinas Prize, named after Franco
Solinas, the late screenwriter who wrote ``The Battle of Algiers''
for the director Gillo Pontecorvo. But he conceded that the prize
had done little to stimulate better scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Laudadio also blamed television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lowers the level of all films and flattens the imagination
of filmmakers and audiences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, many films are jointly produced with state television
or are presold to networks to secure financing, which further
narrows the vision of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Laudadio was not optimistic that the current slump would
eventually force Italian directors and screenwriters to adapt and
produce better films. ``The outlook isn't so bad from a commercial
point of view, and there are some great films, like `Garage
Olimpo,''' he said, adding, ``We still have to hit rock bottom.''

really sad; there are no Cristaldis today,'' said Deborah Young, a
film critic for Variety who is based here. Young, a veteran of
Italian film festivals, said, ``You see the same problems over and
over, the lack of script supervision and executive control.''
</P>
<P>
   Tornatore is still making films, but his latest, ``Malena,'' is
being financed and produced by Miramax studios, a business
arrangement that may signal the studio's interest in Italian films
but also underlines the absence of strong financial and executive
support in Tornatore's homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the relationship between American producers and Italian
directors is always easy. Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of
Miramax, recently told Italian reporters that he found Tornatore
headstrong and joked that he doubted they would ever work together
again. Italian filmmakers once scorned the commercialism of
Hollywood movies. Now younger Italians are complaining about the
self-indulgent and unbusiness-like style of moviemaking
Italian-style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Film in Italy is still seen as an art form, not a commercial
product,'' said Marco Pugini, a young producer whose film company,
Panorama, makes international productions. ``The market is driven
by authors who write their own scripts, and it is hard for the
producer to say, `Sorry, the script isn't working.'''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Italian government gave filmmakers $60 million in
loans and grants. The handout is less generous than French
subsidies, and many film reviewers contend their government should
do more.
</P>
<P>
   Producers like Pugini, however, argue that state subsidies are a
crutch that helps directors avoid the realities of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Even with government grants, Italian film budgets are small,
averaging about $2 million per picture. The result is that Italian
film is mostly restricted to two forms: low-budget art films,
mostly morose coming-of-age-in-the-provinces tales, and big budget,
hugely successful ribald comedies that make ``Dumb and Dumber''
seem smart.
</P>
<P>
   Christian De Sica, the son of Vittorio De Sica, is the king of
the latter genre, an actor and director whose most recent film,
``Christmas Holidays 2000,'' in which he played his usual role, an
antic, hollering husband with a roving eye, was one of the year's
10 top-grossing films. He is among those who felt affronted by the
Cannes Film Festival's rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cannes decision made me angry,'' he said. ``As if the
French didn't also make a lot of stupid movies.''
</P>
<P>
   De Sica conceded, however, that Italian cinema was in a slump:
``Thank God my films are a big success, but there is a crisis.
There is no Fellini, De Sica, Rossellini anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   De Sica complained that Italians do not revere their own
cinematic history, relying on Americans like Martin Scorsese and
Steven Spielberg to restore and preserve the great postwar
masterpieces.

ROME :  postwar masterpieces .

<P>
   De Sica and his brother, Manuel, alarmed celluloid purists when
they restored their father's film ``Miracle in Milan.'' In the
original, famous final scene when all the characters fly over Milan
on broomsticks, headed east in a subliminal suggestion of a
workers' paradise in Russia, the nylon strings holding up the
actors are faintly visible. De Sica's children decided to airbrush
the strings, wiping out one of film buffs' beloved production
errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home, my father always complained about those strings,'' De
Sica said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cecchi Gori Group is one of Italy's biggest movie companies,
an empire that produces or distributes 30 percent of Italian films
and owns 70 screens in 45 theaters. It was founded in 1957 by Mario
Cecchi Gori, a legendary producer who helped bring ``Mediterraneo''
to the screen and wrote screenplays. The company is now run by his
son Vittorio Cecchi Gori, a senator who, in an echo of the media
tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, combines the movie business with politics
and also owns Fiorentina, a Florence soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   Cecchi Gori's television stations are less profitable than the
state channels or Berlusconi's dominant networks, and the company
has run into cash flow trouble, creating payment disputes with MGM
and Miramax, though Cecchi Gori said that those
``misunderstandings'' had been resolved. The Senator, as his aides
call him, is a flamboyant figure, a voluble, staccato speaker who
looks like a young, tanned Rodney Dangerfield and lives in a
sumptuous Renaissance palace built for the Borghese family.
</P>
<P>
   Industry insiders do not view Cecchi Gori as the hands-on
producer his father was, however. It is his wife, Rita Rusic, from
whom Cecchi Gori is now separated, who is credited with producing
the films of Leonardo Pieraccioni, silly farces that in Italy have
outsold many of Benigni's most popular comedies.
</P>
<P>
   The company distributed Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful''
domestically, and it became Italy's top money-making film,
outselling Bertolucci's ``Last Tango in Paris'' and Sergio Leone's
``For a Few Dollars More.'' But Benigni produced the film himself,
and worldwide distribution was taken over by Miramax, which
insisted on deep cuts in the first half to shape it more to
international tastes _ and the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Cecchi Gori was asked in an interview why Italian cinema was in
a slump. ``Because 30 percent of Italian moviegoers go in without
paying,'' he replied sharply. ``I personally verified the receipts
at one of our theaters last summer. There were 2,000 people there,
and 400 didn't pay for their tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   This year a few Italian films veered from the pattern and did
well at the Italian box office, which is dominated by American
blockbusters like ``Runaway Bride'' and ``Mission to Mars.'' One
was ``Pane e Tupilani'' (``Bread and Tulips''), a slight romantic
comedy directed by Silvio Soldini about a housewife who goes to
Venice on a lark to escape her dreary life in Pescara. It was
rejected by Cannes, but shown there out of competition. Last month
it won nine David di Donatello awards, Italy's version of the
Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Another, ``Canone Inverso,'' a Cecchi Gori film directed by
Ricky Tognazzi, the son of the famous comic actor Ugo Tognazzi, is
a more ambitious, international co-production. The film presents a
sprawling love story of Czech violinists caught up in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Neither film can be described as a masterpiece, but the two are
viewed by Italian filmmakers as encouraging departures from the
usual mediocre fare.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Pane e Tulipani' is the best we have right now, but in an
earlier time, it would have been seen as middling, certainly not
excellent,'' said Filice Laudadio, president of Cinecitta Holding,
Italy's best-known studio.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Canone Inverso' is not a great film, but it is interesting
within the Italian context,'' he said. ``For one thing, it is not
about Ricky Tognazzi, and that is already important.''
</P>
<P>
   Laudadio, who has served as director of the Venice Film Festival
and many others, said that Italians, having been spoon-fed silly
comedies, had lost their taste for difficult, troubling movies. He
cited the commercial failure of ``Garage Olimpo,'' a critically
praised film by Marco Bechis, who is half Italian, half Argentine.
The film addresses police torture in Argentina under the military
junta.
</P>
<P>
   Laudadio said that screenwriting was an ailing craft in Italy.
In 1985 he established the Solinas Prize, named after Franco
Solinas, the late screenwriter who wrote ``The Battle of Algiers''
for the director Gillo Pontecorvo. But he conceded that the prize
had done little to stimulate better scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Laudadio also blamed television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lowers the level of all films and flattens the imagination
of filmmakers and audiences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, many films are jointly produced with state television
or are presold to networks to secure financing, which further
narrows the vision of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Laudadio was not optimistic that the current slump would
eventually force Italian directors and screenwriters to adapt and
produce better films. ``The outlook isn't so bad from a commercial
point of view, and there are some great films, like `Garage
Olimpo,''' he said, adding, ``We still have to hit rock bottom.''

   Leontyne Price, the reigning diva of the 1960s and '70s, was
chatting with National Public Radio during intermission in a
broadcast from the San Francisco Opera. Who, the interviewer asked,
were the singers who had shown Price the way? The last of the names
she rattled off in the tones of an empress was ``La Callas.'' She
had turned opera into something people really cared about, Price
said, ``like baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Like baseball, all the arts need their heroes. But the art of
opera, unlike baseball or hockey or skiing or even tennis, belongs
to a frightening degree to custodians who choose to live in the
past. ``The garland briefer than a girl's,'' A.E. Housman called
the athlete's glory in a famous poem; in sports, records exist to
be shattered. But the vestals of opera (critics, biographers, a
vocal clique of reactionary fans) treat the starry dead like so
many Babe Ruths, and the living like riffraff from a farm team in
an age when the major leagues have ceased to exist.
</P>
<P>
   The public at large wants nothing more than to be swept away in
real time, as the nightly, obligatory ovations in our major opera
houses prove. To some, those ovations merely prove how deep the art
has sunk. ``Madame So-and-So was just a house soprano in the Polish
provinces,'' say the censorious, who are incapable of enjoyment but
cannot stay away. ``If she came along today, she could write her
own ticket from Vienna, Milan and London to New York and San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes. And if we could travel back to any era we liked, what
would we find? A few real divinities here and there, working their
miracles against the backdrop mostly of mere routine if not
mediocrity and incompetence. Much has changed in the world, but not
this. Chronicles of those who were there make this truth very
clear. So, in their way, do field trips to the provinces, where
time stands still. (Try Parma.)
</P>
<P>
   For Price, Callas was no death's head but a spur to greatness.
Why should it be otherwise today? The most important lesson Callas
taught her fellow artists was that at the level of genius, a
performer is as much a creator as a playwright, a composer, a
choreographer. The same sovereignty of imagination that transforms
experience into an ``original'' work of art may be brought to bear
on the realization of the words and notes on the page or the steps
of a dance in performance. Such art is perishable _ it is consumed
in its creation _ but it is not of a lesser order. And it leaves
its traces.
</P>
<P>
   What opera needs, at least as much as great voices, is great
personalities. Not ``divas,'' in the debased sense of egomaniacs
with mannerisms, but intrepid explorers of the human condition,
each a Ulysses who has traveled far, seen much, felt deeply.
Explorers who convey the fullness of experience through music, word
and gesture, touching, in ways unique to themselves, the chord of
the universal. At this level, singing a role is no more an act of
``reproduction'' than writing it in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   A current truism of operatic commentary (echoed also in
criticism of instrumentalists and conductors) is that
conservatories and young-artist programs are churning out
interchangeable nonentities, good boys and girls who are well
prepared but anonymous. The old Countess of Tchaikovsky's ``Queen
of Spades'' speaks for fogies of all ages as she mourns the gilded
memory of her youth: ``Who are the dancers now?'' she asks. ``Who
sings? Little nobodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Little nobodies? Actually, there are quite a few candidates for
induction in the Olympian hall of fame out there, at or near their
prime. The bewitching Cecilia Bartoli, the Dickensian Bryn Terfel
and the glamorous Renee Fleming are three whose names come
instantly to mind, but they are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Looking no farther than the Metropolitan Opera, we have seen
within recent seasons the radiant Finnish soprano Karita Mattila as
Elsa in ``Lohengrin,'' the sumptuous Russian mezzo-soprano Olga
Borodina as the Philistine siren in Saint-Saens' ``Samson et
Dalila'' and the German Rene Pape, noblest of basses, as a pair of
Wagnerian kings.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jane Eaglen, the heroine of Wagner's ``Tristan und
Isolde'' and ``Der Ring des Nibelungen'' this season, is she the
long-awaited Real Thing or the next Rita Hunter? That singer _ not
so towering as Eaglen but equally larger than life _ was another
dramatic soprano from England, praised to the skies by the
Anglophile music critic Andrew Porter, whose English translation of
the ``Ring'' she sang and recorded with the English National Opera.
Porter did his vain best to sell her to the American public but had
to admit that her appearances in New York never lived up to the
showing she made in London.
</P>
<P>
   To do her justice, Hunter gave value for money in daunting
assignments when no one else was at hand to do better. So does
Eaglen. But does she leave a lasting imaginative stamp on the
characters she plays? It may be too soon to say.
</P>
<P>
   As the doll in ``Les Contes d'Hoffmann'' _ visibly expecting,
whirling on point while tossing off the most brilliant, intricate
and altitudinous roulades _ the French coloratura soprano Natalie
Dessay did so for sure. Catherine Malfitano's Emilia Marty in ``The
Makropulos Case'' was an electrifying creation, hailed as such by
critics and audiences alike. The Carmen of Waltraud Meier, slammed
in the press, struck me as no less authentic and persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   Across the plaza at the New York City Opera, Lauren Flanigan
this season found in Susan B. Anthony, of Virgil Thomson's ``Mother
of Us All,'' an assignment to justify the sometimes hyperbolic
praise her fierce, unsentimental, even bitter interpretations
regularly generate. The countertenor Bejun Mehta, breathing fire in
music of Handel at City Opera, and even more in his out-of-the-blue
debut with Millennial Arts Productions, has demonstrated decidedly
mythic potential. Alas, Angela Gheorghiu's Violetta in ``La
Traviata,'' once announced by the Met, never materialized
hereabouts; but in a video from Covent Garden, her disarming
portrayal combines the personal beauty and warmth of a Julia
Roberts with the haunting vocal pathos of a Claudia Muzio. We
definitely missed something there.
</P>
<P>
   Argue as we may about particulars, Olympians are very much with
us. And among them, there is a particularly rare, particularly
fascinating subspecies, metaphorically the most operatic of them
all. Call them the sacred monsters. As the term suggests, there is
in these uncompromising, stubborn, even nettlesome creatures at
least a touch of the demonic. They are laws unto themselves. They
must have their way. Olympians go the distance. Sacred monsters go
too far. They conquer and divide.
</P>
<P>
   Terfel is one, though less controversial than some. His
performances have of late taken on a histrionic, highly italicized
character some critics suggest he might tone down. Terfel knows
what they think and proceeds his way, undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   With more dubious wisdom, Gheorghiu once refused to manage a
phrase of Verdi's as Georg Solti gently insisted, setting her own
naive, literalistic notions above the experience and expertise of
his long lifetime. Talent and a rage for control may be two sides
of a single coin.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The epitome of the sacred monster at the moment is surely the
Argentine tenor Jose Cura, 38. So far, New Yorkers have seen him
just three times, in a single production, as the Sicilian lothario
Turiddu in Mascagni's ``Cavalleria Rusticana,'' amid the wreckage
of the once picturesque staging by Franco Zeffirelli, woefully led
by Carlo Rizzi and partnered by the uncongenial Santuzza of Dolora
Zajick. Thanks to Placido Domingo in his capacity as artistic
director of the Washington Opera, audiences in the capital have
taken Cura's measure in two of his signature roles: Saint-Saens'
Samson and Verdi's Otello.
</P>
<P>
   In the biblical spectacular, he bore the destiny of the
despondent Chosen People on heroic shoulders, his prophetic song
ringing forth with dark, blazing grandeur. His authority was total.
But his last Washington ``Otello'' this spring was an altogether
more daring affair. Of the British stage idol Edmund Kean, Samuel
Coleridge wrote, ``To see him act is like reading Shakespeare by
flashes of lightning,'' and so it was with Cura in Verdi's
Shakespearean mode.
</P>
<P>
   Praise or censure? That depends on your point of view. Between
lightning flashes fell long spells of pitch dark. On prior
occasions in Europe, Cura had executed the notes with a
scrupulousness that had only boosted his tremendous conception of
the part. This time, rather than sing the music, he chose to
channel the character. Call it extreme music drama, and say, if you
can, whether it unfolded through or in spite of the music. Over the
radio or on a recording, it might have sounded grotesque, but it
was hair-raising to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who witnessed Cura's Washington Otello is Barbara
Cook, the Broadway star of midcentury who created the roles of
Marian the Librarian in ``The Music Man'' and Cunegonde in
``Candide,'' and continues to wrap audiences around her finger in
cabaret and concert performances. (One prominent London critic has
repeatedly placed her artistry on a par with that of Callas.)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike critics, whose professional obligation to endure upward
of a hundred evenings of opera a year many have patently come to
regret, Cook has the luxury of attending purely as the spirit moves
her. For the last year or so, between engagements of her own, she
has traveled as far afield as Madrid, Paris and London to keep up
with Cura's performances.
</P>
<P>
   Why such devotion? ``It's the total package,'' Cook said
recently. ``In any era, only a very few people are at the pinnacle.
I can't think of anybody who sings as well, who acts as well, who
moves as well. It's like watching a great baseball player who has
this terrific masculine grace. Whatever things might be wrong with
Jose's performances, he has a concentration that pulls you right
into his world.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, viewers in more than a hundred countries will be
tuning in for their Cura fix in a live telecast of ``La Traviata,''
spread out over installments on June 3 and June 4, and shot in what
are billed as authentic Paris locations. (Cinema verite meets
Masterpiece Theater.) The prima donna is the hitherto unknown Eteri
Gvazava, of Siberia, cast, Cura says, after the sort of talent
search that produced Hollywood's Scarlett O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   By rights, Verdi's tragedy of the fallen woman redeemed by
suffering is the soprano's opera, but this time it may be the
tenor's. Not that Alfredo Germont, the romantic but callow
bourgeois papa's boy who woos Violetta from her life of soulless
pleasure, is the sort of character one associates with Cura's
brooding macho presence.
</P>
<P>
   Cura has admitted as much, adding: ``Alfredo has gotten the
greatest courtesan in Paris to give up everything for him. There
must be a reason.'' Americans may decide for themselves in the
fall, when the show is expected to appear on PBS; a Teldec CD of
the soundtrack, conducted by Zubin Mehta, goes on sale here in
July.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree seldom if ever matched in the annals of opera, Cura
_ also a composer and conductor _ marches to his own drum. On
``Verismo,'' his latest CD for Erato, he dedicates a whole program
to a style of the late 19th and early 20th centuries commonly
thought vulgar and sensationalistic. Acting as his own conductor,
he sets out to redefine it as a school of chaste refinement.
</P>
<P>
   In the hit-and-run show stopper ``Amor ti vieta,'' from
Giordano's dismal ``Fedora,'' the delicacy of the phrasing (lines
taken in a single breath alternating with lines of similar length
taken in two) is as unusual as it is natural and discreet. There
are discoveries like this to be made throughout. And nowhere will
you find Cura clinging, in self-indulgent spaghetti-tenor fashion,
to top notes the composer actually wrote or did not.
</P>
<P>
   On his very best vocal behavior, Cura here gives the lie to
those who have said that he has no technique. What we hear, by
contrast, in such daredevil performances as the Washington
``Otello'' is a self-conscious, highly idiosyncratic technique
fraught with peril. How well it will serve Cura in the long run
remains to be seen. Self-immolation is not actually required of
sacred monsters, but longevity is not always their strong suit.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever lies ahead, Cura has already earned his place as one of
the most supremely original performers of the age. But gentler
Olympians, too, are capable of redefining the terms by which the
game is played.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Fleming. For the last few seasons, it has
seemed that she can do no wrong. In Mozart and Strauss, audiences
delight in her floating pianissimo. In bel canto, she dazzles with
her coloratura and impromptu leaps to the stratosphere. William
Christie, the Baroque specialist, who recently collaborated with
her on Handel's ``Alcina,'' went wild for her rococo inflections, a
carry-over from her youthful experience in jazz. The sold-out signs
go up even when she sings a contemporary, all-American program.
</P>
<P>
   By common consent, the foundation on which Fleming's stardom
rests is the sheer beauty of her voice, a property as axiomatic as
the propositions of Euclid. John Kander _ the composer of ``The
Visit,'' due on Broadway next spring, starring Angela Lansbury, and
such indestructible hits as ``Chicago'' and ``Cabaret'' _ is the
sort of opera fan who looks for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opera has played a great role in my life, but not for the
high-C songbirds,'' Kander said recently. ``When I was still a boy,
I fell in love with the people, the people in `La Boheme,' in `Die
Meistersinger,' in `Der Rosenkavalier,' in `Pelleas et Melisande.'
Those people became very real to me. They still are.''
</P>
<P>
   And is Fleming just a high-C songbird? ``When she's done a role
a number of times, and she's really into it,'' he said, ``she gives
wonderful lessons.'' The first example that comes to his mind is
from ``Der Rosenkavalier'' this season. In the nick of time, the
Marschallin stops herself from blurting out to her young lover what
happened once when her husband barged in on her unannounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that one word `einmal,' `once,' she gave the dirtiest
laugh,'' Kander said. ``I loved it. A real snicker. It told me
something about that woman.'' That she's not ashamed? ``Yes, that,
and that she's had some swell times.''
</P>
<P>
   I remember that nuance, and others, not all of them vocal. From
time immemorial, the Marschallin has spent the calm and sensuous
yet depressed orchestral postlude of the first act gazing in her
mirror, facing in her reflection the relentless passage of time.
Fleming instead worked with a rose.
</P>
<P>
   By this point, she had already turned the silver rose for the
young bride Sophie von Fanninal into a bittersweet emblem of the
Marschallin's own lost youth. But that rose, in its fancy
presentation case, had just been carried from the room. On a
dressing table lay another one, cut from a garden, a gift from the
flighty hairdresser whose ministrations this morning she feels have
made her look old. Fleming picked it up and found the hard truth of
the moment that way, sweeping away an entire performance tradition
in an image many a future Marschallin could choose to follow.
</P>
<P>
   A speaking glance no one could anticipate. A gesture, an
inflection, a tone or phrase that unlocks a world. A radical
rethinking of a well-known role or the incandescent creation of a
new one. These are the stuff memories are made of. But there is
something better than memories: fresh experience in the here and
now. Now and again, lightning strikes. Keep your eyes wide open.
Dreams can wait.

U.N. FORMING A NEW PANEL FOR INSPECTING IRAQ WEAPONS
</HEADLINE>
  By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Despite increasingly negative signals from Iraq
on the future of arms inspections there, the head of a new
monitoring and inspection commission is moving ahead with the
staffing of his advisory panel, members of the group said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   AU.S. expert is likely to be put in charge of training and
equipping the inspection commission, with Europeans holding other
key positions, officials say. A core staff of about 40 people is
expected to be hired by sometime next month. The United States and
other nations are also expected to provide the panel with
intelligence information, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An advisory ``college of commissioners'' _ 16 arms control and
weapons experts from around the world _ met with the chief
inspector, Hans Blix, a former Swedish foreign minister and
ex-director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, twice this
week to review his first report on the establishment of the new
U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission. Blix is
chairman of the advisory group as well as the commission, which
replaces the inspection body known as UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. representative in the college of commissioners is
Robert Einhorn, assistant secretary of state for arms control.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the meeting this week, Iraq's vice president, Taha
Yassin Ramadan, condemned the commission in some of the strongest
terms to date. The Iraqis continue to insist that sanctions be
lifted before any arms inspections can resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq has become clearer and clearer in its rejections,'' a
U.S. official said Wednesday. ``We think this is very unfortunate.
Iraq needs to understand that if it wants sanctions to be suspended
or eventually lifted there is only one route to that goal, and that
route passes through full cooperation and compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis, who have been earning large amounts of money through
the legal and illegal sales of oil, have made no moves behind the
scenes to send a more conciliatory message to Blix, as some members
of the Security Council had hoped. Blix has said he will not
negotiate with the Iraqis to win their cooperation. He has not made
any effort to go to Baghdad, saying that the first move is up to
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Blix has drawn some criticism from independent arms control
experts who say that he was not tough enough with the Iraqis in the
past, when he was in charge of nuclear monitoring, while UNSCOM
supervised inspections on biological, chemical and missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say that his plan to include ``cultural'' training
for the new commission is a sop to those in the United Nations
friendly to Iraq, who demand that the Iraqis be treated more
diplomatically after years of tougher inspection techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is trying to demonstrate to Iraq that there's a real
opportunity for Iraq in cooperating with UNMOVIC, but that its up
to Iraq,'' the U.S. official said of Blix. ``He is making clear to
the Iraqis that while there will be elements of continuity from the
past in terms of the responsibilities of UNMOVIC and its mandate in
Iraq, there will also be some innovation and some changes from the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Blix wants to show a kind of fresh face to the world and
to Iraq,'' the official said, ``but at the same time show that this
is truly a professional organization that is determined to pursue
full Iraqi compliance with resolutions of the Security Council.''

ISRAELIS DEBATE MEANING OF PULLOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV _ Was it Israel's Vietnam, this hurried withdrawal from
a foreign land? A humiliation, witnessed by the suffering of
southern Lebanese struggling to flee into Israel because they
feared retribution for aligning with the Jewish state? A defeat for
a country that tried to enforce stability through occupation?
</P>
<P>
   These very points were debated late into the night here on radio
and television, with terms bandied about such as Saigon, house of
cards, embarrassment and loss.
</P>
<P>
   The themes also were picked up in the cafes and shops of this
seaside city, pulsing with shoppers, workers, students and
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a humiliation and it's not a question of pride for
the army; we simply made a mistake in going into Lebanon and now we
have finally left,'' said Gila Zvi, 33, between sips of coffee and
shakes of a colored rattle in front of her 2-month-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Experts and analysts and average Israelis who called in to talk
shows could not decide whether the pullout was a sign of weakness
or the inevitable end of a military policy that had proven too
unpopular and too difficult to maintain anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to celebrate, but also no reason to wear
sackcloth and break into tears,'' said political commentator Nahum
Barnea.
</P>
<P>
   Well-known writer Meir Shalev insisted that those who saw the
withdrawal from south Lebanon as a humiliation or sign of failure
were misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at south Lebanon and did not see Saigon. I observed
my posture and it was upright. I glanced at my tail and it was not
between my legs,'' he wrote in Yediot Ahronoth, Israel's biggest
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already tried all the troubles of war, let's give the
withdrawal a chance,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the talk of whether Israel should feel embarrassed
at how it retreated or whether the occupation was merely based on a
military approach that later proved wrong, the withdrawal was being
analyzed with one eye toward the future.
</P>
<P>
   If the border remains quiet despite Hezbollah fighters just on
the other side of the fence, then Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
decision to go ahead with the unilateral pullout will be hailed by
the public, never mind those first few days when it looked like the
army had been kicked out by a bunch of motley rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is fighting, if Israelis in the northern border
towns end up spending much of their days and nights in underground
shelters, then Barak will be pilloried and the withdrawal itself
will look like a defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that at this stage the army has come out of this
badly,'' said Gerald Steinberg, a national security expert at
Bar-Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
   ``If after three months nothing happens on the border, then any
analogies with Vietnam and other similar statements may
disappear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the cafes near Rabin Square, where Prime Minister Ehud Barak
last year, on the eve of his election, promised to withdraw from
Lebanon by July of this year, the issue seemed even simpler.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this square that Israelis held the first mass protest
against the 1982 invasion of Lebanon and it was here that Israelis
continued to protest the occupation zone formally established in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, 35-year-old Smadar Hazan, who was shopping with a
friend, looked shocked when asked if Israel's image as a tough
country with an even tougher army was somehow harmed by the
unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the contrary, Israel gained something,'' she said.
``Soldiers no longer will be dying in a foreign land. We are
protecting lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a Vietnam, there's a big difference, that
was miles away to fight a war that wasn't their own, we were trying
to protect our border,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But as dusty tanks rolled across the border and young soldiers
screamed out, ``I'm home!'' any deeper meaning to be found in the
withdrawal gave way to joy tinged with sadness as Israel's war of
attrition drew to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have waited for this day a long time, and the soldiers were
able to get out without anyone being killed or any attacks,'' Orna
Shimoni, whose son was killed in Lebanon three years ago, said on
Israel state television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet we have to remember that many sons could not come back and
say, `Mother, I'm home,' '' she said from the northern border town
of Kiryat Shmona.

WHILE HIS LAWYERS PLEAD, GATES PLAYS HOST TO 135 EXECUTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ While Microsoft's lawyers pleaded with a
federal judge not to break up the company, Bill Gates and other
senior company executives were painting a rosy picture of a
software-enhanced future Wednesday for chief executives of some of
the world's largest companies.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the annual event on Microsoft's campus here was on
the Internet's impact on business and, to a lesser extent,
consumers. In the limited portion of the gathering open to the
media, the courtroom battle over Microsoft's survival was not even
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list included notable Friends of Bill like Warren E.
Buffett; major customers like Michael Dell of Dell Computer and
Michael D. Capellas of Compaq Computer; fellow software vendors
like Carol Bartz of Autodesk Inc.; international luminaries like
Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group; and cultural icons like
Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there were 142 executives from 28 countries and 35
business sectors, according to Microsoft. Gates called the
gathering a ``learning event'' for the company as it tried to sort
out what kind of Internet-related software is a priority for
business.
</P>
<P>
   The guests declined to say whether Microsoft's plight was
discouraging open discussion of the impact of antitrust law on
technology development. But Capellas, in a brief session with
reporters, said that collaboration and standards allowing people to
exchange information in a variety of formats were essential to the
Internet's development. He added, as Gates betrayed no emotion,
``Anything that gets in the way of allowing us to build complete
solutions is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft seemed intent on treating uncertainty about
its corporate future as taboo, its efforts to develop products for
the future it foresees and its own use of them were prominently
featured. Ever the salesman, Gates, Microsoft's chairman, delivered
an opening address peppered with phrases like ``the magic of
software.''
</P>
<P>
   Every chief executive received a new Pocket PC, the hand-held
computer from Hewlett-Packard, equipped with Microsoft software for
reading electronic books and other Web-based functions.
</P>
<P>
   The computers _ personal digital assistants in the industry's
jargon _ included pictures and biographies of all the attendees to
encourage the social mixing and informal discussion that is
typically the main attraction for such exclusive business
gatherings. The discussions closed to the media covered evergreen
subjects like ``Strategies for the Age of Speed: Reinvention as an
Ongoing Task'' as well as pressing concerns like ``Internet
Valuations: How High? How Long? How Painful?''
</P>
<P>
   Those whose attention drifted could listen to classical music or
read books that had been loaded onto the devices, including Michael
Crichton's new novel, ``Timeline.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates' remarks centered on the thesis that the Internet age was
entering a ``third stage.'' The first stage, which he identified as
running from 1995 to 1998, was characterized by corporate Web sites
that provided data for people to read and measured how many
visitors they received. The second stage, still around in most
areas, he said, features a ``mania for getting transactions onto
the Web'' in which gross sales are ``worshiped'' with little
attention to how much they cost.
</P>
<P>
   The stage now beginning, he said, will focus on Internet
activities that contribute to profitability and make better use of
``knowledge workers.'' Such workers will receive information
personalized to their needs from many sites on a variety of devices
that allow them to write and annotate through speech recognition,
as well as simply read, and the information will be used to
actually do business online.
</P>
<P>
   In a more concrete example of what is coming, he described how
Microsoft has begun holding meetings online. Smaller numbers of
workers actually attend, but many monitor the progress, sometimes
dropping in for the portion relevant to them; tidbits that apply to
the work of those not present can be captured and forwarded to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Gates also did his best to entertain his guests. A video called
``Everyone's Talking Technology'' featured, among other scenes, a
court battle before Judge Judy in which Buffett accused Gates of
deliberately disconnecting his computer rather than play out an
online hand of bridge in which he was about to lose a $2 bet to
Buffett. Judge Judy ordered Gates to pay up, expressing the belief
that Buffett might be able to make a useful investment.
</P>
<P>
   The event began Tuesday evening with a cocktail reception at the
stately Four Seasons Olympic Hotel in downtown Seattle and
continued Wednesday night with the social highlight of the
conclave, a boat cruise and visit to Gates' futuristic mansion on
the shores of Lake Washington.

HAVE PUMPKINS GONE TO MUSH?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smashing Pumpkins leader Billy Corgan seemed stretched to his
musical limit at the band's packed-to-the-rafters Universal
Amphitheatre show Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Corgan announced on KROQ-FM (106.7) that the
current ``Sacred and Profane'' tour would be the Pumpkins' last,
the bald, six-foot leather-skirted singer, looking like a grinning
Uncle Fester by way of ``The Matrix,'' saw his music reduced to
deafening mush for an audience that didn't seem to mind either way.
</P>
<P>
   Smashing Pumpkins, it seems, is a studio band able to make
clean, well-produced records. On stage during a frustrating
two-hour set, however, Corgan's musicians simply aren't very
convincing. New bassist Melissa Auf Der Maur, formerly of Hole, and
rhythm guitarist James Iha consistently offered unimaginative,
rudimentary parts.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless the sweat-soaked audience at Universal danced,
screamed and waved arms in the air regardless of what was
presented. A messy, noisy cover of the 1974 David Essex hit, ``Rock
On,'' drew the same roar as Corgan's many touching and tuneful
numbers, such as ``1979,'' ``Tonight, Tonight'' and ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   The monkish Corgan clearly speaks to his enormous audience but
the band's look and sound is increasingly hard to swallow. The
leader's singing voice, tolerable on tape, frequently amounted to
little more than an abrasive, strangled wail. On the acoustic
numbers, he seemed to be over-emoting for comic effect.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Pumpkins' best-known hard-rock numbers, ``Bullet with
Butterfly Wings'' and ``Cherub Rock,'' were difficult to
distinguish as the guitars were turned up so loud that the only
thing to be heard was a painful white-noise buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Corgan said on KROQ the Pumpkins, which recently fulfilled its
contract with EMI's Virgin Records, would finish the current U.S.
tour, head to Europe, Japan, Canada, and maybe South America before
the end of the year and then call it quits. The Chicago-based band,
with worldwide sales of 23 million, will tape VH1's
``Storytellers`` in August, and an appearance on ``The Tonight Show
With Jay Leno'' is also scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   But Corgan said fans can expect more releases from the Pumpkins,
including another album's worth of songs and a live disc.
</P>
<P>
   On stage, the singer-guitarist seemed to make reference to the
forthcoming breakup when he grabbed the microphone: ``Are you ready
for the revolution? Does anyone want to testify? Whether you're a
name, or a number, things are changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by this gig, the change is probably for the better.
Corgan can write wonderful songs. Maybe it's time for someone else
to perform them.

OVERDUE WITHDRAWAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the chaos it has engendered in southern Lebanon and the
uncertainty it has created in the region, Israel's rapid withdrawal
from its so-called security zone in Lebanon represents a
long-overdue correction of a failed policy.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's occupation of Lebanese soil began with an intervention
against Palestinian guerrillas in 1978. Then came the reckless
Israeli invasion of 1982, which began with Shi'ite residents of
southern Lebanon throwing flowers upon Israeli tanks to express
their gratitude for what they thought would be their liberation
from the PLO's state-within-a-state. Israel's folly was to overstay
its welcome, by 18 years. During that prolonged occupation, Israel
succeeded in making an enemy of many of the Lebanese who had
originally greeted the Israel Defense Forces as welcome
emancipators.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious dangers in the current withdrawal, as is
evident from the swift disintegration of Israel's proxies, the
Southern Lebanon Army, and from the Katyusha rockets fired Tuesday
from Lebanon into the Galilee. Nonetheless, Prime Minister Ehud
Barak deserves support for keeping his promise to pull Israeli
soldiers out of Lebanon by July 7 _ with or without a peace deal
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the withdrawal is completed, Israel has complied,
albeit belatedly, with United Nations Resolution 425. It will now
be up to the UN to fulfill the next step, Resolution 426, by
deploying its monitoring force to facilitate an assumption of
authority in southern Lebanon by the Lebanese army. And since no
such action by the government in Beirut is possible without
approval from Syria, the ultimate responsibility for peace in
southern Lebanon will fall on the true master of Lebanon, Syrian
ruler Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
   If Hezbollah rockets kill civilians in Israel, the retaliation
may hit Syrian targets. Assad might not appreciate the implications
of his 40,000 soldiers being the only remaining army of occupation
left in Lebanon, but he should hear from Washington, Paris, Cairo,
and Amman that he will be held responsible for any rockets fired
into Israel from Lebanon. And Assad and Barak should both be
shepherded back to the bargaining table.

COO, PRESIDENT LEAVES ETRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE HUMER   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ETrade (EGRP:Nasdaq), already watching its stock price swoon,
said Wednesday that its president and chief operating officer,
Kathy Levinson, is leaving the online broker.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade said Levinson is leaving to ``concentrate on her wide
range of philanthropic and community service interests.'' The
company said Levinson wasn't available to comment.
</P>
<P>
   It named its marketing guru, Jerry Gramaglia, to succeed
Levinson.
</P>
<P>
   The news comes during a week when ETrade's stock has fallen to a
52-week low, closing Wednesday down 1 13/16, or 11.5 percent, at 13
15/16. That's a decline of 28 percent in three days.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade isn't the only online brokerage to have suffered this
week, though it has taken one of the worst beatings. The whole
sector has come under pressure as analysts and investors have begun
saying declining trading volumes during April and May will hurt
commission revenue and margin interest income this quarter. (TSC
wrote about this issue earlier this week.) And things are unlikely
to get better. Trading slows almost every summer.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson has been with ETrade since 1995, when she came on board
as a consultant. She previously worked for competitor Charles
Schwab (SCH:NYSE). In 1996, she was named president and chief
operating officer of ETrade's brokerage unit, ETrade Securities,
and at the beginning of 1999 took on that role for the entire
company, which now also includes ETrade Bank, an online bank.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson is the third top ETrade executive to leave in the past
year. Earlier this year, Debra Chrapaty left her post as chief
information officer to join a start-up and last year Rebecca Patton
left her job as products manager to go to a smaller company. ETrade
went public in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gramaglia, meanwhile, has been with ETrade since June 1998, and
he oversaw the company's massive advertising campaigns that began
in September of that year. The campaigns have swelled ETrade's
customer account numbers but also have pushed the company into the
red.

<P>
   WASHINGTON A federal judge Wednesday abruptly wrapped up the
Microsoft antitrust trial, setting the stage for a swift appeal of
a likely order to splinter the world's largest software company
into two or three parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not contemplating any further processes,'' U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson told John Warden, the lead defense
counsel, at the end of a four-hour remedy hearing called in
response to Jackson's sweeping April 3 ruling that Microsoft had
stifled innovation and harmed consumers by its anti-competitive
monopolistic practices.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson asked David Boies, who had prosecuted the case for the
Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general: ``How quickly
can you get me a final judgment in a form that reflects what
happened in court today?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could have it in your hands by Friday,'' Boies
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson then granted Microsoft's request for 48 hours to comment
on the final government draft.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers must now decide how best to revise their
April 28 plan to cleave the software giant into two separate firms:
an applications arm that markets such popular products as Office
and a Windows arm that markets the flagship Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, Jackson repeatedly praised what he termed an
``excellent'' 65-page friend-of-the-court brief recently submitted
by two trade groups, the Software and Information Industries
Association and the Computer &AMP; Communications Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   It proposed creating yet a third firm that would control
Microsoft's Internet businesses, such as Microsoft Network and its
Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect of a bisection would, in effect, create two
separate monopolies,'' Jackson said. ``Tell me how that would
effectively inspire competition?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to divide the company into three Windows clones,
you would not have the kind of competition that would produce
innovation,'' Boies said. A two-way division would end Microsoft's
``control over both the applications and operating system,'' which
it used ``to protect each franchise,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two-part divestiture is also simpler to implement,'' Boies
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would appear to me that this is anything but simple to
implement,'' Jackson retorted. ``...Do you think Microsoft would be
a willing participant?''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson retains the freedom to craft his own set of remedies
under a timetable of his own choosing.
</P>
<P>
   But a shaken Microsoft team emerged from the courtroom convinced
that Jackson would issue his final order swiftly and that it would
track closely with, if not entirely reflect, the amended government
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``From everything that was said and done today it would appear
that's the way the judge is headed,'' said Mark Murray, a Microsoft
spokesman who had sat through the 78-day trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very near the appellate phase of this controversy,''
Microsoft general counsel William Neukom said. ``On appeal,
Microsoft will be raising challenges to the procedures used
throughout this trial, including the remedy phase. We will be
challenging the findings of fact, the conclusions of law, and the
nature of any relief the judge might enter.''
</P>
<P>
   In spurning Microsoft's plea that it be granted up to six more
months to hold, in effect, another trial focused on the remedial
impact, Jackson noted tartly that ``this case has been pending for
two years.'' He found it ``ironic'' that the firm was asking for
more time in court instead of moving quickly to get to an appeals
court.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, the judge rose from the bench to end the
proceedings, prompting Murray, the Microsoft spokesman, to say:
``That's it. We're going to the (U.S.) Court of Appeals. We always
knew we'd end up there anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I submit this remedy is so extreme ... it will go a very long
way to ensure that Microsoft is the one company that won't win''
the next round of competition in the software industry, Warden had
argued.
</P>
<P>
   On major financial markets, Microsoft shares closed up $2.38 at
$65.56.

UAL, US AIRWAYS COULD HAVE BUMPY FLIGHT TO MERGER COMPLETION 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER FRIEDLIN   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As UAL (UAL:NYSE) moved Wednesday to acquire US Airways
(U:NYSE), Wall Street analysts pointed to several potential
obstacles that could derail the deal.
</P>
<P>
   They listed possible labor discord, antitrust issues and the
tough task of making the marriage work as potential pitfalls and
cited previous failed airline consolidation efforts as proof of the
difficulties that carriers face when they try to merge.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between US Airways and American Airlines fell through
last year because of enormous cost overruns. That failed bid came
one year after a code-sharing deal between the nation's biggest
airline, United, of which UAL is the parent, and Delta Air Lines
(DAL:NYSE) flopped after Delta management refused to grant the
pilots' union a voting seat on the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some people on Wall Street were skeptical that
United Airlines would be able to complete its deal for US Airways.
UAL said earlier on Wednesday that it would pay $4.3 billion in
cash for US Airways and assume $7.3 billion in debt and operating
leases.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors in US Airways were enthusiastic, driving the
share up about 80 percent, because the price UAL was willing to pay
was more than double the airline's stock price on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But among the issues that tempered that enthusiasm was labor
difficulties, which could put the brakes on the merger. A unified
workforce could have difficulty agreeing to seniority lists and
bidding rights for schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Dubinsky, chairman of the United Airlines Master Executive
Council, a unit of the Air Line Pilots Association, said in a
statement that he was ``deeply disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before today, the company and the UAL-MEC faced the enormous
challenge of reaching a satisfactory pilot contract that rewards
our pilots for the sacrifices we have made to return United to
profitability,'' he added. ``The proposed merger will make that
task even more difficult by requiring the integration of two very
different pilot groups into a single airline.'' The union
represents about 10,000 United pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although United's and US Airways' boards have approved this
transaction, the rank and file are the ones that have to work
together and agree to the new work ranking they may have in this
new airline (which) determines their seniority in bidding for
flying time,'' said Susan Donofrio, an analyst with Deutsche Banc
Alex. Brown. ``This has been one of the stumbling blocks of
previous potential mergers.''
</P>
<P>
   And, if labor problems don't scuttle the transaction, analysts
said regulatory concerns could.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is not an antitrust cake walk,'' wrote James Higgins,
an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, in a research report.
``There is a real question as to whether regulators will approve
such concentration in an industry whose competitiveness is already
a concern to many.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined carriers would control 30 percent of U.S. airline
capacity, with American, the nation's second-largest carrier,
lagging behind with 20 percent capacity, Higgins said. He
downgraded his rating for UAL to an underperform from a buy. It
could not be determined if DLJ does any underwriting for the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   UAL and US Airways, however, managed to preempt regulators'
criticism over direct route overlap into and out of Washington,
D.C. In its announcement, United said it would sell some of its
assets to a US Airways board member, Robert Johnson. Johnson, the
founder, chairman and chief executive of BET Holdings II, a media
holding company, would then create a new airline, to be called DC
Air. That carrier would operate out of Washington Reagan National
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The companies did not disclose how much Johnson would be paying
for the carrier's assets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, concerns about the possible obstacles did little to temper
the demand for shares of US Airways, which has recently faced labor
problems and larger-than-expected losses. Under the terms of the
deal, UAL will pay $60 a share for all the outstanding shares of US
Airways, a 130 percent premium based on US Airway's closing price
Tuesday of 26 5/16. Shares of US Airways of Arlington, Va.,
rocketed 21 15/16, or 83 percent, to 48 1/4 by Wednesday afternoon.
(US Airways finished up 22 11/16, or 86 percent, at 49.)
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Chicago-based UAL were off 8 7/16, or 14 percent, to
51 15/16. (UAL closed down 7 3/16, or 12 percent, at 53 3/16.)
</P>
<P>
   The news also helped buoy shares of Northwest Airlines
(NWAC:NASDAQ), which is now seen as a target should the industry
further consolidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the transaction is likely to set off a wave of
consolidation in the industry,'' Candace Browning, airline analyst
at Merrill Lynch, wrote in a report. ``Northwest, with a strategic
asset in the Pacific, strong domestic hubs and a 13.5 percent
economic interested in Continental (CAL:NYSE) is a very attractive
acquisition candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwest was up 2 3/4, or 11 percent, at 26 7/8. (Northwest
finished up 4 13/16, or 20 percent, at 28 15/16.)
</P>
<P>
   Browning upgraded Northwest to an accumulate/buy from a
neutral/accumulate. A Merrill Lynch spokesman said he did not know
if his company has done any underwriting for Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AMR (AMR:NYSE), parent of American, were off because
of investor concerns about lost market share following the merger
between US Airways and UAL. That concern sparked speculation that
AMR might offer a counterbid for US Airways. AMR was down 3 5/16,
or 10 percent, at 29 5/16. (AMR closed down 2 9/16, or 8 percent,
at 30 1/16.)
</P>
<P>
   UAL and US Airways said they expected to complete the deal in
2001, noting that the purchase would add to United's earnings in
the second year following the closing.

FINDING OUT HOW MUCH   FREE SHIPPING IS WORTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: S.C., N.C., Ill.)   By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have been told that in some families a hammock can last for
years. I am more familiar with the sort of situation in which eight
small and medium-size children who are pretending to be pirates
routinely pile onto a hammock, rock it vigorously to simulate high
seas and dangle 16 legs through the mesh to taunt imaginary sharks.
</P>
<P>
   One cannot really expect miracles from a natural cotton rope
structure supported by two spreader bars and zinc-plated hanging
hardware. Even the sturdy old oaks that suspend the ``ship'' are in
peril.
</P>
<P>
   So almost every year, I buy a new hammock, and it's always the
same model (since there's nothing wrong with the product that
pirate-proofing wouldn't fix): the ``original Pawleys Island rope
hammock,'' made in North Carolina and distributed nationwide.
According to the manufacturer's Web site, Pawleys.com, it comes in
three sizes. I buy the middle size, which can hold two adults or
450 pounds or as many as eight bloodthirsty buccaneers. The last
hammock, if I recall correctly, came from a mail-order catalog. I
paid about $100 for it, plus shipping, which set me back an
additional $10 or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus shipping.'' In the months since buying the hammock, I
have come to realize that ``plus shipping'' is one of the ugliest
phrases in the English language. Thanks to the multitude of online
retailers who offered free shipping during last winter's holiday
shopping season, I have been conditioned to believe that I am
entitled to this perk forever.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of online shoppers share my expectations, it turns out.
Last week, Forrester Research reported that 94 percent of online
shoppers were concerned about shipping costs and that 44 percent
had abandoned an online shopping cart after they found out how much
the shipping costs would add to the total. These are, mind you, the
same shoppers who for years accepted mail-order catalogs' shipping
charges, which often add up to 15 percent to the cost of a
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers have different expectations when they shop online,
not only because the retail sites raised their expectations during
the Christmas season, but also because shoppers see that they are
giving the sites something in return, information about
themselves,'' said Susy Chan, director of the e-commerce technology
program at DePaul University in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Now that she mentioned it, I did resent typing in all kinds of
valuable personal information _ name, address, phone number, name
of street where I grew up in case I forgot my password and needed a
prompt every time I bought something online. Beyond the privacy
concerns, these questions are annoyingly time-consuming. I should
be compensated.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, I started my search for a hammock at a site called
freeshipping.com (www.freeshipping.com), which has a search engine
to point shoppers toward about a million products that the site's
125 retail partners are willing to sell without charging shipping
and handling fees. Freeshipping.com's partners _ who include both
well-known retailers like Cooking.com and smaller specialty
retailers like Kideo.com, which sells personalized children's
videos _ pay freeshipping.com a commission for sales referrals.
</P>
<P>
   Freeshipping.com's founder, D.J. Vallauri, got the idea for
creating the site after starting another Web site called
Mustardstore.com (which he eventually sold). ``I kept getting
feedback from people who wanted to order a bottle of mustard that
cost a few dollars and were complaining that the shipping cost a
fortune,'' Vallauri said. ``They were right.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection at freeshipping.com _ 10 categories, including
apparel and office supplies _ is more quirky than comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want people to think of this site as a first stop when
they shop to see if someone is willing to sell whatever you want to
buy without charging you for shipping,'' Vallauri said.
</P>
<P>
   After I did a search for ``hammock'' on the home page, the site
returned matches in three product categories. Although the search
results were displayed in a confusing way _ many matches, were
redundant, for instance _ I quickly found the model I wanted, at
Ezshop.com for $95.70.
</P>
<P>
   When I clicked on Buy Now, freeshipping.com sent me directly to
Ezshop.com's Web site. But after I arrived, I hesitated because
Ezshop.com said the item ``usually ships within 14 business days.''
That seemed like a long time. More important, I was shopping in an
unfamiliar store. The home page said Ezshop.com was located in
Dallas, and it listed a phone number _ unfortunately not toll-free
_ that I could call for customer service. When I phoned anyway, no
one answered.
</P>
<P>
   That made me uneasy. So I did some quick comparison shopping.
Using search engines, I found the same model at higher prices and
with shipping costs that ranged from $8.95 to $14.95 at several
other online shops. One, Smith &AMP; Hawken (www.smithandhawken.com),
was a store I know well. But there I would have to pay nearly 40
percent more; even on sale, the hammock would cost $133.95,
including shipping and handling. On the other hand, the Smith &AMP;
Hawken hammock would arrive much sooner: in 7 to 10 business days.
</P>
<P>
   Was it worth it to pay extra for security? In this sort of
situation, many experienced online shoppers will choose the brand
name they trust, said Chan, of DePaul University. ``Convenience,
the time spent and knowing that the item will arrive when it is
expected are more important than just getting a short-term benefit
like free shipping,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But brand names do not mean that much to me, not when the items
offered by two retailers are identical. The only perk that I can
think of that is more valuable than saving money would be something
along the lines of guaranteed baby-sitting on a Saturday night. Any
online retailer who offered that would earn my loyalty. Friday
night would be good, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of such luxuries, I sent e-mail to ask Ezshop why
shipping took so long and why the phone wasn't answered. Within two
hours, Ezshop responded: ``We seem to have had some trouble with
our phones earlier today. They are now working and we would be
happy to help you via phone. In regards to shipping, all items ship
directly from the manufacturer, and this particular manufacturer
needs this long to ship orders. Although they tend to ship much
faster, normally in five business days.''
</P>
<P>
   I ordered the hammock from Ezshop. I hope it arrives when it's
supposed to. Or else, I have been told, I may walk the plank.

JUDGE ORDERS PROSECUTORS TO REVISE MICROSOFT BREAKUP PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c. 2000 N.Y. Times.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal judge overseeing the antitrust case against
Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq) brushed aside the company's motion to
dismiss a government breakup proposal, then ordered prosecutors to
revise their plan to split the company in two.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson also said he foresees ``no further
process'' in the trial after Wednesday's hearing on possible
remedies, potentially indicating an early decision. The company had
request for several months to prepare to argue against a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing a little more than four hours of arguments in his
courtroom in Washington, Jackson told federal antitrust prosecutors
lawyers to update their two-way breakup proposal by Friday. In the
courtroom, he had discussed the possibility of a three-way breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's shares rose 2 13/16, or 4.5 percent, to close at 66
in Wednesday regular trading. The stock is well off its 52-week
high of 119 15/16, reached before settlement negotiations in the
antitrust trial dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   The court proceedings appeared to begin on a sour note for the
Redmond, Wash.-based software company, which unexpectedly filed
additional written documents on Monday seeking to dismiss the
breakup proposal. Judge Jackson, who did not request the extra
documents, opened the hearing by declining to discuss the company's
motion to dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to proceed to the merits of the remedy,'' Jackson
said, according to the Reuters news service. Kevin O'Connor, an
assistant attorney general from Washington, then began the
government's case for a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson criticized the government proposal, saying it would
create two monopolies where now there is one. ``A bisection will in
effect create two separate monopolies,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he praised a friend-of-the-court filing calling for
Internet Explorer, Microsoft's Web browser, to be split away into
yet a third company. ``Rather than reorganizing Microsoft into only
a Windows company and a single applications company, the court
should supplement plaintiffs' proposed final judgement by
separating the Internet Explorer product and personnel into a
third, independent company,'' the brief said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson ruled on April 3 that the company used illegal methods
to expand its monopoly on the Windows operating system to other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 17 attorneys general proposed last
month to split the company into two parts. One company would own
the operating system business while the other would own the
remainder of Microsoft's assets, including the Office software
package, Web browser and the MSN network of Web sites. Microsoft's
remedies proposal, which it was required to file May 10, asked for
a dismissal of the Justice Department's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The additional documents filed Monday sought to bolster the
dismissal motion, using arguments the government itself made in its
prior case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to propose remedies for a ruling it plans to appeal on
behavior it still maintains was legal, Microsoft asked for
behavioral regulations, including restrictions governing the
company's license agreements with computer makers. The government
proposal also offers conduct remedies, including some that appear
in the company's proposal. Two states abstained from the government
proposal because they oppose the breakup.
</P>
<P>
   When the time came for Microsoft's lawyer, John Warden, to
defend the company's conduct remedies proposals, he took a pass:
``I'm not going to discuss it, it's addressed in the brief.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Warden spent his time in court Wednesday arguing
against the breakup proposal and explaining why his company needed
months of preparation if the judge is considering a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   As the court proceedings proceeded on the East Coast, William H.
Gates, Microsoft's chairman, made a presentation to business
leaders on the West Coast at the company's fourth annual CEO
Summit. According to a prepared statement from the company, Gates
``shared his belief that the successful companies in this next
generation of the Internet will be those that renew their customer
commitment, strengthen ties with partners and use the power of
leading-edge Internet services.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is poised to release Next Generation Windows
Services, the first incarnation of the company's envisioned
platform of software applications floating on the Internet.

PENN SCALES BACK GENE THERAPY INSTITUTE IN AFTERMATH OF PATIENT'S
DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Mo.)   By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The scientist who ran a gene therapy study that
killed an 18-year-old patient at the University of Pennsylvania
will no longer conduct experiments on people, and the prestigious
gene therapy institute he founded is being scaled back, university
officials announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Dr. James M. Wilson, who as director of the
university's Institute for Human Gene Therapy has been regarded as
one of the bright young stars of his field, will restrict his work
to the study of molecules and cells, and will experiment only on
animals. Those restrictions will also apply to other scientists
working under the auspices of the institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that Dr. Wilson was overloaded with regard to
responsibility,'' President Judith Rodin said at a news conference.
Rodin described the decision as one in a series of steps the
university was taking to improve patient safety in all experiments,
and also to reduce any appearance of conflict of interest in
scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   The move will have no immediate practical effect, because the
Food and Drug Administration has already suspended all human
experiments at the institute. Nor does it necessarily mean an end
to gene therapy clinical trials at the university. Doctors in other
disciplines may conduct such experiments, Rodin said, although they
will be reviewed by a special ethics panel from now on.
</P>
<P>
   But for Wilson, who over the past seven years had built his
institute into the nation's largest academic gene therapy program,
the decision is a major setback.
</P>
<P>
   He is facing the threat of a lawsuit by the family of the young
man who died, Jesse Gelsinger, and still must contend with an
investigation by the FDA, which uncovered a number of deficiencies
in his program in the wake of Gelsinger's death.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rodin said, the university is re-examining its
relationship to the biotech company, Genovo, that Wilson founded.
The company contributes one-fifth of the $25 million annual budget
at the gene therapy institute, and in return has exclusive rights
to develop Wilson's discoveries into commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the gene therapy institute will stop manufacturing
the genetically altered viruses, known as vectors, that are used to
introduce genes into cells. That work will be turned over to
commercial laboratories, which have flourished in the years since
the institute was founded in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson did not grant interviews Wednesday, but instead issued a
terse statement saying that he felt confident that the steps
outlined would ``help position Penn as a model environment for the
conduct of all types of clinical research, especially gene
therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   But one leading scientist in the field, Dr. W. French Anderson,
who in 1990 conducted the first gene therapy experiment, described
Rodin's move as an overreaction. ``This is throwing the baby out
with the bathwater,'' Anderson said. ``It basically eliminates the
gene therapy program if you can't run trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodin's announcement came in conjunction with the release of a
report by an independent panel of experts that evaluated the gene
therapy institute at Rodin's request. The six-member panel, led by
William H. Danforth, chancellor emeritus of Washington University
in St. Louis, strongly suggested, but did not explicitly recommend,
that clinical trials at the institute be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The experts raised serious questions about how well human gene
therapy studies were being monitored at the university. They
concluded, essentially, that either because of lack of knowledge or
financial resources the institute was not capable of complying with
the federal regulations governing clinical trials. Should clinical
trials continue under the institute's auspices, the report said,
``hundreds of standard operating procedures must be developed,
recorded and put into exact operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than beef up the institute, the university chose to
devote its resources to more intensive monitoring of all the
clinical trials it conducts. Danforth's committee also called for
the university to re-evaluate its hospital experimentation
committees, known as institutional review boards, that review
proposals for clinical trials. And it recommended that the
university review its policies on conflict of interest to avoiding
even the appearance of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Rodin said the university would follow the panel's
recommendations. But she said that Wilson had complied with
``fairly strict and unusual constraints'' regarding conflict of
interest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Given the committee's findings, Inder Verma, a panel member who
is also the incoming president of the American Society for Gene
Therapy, said Rodin had two choices: She could either give the gene
therapy institute more staff members and outside supervision, or
restrict it to basic scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   To choose the latter path, Verma said, was ``a very reasonable
thing.'' Yet at the same time, Verma said, he and the other panel
members came away with the strong impression that before
Gelsinger's death, Wilson and his colleagues had been doing the
best they could to follow FDA rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's intention was good,'' Verma said. ``It's just that
the system required more monitoring and support.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger's death in September was, as far as government
officials know, the first directly caused by gene therapy, and it
has had ripple effects throughout the 10-year-old field. In the
months since, there have been other reports of lapses in gene
therapy experiments.
</P>
<P>
   In response to those lapses, Donna Shalala, secretary of health
and human services, announced on Tuesday that the Clinton
administration was seeking authority to impose fines of up to $250
million on scientists who violated federal research rules in any
human experiment.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday, the Senate is to convene its second hearing to
examine accusations of lax government oversight of gene therapy
research.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Caplan, the director of the Center for Bioethics at the
Univeristy of Pennsylvania, said such scrutiny of gene therapy was
likely to continue for some time, particularly at the institute.
``Until his ship stops floundering,'' he said of Wilson, ``it is
going to be steered by somebody else for a while.''

INDIA PONDERS INVOLVEMENT AGAIN IN SRL LANKA
</HEADLINE>
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ India, chastened by its disastrous
intervention more than a decade ago in the brutish war that has
long plagued Sri Lanka, is gingerly stepping back into a conflict
that has once again reached a crisis stage.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in New Delhi continue to say India will not send in
its own troops or supply arms to Sri Lanka, which is battling
separatist ethnic Tamil rebels. But the defense minister and the
national security adviser have suggested that the Indian navy was
prepared to evacuate 30,000 Sri Lankan troops at the request of the
Sri Lankan government under certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for India's Ministry of Defense, Pramod Bhatnagar,
said that the navy had two ships standing by to evacuate troops and
civilians from the Jaffna peninsula, a small finger of land just
miles from India's southern coast, though only if a cease-fire is
declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment we receive an order, we will go into action,''
Bhatnagar said. ``It will be essentially a peace mission.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the Sri Lankan government is not ready to
withdraw and turn over the city of Jaffna in the Tamil-dominated
north. But the boastful declarations of military and political
leaders that the country would fight to the last man to defend
Jaffna are sounding more tentative as the fighting continues.
</P>
<P>
   The Sri Lankan president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, said in an
interview published on Wednesday in The Hindu, a national Indian
newspaper, that the military still holds two-thirds of the Jaffna
peninsula but added that the rebels are putting up ``a very
determined fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawal, she said, ``does not seem a possibility at this
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Security analysts and Western diplomats say they doubt that the
government can hold on indefinitely even though its troops
outnumber the rebels by 6-to-1. The Sri Lankan military has been
weakened by a highly politicized command structure, a demoralized
rank and file and planes that don't fly, they say. Kumaratunga
herself acknowledged shortcomings in the military strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the rebels, who call themselves the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, have proved to be a motivated, expertly led
force that is ruthlessly focused on winning a homeland for the
country's Tamil minority and is financially supported by a large
Tamil diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   India, which has it own secessionist problem in Kashmir, has a
tortured history in the Sri Lankan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, India _ which
has a huge Tamil population in its south _ covertly armed and
trained separatist Tamil militants from Sri Lanka and allowed them
to set up bases in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lankan historians see Gandhi's meddling in Sri Lanka as a
cynical effort to court political support among Tamils in southern
India and to assert India's dominance over its smaller neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   But India succeeded only in helping to unleash a war that has
taken more than 60,000 lives and has entangled India itself.
</P>
<P>
   Rajiv Gandhi, who succeeded his assassinated mother as prime
minister, sent in Indian troops in 1987 with the aim of quickly
imposing a settlement. At its peak, more than 75,000 Indian troops
were on Sri Lankan soil. Almost three years later, India pulled out
with none of its aims achieved and more than 1,000 of its troops
killed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Gandhi, who was then out of office and campaigning to
regain his post, was assassinated by a suicide bomber from the
Tigers, one of the guerrilla groups India had trained. The
conspirators in his murder have been sentenced to death and the
Tigers banned in India.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lanka itself said good riddance when India departed in 1990.
But 10 years later, facing a renewed onslaught from the Tigers, it
has turned to India for military assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Kumaratunga alluded to India's moral responsibility in her
interview with The Hindu, noting that it was India that ``supported
the terrorists on their soil, gave them not just refuge, but arms
and training so that they could come back and start the war.''
</P>
<P>
   She said India should now be using its influence to bring the
Tigers to the negotiating table. Sri Lankan officials have been
meeting with a delegation from Norway over the past three days that
is trying to ``facilitate'' peace talks between the government and
the rebels that broke off five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   India, as well as the United States, have taken the position
that the conflict can only be resolved through negotiation, and
that the solution should preserve the territorial integrity of Sri
Lanka, while granting greater autonomy to the Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   India, which is deeply embroiled in a conflict with anti-India
guerrillas to its north in the state of Kashmir, cannot afford to
encourage Tamil nationalists in south India by countenancing the
creation of a separate Tamil nation in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the immediate crisis is a military one in the Jaffna
peninsula. The Tigers controlled Jaffna from 1990 to 1995, lost it
to the government for the past five years and claim they are moving
closer to recapturing it.
</P>
<P>
   There are fears that the Tigers, who are infamous for
assassinating their Tamil rivals and other political leaders, will
kill many civilians whom they consider government collaborators.
The U.S. State Department has categorized the Tigers as a terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting has been raging in the north, but it is difficult to
know what is happening on the ground. The government has banned
reporters from the battle zone and imposed severe censorship on the
press.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, it has closed two newspapers for defying the
censor: the Sunday Leader, a weekly newspaper based in Colombo, and
Udayan, Jaffna's Tamil newspaper. The coverage of the crisis has
been largely reduced to regurgitating press releases issued by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   If the time comes when the government has to withdraw from
Jaffna, Sri Lankans may well be unprepared for the defeat. That
would prove politically costly for Kumaratunga's party, which faces
parliamentary elections by October.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how long the government can hang on in Jaffna. It
has been buying arms and aircraft. Kingsley de Silva, a historian
who is executive director of the International Center for Ethnic
Studies in Kandy, Sri Lanka, said he believes Kumaratunga will try
to hold on militarily in Jaffna until after the elections if at all
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think the government can survive if there is a
massive evacuation,'' he said.

JOANNA THE SPY: MORE BOND THAN BOND 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE HUTSKO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This is Special Agent Perfect Dark,'' a female voice with a
British accent said in a telephone message left at my home last
week. ``I must be brief _ you never know who's listening. I need
your assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The message caught me off guard _ for an instant, I actually
wondered how ``they'' knew that I was playing Perfect Dark at that
moment. Then I realized that it was just a public relations stunt
from Nintendo, so I immersed myself once more in the game's
alternate reality, which is every bit as exciting and nerve-racking
as a fast-paced action film.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Rare, a British company, Perfect Dark _ the name
refers to the code name used in the game for the 23-year-old
heroine, Joanna Dark _ draws its look and feel from the company's
1997 spy hit, Golden Eye, a game that featured James Bond but had
comparatively stiff animation. The company deserves kudos for
casting a female character in the lead role in an industry
dominated on both sides of the screen by young men.
</P>
<P>
   Striking a balance between sharpshooting and sleuthing, Joanna
is years ahead of Bond in her outing, set 23 years from now. The
first-person action of Perfect Dark _ which is not a Bond sequel
and has no characters from that game _ unfolds in a science
fiction-flavored landscape that features better graphics, sound
effects, weapons and gadgets than Bond's game.
</P>
<P>
   There are nine Solo Missions, each with levels of three to five
objectives, depending on the difficulty setting selected. The first
mission begins simply enough: Infiltrate the headquarters of the
secretive, sinister dataDyne company and rescue a doctor being held
hostage. In the first of many plot twists, the doctor turns out to
be a sentient robot that is imprisoning the soul of a scientist in
a roaming device that displays only the doctor's wide, staring
eyes, which are strangely, unsettlingly pretty, as if they had been
through a Cover Girl makeover.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Joanna must sneak past enemies or, more often
than not, shoot them. These bad guys are markedly smarter than
Golden Eye's villains. They hide in corners or duck behind boxes,
waiting for the vulnerable moment as you, playing Joanna, are
reloading so they can pop out and get you in their sights.
</P>
<P>
   How smart the enemies are _ and how many mission objectives
there are _ depends on the difficulty setting chosen at the start
of the mission. (A note to parents: the enemies' equally smart
mouths contribute to the game's Mature rating.)
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that the Agent setting is a walk in the park.
It's hard, not only because swarms of deadly enemies must be
eliminated, but also because shooting accurately at bad guys takes
enormous amounts of practice on the Nintendo 64 controller. As a
player more attuned to fast 3-D action games on PC's, I found that
adjusting to the Nintendo 64 controller was like trying to tie
shoelaces with fingers soaked in Novocain.
</P>
<P>
   Practice pays off. Before long it feels more natural to be
sneaking around as Joanna achieves increasingly complicated
objectives. She goes undercover to free hostages, travels
underground to infiltrate a lab and dives into the sea to recover
an alien who goes by the name of Elvis. Fans of conspiracy theories
get a visit to not only Area 51, but to Area 52, too.
</P>
<P>
   The environments depicted in Perfect Dark are gorgeous, as long
as the player has upgraded the Nintendo 64 with an optional memory
Expansion Pak, which costs $29.95 and also improves the graphics of
some other games, like Quake II and South Park Rally. Without it,
only a third of Perfect Dark can be played _ it has the multiplayer
levels but none of the single-player missions. With the Expansion
Pak installed, the game has vibrant effects.
</P>
<P>
   Light sources give off a squint-inducing glare and can be shot
out to darken a room, causing enemies to scramble. Windows shatter
with Dolby Surround Sound (if your television is equipped with it),
and, yes, blood splatters the walls and floors behind and beneath
enemies on the receiving end of your arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   An assortment of gadgets lets the player see in the dark or
decode computer-locked doors; other gadgets cloak Joanna from
sight. The most ingenious and captivating gadget is the Camspy, a
controllable spy camera that Johanna sets loose to see in places
she can't go.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect Dark is not without its frustrations. There is no Save
Game feature within levels, so dying during a mission means going
back to its beginning and starting over. (Only completed levels are
saved.) Because each game has up to five objectives, the inability
to save the game in the middle of a mission is at times
infuriating.
</P>
<P>
   One way to double Joanna's odds of completing the single-player
levels is to play in cooperative mode. That lets you invite a
friend to play at Joanna's side, helping you take out the enemies
and complete objectives. Or you can enlist the aid of one of the
game's ``simulants,'' which are designed to act like human players.
An interesting twist on the co-op mode is the counter-op mode, in
which the second player acts on behalf of one of the level's
enemies and tries to keep Joanna from getting out of the level
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Players who are frustrated from dying too often in the middle of
more complicated single-player levels can let off steam in the
game's biggest surprise of all, its multiplayer levels. In design
and execution, they evoke the feeling of two heavy-hitting PC
multiplayer games, Quake III and Unreal Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   As many as four human players seated around a single Nintendo 64
console can go head to head, each taking up a quarter of the TV
screen while following one character's actions. The game slows down
noticeably when several players are on the screen, all shooting at
once.
</P>
<P>
   Up to eight additional computer-generated players, or simulants,
can be sprinkled into the game. Or solo players can play against
one or several simulants. Simulants can be tweaked to be aggressive

   With an abundance of multiplayer levels and the option of
returning to the Solo Missions and playing the game all over again
at one of the more difficult settings, Perfect Dark is one of those
rare games with lots of replay value. While faults like the
inability to save the game in the middle of levels prevent it from
being perfect, Perfect Dark comes close.

&HT;     PELOSI, LOSING TRADE VOTE, VOWS VIGILANCE ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN
CHINA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Nancy Pelosi, reflecting Wednesday on her
failed campaign to defeat normal trading status for China, vowed to
be ``relentless'' in holding supporters of the China trade bill to
their pledges to ensure Beijing stops suppressing human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, expected to be quickly approved by the Senate and
President Clinton, would put an end to the annual review that
Congress gave to China's trade status and would grant China the
same permanent low-tariff access to U.S. markets that most other
countries have.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the annual review means that Pelosi, Democrat from
San Francisco, would lose her yearly platform for exposing China's
human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden is now on the other side that won to ensure that
China stops threatening Taiwan, proliferating nuclear weapons and
suppressing the human rights on its people,'' Pelosi said in an
interview after the 237 to 197 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be relentless in holding supporters (of the China
trade bill) to their pledges,'' she said. But, she added, ``our
experience is, the minute after the vote is cast, these side
commitments are forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, who argued that jettisoning the annual review would take
away the only leverage lawmakers have to curb China's suppression
of its people, was optimistic up to the final hours of the House
debate that the bill would fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to us is that the Republicans we thought we
could get, just weren't there,'' Pelosi said. ``We have no regrets,
everyone knows we worked as hard as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi dismissed a successful amendment sponsored by Reps.
Sander Levin, D-Mich., and Doug Bereuter, R-Neb. that creates a
human rights monitoring commission for China. The planned
commission ``was camouflage to give people who support human rights
some cover to support the bill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The human rights commission would consist of nine House members,
nine senators and five presidential appointees. It would focus on
China's human rights abuses, labor standards and religious freedoms
and submit an annual report to Congress and the president.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would also establish a task force to monitor the
U.S. ban on the importation of Chinese goods made by forced prison
labor.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Pelosi gathered with other opponents of the bill
for chicken wings and sandwiches in the office of House Democratic
whip David E. Bonior, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi embraced Wei Jingsheng, a leading Chinese dissident who
spent 19 years in prison in China for writing democratic slogans on
a wall. ``I'm sorry,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   Wei, who appeared downcast, replied through a translator that
the vote granting permanent normal trading status to China ``is not
only very dangerous for China, it is very dangerous for the United
States as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote, Pelosi delivered an impassioned speech on the
House floor, warning her colleagues not to squander U.S. leverage
over China in order to please the U.S. business community, which
had lobbied for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said there are more people in prison in China now than at
any other time and that China continues to expand its nuclear
weapons proliferation program by helping Libya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must speak out for freedom because it is in our national
security interest to do so,'' Pelosi said. ``What credibility do we
have as a leader of the free world to speak out against human
rights abuses any where in the world if we will put deals ahead of
ideals in China?'' Pelosi asked. ``What does it profit a country if
it gains the world, but suffers the loss of its soul?''
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Rep. Robert T. Matsui, D-Calif., who was
instrumental in gathering support for the bill, said its passage
``is a big major step in terms of engaging the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   Matsui said the business community ``really worked in a way I
haven't seen in 22 years'' to get the bill approved.
</P>
<P>
   He said rejecting permanent trade relations for China would have
moved the United States ``more to isolationism.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi faced some formidable foes in this fight, including
leading elements of the business and agriculture sectors, the
Clinton administration _ including Vice President Al Gore _ and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   On Pelosi's side were organized labor and human rights and
environmental groups.

</P>
<P>
   Before the vote on the House floor, Bonior pleaded for defeat of
the China trade bill, saying Chinese workers who make handbags for
3 cents an hour won't be able to expand American exports by buying
U.S.-made items such as cell phones and cars. China, Bonior added,
is a nation where ``injustice is law and brutality is order.''
</P>
<P>
   But House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas, argued that
granting permanent trading status to China would improve life for
the Chinese by exposing them to Western ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will see liberty elsewhere in the world and they will
demand it of their nation,'' Armey said. ``If we deny them the
chance, we will condemn them to a life of despair.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Rep. J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who closed the
debate on the China bill, said the Chinese market is opening,
giving someone the opportunity to sell there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, who will be there? Will it be the United
States or will it be Europe and Japan?'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the trade bill, Hastert predicted U.S.
exports to China would increase by $2 billion a year and said ``our
high tech firms would thrive in the Chinese markets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gradual Democratic reform is taking place in the hearts and
minds of the Chinese,'' Hastert said. ``More trade will expose the
Chinese to American ideas.''

RUSSIA THREATENS TO BOMB ISLAMIC TARGETS IN AFGHANISTAN
</HEADLINE>
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia warned on Wednesday that it might bomb targets
in Afghanistan if the Islamic-led government there shelters and
supports rebels fighting in Chechnya and former Soviet republics in
Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian foreign minister and defense minister each suggested
that airstrikes might be carried out if the Taliban, the
fundamentalist group that leads the Afghan government, supports
Islamic militants fighting in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a potential threat emerges, various actions become
possible,'' Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said when asked if Russia
was contemplating airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   There were no signs that military action was imminent, and some
experts said that the Russians were engaging in saber rattling to
press the Taliban to sever its links with Islamic militants in the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials also insisted that the Kremlin was not
planning a ground attack in Afghanistan, the site of a disastrous
10-year war between Soviet troops and Islamic guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Russian threat put the United States in an
uncomfortable position little more than a week before a summit
meeting here between President Clinton and Russian President
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has urged the Kremlin not to broaden the conflict in
the Caucasus or along its southern periphery by bombing
Afghanistan. Still, it was the Clinton administration that launched
a cruise missile attack in 1998 against suspected terrorist camps
in Afghanistan following the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the object of the Clinton administration's attack _
the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, whom Washington suspects of
masterminding the embassy bombings _ is also a nemesis of Russia.
Russian officials have charged that bin Laden and Islamic groups
are providing weapons and other aid to Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree that bin Laden is a threat to the region and
beyond,'' said a senior Clinton administration official. ``But we
believe the Russians should exercise restraint. We don't believe
that anything is to be gained by spreading the Chechen war.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. experts say that there is some merit to the Russian
complaint that the fighters in Chechnya include militants from the
Middle East and South Asia and that foreign Islamic groups are
providing money and material support. But they assert that Russia
is exaggerating the significance of the foreign assistance in order
to portray its war in Chechnya as a struggle against an external
threat rather than a battle against insurgent Chechens who are
fighting for their independence.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya is not the only Russian concern. Earlier this month,
Putin suggested that Islamic rebels in Uzbekistan and other former
Soviet republics in Central Asia were receiving support from
foreign sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready to take preventative measures, if necessary,''
Putin said during a visit to Tashkent, the Uzbek capital. ``We are
ready to take preventative measures, if necessary. Russia will
certainly lend a hand to Uzbekistan.''
</P>
<P>
   The speculation about airstrikes was ignited by comments earlier
this week by Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin spokesman for the
war in Chechnya. Yastrzhembsky's comments were assailed by Gennadi
Zyuganov, the Communist party leader, who urged caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am becoming increasingly convinced that people are getting
into the Kremlin who are ready to wage war with anyone, starting
with their own people and ending with neighboring states,''
Zyuganov said. ``The remark made by the press secretary was
absolutely irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yastrzhembsky has insisted that his comments reflected
official policy and on Wednesday, Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor
D. Sergeyev were careful not to undercut the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the current situation, the important thing is to show our
resolve to conduct decisive actions against the bandits,'' Sergeyev
said in Minsk, Belarus, where he was attending a meeting on
security cooperation between Russia and former Soviet states,
including Central Asia republics.
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcing the point, defense ministry officials said on
Wednesday that they had carried out military exercises, dubbed
``Southern Shield,'' in which airstrikes were carried out to defend
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan against Islamic rebels
supported from bases in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban are merging with the anti-Uzbek and anti-Tajik
opposition,'' Russian officials told the news agency Interfax.

AUTHOR KOZOL ON A CRUSADE FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jonathan Kozol is known for his scathing critiques of
public education in America and its inequalities, his unstinting
advocacy for the poor and dispossessed, all put forth in
best-selling books that mix righteous anger and liberal polemic.
His tireless activism has made Kozol seem, after almost four
decades, as nagging as a debtor's conscience.
</P>
<P>
   But get the 63-year-old Kozol out onto the wide open spaces of
the asphalt playground at Cooper Elementary School in West Seattle
and the man seen often as a scold is instantly transformed. Never
mind the suit and tie, the wire-rimmed spectacles, the Harvard
University and Rhodes scholar pedigree. Here at Cooper, the real
Kozol emerges _ Kozol the kid.
</P>
<P>
   This smallish man with windblown gray hair is soon tossing a
blue ball back and forth with a young girl who had seemed shy as a
whisper only moments before. Or the former teacher is hunched over
at kid-level, his eyes registering intense interest, as he quizzes
children about their names, where they come from, what they like at
school. His little playground partners respond readily to his
childlike enthusiasm, the smiles that often light his face, the
natural ease of kidding around.
</P>
<P>
   Kozol is so energized by these encounters that it takes
considerable self-control for him not to demonstrate, with a bunch
of giggling young jump-ropers, his talent for double Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be the only adult doing double Dutch,'' he
remarks to an adult bystander, ``and certainly not the only male.''
</P>
<P>
   There is such pure delight about Kozol when he is among
schoolchildren that all his past advocacy suddenly makes perfect
sense: The man loves kids and hates anything that threatens to
thwart their joys and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The same message resounds through Kozol's powerful new book _
``Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope'' (Crown
Publishers, 375 pages, $25). This is a dramatic change of pace from
one of the country's leading social critics, a soft-spoken,
heart-tugging and highly personal inside look at a group of young
African American and Hispanic children in one of the poorest
neighborhoods in America, the Mott Haven section of New York City's
South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the polemics of such past Kozol books as ``Death at an
Early Age,'' (1967), ``Savage Inequalities'' (1991) and ``Amazing
Grace'' (1995). Instead, ``Ordinary Resurrections'' gives affecting
glimpses of Kozol trudging up flights of walk-up apartment stairs
in order to share his first Kool-Aid in 50 years with an 8-year-old
girl known as Pineapple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jonathan,'' the would-be grown-up instructs him several times,
``please make yourself at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Or there are glimpses, accumulated by Kozol in more than 200
visits to the neighborhood, of the heroic labors of devoted
teachers at Public School 30 or intrepid after-school workers at
the neighboring St. Ann's Episcopal church. These adults, despite
horrid odds, enwrap the children in a cocoon of love, hope,
discipline and commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all kinds of heroines and heroes in the ordinary
world,'' Kozol writes. ``The ones I like to spend my time with are
the preachers and the teachers who take on the hardest, messiest
and most exhausting work and still come out of it somehow with
souls intact and particles of merriment still percolating in their
personalities. I don't know how they do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others might make the same observation about Kozol in the wake
of his hectic visit to Seattle, which lasted from Sunday through
Tuesday. This was not the usual sort of book-tour stop. Instead,
Kozol's visit became a kind of secular children's crusade, with the
author playing the various roles of preacher, cheerleader,
counselor, listener, advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Kozol, who is Jewish, delivered the sermon at the Sunday worship
service at the University United Methodist Temple before 400
people, then returned there that evening to a University Book
Store-sponsored talk about his new book before 900 people.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Kozol fired up an Alliance for Education luncheon
attended by 40 people, including Superintendent Joseph Olchefske
and many potential donors of private money to assist Seattle public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You in Seattle still have the potential to live up to Dr.
King's dream in this city, which is very rare in this country,''
Kozol emphasized. ``You in Seattle have the makings of a real
democratic system of public education.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozol also met with teachers from public schools in the Queen
Anne vicinity and with students at McClure Middle School. He spent
an hour with Howard Schultz, chairman of Starbucks, whose
foundation's efforts on behalf of literacy were inspired by Kozol's
``Amazing Grace.'' And Kozol had dinner with Rudy Crew, the former
New York City schools chancellor who is now executive director of
the Institute for K-12 Leadership at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the best part of the visit to Seattle, in Kozol's view, was
his time Tuesday with the students at Cooper elementary. There were
no books to sell or sign, no requests for quick answers to
difficult education questions. There was just more to learn at a
brand-new school, where he was often accompanied by principal Anne
Johnson who, although she was too shy to mention it to Kozol, had
been inspired to go into urban education by Kozol's ``Death at an
Early Age,'' as have been many teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Kozol was impressed by Cooper's building, a handsome and
spacious facility nearing the end of its first school year, and its
green surroundings of undeveloped parkland. He impulsively tested a
pencil sharpener at one point and smiled when he found it in fine
working order. But, more than physical resources, he delighted in
the school's 400 students of all colors speaking 15 different
languages, 85 percent of them from homes classified as
impoverished, yet getting along well together in classrooms,
cafeteria and playground.
</P>
<P>
   But Kozol soon discovered that the appearance of calm at Cooper
was deceiving. These children on society's low rung had been
thriving in their sudden good fortune at their new school, what
seemed a gleaming entrance into the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   But now 80 students at Cooper are likely to be transferred to
other schools as the result of the district's redrawing of
boundaries, which had the effect of adding the territory of a golf
course and industrial Harbor Island but losing children. Cooper
parents and staff are outraged, as is Kozol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people see the little children at this school as a
symbolic fight,'' the activist said. ``It would be awful to send
these kids back to other schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozol's anger was fueled, in part, by the contrast between
Cooper and the South Bronx elementaries that are the centerpiece of
``Ordinary Resurrections.'' It was not so much Cooper's spacious
new building as the school's ethnic mix. The South Bronx schools
have just 26 whites among 11,000 students, schools so segregated
that Kozol often likens them to the mandatorily segregated schools
of Mississippi in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   And this poor South Bronx neighborhood is also a societal
dumping ground, a place not only plagued by poverty, unemployment
(over 45 percent), heroin, AIDS and incarcerated fathers, but also
by such unwanted institutions as a medical-waste incinerator, a
sewage plant and a prison. Yet this neighborhood is also the home
to Pineapple, Elio, Tabitha and Otto, real children who participate
in everyday childhood dramas and escapades with resilient spirits.
</P>
<P>
   These children have provided comfort and delight to Kozol, a
longtime bachelor with no children of his own who has been
dispirited by the increasing decline of his parents, including a
father with Alzheimer's who no longer recognizes him. These
children had also provided a corrective, of sorts, to ``Death at an
Early Age,'' proving to Kozol that such children could at least
survive and prosper until middle school, and maybe beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``These children,'' he emphasizes, ``do not die as easily as
some of us believed, including me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozol sits on a bench on the Cooper playground on a sun-drenched
afternoon, heartened by his time with schoolchildren, but also
pensive, reflecting on what four decades of advocacy and writing on
their behalf has wrought. He remains hopeful, yet circumspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to think,'' Kozol says, ``that these books have
made it harder for people to ever again categorize children because
of race and poverty, and harder for people to ignore the value of
their lives. Because as long as people feel free to categorize and
label children, then it is easy to segregate children, isolate
them. And everyone loses.''

PLAYWRIGHT EXPLORES ELIAN-STYLE IDENTITY CRISIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Octavio Solis is known for giving back to his community _ fellow
writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard from a lot of people,'' says Katherine Owens,
co-artistic director of Undermain Theatre in Dallas. ``They talk
about Octavio's generosity with other writers. He doesn't make a
big stink about where he's at.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where he's at'' right now is the top of his profession _ and
the Dallas Theater Center's Big D Festival of the Unexpected, of
which this year's centerpiece is the world premiere of Solis'
``Dreamlandia.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his days as a student writing ``punk-flavored'' musings at
the 500 Cafe in Dallas' Exposition Park, the Texas-born Solis, 40,
has matured into a playwright of international stature. He has
written about 15 plays in almost as many years, many of which were
commissioned by well-known regional theaters such as San
Francisco's Thick Description and South Coast Repertory.
</P>
<P>
   His first major commission, ``Man of the Flesh,'' came in 1987
from Teatro Dallas. Last year, Dallas' Undermain Theatre performed
``Shiner,'' a co-commission for Solis and San Francisco playwright
Erik Ehn. Solis, recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts
Playwrighting Fellowship as well as other playwriting grants, is
working on a musical based on the Orpheus legend. Members of the
band Los Lobos are involved in the project for Los Angeles' Mark
Taper Forum. After leaving Dallas, Solis will spend a two-year
residency in Ashland, Ore., to work on a new play that he will also
direct.
</P>
<P>
   His time as a young writer in Dallas was important, Solis says,
because ``it cut my teeth in terms of realizing how much of a tool
language can be; that the language of the theater can be heightened
and poetic. I desperately wanted to get away from realism. I think
that's such a bore.''
</P>
<P>
   A bore is certainly one thing no one is likely to call
``Dreamlandia,'' which began to take shape after Solis worked with
Dallas Theater Center artistic director Richard Hamburger on Solis'
``Santos &AMP; Santos'' in 1995. After that successful production,
Hamburger wanted to work with Solis again and asked him if there
were any project he was thinking about. Solis cited ``Life Is a
Dream,'' by 17th-century Spanish playwright Pedro Calderon de la
Barca, as a seminal work in his development as a playwright and
expressed interest in working from that classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three options,'' Solis says, ``but really I thought we
only had two: a strict translation or an adaptation more or less
true to the original. I started to do (the latter) but made a sharp
left turn on Page 1 and never looked back. I read ``Life'' once,
put it aside and started writing my play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is a Dream'' is one of Calderon's most-produced works.
Like one of his contemporaries, William Shakespeare, Calderon drew
from existing stories, legends and history for his plays. ``Life''
comes from the Middle Ages story of Josephat, who is held prisoner
and isolated from the rest of the world. In ``Life,'' that man is
the ``sleeping prince,'' Segismundo. In ``Dreamlandia,'' it's
Lazaro, a young man raised on an island straddling the
Mexican-American border who struggles with his cultural identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound sacrilegious, but I sort of thought,
`You know, I can improve on this play,' '' he says, laughing. ``I
feel as a writer you need to have that kind of arrogance to feel
like you can do anything, instead of holding the work as some
sacred thing. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The workshop version of ``Dreamlandia,'' called ``Suenos Suenos
Son,'' was performed at the 1997 Big D Festival. Solis says the
current version is virtually unrecognizable from its earlier
incarnation. He worked as DTC's playwright-in-residence last year,
during which he totally rewrote it, and he has since reworked it
many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the kind of writer who thinks that everything I put
down (on paper) is finished, genius work,'' he says. ``I have to
rework and fine-tune until I get it right. I have no delusions
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not he has delusions of grandeur, he has established
a loyal and growing following of admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``His use of language is extraordinary,'' Hamburger says. ``He
has a Shakespearean use of character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all used to go hang out in Deep Ellum before it was
anything, and he would read his stories,'' says Owens, who was part
of the local theater scene with Solis before the playwright
ventured out of North Texas to establish a national reputation. ``I
thought he had such a remarkable amount of energy. His characters
were so vivid; he was speaking from a platform of myth that I don't
think other people have. I think he has a strong moral side, and
also a strong mythic side ... and those don't always go together.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Solis is a Latino writer, his work might be mistakenly
referred to as ``magic realism,'' a genre that incorporates
fantastic occurrences in an otherwise realistic setting often
associated with _ but not limited to _ Hispanic writers. Solis
admits to liking but not employing magic realism in his own
creations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's more irony, and a sense of humor and
brashness, that I find in my work,'' Solis says. ``In my plays, I
find that humor and irony have to be part of the tragic elements of
the play, the serious elements, the spiritual elements.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamburger agrees. ``I think the way ``Dreamlandia'' explores the
border between Texas and Mexico, between dream and reality, between
cultures, between different visions of the world, is quite
fascinating,'' he says. ``Some of the characters quite literally
don't know what is real and what is not real, which country they're
in, when they're dreaming or when they're awake, or whether they're
of Mexican or white heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Elian Gonzalez case, the play _ in which Lazaro
is torn between two worlds _ is more topical than even Solis could
have imagined when he was writing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tug of war going on between two entirely different
worlds, two nations, two world views,'' Solis says. ``And (Elian)
can barely figure out who he is. Everyone's trying to tell him,
`You're American,' no, `You're Cuban.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people have any idea of some of the things that
are going on (at the border),'' he says. ``It's an urgent world,
and a world that's going to transform the rest of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than cultural identity, Solis touches on additional issues
facing Mexico and America: NAFTA, the drug trade, ``maquiladoras''
and the killing of Mexican women, and the way Latinos are treated
in America. ``I hope to raise consciousness in people, because I'm
touching on a lot of issues,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Solis believes this will happen because of his and Hamburger's
understanding of each other. Hamburger ``knows how to bring forth
the vitality that is in the script. He just trusts it. We have a
good marriage.''

 &QL; 
An hour of  &UR; Robin Williams &LR;  doing stand-up was the surprise treat
Sunday, May 20, at Comedy Night at the Geary, an ACT Scholarship
Fund moneymaker. Williams was a surprise to organizers, too, who
didn't know until a few days before that he'd be joining
 &UR; Johnny &LR;  &UR; Steele &LR; ,  &UR; Will Durst  &LR; and  &UR; Greg Behrendt &LR; . At $25 a
ticket, fans got a great bargain; Williams got the opportunity he
likes, to try out new material in an unadvertised gig.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also headlined at a fund-raiser saluting  &UR; Bill Clinton &LR; 
last night in Washington. He told the Washington Post about  &UR; George
W. Bush &LR; : ``Some men are born great. Some achieve greatness. And
some get it as a graduation gift.''
</P>
<P>
   And he discussed appearing at political fund-raisers. ``Four
years ago, when I had never done any of these things before, I felt
like  &UR; Ray Charles &LR;  at the Louvre. . . . Is the money soft or hard?
It is money coming from the folks, and they're getting something
for it _ the music and the comedy and God knows what.''

   Each half of this couple, which has been a couple for more than
a year, brings a lot of history to the relationship. ``I haven't

<P>
   ``When Ronald Reagan and Nancy went to dinner with  &UR; Oscar de &LR;

Rollins' explained to the magazine. ``Now, he gets to go to all the
places he once only read about.''
</P>

said.

FOX APPOINTS NEW PRESIDENT OF ENTERTAINMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Fox network, confirming weeks of speculation, announced
Wednesday the appointment of Gail Berman as president of
entertainment for the network.
</P>
<P>
   Berman had been president of Regency Television, a production
studio affiliated with Fox's own 20th Century Television. Regency
this year created the television season's biggest new comedy hit,
``Malcolm in the Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   She replaces Doug Herzog, who held the position 16 months.
Berman will report to Sandy Grushow, who last November was named
chairman of the Fox television entertainment group, a unit of News
Corp. Grushow is the chief executive of both the Fox network and
its production studio.
</P>
<P>
   Berman said Wednesday she has had a strong working relationship
with Grushow for the last two years and that she expected Grushow
to ``move on to some larger issues in the company.'' As for her own
role, she said, ``I have the mandate to run the network,'' adding,
``I feel totally comfortable with the arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``Malcolm,'' Regency developed a number of other
successful shows during Berman's brief tenure there, including
``Roswell'' on WB, and two shows set for next season's network
schedules, ``Fearsum'' on Fox and ``Tucker'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   While she ran Regency Television, Berman, in an unusual
arrangement, continued to serve as executive producer for two other
series she helped create, ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and
``Angel,'' both of which have been successes for the WB network.
</P>
<P>
   She said that with this appointment she would end her
association with both those series.
</P>
<P>
   Berman started out as a producer for Broadway. Among the theater
she helped in producing were the original Broadway production of
``Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat'' in 1980, David
Rabe's ``Hurlyburly'' in 1984 and Athol Fugard's ``Blood Knot'' in
1985.

UNITED NATIONS AND CAMBODIA NEARER TO DEAL ON KHMER ROUGE TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 2nd and 3rd grafs to clarify)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ After months of often acrimonious exchanges
over who should ultimately control war crimes trials for the Khmer
Rouge, the United Nations has conceded to Cambodia the right to
appoint one of two prosecutors. The compromise appears to have
surmounted a major hurdle in eventually bringing former leaders of
the Khmer Rouge to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups immediately criticized the deal under which
either the Cambodian prosecutor or a co-prosecutor appointed by the
United Nations could proceed with a case if a five-judge panel does
not block it. The groups said the United Nations had compromised
its requirement that the trials be conducted by allowing the
prosecutors total independence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to allowing co-prosecutors, the deal also provides
that the panel of judges will include three members from Cambodia
and two nominated by the United Nations. Initially, the United
Nations would have preferred to model this panel on the war crimes
tribunals used in the Balkans and Rwanda, which are outside the
control of national governments.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was arrived at in part last month through the
intercession of Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who discussed the urgency
of establishing a tribunal with Cambodian leaders, and a long
series of negotiations between a U.N. team and Cambodia's prime
minister, Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   The deal must be approved by the Cambodian legislature before
the tribunal can be involved in cases against former members of the
Khmer Rouge, an extreme leftist movement that decimated Cambodian
society in the 1970s. More than 1 million people were executed or
died from hard labor, dislocation, starvation and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the deal signaled that Hun Sen, himself a former
lower-ranking Khmer Rouge official, had given up having total
control over the tribunal. The United Nations had opposed his
efforts because of the weakness and political vulnerability of the
Cambodian judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, U.S. and U.N. officials said, the two
prosecutors would be backed by the five judges. If the two
prosecutors cannot agree on an indictment, the five judges would
act as arbitrators. But for an indictment to be derailed, four of
the five judges would have to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary-general considers the prime minister's response
a positive development,'' said Fred Eckhard, the spokesman for U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. But the United Nations is refusing to
discuss the agreement, and plans to send its legal counsel, Hans
Corell, back to Cambodia to work out details. In the past, Hun Sen
has changed his position and undercut agreements.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials here and in Cambodia said that the Clinton
administration, with few foreign policy breakthroughs to its credit
as it enters its final months, strongly backed the deal, apparently
finalized this week in an exchange of letters between Hun Sen and
Annan.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, Bruce Broomhall, the
international justice coordinator, said that this provision is a
welcome development, but overall he remains skeptical of the
agreement ``because in our assessment it is a
lowest-common-denominator solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This rewards political intransigence by compromising on the
integrity of the tribunal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said in
an interview that he sees many pitfalls in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're afraid that this is a precedent that will come back to
haunt the U.N. elsewhere,'' Roth said. ``The U.N. has been a very
firm custodian of fair trial standards, and prosecutions have been
conducted with scrupulous regard for due process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This arbitration panel sets a terrible precedent, because it
suggests that a U.N.-appointed international prosecutor can't be
trusted to make independent, clear decisions. This sends precisely
the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   ``This compromise really only addresses the big issues of who
gets indicted and who gets acquitted or convicted,'' Roth, a former
prosecutor, said. ``In those big decisions, there is a sort of
check-and-balance system put into place. But there are dozens of
ways, apart from those big decisions, that the Cambodian government
can still sabotage the prosecutorial process. These are just not
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other unresolved issues, Roth said, there seems to have
been no clear decisions on what to do about amnesty deals that Hun
Sen has made with several high Khmer Rouge officials who are now
living openly in Cambodia _ some of them with government jobs.

 &HT;    HOUSE PASSES CHINA TRADE BILL
 &HT;    With CHINA-REACT-0525.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided U.S. House of Representatives
passed historic legislation on Wednesday ushering China into the
league of commercial powers enjoying permanent, first-rank access
to the vast U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   The 237-197 tally _19 more than needed to pass it _ advanced the
U.S.-China Trade Bill to the Senate, where it is expected to pass
with broad support in early June.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote marked the biggest legislative trade victory
for President Clinton since he pushed the North American Free Trade
Agreement, NAFTA, through a reluctant Congress in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of public stumping, Clinton was still lobbying
undecided lawmakers throughout the day for passage of a bill he
repeatedly called the most important foreign policy issue Congress
would face this year.
</P>
<P>
   He hailed the bill as an essential compliment to China's
impending admission to the World Trade Organization, or WTO,
expected as early as this fall, and said both developments, taken
together, would expand Chinese markets for U.S. exports ranging
from soybeans and pork to auto parts and computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be exporting, however, more than our products,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing China into the WTO and normalizing trade will
strengthen those who fight for the environment, for labor
standards, for human rights, for the rule of law,'' he said during
a televised address from the Rose Garden immediately after the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage in China's development,'' he said, ``we will
have more positive influence with an outstretched hand than with a
clenched fist.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added that with 1.25 billion people, ``China is the
largest new market in the world.'' He said the outcome was
particularly welcome after the enactment earlier this month of a
bill to expand trade with Africa, Central America and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would end the two-decade practice through which
Congress has made China's ability to export to this country
conditional upon an annual review of Beijing's conduct in areas
ranging from human rights and worker liberties to environmental
practices and religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   While China's record in each of those areas remains poor by U.S.
standards, supporters of permanent normal trade relations, or PNTR,
for China said the yearly review had become a largely symbolic
exercise with little apparent impact on Beijing's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   At best, these proponents contend, the annual threat to rescind
favorable trading terms with China had become a source of added
friction in the already complicated relationship between the United
States and the most populous country on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The annual review has not been an effective mechanism,'' said
Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich. ``It was not used after Tiananmen,'' he
said, referring to Beijing's bloody crackdown on student-led
demonstrations in 1989, ``and there's no strategy for its effective
use in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argued that in granting PNTR status to China the
United States was ceding a powerful tool for influencing Beijing's
harshly repressive Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   The most passionately debated trade issue to come before the
Congress in seven years, the bill was cast by its foes as a litmus
test of American values and ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote defines what kind of a nation we want to be,'' said
Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., who opposed the bill ``Are we only for
the almighty dollar or for morality and doing what's right? The
almighty dollar, or human rights?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked fellow opponent Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who voted
against the bill: ``What credibility do we have, as the leader of
the free world, to speak about human rights abuses anywhere in the
world if we put deals above ideals?''
</P>
<P>
   And, like the annual discussion the bill is aimed at ending,
Wednesday's debate was marked by sharp criticism of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a police state ... a nation where injustice is law and
brutality is order,'' said House minority whip David Bonior,
D-Mich., a leading opponent of PNTR. ``Americans value trade, but
we're not willing to trade in our values.''
</P>
<P>
   What won the day, though, was the multi-premised argument that
PNTR would manifestly benefit U.S. exporters, even as increased
ties with U.S. companies helped to promote change in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I profoundly believe that it will advance the cause of human
rights for the Chinese people ... It may be the only way,'' said
House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Holding what he said was a palm-held personal computer, Armey
said China's Communist rulers would not be able to turn back the
tidal wave that advances in information technology have unleashed
across China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is said that the pen is mightier than the sword,'' Armey
said, ``and I would argue that the PC is mightier than the shackles
of tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   In a day of soaring emotions and equally pitched rhetoric, the
vote turned traditional House allegiances upside down, splitting
Republicans and Democrats alike, making adversaries of allies and
turning partisan foes into unlikely comrades.
</P>
<P>
   After Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., delivered a forceful appeal
for passage, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who led the
Republican effort to approve the bill, remarked on the strange
bedfellows the issue had created.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie, we've been talking a lot lately,'' Hastert said.
``They'll be talking about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Managing the floor debate for Republican opponents, meanwhile,
was Georgia Republican Charlie Norwood, who found himself lined up
alongside the likes of Bonoir and House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   In a barnburner that elicited a sustained ovation, Norwood said
the debate boiled down to ``jobs, bombs and bibles,'' saying the
issue touched on critical elements of this country's economic and
security future as well as the religious persecution that continues
in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``My district has lost manufacturing jobs to cheap Chinese labor
every year that I've been in Congress ... this is not just cheap
labor my friend, it's also slave labor,'' said Norwood. Meanwhile,
he said, ``persecution of anyone in China who believes in a higher
authority has gotten much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   For Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., opposition to PNTR for China came
down to bread and butter issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to hurt probably a couple of hundred thousand
Americans real bad. It's going to hurt those people who are going
to lose their jobs overnight,'' Stark said during Wednesday's floor
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the PNTR bill as a boon for big corporations, Stark
cast the vote as a choice between helping ``families who may be
looking for hamburger helper on the dinner table ... or for the
people who may be making millions of dollars in stock options.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States purchased some $81 billion worth of goods from
China last year, nearly $70 billion more worth of products than
U.S. companies shipped to China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made the strengthening of U.S.-China relations a
cornerstone of his foreign policy agenda. The goal has pitted him
against elements within his own party _ particularly labor unions
that fought tooth, nail and hair for the bill's defeat _ China's
own behavior, and even the breath-taking series of errors that led
to the U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy last spring in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   As with NAFTA, it was Republicans who Clinton needed to carry
Wednesday's vote. This time around, Clinton found himself aligned
with the very Republican House members _ Armey, Hastert and Rep.
Thomas DeLay of Texas among them _ who led the charge less than two
years ago to impeach him on charges stemming from his relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

 &HT;    Roberds ready to liquidate
 &HT;    By Tim Tresslar
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST CARROLLTON, Ohio _ The liquidation sale for failed home
furnishings retailer Roberds Inc. is expected to begin Friday at
some stores in Dayton and Atlanta and on Saturday at all the
company's remaining stores in those markets, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Brothers Retail Partners will open certain stores Friday
at noon as workers finish preparing them for the liquidation sale,
said Walter Craig, senior lead consultant for the Boston-based
liquidator. Craig was unsure which stores will open Friday. All
locations in Ohio, Indiana and Georgia will open Saturday for the
liquidation sale.
</P>
<P>
   On May 2, Roberds shuttered stores in Ohio, Indiana and Georgia
and announced it was going out of business. In January, the company
had filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors and planned to
emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization within 90 days.
However, the cash-strapped retailer's inability to secure new
inventory forced it to close.
</P>
<P>
   On May 16, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Thomas F. Waldron named
Gordon Brothers liquidator for six stores plus the Fairborn
warehouse in the Dayton area. The company also is conducting the
liquidation of 10 stores and a regional warehouse in the Atlanta
area.
</P>
<P>
   Roberds Vice President and Chief Financial Officer John Grigsby
said the liquidators will accept cash, checks and credit cards for
purchases. They will not accept Roberds' private-label credit card,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is to be completed by Sept. 15, or earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Brothers purchased $27 million in inventory from Roberds
and also plans to stock stores with non-Roberds merchandise, a
practice called ``augmenting.'' The Ohio Attorney General's office
had protested plans to add more inventory because it violates the
state's consumer protection laws. Waldron granted Roberds' request
to do so, saying the additional inventory will mean more money for
Roberds to reimburse customers who made down payments but did not
receive promised merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said the company will bring in merchandise of ``quality as
good or better'' than what Roberds offered before it closed. Plans
call for Gordon Brothers to buy at merchandise for the
going-out-of-business sale from Roberds' vendors, Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   The liquidator will honor deposits, merchandise credits and gift
certificates transacted since Roberds' January bankruptcy filing,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers needing information regarding unfilled orders can call
1-800-686-6814, extension 2510.

<P>
   Buy at AEA and sell by H&AMP;Q, goes the Wall Street saying.
</P>
<P>
   AEA, of course, is the American Electronics Association's
investment conference held in early November each year, and H&AMP;Q is
the annual Chase Hambrecht &AMP; Quist technology conference, held in
May.
</P>
<P>
   The concept behind the saying is that technology stocks trade at
bargain prices both after the summer slump and before any rally
created by reports of strong third or fourth quarter sales.
</P>
<P>
   By selling into the enthusiasm generated by the technology
company presentations at H&AMP;Q, investors have been able to lock in
profits and avoid the slump that corresponds to the slow sales
reported for the June quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The theory has worked pretty well over the years. In 1999, for
example, Compaq fell 10 percent from May 11 to July 1. Dell dropped
14 percent during the same period. In 1998, Dell declined 13
percent in an even shorter span from May 11 to June 1. That year,
Compaq tumbled 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Old market truisms, however, haven't been fairing too well of
late. ``Don't fight the Fed'' is one example.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Federal Reserve started to raise interest rates on
June 30, 1999, an investor would have done just fine buying the
high price-to-earnings stocks that interest rate hikes are supposed
to slaughter. From July 1, 1999, to March 17, the Nasdaq Composite
Index was up almost 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hikes and a tumble''? That one hasn't panned out,
either. Since the central bank's Nov. 16 decision to increase the
federal funds rate to 5.5 percent _ it had been 4.75 percent before
the June meeting _ the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 climbed 3 percent. The
Index is up 4 percent since the Feb. 2 move to 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   No great gains, but certainly no correction, either. Odds are
that 2000 won't treat ``buy at AEA, sell at H&AMP;Q'' with a whole lot
more respect.
</P>
<P>
   A shift in the fundamentals of the market has taken some of the
predictive power out of the traditional admonitions against the
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are far less dependent on banks and bank loans for
financing, and consumers now have access to much more credit from
many more sources. Those sources themselves are raising money in
ways that often bypass banks.

<P>
   In the same way, fundamental changes in the technology sector
suggest that investors might want to revisit some of the
assumptions that lie behind the ``buy at AEA, sell at H&AMP;Q'' rule.
</P>
<P>
   The expression itself dates from the days when the
personal-computer industry was the technology sector. It's an
accurate reflection of the lumpy, seasonal patterns in
personal-computer sales, which peak in the last quarter of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   From October to December, computer sales often account for as
much as 40 to 50 percent of a company's annual total. Of course,
that also means a January slump in orders, as manufacturers and
sales outlets work off inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at suppliers start to pick up in the quarter that ends in
September, as everybody begins to ramp up for the rest of the year.
Over time, this pattern has been as predictable as the hands on a
clock.
</P>
<P>
   But PC companies aren't the technology sector anymore. Dell,
Intel, and Microsoft now share leadership with companies such as
Cisco Systems, Oracle, and Nokia, none of which sell significant
amounts of their products to the personal-computer market.
</P>
<P>
   And the growth in the technology sector isn't coming from PC
companies; it's coming from areas such as wireless communications,
broadband Internet to the home, and optical networking.
</P>
<P>
   Even classic PC companies such as Intel recognize the shift.
Recently, its acquisitions have been of companies active in
communications, not in computer technologies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's not even clear that it's accurate to talk about a
``technology sector'' at all anymore. By some counts, technology
companies compose as high as 40 percent of the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 Index.
</P>
<P>
   Technology mutual funds now routinely divide their technology
holdings into 10 or more sectors, such as telecommunications
equipment, semiconductor equipment, and computer services and
software, that are each as large _ in the number of companies they
encompass, anyway _ as the old PC sector.
</P>
<P>
   And technology is everywhere in this economy. General Motors is
a holding company with interests in automobiles, satellite
communications, and business-to-business Internet commerce. The
traditional auto company is now just one piece of a much larger
pie.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric, the epitome of an old economy company, is
again looking to reinvent itself by employing the Internet to cut
costs and grab markets.
</P>
<P>
   None of this means there won't be a ``technology slump'' this
summer. The old rule still has its converts, and to a degree, it
now represents a self-fulfilling prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks fall in the summer because everyone sells in
anticipation of a sell-off, which they themselves are creating. And
it is also never wise to downplay the importance of the mass
migration of brokers and analysts to the beaches of the east and
west coasts. Fewer analyst reports mean less cheerleading for
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But wise investors will take notice of the way the trend has
been changing. The slump is shorter and less predictable, it seems.
And it has less and less to do with the fundamentals of the many
technology companies that don't follow the seasonal patterns of the
PC industry.
</P>
<P>
   The summer slump may now be an opportunity to exploit. &QL;

 &HT;    Home Depot store accused in bias suit
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot is being charged with racial profiling by
an African-American customer in California who said he was falsely
arrested for trying to get a $12.80 refund.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Pina is seeking $7 million in damages in a lawsuit filed
in Los Angeles Superior Court for an incident the suit claims
occurred last year at a Home Depot in Signal Hill near Long Beach.
Pina claims he tried to return two items he had purchased the
previous day at a Home Depot in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Pina was arrested in the store by
local police after Home Depot's security officer accused Pina of
using a fake receipt.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were dropped days later after Pina proved he had an
original receipt that matched Home Depot's transaction records, the
lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Pina's attorney, Scott Broffman, said his client was a victim of
racial profiling at the Signal Hill store, which is in a mostly
white neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the outside legal experts' review of the case, there
is nothing to indicate that Home Depot's policy of
non-discrimination and its value toward treating everyone equally
was violated,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The case is scheduled to go to trial on June 5, Broffman said.

<P>
   Buy at AEA and sell by H&AMP;Q, goes the Wall Street saying.
</P>
<P>
   AEA, of course, is the American Electronics Association's
investment conference held in early November each year, and H&AMP;Q is
the annual Chase Hambrecht &AMP; Quist technology conference, held in
May.
</P>
<P>
   The concept behind the saying is that technology stocks trade at
bargain prices both after the summer slump and before any rally
created by reports of strong third or fourth quarter sales.
</P>
<P>
   By selling into the enthusiasm generated by the technology
company presentations at H&AMP;Q, investors have been able to lock in
profits and avoid the slump that corresponds to the slow sales
reported for the June quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The theory has worked pretty well over the years. In 1999, for
example, Compaq fell 10 percent from May 11 to July 1. Dell dropped
14 percent during the same period. In 1998, Dell declined 13
percent in an even shorter span from May 11 to June 1. That year,
Compaq tumbled 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Old market truisms, however, haven't been fairing too well of
late. ``Don't fight the Fed'' is one example.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Federal Reserve started to raise interest rates on
June 30, 1999, an investor would have done just fine buying the
high price-to-earnings stocks that interest rate hikes are supposed
to slaughter. From July 1, 1999, to March 17, the Nasdaq Composite
Index was up almost 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hikes and a tumble''? That one hasn't panned out,
either. Since the central bank's Nov. 16 decision to increase the
federal funds rate to 5.5 percent _ it had been 4.75 percent before
the June meeting _ the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 climbed 3 percent. The
Index is up 4 percent since the Feb. 2 move to 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   No great gains, but certainly no correction, either. Odds are
that 2000 won't treat ``buy at AEA, sell at H&AMP;Q'' with a whole lot
more respect.
</P>
<P>
   A shift in the fundamentals of the market has taken some of the
predictive power out of the traditional admonitions against the
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are far less dependent on banks and bank loans for
financing, and consumers now have access to much more credit from
many more sources. Those sources themselves are raising money in
ways that often bypass banks.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, fundamental changes in the technology sector
suggest that investors might want to revisit some of the
assumptions that lie behind the ``buy at AEA, sell at H&AMP;Q'' rule.
</P>
<P>
   The expression itself dates from the days when the

<P>
   In July 1948, the Republican presidential nominee, Thomas Dewey,
met in Washington with two top advisers, John Foster Dulles and
Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, to decide what stance their party should
take on one of the first showdowns of the Cold War: the Soviet
blockade of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters afterward, Dewey, who had a substantial
lead in the polls over the incumbent, Harry Truman, said that the
Berlin crisis was so grave that it must be exempt from partisan
wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The present duty of Americans is not to be divided by past
lapses but to unite to surmount present danger,'' Dewey said. That
policy of ``indispensable unity,'' he added, was ``the Vandenberg
policy,'' meaning it bore a Republican stamp even though it had
been formulated under Democratic administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Such words found an echo last week when Gov. George W. Bush
sided with the Clinton administration in opposing a measure pushed
by Senate Republicans that would have set a strict deadline for
withdrawing American troops from Kosovo. He called it ``legislative
overreach,'' which, if enacted, would hamper his ability to conduct
policy should he be elected president in November. The bill failed,
but 40 of the 55 Republican senators supported it.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly lay behind this rift between Bush and the
Republican Congress? Important strategic or tactical differences?
Evidently not.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this is about on the Republican side is a deep dislike
and distrust for President Clinton,'' explained Sen. Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska, who voted against the Kosovo provision. It was a candid
admission by a respected Republican lawmaker that many in his party
have let their antipathy toward the president dictate their votes
on issues normally considered above partisan bickering.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Congress has no business disagreeing
with the president on foreign policy. Legislative consultation is
essential to strong, durable policy. There was far too little
debate, to cite the most obvious example, when President Lyndon
Johnson began escalating the Vietnam War in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are presidential candidates barred from developing their own
foreign policy ideas. On the contrary, as Bush's recent comments on
nuclear security show, he is willing to state his differences with
Clinton on sensitive matters. But in doing so, he has sent a
broader message of continuity, most obviously by appearing at a
news conference on Tuesday with Henry Kissinger and Colin Powell,
two Republicans who are respected by Democrats. Unlike
congressional Republicans, Bush seems to recognize the distinction
between principled opposition and vengeful obstructionism, and to
know how destructive the latter can be.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what happened after the 1948 election. Dewey didn't
win, of course. Truman did. In their frustration, Republicans
embarked on a mission to punish the Democrats. Some claimed the
Truman administration had treasonously handed China over to the
Communists in 1949. Then Sen. Joseph McCarthy accused Secretary of
State Dean Acheson and others of being servants of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   It was slander, yet senior Republicans like Robert Taft
tolerated and even egged on McCarthy's assaults. A few Republicans
came forward to challenge McCarthy, but none had the stature of
Arthur Vandenberg. He died in 1951, having supported Truman's Cold
War policies to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, too, have indulged in the politics of vengeance. In
1974 the ``Watergate Congress,'' seething with hatred of Richard
Nixon, cut the lifeline to South Vietnam as it was about to be
overrun by North Vietnamese troops. If not for President Gerald
Ford, who insisted that South Vietnamese refugees be transported to
the United States, many thousands more would have been killed or
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel hastens to assure us that congressional Republicans are
under control. ``If you have a President Bush,'' he said, ``you'll
find all this settle down considerably.''
</P>
<P>
   But if we have President Gore instead, the Republicans might
grow even testier, battling the perceived usurper at every
juncture. Will they attack Gore just as McCarthy and company
attacked Harry Truman, not only for his sins but for those
committed by the popular president whose coattails he rode into
office? Hagel's words seem to carry an implicit threat: If our guy
doesn't win, more trouble will come.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would do far better to follow Bush's lead, not only
because it is more statesmanlike but because history is on his
side. In staking out common ground with the current administration,
Bush is aligning himself with Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon and
Ronald Reagan, all Republicans who came into office on the heels of
Democratic presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Despite differences with their predecessors, each achieved
triumphs by staying the course of a bipartisan foreign policy. And
each had legislative help. If Bush is elected, he will need it,
too. But he also needs it now if the country is to feel confident
in Republican leadership. He needs an Arthur Vandenberg. Sadly, he
doesn't appear to be in sight.

  Chan, Wilson ride out early 
mutual dislike in buddy film 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When director Tom Dey (pronounced ``Dye'') showed up on the set
of ``Shanghai Noon,'' he was understandably a little nervous. Not
so much because he was a commercial director making his first
feature film. It had more to do with a phone call he had received
from one of his stars, Owen Wilson, not long before shooting was to
commence.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Wilson and his co-star, Hong Kong action hero Jackie
Chan, weren't exactly seeing eye-to-eye on things. They weren't
even on speaking terms. So as he prepared for his first day of
location shooting in Calgary, Dey pondered how he would go about
making a buddy movie featuring two actors who weren't exactly
buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember feeling pretty worried before we started,'' Dye
says. ``We knew this movie would rise and fall based on the
chemistry between Jackie and Owen.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the reaction from studio executives at Disney, the
movie's distributor, everyone involved must have risen to the
occasion. ``Shanghai Noon'' is opening on Memorial Day weekend, one
of the peak movie-going periods of the year, and it's positioned
against ``M:I-2,'' considered to be the most potent box-office film
of the summer. Disney moved the film up from its original August
release date based on reactions from test audiences, who raved
about the interplay between Chan and Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We caught lightning in a bottle,'' Dey says, breathing a
little easier these days.
</P>
<P>
   Chan came up with the idea of ``Shanghai Noon'' while making
another buddy movie, ``Rush Hour.'' Basically, Chan wanted to make
an ``East Meets Western'' kind of movie, playing his chopsocky
sensibilities off the idea of the traditional gunslinger. Once Dey
was hired, the challenge was to find an actor who could play off
Chan's fish-out-of-water innocence much the same way Chris Tucker
did in ``Rush Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   After a number of auditions and turn-downs (Vince Vaughan was
once a leading candidate for the role), Dey gave the part to Owen
Wilson, who was hired as much for his writing ability as he was for
his acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there were too many lines that I said in the
movie that were in the original script,'' says Wilson, who co-wrote
the critically acclaimed independent films ``Bottle Rocket'' and
``Rushmore'' with writing partner Wes Anderson. ``My idea was to
create an outlaw who was pretty much just in it for the girls. He
didn't actually care all that much for the actual outlaw part of
the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's reluctant gunfighter teams up with Chan's character, a
Chinese Imperial Guard who comes to the Old West to rescue a
princess who has been kidnapped from the Forbidden City. It's a
buddy movie in the tradition of ``48 Hours'' (Wilson's favorite)
and ``Midnight Run'' (Chan's choice), featuring two characters who
learn from each other once they move beyond their initial hostility
and mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, life imitated art as the relationship between
the two leads strangely evolved much as it did in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owen and Jackie are very different people,'' Dey says. ``Owen
is from Texas and he's got this drawl to his voice. He's kind of
lazy, kind of laconic. Jackie is everything that Owen is not. He's
extremely disciplined and hard-working and really embodies the
traditional values of the East.''
</P>
<P>
   The two actors share one trait _ shyness. And that wariness was
largely responsible for the initial rockiness between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first encounter was a bad experience because I don't talk
to strangers easily,'' Chan says. He then compares that first
meeting to what he believes is the secret of a good buddy movie,
saying, ``You start with not knowing someone, having conflicts with
him. Then you get to know him better, you work together, and you
become buddies as actors. It's a principle in life to get to know
people better.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson agrees, which is ironic given that he tried to employ
that principle when he first met Chan, only to be rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were supposed to meet for dinner and get to know each other
since the movie kind of depends on the buddy factor,'' Wilson says.
``And when he came in, he had some people with him, which was a
little awkward. So I just kind of talked to his manager and Jackie
just kind of smiled and nodded, and finally I just got up and said,
`Well, I guess I'll see you in Calgary.' And he was like, 'Oh, OK.
See you.' He didn't say, 'Oh, you've got to stay longer.' So then I
was thinking that maybe he just didn't like me. I had no idea what
to think about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan and Wilson were still circling each other (and Dey for that
matter) on the first day of filming. Dey decided to put their
underlying antagonism to work, choosing to shoot a jailbreak scene
that featured plenty of hostility _ both in the script and
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the one scene in the movie that I didn't want to
(shoot) and that's what we began with,'' Wilson says of the
sequence he believed was too unrealistic. ``So that made it extra
kind of awkward. But it ended up working, me screaming at Jackie,
and we made each other laugh, too. And I quickly realized that we
were pretty simpatico sense-of-humor-wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a real innocence that I like,'' Wilson continues. ``And
once you get to know him, you see a kind and decent person, the
same person that comes across on the screen. You can't really fake
stuff like that. It's not like you see this guy on camera and then
the camera shuts off and he's saying, 'Where's the hookers? Where's
the tequila?'''
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol did actually play a significant part in the making of
``Shanghai Noon.'' Chan threw a party for the crew one night and,
as the evening wore on, he and his stunt men began playing several
variations of a Chinese drinking game. Wilson, ever the observer,
watched (and ended up participating, naturally), and approached Dey
with the idea of including it in the movie. Filmed as each actor
sits in a separate bathtub, it ended up being one of the film's
funniest scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we shot that, it really was the complete turning point in
both the relationship between the characters and the relationship
between Owen and Jackie,'' Dey remembers. ``And it was pretty much
improvised on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Wilson: ``They talk so much about De Niro gaining weight
for 'Raging Bull.' But what about me getting totally hammered so we
could pull off that Chinese drinking-game scene?''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson might get his due when it comes time to negotiate his
contract for a possible sequel. Disney has already commissioned
``Shanghai Noon'' screenwriters Alfred Gough and Miles Millar to
begin work on a follow-up, which Millar says will be an
action-adventure movie in the vein of ``Raiders of the Lost Ark.''
Whether the script will ever see the light of day will depend on
how well audiences respond to the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but feeling like the little engine that could,''
Dey says. ``Anything that happens now is gravy.''

Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Shanghai Noon'' does little more than deliver on its promise _
Jackie Chan in the Old West _ in crisp, efficient and nicely
packaged style. It's not exactly a landmark achievement, but when
you consider how readily such surefire entertainment material
misses the mark in today's Hollywood (``Wild Wild West'' anyone?
Didn't think so), it sure is appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   The feature debut of commercials director Tom Dey (who once
wrote a magazine profile of the great Mexican cinematographer
Gabriel Figueroa, and it shows), ``Shanghai'' strikes a good
balance between humor and action, stages Chan's ridiculously
inspired fight stunts so you can enjoy them rather than get a
headache from overediting, and gives us just about every Western
gag we could want. Chan, as wayward Chinese Imperial Guard Chon
Wang, fights Indians (and inadvertantly ends up married to one),
falls off trains, tears up saloons, has horse problems, et cetera.
He makes every time-honored situation seem, if not exactly fresh,
at least re-imagined with the painstaking care of a master physical
comedian.
</P>
<P>
   And for verbal fun, there's Owen Wilson's Roy O'Bannon. Chon
Wang's sometimes reluctant, probably untrustworthy sidekick,
O'Bannon is an intelligent if not real adept aspiring outlaw who
takes it upon himself to become his Asian pal's guide to all things
Western. What makes this stock character consistently amusing is
the way that Wilson plays him with the sensibility of who he
actually is: a 21st Century Texas slacker, wise to the implications
of everything and so ironically detached he even views his
strongest desires as something of a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson reportedly wrote most of his own dialogue, and much of it
bears the loopy, zen smartypants sting of the scripts he's written
with filmmaking partner Wes Anderson for ``Bottle Rocket'' and
``Rushmore.'' Hitching that fairly sophisticated humor up with
Chan's inventive kung foolery was an unlikely but felicitous
gambit. And, of course, it's not as obvious as Chan's ``Rush Hour''
pairing with Chris Tucker, whose grating style can be described as
verbal drop-kick comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The story here involves the luckless but formidable Chon Wang
and several other Imperial Guards delivering a ransom to 1870s
Nevada, where kidnapped Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu, dispensing with
the imperious attitude for a winning change) is being held by a
renegade traitor (Roger Yuan). Of course, Chon Wang gets separated
from his comrades, leading to multiple opportunities for trouble
and to fool around with the slapstick potential of tomahawks,
horseshoes, moose antlers and the like. Chan reportedly employed a
contemporary, 19th Century fighting for, um, that extra bit of
authenticity. It still looks like Buster Keaton, real angry, to me,
but it doesn't detract from the impression that Chan, as always,
took his work very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else about the movie is very serious, though, and
Western purists could conceivably be offended. On the other side of
that argument, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar's amiably ambling but
fully packed script saves room for some pointed yet anything but
sanctimonious, satirical jabs at the genre's inherent racism, which
is an always welcome development and especially apt here.
</P>
<P>
   You don't want to oversell ``Shanghai Noon'' _ it is,
fundamentally, just the old ``Kung Fu'' TV series with laughs and
better stunts. But if that at all sounds like a fun idea to you,
chances are you'll enjoy this one more than you will most of the
summer's overreaching entertainments.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: HAVE A NICER WEEK
 &HT;    For release Sunday, May 28.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON The Bible tells us that God labored for six days of
creation and rested on the seventh. Historians tell us the ancient
Jews took the idea of the week from the Babylonians, who lived on
the site of modern-day Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other measures of time, such as the day and the year, the
week has no fixed rationale in the heavens. A ``week'' could just
as well be eight days, as the Romans once had it. (They switched
back to seven in 321 A.D. under Emperor Constantine.)
</P>
<P>
   The World Future Society, which a decade ago foretold the rise
of the Internet, recently invited folks to e-mail along
far-reaching ideas on how to improve our lives. Proposals deemed of
wide interest are being posted online.
</P>
<P>
   That's how a proposed nine-day week made the cut on the
society's new ``social innovation forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Under such a scheme, says author Harold Howe II, ``our economy
would become more efficient, our leisure time more rewarding, our
schools and colleges less crowded, our religious activities more
meaningful, and our family lives more successful for both children
and adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Howe, who served as U.S. Commissioner of Education under
President Lyndon Johnson, found an unpublished 80-page Ford
Foundation research paper from 1976 that fosters the concept. It
was written by Carlos Varsavsky, an Argentine-born Harvard
astrophysicist who died in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Under Varsavsky's plan, all of us would join one of three
``cadres.'' At any given time, two cadres would be on the job (or
in school) while the third would be on vacation. Each ``week''
would consist of six work days and three rest days.
</P>
<P>
   Varsavsky thought the concept would be particularly useful to
part-time workers and seniors gearing down toward retirement. They
could elect to work one of the three-day segments while taking the
other six days off.
</P>
<P>
   For efficiency and convenience, families and small-sized work
groups could arrange to join the same ``A'',''B'' or ``C'' triad.
Should the need arise, they could also move from one to another.
</P>
<P>
   Since service facilities would run at full-bore every day, the
need to take time off from work to do chores would ease. Cars could
be fixed during any one of the three rotating three-day
``weekends.'' Stores would also remain open every day except,
perhaps, for five annual across-the-board holidays, such as
Christmas, that would be exempt from an annual 40-week cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic jams would be eased as well and parking spaces would be
more available _ since at any one time one third of the drivers
would be home or headed for the hills.
</P>
<P>
   For religious-minded people, there would be in a sense three
``Sundays'' a week. To be sure, church attendance on any one of
those ``Sundays,'' would drop by some two thirds. But, Howe argues,
the added ``ease of communication and opportunities for depth and
intimacy in worship would be much enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   A need to ``think outside the box'' has become the current
mantra in many Fortune 500 companies. Still, when new ideas
challenge tradition, the status quo often prevails.
</P>
<P>
   So will a nine-day week ever come to pass? It's doubtful. But it
wasn't so long ago that visionaries doubted we would ever walk in
space.

  Woods can't save Showtime's version of the Mapplethorpe trial 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Tonight' refers to Sat., May 27.) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Woods is an actor who really needs a crackling script to
sell his wiry nervous energy. Give him dialogue with the brittle
snap of a dried twig and he's flat-out brilliant, as he was in
``Salvador,'' ``Nixon'' and ``True Crime.'' Hand him an
indifferently render screenplay, and he tries so hard to save or
elevate it he can become downright annoying (see _ or better yet,
don't _ ``The Boost'' or ``Another Day in Paradise'').
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dirty Pictures,'' you'll likely keep waiting for Woods to
break loose even once the credits have rolled. There's even a scene
in which his character's wife, played by Diana Scarwid, tries to
coax him into breaking from his constraints and strutting his
stuff. He underplays his one big speech, which comes pretty late
into the proceedings anyway, and even though it's apparent his
character is the smartest guy in the whole film, he's vexingly
timid in a way you just know the real Woods isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty Pictures'' is one of those preaching-to-the-converted
films about the sacredness of the First Amendment, focusing on the
1990 obscenity trial in Cincinnati _ the town that had a veritable
aneurysm over Larry Flynt's handiwork _ when a local art museum had
the audacity to show an exhibit of the works of the late
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Mapplethorpe's work was benign enough _ some nicely lit
and composed shots of flowers and celebrities and very pretty
people. But then there were those handful of shots of homoerotic
sadomasochism that were extreme enough to put most decent folks off
their feed for a minute or two; and that's what got Contemporary
Arts Center director Dennis Barrie (Woods) hauled into court.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, ``Dirty Pictures'' is downright incoherent, a
Cuisinart of jabbering bit players _ pompous attorneys and
dramatically lit jurors alike _ mixed with real-life interview
subjects (Salman Rushdie, William F. Buckley Jr., Susan Sarandon,
Fran Liebowitz) waxing pretentious and the headline stars (Woods,
Scarwid and Craig T. Nelson as the politically motivated sheriff)
attempting to assert their characters in a jumble of narrative. The
story eventually comes into focus, but by then, it's already become
a rote, by-the-numbers ``issue'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   So we watch the requisite twisting in the wind demanded of
Barrie as politicians and lawyers get a hold of the trial. There's
never any question who's right _ the prosecutor is a puffy,
wheezing, squinty-eyed white guy; the judge dismisses defense
attorneys with fey, self-satisfied hand gestures. The film stacks
the deck further by showing Mapplethorpe's work _ but mainly his
more palatable photographs; the controversial stuff is seen in
split-second shots or simply described by sundry characters.
</P>
<P>
   Only at the very end does ``Dirty Pictures'' get provocative,
when its feel-good ending is undone by a monologue delivered by one
of the straight-laced, Moral Majority characters, who claims
victory because Barrie's marriage fell apart and the simple fact of
the trial made museum curators around the country a tad more timid.
The film has a small, salient point to make, and Liebowitz delivers
it early on when she observes of the concept of community
standards, ``There are no communities anymore _ there are only
special-interest groups.'' &QL;

   CHINA-TRADE-ASSESS (Washington) _ With his narrow victory on
trade with China, President Clinton has finally defined his imprint
on U.S. foreign policy: As the president who conducted the
post-Cold War experiment of using American economic power to foster
political change among America's neighbors and its potential
adversaries. It is a path he set out on in 1993, when 10 months

   ARSENIC-WATER (Washington) _ The Clinton administration has
proposed strict new regulations of arsenic in tap water, reducing
by 90 percent the public's maximum exposure to the chemical, which
causes cancer and is found at harmful levels in at least 1 out of
10 of the nation's community water supplies. About 30 million
people live in areas served by water systems that do not meet the
new standard, officials say. Los Angeles water has slightly more
arsenic than would be allowed, and other communities have much
higher concentrations. Norman, Okla., for example, has about seven

   1. BUSH IS NO EINSTEIN ON SOCIAL SECURITY, by Michael Kinsley.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein makes an unexpected appearance in George W. Bush's
Social Security proposal: ``Because of the impact of compound
interest, which Albert Einstein called the most powerful force in
the universe, diversified personal retirement accounts can be
expected to earn nearly 6 percent after inflation _ almost three
times what Social Security now provides.''
</P>
<P>
   Einstein was wrong, of course. The most powerful force in the
universe is stupidity. Then comes political spin. Compound interest
may be third.

</P>
<P>
   Priceline, the leading name-your-own-price Web site (the one

gasoline. You tell them how much you're willing to pay for a
certain number of gallons _ and give them your credit-card number
in advance.
</P>
<P>
   If they accept your offer, they immediately charge your credit
card. You then go to a nearby gas station and ignore the price at
the pump. But before you decide Priceline is the consumer's best
friend, you ought to know a little about how it works.

   3. TRADE WITH CHINA WILL CHANGE WOMEN'S LIVES, by Anne
Applebaum.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, while in Beijing for the (now forgotten, then
notorious) U.N. Conference on Women, I took a break from the chic
Frenchwomen with their talk of Kristeva, the earnest Germans
arguing about Jung, and the confused Cambodians, who were silently
making a quilt in honor of the great event.
</P>
<P>
   I set out for the countryside, the better to meet some actual
Chinese women, who were pretty thin on the ground at the U.N.
conference, except in the role of ``photographers'' and spies.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours from Beijing, in one of the small factory towns
that feed the city's markets, I found some. They were young peasant
women who had come to make their fortunes, sewing fake Chanel
handbags on rickety machines. In the workshop I visited, there were
about 12 of them. They worked downstairs, slept upstairs, and were
enthusiastic about the relative wealth and freedom which their new
employment status had conferred upon them.

   4. HAS CLINTON WEAKENED AMERICA'S DEFENSES? by Michael O'Hanlon.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans would have you believe that the
Clinton administration has gutted the U.S. military. Citing a
``severe drop in overall military readiness,'' Rep. Duncan Hunter
says U.S. forces are being pushed ``to the breaking point'' and
``could not fight and win against Iraq today as we did in 1991.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott alleges a similar ``downward spiral.'' Sen. Bob
Smith and others complain of a ``readiness crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans are wrong. On a per-person and per-weapon
basis, U.S. armed forces are very good, and by some measurements
they've never been better.

   5. THE TWO FACES OF VLADIMIR PUTIN, by Anne Applebaum.
</P>
<P>
   He's met with Tony Blair and shaken hands with the queen. Ted
Turner has come to pay his respects, and so did Sandy Berger:
Vladimir Putin, the new Russian president, even greeted Berger by
speaking of the ``warm, friendly, personal, and business
relations'' they had enjoyed when both were heads of their
respective countries' national security councils.
</P>
<P>
   The joviality will doubtless continue when President Clinton

   6. HOW TO WRITE A BOOK ON WOMEN IN HOLLYWOOD, by Judith
Shulevitz.
</P>
<P>
   Premiere magazine writer Rachel Abramowitz's ``Is That a Gun in
Your Pocket? Women's Experiences of Power in Hollywood'' is a long,
gossipy, blow-by-blow account of seemingly every single career move
ever made by the first two generations of women to succeed in
Hollywood, including studio chiefs Dawn Steel and Sherry Lansing,
agent Sue Mengers, actress/director Jodie Foster, director/writers
Nora Ephron and Elaine May, and producer Paula Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ITAGIYP isn't terrible, exactly, but it is the kind of book that
induces in the reviewer such weighty thoughts as, ``Ought this kind
of book to exist?''
</P>
<P>
   There is, in fact, an interesting case study to be written about
women and Hollywood. Complain all you like, but as industries go,
the movie industry is relatively open to women and other outsiders.
Sure, Hollywood looks white and male, given the frat-like male
bonding that goes on in film crews and the networking that tends to
shut out minority executives, but that appearance is misleading.

   1. BUSH IS NO EINSTEIN ON SOCIAL SECURITY, by Michael Kinsley.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein makes an unexpected appearance in George W. Bush's
Social Security proposal: ``Because of the impact of compound
interest, which Albert Einstein called the most powerful force in
the universe, diversified personal retirement accounts can be
expected to earn nearly 6 percent after inflation _ almost three
times what Social Security now provides.''
</P>
<P>
   Einstein was wrong, of course. The most powerful force in the
universe is stupidity. Then comes political spin. Compound interest
may be third.

   2. THE ECONOMICS OF PRICELINE, by Ira Carnahan.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline, the leading name-your-own-price Web site (the one
with those William Shatner TV commercials), is now selling
gasoline. You tell them how much you're willing to pay for a
certain number of gallons _ and give them your credit-card number
in advance.
</P>
<P>
   If they accept your offer, they immediately charge your credit
card. You then go to a nearby gas station and ignore the price at
the pump. But before you decide Priceline is the consumer's best
friend, you ought to know a little about how it works.

   3. TRADE WITH CHINA WILL CHANGE WOMEN'S LIVES, by Anne
Applebaum.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, while in Beijing for the (now forgotten, then
notorious) U.N. Conference on Women, I took a break from the chic
Frenchwomen with their talk of Kristeva, the earnest Germans
arguing about Jung, and the confused Cambodians, who were silently
making a quilt in honor of the great event.
</P>
<P>
   I set out for the countryside, the better to meet some actual
Chinese women, who were pretty thin on the ground at the U.N.
conference, except in the role of ``photographers'' and spies.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours from Beijing, in one of the small factory towns
that feed the city's markets, I found some. They were young peasant
women who had come to make their fortunes, sewing fake Chanel
handbags on rickety machines. In the workshop I visited, there were
about 12 of them. They worked downstairs, slept upstairs, and were
enthusiastic about the relative wealth and freedom which their new
employment status had conferred upon them.

   4. HAS CLINTON WEAKENED AMERICA'S DEFENSES? by Michael O'Hanlon.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans would have you believe that the
Clinton administration has gutted the U.S. military. Citing a
``severe drop in overall military readiness,'' Rep. Duncan Hunter
says U.S. forces are being pushed ``to the breaking point'' and
``could not fight and win against Iraq today as we did in 1991.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott alleges a similar ``downward spiral.'' Sen. Bob
Smith and others complain of a ``readiness crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans are wrong. On a per-person and per-weapon
basis, U.S. armed forces are very good, and by some measurements
they've never been better.

   5. THE TWO FACES OF VLADIMIR PUTIN, by Anne Applebaum.
</P>
<P>
   He's met with Tony Blair and shaken hands with the queen. Ted
Turner has come to pay his respects, and so did Sandy Berger:
Vladimir Putin, the new Russian president, even greeted Berger by
speaking of the ``warm, friendly, personal, and business
relations'' they had enjoyed when both were heads of their
respective countries' national security councils.
</P>
<P>
   The joviality will doubtless continue when President Clinton
himself arrives in Moscow at the end of next week _ and no wonder.
Although an official economic plan hasn't been published yet, words
like ``tax reform'' and ``foreign trade'' have lately been tripping
blithely off the president's tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Skip the upbeat headlines and read the stories buried deep

HANSON GOES ITS OWN WAY

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When they released their major-label debut, 1997's ``Middle of
Nowhere,'' the Hanson brothers were in the wrong place at the right
time.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were young 'n' cute, they were quickly and
thoughtlessly lumped in with the then-burgeoning boy-band movement
that was led by Backstreet Boys. Didn't matter that, unlike
Backstreet and later, 'N Sync, the Hanson bros _ Isaac, Taylor and
Zachary _ played their own instruments (and played them well) and
had more of a crush on the Jackson 5 than on New Kids on the Block.
</P>
<P>
   The boy-band craze helped ``Nowhere'' wind up everywhere: It
sold 5 million copies, and the band's signature hit, ``MMMBop,''
was as inescapable as their cute little mugs. But over time,
critics turned their backs and a lot of fans graduated to harder
stuff, like LFO.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to say if Hanson's second effort, ``This Time Around,'' is
gonna sell or flop. But one thing's for sure, and laugh all you
want: It ain't bad.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most impressive things about it: The brothers wrote
all the songs and even partially produced them. And while they
could have easily gone for the same digestible, funk-frosted pop
formula of their first disc, the guys opted for a grittier sound
that echoes '70s FM radio.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we're not talking the extravagances of Led Zeppelin or Yes.
Rather, songs like ``You Never Know,'' ``If Only'' and ``Runaway
Run'' are drenched in crunchy guitar riffs a la Bad Company.
Amplifying the '70s-rock vibe, John Popper from Blues Traveler
belts through a heated harmonica solo, while young guitar prodigy
Jonny Lang tears off a solo here and there.
</P>
<P>
   Modern twists, such as turntable scratches from Beck cohort DJ
Swamp, do abound, keeping ``Time'' from sounding dated.
</P>
<P>
   Vocally, the group has matured quite a bit. The honey-glazed
harmonies are still there, but you get the feeling that they're
coming from the heart this time, not a sound engineer's control
board. Isaac's voice has hardened, too, lending to these songs a
more grizzled edge.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, not everything works. The big ballads, such as
``Love Song'' and the title track, come off as factory-made space
filler to kill time between the good songs.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, this is a surprisingly good effort and, if
anything, the kids should be championed for doing it their way.
Initially, former Cars singer Ric Ocasek was brought in to produce
but was relieved when his ideas clashed with theirs. The band's new
label also reportedly put pressure on the guys to produce another
``MMMBop'' _ and they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Still only in their teens, Zac, Isaac and Taylor have discovered
the art of keeping their integrity, something most bands twice
their ages couldn't give a flip about. And that's worth a whole
lot. &QL;

 &HT;    Bush's support needed for state conservation initiative
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's task force on conservation
is months away from issuing recommendations on state parks,
wildlife, private lands, urban sprawl and outdoor recreation. But
two broad points of debate have already emerged: money and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   It is also clear that any major conservation initiative would
need the governor's backing to get a warm reception when the state
Legislature convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``This session is potentially going to be a make-it-or-break-it
for parks and conservation in the state. A lot of it rides on
Bush,'' said Andy Jones, Texas program coordinator for the
Conservation Fund, a national land-preservation group.
</P>
<P>
   A series of articles last week in the Austin American-Statesman
documented thin staffing and budgets, lack of land acquisition,
gaps in stewardship and pork-barrel politics in the state park
system.
</P>
<P>
   Reports by Texas A&AMP;M University and the Texas Historical
Commission have recommended budget increases. The staff of the
Legislature's Sunset Advisory Commission has outlined several
options for increasing the Parks and Wildlife Department's budget.
The 10-member Sunset Advisory Commission is expected to vote on
those recommendations next month.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's task force seems likely to call for more money to improve
and expand the 122 state parks, historical sites, natural areas and
fishing piers. The method of funding _ voter-approved bonds, a
dedicated share of state sales taxes or general appropriations _ is
less important than the money itself, said Carol Dinkins, a Houston
lawyer who chairs the panel and is also vice chairwoman of the
Parks and Wildlife Commission, which sets policy for the parks
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think we very much need new funding, and it needs to
be funding for acquisition, development, management and
operations,'' Dinkins said. ``Ultimately, it's going to be up to
the Legislature as to how to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is also up to the Legislature as to whether to do
that at all. Bush's position, and his willingness to use his bully
pulpit, could shape the debate. That is true even if the GOP
governor moves to the White House in January.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not elaborated beyond his two-page executive order in
February that established the task force. State and local parks
``are currently overtaxed due to increased demand, aging
infrastructure and insufficient funding,'' Bush said in his charge
to the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones, a spokesman for Bush, said the governor would not
pre-empt the task force and would instead await its report, which
is due by Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of faith in the task force members, who are all
respected leaders in their communities,'' Mike Jones said. ``They
all share the governor's concern for the quality of our environment
and, like him, they're dedicated to passing on a clean, better
Texas and passing on these beautiful natural resources we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry has not staked out a position, but a
spokesman said Perry looks forward to working on conservation
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are carefully monitoring the sunset commission and the
governor's task force on conservation as they grapple with these
issues,'' said Eric Bearse, Perry's spokesman. ``And we will be
looking forward to working with them and their proposals once they
make them public.''
</P>
<P>
   Any sizable spending initiative is likely to be received
skeptically by Rep. Rob Junell, who chairs the powerful House
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is going to be at the top,'' said the Democrat from
San Angelo. ``Health and human services will be next to the top.
And then we'll look at all the other things we do. When you add
money to Parks and Wildlife, you're basically taking it from
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Parks and Wildlife Department sought unsuccessfully last
year to get lawmakers to lift a $32 million cap on the amount of
money dedicated to parks from sales taxes on sporting goods. Junell
indicated this week that he remains philosophically opposed to such
a proposal, referring pointedly to Andrew Sansom, the department's
executive director and a proponent of dedicated funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a representative government,'' Junell said. ``Mr.
Sansom and the department would like to have an agency where the
Legislature just sends them whatever amount of money they'd like to
have and never bother them again. That's not the way our
Legislature works.''
</P>
<P>
   The method of funding is secondary, Sansom said. ``The issue on
the front burner is that we can't do all the things that are
expected of us on the revenue we have,'' he said. ``The issue of
where that money comes from is an issue for leadership to decide,
people like Chairman Junell.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions of money aside, the issue of acquiring additional
public land at all is also contentious. Conservation groups have
long urged the state to expand its holdings, but the Texas Farm
Bureau, which represents many farmers and ranchers, is opposed. Any
acquisitions should be offset by the sale of equal amounts of
public land to the private sector, said Gary Joiner, the bureau's
associate legislative director.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Wildlife Association, whose members are mainly
ranchers, supports a three-pronged approach to conservation that
includes government ownership, public-private partnerships and
private ownership, said David Langford, executive vice president.

COMMENTARY: `COLD-WAR MENTALITY' 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The best national missile defense requires a bold
rhetorical offense.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and a phalanx of famed Cold Warriors brought it
off this week. They denounced the arms-control doves seeking to
curry favor with Vladimir Putin at the forthcoming Moscow summit
meeting as _ hold your breath _ a pack of unreconstructed Cold War
relics.
</P>
<P>
   For years, those who dared propose a limited missile defense of
American cities against rogue nations or terrorists drew brickbats
from accommodationists. Withdrawal from the outdated ABM treaty
would upset the Russians, we were warned, and thereby stop Start
(the strategic arms treaties).
</P>
<P>
   With Bill Clinton's election, a compromise was struck: the
United States would spend tens of billions in research developing a
limited defense against a few missiles from Iraq or North Korea,
but one that would not pose a threat to the thousands of Russian
ICBM's.
</P>
<P>
   Even this half-loaf was to be half-baked. Because the president
was skeptical of our technology and unwilling to offend his left by
countering the mounting danger, the United States poked along with
no sense of urgency. Even if our limited system were to work,
Clinton never intended to risk Russian disapproval by deploying it.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with the CIA estimating nuclear blackmail from rogue
states as a distinct possibility, congressional and public opinion
is putting pressure on Clinton for action.
</P>
<P>
   His grudging response, outlined in this space last month, was to
seek a weak deal with Putin at the summit. Allow us to make minor
changes in the ABM treaty, enabling us to put up a puny defense,
was the Clinton idea; in return, we will reduce our missile force
in the Start III treaty all the way down to the level the Russian
military can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms saw this bad ABM deal in prospect and announced
that amendments tying the next president's hands would be ``dead on
arrival'' in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   That effectively exposed the Putin-Clinton dealing on ABM and
Start III as a meaningless charade. But it posed a political
appearance problem for the Bush campaign. How to oppose the summit
stunt without seeming to be obstructionist, triumphalist, nasty to
the Russians or, worst of all, subject to accusations of being an
unreconstructed Cold Warrior?
</P>
<P>
   Bush's answer: First, trot out the heavy hitters who helped win
the Cold War. He lined up Nixon-Ford's Henry Kissinger and Don
Rumsfeld, Reagan's George Shultz, his father's Colin Powell and
Brent Scowcroft. (No James Baker; forgot his phone number.) One by
one, these mainly hard-line heroes endorsed the candidate's call
for a limited anti-missile system. Kissinger, who wrote the ABM
treaty, asserted that it belonged to a long-gone bipolar world.
</P>
<P>
   But this performance by the Bush front-line brain trust was
played with a remarkable rhetorical twist. Instead of hunkering
down to await the usual ``unreconstructed Cold Warriors'' blast
from the White House, Bush charged the Clinton-Gore administration
with being ``locked in a Cold War mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   That stole the opposition's clothes. Calling for ``a new era of
nuclear security,'' Bush announced: ``The Cold War era is history.
Our nation must recognize new threats, not fixate on old ones.'' He
anticipated a knee-jerk Gore reaction with a built-in response:
``It is possible to build a missile defense and defuse
confrontation with Russia. America should do both.''
</P>
<P>
   He then showed arms-control sophisticates he had an
understanding of the potential Putin-Clinton summit dodge: ``Start
III should not be an excuse to limit our ability to build a missile
defense system.'' Rather than let a Russian deal on amending ABM
determine the number of missiles in our arsenal, the U.S. military
would determine how few are required for our security; Bush would
then ask Russia to match the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also made plain what Clintonites know but won't admit:
``This administration is not fully devoted to the development of an
antiballistic missile system that will work.''
</P>
<P>
   A serious issue is joined. Thanks to deft presentation, the
Clinton-Gore side is the one lost in the mists of the old ``Cold
War mentality.''

WITHDRAWAL CHANGES RULES OF ENGAGEMENT ALONG BORDER
</HEADLINE>
  (With ISRAEL-LEBANON) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG

<P>
   METULLA, Israel _ At 6:45 Wednesday morning, after the last
Israeli tank rumbled out of southern Lebanon ending a 22-year
occupation, Maj. Kobi Dostakam closed and locked the gate of the
border fence near this community at the northern tip of Israel.
``Now let's see what happens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Through the night columns of tanks, artillery pieces and armored
personnel carriers streamed out of Lebanon, and after they crossed
into Israel on Wednesday morning, many Israeli soldiers were
ambivalent about the departure.
</P>
<P>
   Some wondered whether it would finally restore calm to the
border area, and cautioned that a possible flare-up of cross-border
violence might turn back the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may not be our last time in Lebanon,'' said Shai
Ben-Yishai, a tank platoon commander. ``We may have to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Others nearly celebrated, hoisting Israeli flags, smiling and
waving as their armored vehicles lurched though the gate. ``It's
over!'' one soldier shouted as he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Shai Mor, who brought home a flag of Lebanon as a souvenir of
his nine months in the town of Merj 'Uyun, said he felt both
``tremendous happiness and pain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadness because we surrendered in a way, and happiness because
maybe soldiers will stop getting killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on his tank, Omri Israel said fighting Hezbollah
guerrillas had become an exercise in futility. ``You can't win a
guerrilla war,'' he said. ``I don't think we ran away. We left with
dignity. We withdrew in order to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah militants are now just across a double fence from
Metulla, a farming community and vacation spot that lies alongside
Kafr Kila, a southern Lebanese village that Hezbollah fighters
entered this week.
</P>
<P>
   At a border crossing abandoned by the Israelis, militants and
villagers looted stockrooms, drove off in army trucks and broke
into cars left behind by members of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army who had fled to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Other Hezbollah followers paraded in armored vehicles left by
the militia, and gathered at the fence facing Metulla to wave
flags, brandish weapons and chant slogans. Israeli soldiers, who in
southern Lebanon had shot Hezbollah fighters on sight, simply
looked on.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules of engagement were in effect spelled out by the
chief of the army's Northern Command, Maj. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, at
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw these people from four to five meters away,'' he said of
the men gathered across the fence. ``I looked at him, he looked at
me, I'm holding my weapon, and nothing happened. If he had fired,
he would have died. He didn't fire. And that's the reality we have
to adjust to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Haim Sela, a resident of Metalla, discounted suggestions
that Hezbollah guerrillas might shoot across the fence, asserting
that Syria, which is the dominant power in Lebanon, did not want to
provoke an Israeli response.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't fire a single bullet at civilian communities
because Assad doesn't want war with Israel,'' he said, referring to
President Hafez al-Assad. ``The war here is over.''
</P>
<P>
   But at Kibbutz Misgav Am, a border settlement on a ridge above
Metulla, Nurit Rapoport was not convinced. Gazing into southern
Lebanon, Rapoport said she suddenly felt more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've been stripped this morning,'' she said. ``I'm
for the withdrawal, but I feel exposed.''

RAVE NOTICES

Our rating: 3 stars 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Subtitled ``A Digital Odyssey Into the Electronic Dance
Underground,'' filmmaker Jon Reiss' entertaining new documentary
examines the electronic dance (or rave) community and the bizarre
yet fast-growing culture it has spawned.
</P>
<P>
   The well-paced film, which includes high-quality musical
segments by such popular techno acts as Moby, Crystal Method, DJ
Spooky and Meat Beat Manifesto, gathers interviews with ravers, DJs
and musicians who explain why they embrace a lifestyle that
includes sucking on pacifiers, dressing in bunny suits and
traveling to the middle of nowhere to leap around to throbbing
electronic beats.
</P>
<P>
   The lively, informative film makes a convincing argument that
technology is helping create a new global village. Certainly, the
rave phenomenon seems new, and the scene's multimedia presentations
include sights and sounds never experienced in, say, the rock era.
</P>
<P>
   One surprise is the amount of humor Reiss manages to dig up. An
interview with the members of Crystal Method, for instance, had
this reviewer grinning as the unexpectedly articulate musicians
discuss their personal bomb shelter and having to tell their
parents about their band name.
</P>
<P>
   Another memorable segment has British dance-music star Roni Size
discussing how the music transformed him from a teen troublemaker
to a productive and focused adult.
</P>
<P>
   Shot with a tiny digital camera and edited down to a nifty 85
minutes, Reiss gets to the heart of the intoxicating craze, which
has quietly crept into the mainstream by way of Moby, whose songs
are currently used on at least two major TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   If the documentary has drawbacks, it's the sometimes frenetic
and one-dimensional soundtrack as well as the silly computer
graphics used as brief interludes. Also, Reiss ignores such
less-savory aspects of rave culture as the scene's rampant use of
the designer drug Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, ``Better Living Through Circuitry''
explores with intensity one of the most significant youth cultures
to emerge in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   _____ &QL; 
The film: ``Better Living Through Circuitry'' (not rated). &QL; 
Stars: Includes performances by Moby, Crystal Method, DJ Spooky and
Meat Beat Manifest. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed by Jon Reiss. Produced by Brian McNelis
and Stuart Swezey. Released by Seventh Art Releasing. &QL;

SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE TAX SHELTERS LESS
LUCRATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corporate tax shelters, whose resurgence is costing the
government billions of dollars a year, would be much less lucrative
under revisions proposed Wednesday by the bipartisan staff of the
Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals would require companies and promoters to disclose
tax-avoidance transactions more fully, subject companies that
engage in shams to a 40 percent penalty on taxes they evaded and
penalize promoters up to half the fees they charged for creating
shams.
</P>
<P>
   The staff proposal is similar in many ways to regulations
proposed in February by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to
crack down on abusive tax practices of large companies. The
official estimate that abusive shelters cost the government $10
billion annually, Summers said, is ``just the tip of the iceberg.''
Some estimates, in fact, put it as high as $80 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest plan differs on key points. One difference
involves whether to define tax shelters by statute or to rely on
tests created under a series of rulings by Tax Court judges and
judges in other courts to determine whether a transaction was
motivated by a hope for profit or was primarily a tax-avoidance
technique.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., who is chairman of the Finance
Committee, wants written comments on the proposal by June 9, after
which he will decide whether to hold hearings, said Tara Bradshaw,
a committee spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   But a new law to curb corporate tax evasion is unlikely this
year because Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who heads the House Ways
and Means Committee, has said he sees no reason to pass such
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   And Archer has strong allies. Kenneth J. Kies of
PricewaterhouseCoopers, perhaps the nation's most widely consulted
expert on corporate tax-reduction techniques, says there is no need
for new legislation to curb tax shelters because there is no
significant problem with improper corporate tax avoidance.
</P>
<P>
   Kies, former chief of staff for the congressional Joint
Committee on Taxation, said that rather than being a massive
problem, abusive tax shelters are used by no more than 50
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Kies said he based this number on a report that Treasury
prepared under the Paperwork Reduction Act. That report estimated
that only four promoters were selling tax shelters under
confidentiality agreements and that 50 corporations and 50
promoters were involved in the kinds of abusive practices it seeks
to curb.
</P>
<P>
   Tax specialists on Capitol Hill and in the Clinton
administration said Wednesday that since Summers issued the
proposed regulations to curb corporate tax shelters, the use of
confidentiality contracts had dried up. Instead promoters are
relying on clients to keep quiet about their use of tax-shelter
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Both specialists said they were confident that far more than 50
companies use abusive shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Kies' view that corporate tax shelters are a minor problem was
also disputed Wednesday by leaders of organizations representing
tax lawyers and corporate tax executives, who say there is a
significant problem of abusive corporate tax practices. Both the
American Bar Association tax section and the Tax Executives
Institute favor requiring fuller disclosure of tax shelters to the
IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sax, chairman of the association's tax section, said,
``Many parts of this proposal are welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Sax said that among the provisions he likes is one requiring the
chief financial officer or other top executives to certify the
legitimacy of any transactions that create bigger tax benefits than
profits for a company.
</P>
<P>
   This proposal, similar to one made by Treasury, grew out of
complaints by some corporate tax executives that they opposed
illegitimate tax shelters, but were overruled by chief financial
officers eager to show profits.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Murphy, executive director of the Tax Executives
Institute, which represents corporate tax officials, said it
opposes this provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not denying there have been tax directors who say their
advice was ignored,'' Murphy said. ``But the clear consensus among
our leadership, and a sampling of our membership, is that requiring
the chief financial officer to attest to his knowledge of
transactions is a total waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy added that increased disclosure will be meaningless
unless it is accompanied by expanding the auditing staff of the IRS
so that the disclosures are fully investigated and improper
activities are identified and stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a right to expect that somebody will look at those
and act accordingly,'' Murphy said, adding that the institute also
favors increased staff to audit individual returns.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said he has doubts about the need for legislation, saying
the Treasury and IRS have sufficient authority through regulations
to deal with abusive transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee staff proposal deals only with
companies with revenues of $10 million or more. The draft
legislation would not affect wealthy individuals, although many of
the most abusive tax evasions uncovered by the IRS in recent years,
including one marketed by PricewaterhouseCoopers, could also be
used by very wealthy individuals.

ON DAY OF VOTE, LOBBYISTS LEAVE NOTHING TO CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-TRADE, CHINA-TRADE-ASSESS) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By Wednesday morning it was quite clear that the
China trade bill would pass, but no one on either side was taking
chances.
</P>
<P>
   From a stuffy conference room in the basement of the Capitol,
about 50 business lobbyists were dispatched, cell phones in hand,
in a final effort to nail down the votes of the dozen or so
lawmakers who were still thought to be undecided.
</P>
<P>
   A lobbyist for Procter &AMP; Gamble, for instance, was sent to see
Rep. Ernie Fletcher, R-Ky. The company makes Jif peanut butter in
Fletcher's district and employs 239 workers.
</P>
<P>
   An official from United Parcel Service went to see Rep. Robert
Scott, D-Va. UPS has a hub in Newport News in Scott's district.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Van Hilleary, R-Tenn., had his arm twisted by a lobbyist
from TRW, which has about 500 workers at an automotive plant in
Morristown in Hilleary's district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to get overconfident,'' said Johanna Schneider
of the Business Roundtable, an organization of giant corporations,
who was working from the room in the basement, Room HC-8.
</P>
<P>
   And despite vote counts that showed them losing, the opponents
of the measure were also out in force on Wednesday. Scores of union
members from back home were on the phone, and at least a dozen
labor officials from across the country were on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Art Pulaski, president of the California AFL-CIO, paid a final
call on Rep. Henry Waxman, a Democrat from Los Angeles, who had not
tipped his hand on how he would vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Fletcher, Hilleary and Waxman voted for the bill.
Scott voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   They, and the handful of other lawmakers who were truly
undecided as the vote approached, were besieged in the last few
days, and the pressure peaked on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a big wave hitting the shore,'' said Rep. Vito
Fossella, R-N.Y., who did not let on until just before the vote
that he planned to support the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He said he took a call on Wednesday morning from a driver for
UPS whom he had met at a Boy Scout function on Staten Island last
weekend. He was also called by members of the food workers union.
The driver favored the trade bill; the food workers were against
it.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since he entered Congress three years ago, he
said, he was lobbied by rank-and-file workers in financial services
companies _ at the banks and brokerage houses and insurance
companies _ who live on Staten Island, or in the slice of his
district that is in southwestern Brooklyn, and work in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally decided, I don't see how voting no is in America's
interest,'' Fossella said.
</P>
<P>
   For him and the others who were undecided _ most genuinely
trying to weigh the national security and economic implications of
the legislation as well as the direct interests of their
constituents _ all the attention was exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally let people know today I needed some space to
breathe,'' said Rep. John Sweeney, a freshman Republican from
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   He more or less decided overnight to vote for the measure,
Sweeney said, but at 3 on Wednesday afternoon, he still had qualms
and was following the debate on television in his office, ``just to
make absolutely sure I'm making the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of policy, Sweeney said, he concluded that ``we lose
a little more than we gain if the status quo remains.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the end,'' he said, ``you always vote your district.''
</P>
<P>
   And his district, which includes Saratoga Springs and Glens
Falls along the upper Hudson River, was divided.
</P>
<P>
   He heard, he said, from the dairy farmers and the apple and pear
growers and small-business owners who favored the concept of
expanded trade with China. And he heard from the paperworkers and
other union members who feared losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush called recently. So did Defense
Secretary William Cohen. The congressman was given a special
briefing by the CIA. Dennis Hughes, president of the AFL-CIO in New
York, visited him on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to absolutely everybody,'' Sweeney said. ``It was
a very hard call.'' He finally voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter Deutsch, a Democrat from southern Florida, dropped
out of sight on Wednesday while he pondered his decision. He took
no calls and held no meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made myself available to everybody for weeks,'' Deutsch
said. ``Today I needed to think on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   He especially thought, he said, about the huge Motorola plant in
his district with its 2,000 workers and its hopes of selling
two-way radios in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few values I would put above them,'' he said.
``But national security is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after lunch, about three hours before the vote, Deutsch
decided to vote against the bill.

UNEASE SETS IN ALONG BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QLAYA, Lebanon _ Amid the rubble and chaos on the morning after
Israel ended its 22-year occupation of southern Lebanon, villagers
celebrated their ``liberation'' Wednesday, but the towns set among
the rocky hills also seemed to teeter on the edge of lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, the scene seemed dangerously close to spiraling
out of control along sectarian lines, with triumphant Shiite Muslim
militias parading in newly confiscated tanks as Christians who had
been loyal to Israel looked on in fear of what the future could
hold.
</P>
<P>
   There were no Lebanese police or soldiers visible in the streets
to fill the vacuum left by Israel's stunning and rapid retreat. UN
peacekeeping forces were also noticeably absent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are very afraid,'' said Nimr Homsi, 24, of the
Christian town of Qlaya just north of the Israeli border. ``Look at
what they are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Homsi, who works as a UN interpreter, pointed to three men in
fatigues, one of whom held the yellow flag of the Hezbollah
guerrillas and another who was shooting open a padlock to a store.
``They are not liberating us, they are stealing, and looting, and
intimidating us. Where is the government? Where are the police?''
</P>
<P>
   But Hezbollah, the Islamic resistance movement that succeeded in
ousting the Israeli military machine, insists its forces will
respect the law. Hezbollah, which is also an emerging and powerful
political force, has much at stake in ensuring this. But it has
also been careful to point out that it cannot control people who
have nothing to do with its goals but wave its flag, and that its
role is not to police the pullout.
</P>
<P>
   Sheikh Nabil Kaouk, Hezbollah's military commander for the
south, was waving to supporters in the streets Wednesday. When
asked about the mounting concerns of lawlessness, he replied, ``We
will provide protection to the Christians from tomorrow morning;
you will not find one weapon in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   But that seemed hard to believe at the former south Lebanon
headquarters of Israel's military and its proxy militia. By early
Wednesday, it had turned into a weapons bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   Giddy packs of teenagers and men who identified themselves as
Hezbollah guerrillas openly looted old Russian tanks, high-powered
machine guns, a flatbed truck stocked with heavy caliber
ammunition, helmets, flak jackets and anything else they could
carry.
</P>
<P>
   The massive infusion of this military hardware and firepower
into the hands of the militias raised the fear that factions within
the militias, or perhaps a splinter group, could fire into Israeli
military positions and northern residential communities just a few
hundred yards across the border.
</P>
<P>
   This, analysts from all sides agreed, could ignite a regional
conflagration involving Israel, Lebanon, and Syria, which has
35,000 troops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   At the border near the Israeli town of Metulla, Lebanese
militias were face to face with Israeli soldiers and members of the
media trading taunts and insults through the barbed-wire and
chain-link fencing. UN officials reported that firebombs had been
thrown from the Lebanon side into the Israeli side, igniting
several South Lebanon Army-owned vehicles parked along the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, that fence was all that marked what has been the last
active Israeli-Arab warfront in a half century of conflict in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Wednesday vowed swift and
decisive retaliation if any force attacked Israel across its
border. ``We gave our word, and we have kept our word and brought
our boys home,'' Barak said, referring to a campaign promise he
made to withdraw from Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations will determine whether Israel has fully
withdrawn under the terms ordered by the 1978 UN Resolution 425.
Timur Goksel, political officer of the UN Interim Forces in
Lebanon, said UN peacekeepers would not actively deploy in south
Lebanon until the United Nations confirms that the withdrawal is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the heavily armed Muslim factions strutted through
largely empty streets of the enclaves loyal to Israel and its SLA
allies.
</P>
<P>
   In the Christian enclave of Qlaya, long openly loyal to the
Israeli presence in Lebanon, the few residents who did not flee
into Israel clustered in St. Georges Greek Orthodox Church and
looked out on the parading supporters of Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Majid Suliman, 44, a Maronite Catholic dressed in
uniform for his job as a member of the Lebanese police. He said
fewer than 16 police were assigned to all of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are entering homes, they are stealing property, and there
is nothing we can do,'' he said of the Muslim guerrillas. ``I don't
know why the government is not coming in here.''
</P>
<P>
   One resident challenged Suliman, saying that the policeman knew
why the government was not deploying. It was commonly heard
Wednesday that Syria, which effectively controls Lebanon, had
restricted the Lebanese army, seeking to create a chaotic
atmosphere to unsettle Israel and those who supported the
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Lebanese Christians were willing to allow their
names to be published in connection with this sentiment, saying
they feared for their lives. But several said that by keeping the
zone in a state of chaos, Syria can maintain some leverage on
Israel in its attempts to negotiate the return of the Golan
Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the nervousness among Christians in Qlaya Wednesday
was the Israeli bombing of a weapons depot just across the street
from the stone church before dawn. Afterward, the site burst with
explosions of grenades and missiles that had shattered windows in
homes nearby and blown out the church's stained glass. As of
midday, ordnance was still popping and exploding with loud thuds.
</P>
<P>
   Ghada Khouri, 24, a bandage covering a wound under her left eye
and blood still caked to her shirt, was furious that the Israelis
blew up the depot without warning nearby residents. On the floor of
her 1-year-old daughter's bedroom lay shattered glass, blown-out
doors, and missile fragments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel left us behind. We were used by them,'' said Khouri.
``We meant nothing to them, and now we have no future.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most searing images Wednesday was the scene at the
12th century Beaufort Castle. A military compound of steel and
concrete had been built into the stone Crusader castle on a
dominant hilltop in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   As Israeli soldiers retreated early Wednesday, they set off
massive explosions to destroy the castle. Wednesday, hundreds of
residents climbed the steep hillsides to sift through the rubble of
computers, of concrete slabs, of twisted steel beams, and of boxes
of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The remnants of the Israeli military complex, some of it still
smoldering, seemed to blend in with the remains of the stone castle
_ the ruins of two foreign invaders in Lebanon, the 12th-century
Christian Crusaders, and the 20th-century Israelis.

GEEK NOTES: PRICELINE WANTS YOUR BID FOR TELEPHONE CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Priceline.com, which earned its reputation with the
name-your-own-price model for airline tickets, will soon try to
interest you in bidding for a new commodity: cheap calls to your
mother (or anyone else).
</P>
<P>
   The company began its Priceline Long Distance Service Wednesday.
As with other Priceline services, like those for airline tickets
and groceries, consumers can go to the company's Web site
(www.priceline.com) to bid on blocks of long-distance time. Bids
are accepted or rejected within 60 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   After their bids are accepted, consumers use the Priceline
credit as they would use any prepaid phone card. The customer first
dials a toll-free number, then enters a password and begins using
the time, which has already been charged to the customer's credit
card. (Consumers don't have to change their primary long-distance
carriers.) Blocks of time are available for domestic calls, for
international calls to a single country and for a combination of
domestic and international calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to boil down all the complicated long-distance
pricing schemes to a simple equation: no hidden charges, no monthly
fees, no minimum call times,'' said Daniel Schulman, Priceline's
president and chief executive. ``We think the simplicity, combined
with great savings, will appeal to a broad range of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   One way the company is trying to keep the service inexpensive is
by routing calls over the networks of three Internet telephony
companies: Net2Phone, deltathree.com and zeroplus.com. Schulman
said Priceline had been testing the service for about a month with
10,000 consumers. The average block of time sought by each bid was
four hours, Schulman said, adding that the average saving was about
40 percent off the best available long-distance packages.
</P>
<P>
   James Vogtle, e-commerce research director at the Boston
Consulting Group, said the Priceline service could mean savings for
consumers, even beyond those offered by other carriers. ``The
long-distance market is a commodity market with lots of surplus
capacity, the kind of market where the Priceline model makes
sense,'' Vogtle said. ``Consumers just might get better prices than
they would be able to negotiate on their own.''

   MOTOROLA INTRODUCES A PAGER TO ATTRACT 18- TO 24-YEAR-OLDS
</P>
<P>
   Motorola announced this week that it would introduce a two-way
pager aimed at young adults. The pager, the Talkabout T900, is
called a personal interactive communicator by the company. It will
cost less than $200, with additional monthly service starting at
$14.95.
</P>
<P>
   The T900 is about the size of a standard pager and has a
keyboard for entering e-mail messages and a form of instant
messaging. Unlike what are usually called alphanumeric pagers,
these units allow the user to get information like news, sports,
weather reports, horoscopes and driving directions.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it believed that e-mail and instant messaging
would be the key attractions for adults 18 to 24 years old. ``It
will allow active adults a way to communicate instantly to help
organize their busy lives,'' said Amy Kabcenell, a marketing
director with Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   The two-way pager market had been limited because there was only
one nationwide service provider, Skytel. That has changed with
several vendors now offering wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   The pagers will go on sale in early June.

   LEGO WEBCAM TURNS TOY INTO A ROBOT THAT STANDS GUARD
</P>
<P>
   Lego's popular Mindstorm line of programmable toy robots proved
that it was fun to watch robots do your bidding. The latest
addition to the Mindstorm line may prove that it's just as much fun
to have a robot watch you.
</P>
<P>
   Vision Command is a $99 Web camera that, when mounted on the
core unit of Lego's Robotics Invention System, can turn the toy
into something resembling Robby the Robot from ``Forbidden
Planet.'' Using the camera as a pair of eyes, the Mindstorm robot
can detect color or movement and, depending on its programming, can
react with any number of responses.
</P>
<P>
   The camera is tethered to the PC through a 15-foot USB cable.
Programmers can break the camera's field of vision down into eight
separate regions and program a different response for each one. The
robot might chase a ball if it detected color in one region, snap a
still photograph if it detected motion in another or utter a threat
if it saw a little brother enter the room. (Threats can be easily
recorded with the built-in microphone.)
</P>
<P>
   Simply mounted on a computer, the Vision Command can also act as
a Webcam, with all the usual still and video Webcam capabilities.
Yes, it will still threaten that little brother.

   SHOOT-'EM-UP GAME FOR PALM-BASED UNITS
</P>
<P>
   Now, during those boring conference calls, you can use your Palm
organizer to do more than play Tetris. You can blast Wibble Bots.
</P>
<P>
   James McCombe, a programmer in Belfast, Northern Ireland, has
created Dreadling, a first-person shooter contest that shrinks the
action-game concept behind Id Software's Wolfenstein 3D and Doom
down to size.
</P>
<P>
   Dreadling has textured 3-D graphics, and the Palm's standard
five buttons are converted to the game's controls. The player can
collect fresh ammunition, new weapons and health credits while
facing monsters. The game will run on the Palm III and later
models, and on Visor and IBM WorkPad c3 organizers that run at
least version 3.0 of the Palm operating system. A sample version
can be downloaded free from www.dreadling.com, and the full version
of the game costs $19.98.
</P>
<P>
   Since the average PDA has only about two megabytes of RAM,
McCombe had to make the file as small as possible. ``The shareware
version of Dreadling requires only 80 kilobytes of memory and
requires an extra 50 kilobytes or so when running, since it
decompresses itself into available memory,'' he said in an e-mail
message. McCombe has created fairly speedy renderings of explosions
and monsters for the Palm's small screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Games of this nature normally require large amounts of
processing capability, memory and advanced graphics hardware,''
McCombe said. ``Your average computer screen has a game resolution
of 800 by 600 pixels at least, and the Palm Pilot has only 160 by
160.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Dreadling proves, that is just enough to shoot down a few
Grunt Bots before the next meeting.

 &HT;    Fraud charges jeopardize plans for elections in Venezuela, Peru
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Carter Center had expected to be monitoring two
elections in South America this Sunday _ one in Peru, the other in
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   But developments on Wednesday illustrated the shaky state of
democracy in the region and left the Carter Center unsure whether
either election would even be held, let alone deserve to be
monitored.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, Alejandro Toledo, who had been challenging President
Alberto Fujimori's bid for a third term, formally withdrew this
week from Sunday's runoff election, saying it was hopelessly rigged
against him. He said he would compete only if it were postponed and
if conditions improved.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center was unsure for a time this week whether that
meant an election would even be held or whether Fujimori would be
declared the winner with no votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Jennifer McCoy, director of the Latin American and
Caribbean program at the Carter Center, said the latest information
is that the runoff will be held _ with only one candidate
participating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we see some major changes, it is likely that we will
not send observers for the election this Sunday,'' McCoy said. A
formal statement withdrawing from the monitoring mission may come
as early as today, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The center monitors not only the accuracy of the election-day
vote count, but ``campaign conditions'' in the time preceding the
vote. In this campaign, McCoy said, ``access to the media has been
very inequitable. There has been harassment of the candidates.
There has been some intimidation of the press that led to some of
the press not accepting advertisements from opposition
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Peru's national election watchdog group, Transparencia,
announced this week that it would ``abstain from observing Sunday's
election.'' And the Organization of American States' monitoring
mission announced that it was suspending cooperation with election
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation remains in flux. Eduardo Stein, head of the
OAS delegation, said Tuesday that his mission had made headway in
negotiating a possible postponement of the vote with election
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, where president Hugo Chavez is being challenged by
Francisco Arias Cardenas _ who participated with Chavez in a failed
coup attempt in 1992 _ technical problems have marred preparations.
National Electoral Council President Estanislao Gonzalez said
earlier this week that the vote is ``in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   He blamed an Omaha, Neb., contractor, Election Systems &AMP;
Software, for delaying delivery of vote-tabulating software and
contended the firm is part of a ``destabilizing campaign . . .
directed so that the May 28 electoral process doesn't occur.''
</P>
<P>
   McCoy said Wednesday that the Carter Center is still uncertain
whether the balloting will take place this Sunday. She said
opposition officials are concerned because they will not be able to
monitor the performance of the machines, and they fear the software
could be manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that Venezuela has a history of fraud with
hand-counted ballots, so the transition to machine tabulation is
``a step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center is still prepared to monitor the election this
Sunday. If the vote is delayed, the center will try to organize
another observer mission for the new date, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Venezuelan campaign has been open and has afforded the
candidates good access to the press, McCoy said. On the other hand,
the campaign season was only 25 days long _ much shorter than
voters in the country are accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center's involvement in Venezuela runs deeper than
election monitoring alone. The center has had a continuous presence
in the country since last August to monitor the drafting and
approval of the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The new constitution _ adopted in December by a constituent
assembly dominated by the governing coalition _ provides for a
unicameral legislature, rather than one with two houses, prompting
some states to worry about unequal representation, McCoy said. And
it strengthens the power of the president while weakening that of
the congress, prompting fears that it represents a step back toward
Latin America's authoritarian past, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the document is strong in its support of
human rights and the social welfare of Venezuela's people, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   It has become commonplace for U.S. political figures to say that
democracy has now come to every country in the western hemisphere
except Cuba. But the events in Peru, election violence in Haiti,
and allegations of government manipulation of recent elections in
the Dominican Republic raise questions as to how firmly entrenched
democracy is.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy said the answer is mixed. There are strong democratic
institutions in countries such as Chile, Argentina and Brazil, she
said. Mexico, she said, has made ``a very impressive and gradual
transformation over the last decade'' away from one-party politics
to the competitive climate of the current campaign. And Central
America, wracked by civil wars in the 1980s, has also made
progress, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But problems persist in the Andean countries, McCoy said.
Colombia faces problems with guerrillas and illegal drugs. In Peru,
the president is running for a third term ``under questionable
constitutional authority,'' she said. Ecuador suffered a military
coup this year. And in Venezuela, ``the elected president is trying
to carry out a peaceful social revolution, but in a manner that
some of his critics fear is authoritarian,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In this area, she said, ``the institutionalism, or really the
entrenchment of democracy has not taken hold _ or is being
threatened at this moment.''

PROSECUTORS DROP CHARGES AGAINST LINDA TRIPP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A double-crossing tattletale to some and a
patriotic whistleblower to others, Linda R. Tripp on Wednesday won
a measure of vindication for revealing President Clinton's sex
scandal, as prosecutors dropped charges that she had illegally
wiretapped her friend Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, who cast herself as having thwarted what she described as
Clinton's ``blatant attempt to fix a court case,'' was spared a
criminal trial after a Maryland state judge limited Lewinsky's
testimony against her former confidante, gutting the prosecution's
case.
</P>
<P>
   The development signaled an end to the only major criminal
charges to arise from Clinton's impeachment. On Monday, an Arkansas
ethics panel recommended that he be disbarred for his role in the
drama.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp issued a statement that said, ``The full story has not
been told, but I continue to believe I did the right thing given
the extraordinary circumstances in which I found myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lucianne Goldberg, a New York book agent who prompted Tripp to
secretly tape her conversations with Lewinsky, said of Tripp: ``She
has been through such an extraordinary and unfair ordeal. This has
eaten up two years of her life, and her biggest crime was telling
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland prosecutors said Tripp's biggest crime was a felony _
wiretapping a conversation without the other party's consent _ a
state offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's tape of Lewinsky provided the independent counsel,
Kenneth W. Starr, with evidence that Clinton had engaged in an
affair in the White House with Lewinsky and had lied about it under
oath in a sexual-harassment suit brought by an Arkansas employee,
Paula Corbin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence provided the foundation for Clinton's 1999
impeachment trial, the first of a president in 131 years. The
Senate cleared him on all three counts.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, a Maryland state prosecutor, Stephen Montanarelli,
said the judge's decision to bar most of Lewinsky's testimony had
undermined his effort to prove that Tripp recorded a phone
conversation with Lewinsky without her consent in December 1997.
Tripp had learned earlier that it was illegal to make such
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no other witnesses to the conversation whom the
state can call to testify, and Tripp cannot be compelled to
testify,'' Montanarelli said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Diane O. Leasure, ruled this month that Lewinsky's
testimony was tainted because her recollection of the conversation
date had been influenced by Starr's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Montanarelli, arguing that Lewinsky did not need Starr's team to
refresh her memory, asked Leasure to reverse her ruling. On
Tuesday, the judge declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an extremely important . . . event in her life which
was, shortly after it occurred, published in detail in the national
news media,'' Montanarelli said of Lewinsky. ``We believe her, the
court does not, and that resolves the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution also was stymied by its need to present a case
against Tripp that did not involve evidence she provided to Starr.
He got that evidence in exchange for a federal grant of immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the federal grant of immunity, the state of Maryland
pursued its selective prosecution of me for more than two years,''
Tripp said in her statement. ``My family and I are gratified that
the federal immunity I was given provided the protection it
promised.''
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Joseph Murtha, spoke more harshly of her
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions by the state prosecutors to dismiss these charges
today do not dispel our concern that the decision to indict Linda
Tripp was politically motivated and that the case was prosecuted
solely because she blew the whistle on President Clinton's attempt
to fix a case,'' Murtha said.
</P>
<P>
   Pending is a Tripp civil suit alleging that the Clinton
administration used confidential records to smear her reputation in
retribution for her role in the Lewinsky matter.

 &HT;    Fraud charges jeopardize plans for elections in Venezuela, Peru
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Carter Center had expected to be monitoring two
elections in South America this Sunday _ one in Peru, the other in
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   But developments on Wednesday illustrated the shaky state of
democracy in the region and left the Carter Center unsure whether
either election would even be held, let alone deserve to be
monitored.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, Alejandro Toledo, who had been challenging President
Alberto Fujimori's bid for a third term, formally withdrew this
week from Sunday's runoff election, saying it was hopelessly rigged
against him. He said he would compete only if it were postponed and
if conditions improved.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center was unsure for a time this week whether that
meant an election would even be held or whether Fujimori would be
declared the winner with no votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Jennifer McCoy, director of the Latin American and
Caribbean program at the Carter Center, said the latest information
is that the runoff will be held _ with only one candidate
participating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we see some major changes, it is likely that we will
not send observers for the election this Sunday,'' McCoy said. A
formal statement withdrawing from the monitoring mission may come
as early as today, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The center monitors not only the accuracy of the election-day
vote count, but ``campaign conditions'' in the time preceding the
vote. In this campaign, McCoy said, ``access to the media has been
very inequitable. There has been harassment of the candidates.
There has been some intimidation of the press that led to some of
the press not accepting advertisements from opposition
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Peru's national election watchdog group, Transparencia,
announced this week that it would ``abstain from observing Sunday's
election.'' And the Organization of American States' monitoring
mission announced that it was suspending cooperation with election
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation remains in flux. Eduardo Stein, head of the
OAS delegation, said Tuesday that his mission had made headway in
negotiating a possible postponement of the vote with election
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, where president Hugo Chavez is being challenged by
Francisco Arias Cardenas _ who participated with Chavez in a failed
coup attempt in 1992 _ technical problems have marred preparations.
National Electoral Council President Estanislao Gonzalez said
earlier this week that the vote is ``in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   He blamed an Omaha, Neb., contractor, Election Systems &AMP;
Software, for delaying delivery of vote-tabulating software and
contended the firm is part of a ``destabilizing campaign . . .
directed so that the May 28 electoral process doesn't occur.''
</P>
<P>
   McCoy said Wednesday that the Carter Center is still uncertain
whether the balloting will take place this Sunday. She said
opposition officials are concerned because they will not be able to
monitor the performance of the machines, and they fear the software
could be manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that Venezuela has a history of fraud with
hand-counted ballots, so the transition to machine tabulation is
``a step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center is still prepared to monitor the election this
Sunday. If the vote is delayed, the center will try to organize
another observer mission for the new date, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Venezuelan campaign has been open and has afforded the
candidates good access to the press, McCoy said. On the other hand,
the campaign season was only 25 days long _ much shorter than
voters in the country are accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center's involvement in Venezuela runs deeper than
election monitoring alone. The center has had a continuous presence
in the country since last August to monitor the drafting and
approval of the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The new constitution _ adopted in December by a constituent
assembly dominated by the governing coalition _ provides for a
unicameral legislature, rather than one with two houses, prompting
some states to worry about unequal representation, McCoy said. And
it strengthens the power of the president while weakening that of
the congress, prompting fears that it represents a step back toward
Latin America's authoritarian past, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the document is strong in its support of
human rights and the social welfare of Venezuela's people, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   It has become commonplace for U.S. political figures to say that
democracy has now come to every country in the western hemisphere
except Cuba. But the events in Peru, election violence in Haiti,
and allegations of government manipulation of recent elections in
the Dominican Republic raise questions as to how firmly entrenched
democracy is.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy said the answer is mixed. There are strong democratic
institutions in countries such as Chile, Argentina and Brazil, she
said. Mexico, she said, has made ``a very impressive and gradual
transformation over the last decade'' away from one-party politics
to the competitive climate of the current campaign. And Central
America, wracked by civil wars in the 1980s, has also made
progress, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But problems persist in the Andean countries, McCoy said.
Colombia faces problems with guerrillas and illegal drugs. In Peru,
the president is running for a third term ``under questionable
constitutional authority,'' she said. Ecuador suffered a military
coup this year. And in Venezuela, ``the elected president is trying
to carry out a peaceful social revolution, but in a manner that
some of his critics fear is authoritarian,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In this area, she said, ``the institutionalism, or really the
entrenchment of democracy has not taken hold _ or is being
threatened at this moment.''

NERVOUS INVESTORS STAGE RALLY IN TECH STOCKS, BUT MARKET STAYS
UNSETTLED 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market ended a five-day slide Wednesday as
investors bought many of the technology stocks that had been
battered since the Federal Reserve raised its short-term interest
rate target half a percentage point last week.
</P>
<P>
   But the fear of higher interest rates, and the threat of how
much they could slow the economy in the months ahead, continued to
hurt companies that traditionally fare poorly when growth slows.
</P>
<P>
   So Intel, down 9.8 percent in the last week, rose 6.8 percent.
Microsoft, off 8.2 percent, jumped 3.8 percent, Cisco Systems,
lower by 16.5 percent in the last week, climbed 9.1 percent,
Veritas Software, off 10.3 percent, rose 12.4 percent, and Sun
Microsystems, down 17.8 percent, rallied, 6.3 percent. But Sears,
Roebuck dropped 3.5 percent; International Paper, 3.6 percent; Dow
Chemical 2.2 percent; and Union Carbide 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index rose 106.06 points, or 3.4 percent,
to 3,270.61, but after falling almost 6 percent Tuesday, the index
is still below the 3,321 level it plunged to in the week ending
April 14, when the index fell a record 25.3 percent. The Dow Jones
industrial average climbed 113.08 points, or 1.1 percent, to
10,535.35, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index finished
25.19 points, or 1.8 percent, higher at 1,399.05
</P>
<P>
   But there is so much uncertainty in the market right now that it
is impossible to tell whether one day's rally means anything more
than investors switched from one sector to another.
</P>
<P>
   The abandonment of technology stocks in mid-April helped lead to
a big rally in economically sensitive stocks as investors, instead
of fleeing the stock market, just moved their money to another
sector. But since the Fed's interest rate increase last Tuesday,
stocks in this sector have been tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market bulls believe you have 50 basis points or
less; the market bears believe you have 100 to 150 basis points
more to go,'' said Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, referring to how much higher the Fed
will push short-term interest rates. A basis point is one-hundredth
of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we get some data points to shore up confidence that the
economy is slowing down, sellers will win the day,'' he said. And,
he added, it will probably not be until June 13, when May retail
sales are reported, that there is a chance for a report that could
confirm that consumers are slowing down. March retail sales fell
0.2 percent, but no one puts much stock in one month's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty about the outlook for the stock market and the
economy is also increasing the daily volatility of trading. Barely
a day goes buy without big swings up and down, even if the market
ends up little changed on the day. Wednesday, for example, the
Nasdaq index was down almost 122 points, or 3.9 percent, before
rallying. From the low for the day to the close, the index rose 7.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, prices rose as the stock market fell earlier
in the day. But as the stock market climbed back into positive
territory, bonds gave up their gains as some investors switched
from bonds back to stocks.The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note
fell to 6.46 percent, from 6.42 percent on Tuesday. The price,
which moves in the opposite direction, fell 9/32, to 100 8/32. The
yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.19 percent from 6.16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One of the interesting stock rallies Wednesday was in Microsoft,
which rose 2 13/16, to 66, which means the company is worth just a
little more than a half of what it was at its high last December.
The rally came even as the federal judge trying the Microsoft
antitrust case seemed to suggest in a court hearing Wednesday that
the government's plan to break up the company did not go far
enough.

RANDADDY OF MUSIC FESTIVALS THRIVES IN BIG WAY 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Ohio, Pa., Ky.)  By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ It came as a surprise to many in 1995 that the
Cincinnati Symphony was turning 100. It is older than better-known
counterparts in Philadelphia and Cleveland. Yet the orchestra is by
no means the oldest musical institution in this city of Germanic
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   That distinction belongs to a choral event, the May Festival,
founded in 1873. The sprawling Music Hall, which opened in 1878 and
is now the home of the orchestra, was actually built for the
festival.
</P>
<P>
   So the May Festival may be more entitled than most to greet the
new millennium in a grandiose way, as James Conlon, its music
director for 21 years, decided to do this season.
</P>
<P>
   Two huge works anchor the affair _ Mahler's Eighth Symphony,
last Saturday, and Schoenberg's ``Gurrelieder,'' next Saturday _
and reinforcements, the Concert Chorus of the City of Dusseldorf,
have been brought in to add the needed heft.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the May Festival Chorus lacks substance. An amateur
group, it was founded in 1880, 700 strong, down 100 from the
combined choruses at the first festival. Having evolved with
changing times _ specifically, a decline in amateur music-making
and a concern to emulate performance practices of earlier eras _
the festival chorus now numbers 135.
</P>
<P>
   That is still large for, say, Mozart's C minor Mass (K. 427),
which was what remained of the opening concert on Friday evening
after a day of flight delays from New York. But it is good to see
so worthy a tradition survive on some level, the more so in that it
still represents a significant degree of community involvement in
what has become a year-round enterprise. And as trained by Robert
Porco, a noted choral specialist, the festival chorus acquitted
itself admirably, alternating lightness with strength where needed
and singing with generally sure intonation and good unanimity.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of that program, it was a shame to have missed
especially the chorales from Bach's Cantata No. 147, the source of
countless ``Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring'' arrangements. To give the
audience some idea of the changing, contracting times, Conlon
performed one in a big Romantic expansion and the other more in
line with current notions of proper Baroque style.
</P>
<P>
   Such minimalist concerns hardly affect the Mahler, the
``Symphony of a Thousand.'' The festival presented the fourth
performance of this work in the United States in 1931, with Eugene
Goossens conducting more than the specified number of performers,
including some 900 voices, and the Cincinnati Symphony, which
joined the festival in 1905. Here, with the Dusseldorf chorus, the
Cincinnati Boychoir and the requisite vocal soloists, the forces
numbered 482.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good size for Music Hall, and the finely restrained
quiet singing of the adult choirs, totaling 260, was as remarkable
as many a sonorous outburst. But the endings of the two movements
were spectacular in their force, as rousing as any this longtime
Mahlerian has heard.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharply contrasted preconcert recital on Saturday, Kristine
Jepson, a mezzo-soprano and the best of an uneven lot of vocal
soloists during the weekend, performed songs by Duparc and Gene
Sheer wonderfully, with Thomas Muraco as pianist.
</P>
<P>
   This despite the oversize setting of a hall with 3,400 seats,
most of which were full for the big concerts.
</P>
<P>
   The festival's first weekend ended with a concert on Sunday
evening at the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption in nearby
Covington, Ky. Further showing the range of community involvement,
the May Festival Youth Chorus opened the program handsomely with a
cappella numbers by Scarlatti, Monteverdi and Palestrina.
</P>
<P>
   Then the May Festival Chamber Choir, led by Porco, became the
main attraction. Justly popular works of Bach, the motet ``Jesu,
Meine Freude'' (``Jesus, My Joy'') and the Cantata No. 106,
``Gottes Zeit Ist die Allerbest Zeit'' (``God's Time Is the Best
Time of All''), were followed by a lovely rarity, Giacomo
Carissimi's oratorio ``Jephte,'' in fetching accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Now on to Orff's ``Carmina Burana,'' on Friday, and the big bang
of ``Gurrelieder.''

EMPLOYEES' SUPPORT FOR UNITED, US AIRWAYS MERGER UNCLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sidebar with AIR-MERGER) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When United Airlines and US Airways tried to merge in 1995,
objections from United's employees, who own 55 percent of the
company, scuttled the deal. A big question is whether employees
will block the current deal.
</P>
<P>
   James Goodwin, the chairman and chief executive of UAL Corp.,
which operates United Airlines, voiced optimism Wednesday about the
reaction of his airline's labor unions to the proposed acquisition
of the US Airways Group. He even ventured that the powerful pilot's
union, ``supports the deal strategically, but warned about other
issues,'' like combining the seniority lists for the two airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But Rick Dubinsky, the chairman of the master executive council
of the airline pilot's union at United, said the union had not
signed off on the latest merger attempt. ``I am deeply disappointed
that the company would enter into a transaction of this magnitude
without reaching full agreement with the United pilot group on all
issues,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the International Association of Machinists and
the Association of Flight Attendants, as well as the pilots' union
at US Airways, were more cautious in reacting to the deal. But an
airline union lawyer predicted that they too would have concerns
about the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe, if you go down the ranks of the airlines'
three unions, that this is going to be an easy merger,'' said the
lawyer, who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Dubinsky and John Peterpaul, a retired vice president of
transportation at the machinists' union, are both on United's
board. But spokesmen for the machinist's union and the United
pilots insisted that even if Dubinsky or Peterpaul knew about the
proposed merger before the United board approved it on Tuesday
evening, they did not tell their union colleagues about it, nor
would they have the authority to make commitments on behalf of
their unions without consultation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick, as a member of the board, has a fiduciary responsibility
to maintain confidentiality,'' said Kenneth Bradley, a United
captain and spokesman for the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots
Association, the national pilots' union.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Palmer, a spokesman for the machinist's union, said that,
``This kind of just got sprung on us.'' Palmer added that when it
comes to United's board, Peterpaul, ``doesn't consult with us on
how he votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubinsky and Peterpaul are crucial to the deal because the
approval of at least one of the two union representatives on
United's board is required for large corporate transactions, under
the terms of the company's employee stock ownership plan. But both
men are legally obliged to vote in the interests of all
shareholders, even if this may conflict with the interests of their
unions, although balancing these interests is a matter of judgment.
Neither man was available Wednesday for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The acceptance or rejection of the pact by United's 10,000
pilots will be critical, labor officials said. The United pilots
own 46 percent of the employee stock ownership plan set up in 1994.
Because the stock ownership plan, in turn, owns 55 percent of
United, this means that the pilots own a quarter of the company.
The machinists own 37 percent of the employee stock ownership plan,
salaried non-union employees own the remaining 17 percent. United's
flight attendants are not part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots are also in the middle of negotiations with United on
a new labor agreement, and have been divided on how aggressively to
bargain. Dubinsky, who led a strike against United in 1985, won
election to the local union chairmanship last year with a
reputation for toughness, returning after an absence to a job he
had held twice before.
</P>
<P>
   United and its pilots have agreed this year to begin meeting
with a federal mediator on June 5, after 17 months of bargaining
with little progress. When the most recent, six-year labor contract
lapsed on April 12, United's pilots dropped back to what they were
earning in 1993, before the contract was signed.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the contract lapsed, United pilots were earning
slightly less than US Airways pilots. The United pilots are
demanding raises that would make them the highest-paid pilots in
the industry. That raises the ticklish issue of whether to pay the
same to pilots from both airlines or try to introduce a two-tier
pay structure, which the national pilots' union has tried to limit.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of seniority lists with US Airways is another
concern of United pilots. Airlines use seniority to determine who
flies popular routes at convenient times and who is stuck flying to
undesirable locations on holidays. Seniority is also an important
factor in deciding which pilots are captains and which are first
officers. This makes an enormous difference in pilots' pay:
captains earn $160,000 to $230,000 at US Airways right now, while
first officers earn $100,000 to $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pilot seniority is really sacred, that dictates every aspect
of a pilot's career,'' said Bradley, who flies Boeing 757s and 767s
for United.
</P>
<P>
   Combining seniority lists is seldom a straightforward question
of just figuring out who was hired first by which airline. This is
particularly true for US Airways, which is the product of a series
of airline mergers that were followed by complicated combinations
of seniority lists. US Airways' purchase of the shuttle linking
Washington, New York and Boston several years ago provoked a bitter
dispute among pilots of the airline and the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute ended up going to an arbitrator, who ruled last year
that anyone who had been a captain at the shuttle would remain a
captain of the combined airline, even if this meant putting them in
seniority lists ahead of people who had spent more years as pilots
at US Airways.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of the shuttle service's pilots are survivors of the
bankruptcy of Eastern Airlines, and pose some of the thorniest
issues of all for the pilots of any airline merging with US
Airways. Many of these shuttle pilots joined Eastern in the 1960s.
They lost much of their seniority when Donald Trump bought the
Eastern shuttle in 1989. Trump later sold the shuttle to a holding
company, which sold it to US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   But the former Eastern pilots from the shuttle are unlikely to
be treated as having more seniority than pilots at United Airlines,
which hired many of its pilots in the 1970s and 1980s. When United
hired 700 Eastern pilots following Eastern's bankruptcy in 1989,
the United pilots insisted that the Eastern pilots lose all their
seniority and work their way up from the bottom of United's
seniority list as though they were rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters is the plan by United and US Airways to
spin off US Airways' nonshuttle flights out of Washington into a
new airline. This would require a separate seniority list and a
decision on which pilots would go to the smaller airline, which
might be less financially stable.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Freundlich, a spokesman for the US Airways pilots, said the
pilots' master executive council at US Airways was determined to
look out for the airline's pilots in any combination of seniority
lists. ``The attitude is one of caution, and the MEC will do
everything that is necessary to protect the interests of the US
Airways pilots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways' labor contract with its pilots still has another
three years to go before either side can reopen it. Neither the
United nor US Airways pilots could readily go on strike even if
they objected to the proposed merger. The airline industry is
covered by the Railway Labor Act, which requires extensive
mediation and a cooling-off period before transportation workers
are allowed to walk off the job.
</P>
<P>
   United pilots are likely to give extra scrutiny to the deal
because the US Airways chief executive is Stephen Wolf, who was
United's chief executive in the early 1990s and had a bitter
relationship with the pilots. But Wolf said Wednesday that he would
leave as soon as a merger was concluded. &QL;

CLOSE FEDERAL SCRUTINY OF DEAL IS EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   United Airline's acquisition of US Airways will face a tough
examination by the Justice Department over the ebbing of
competition the merger would bring about, antitrust experts say.
And the proposed merger has prompted speculation about a new round
of consolidation in the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   United is strong in Latin America and Asia, but is weaker across
the North Atlantic. The airline has one overseas flight from Boston
to London.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ray, managing director of John Hancock's bond and corporate
finance group and team leader of the transportation portfolio, said
it is possible that Boston would become an attractive gateway for
European expansion while benefiting from United's global network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for Boston there will be a net plus for the consumer
because of the immense United system that it will expose us to,
especially overseas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also concern that the merger could create such an
aviation giant that consumers would suffer. Massachusetts Attorney
General Thomas F. Reilly's office is working with other states to
review the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about the air fares consumers will pay,''
said Timothy Shea, chief of the public protection bureau. ``We are
working with other states, including Pennsylvania, to review the
transaction for its impact on consumers and airline competition.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in New York on Wednesday to announce
formally the nearly $12 billion deal _ United's UAL Corp. will pay
$4.3 billion in cash and assume $1.5 billion in debt and $5.8
billion in aircraft lease agreements _ UAL chairman and chief
executive James E. Goodwin and US Air Group chairman Stephen M.
Wolf vowed to complete the deal. They said regulators should
approve because it will benefit consumers, not hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will link United's extensive east-west system and US
Airways's comprehensive north-south system, and we believe it will
create the first truly efficient network that will stimulate jobs
and create a global airline better able to deliver benefits to
millions of passengers and hundreds of communities throughout the
US,'' Goodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said because there was little overlap on the two
airlines' route systems, antitrust issues should not be a concern.
But in order to alleviate those worries, US Airways would spin off
much of its Washington Reagan National Airport operations to board
member Robert Johnson, who would start a new airline, DC Air.
United, which has a hub at Washington's Dulles International
Airport, would keep the lucrative Boston-New York-Washington
shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, United vowed it would not raise ticket prices for
two years unless fuel prices or the consumer price index rose. It
also said it would not cut travel agent commissions for two years.
United has been an industry leader in cutting the commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the antitrust laws is to make consumers not
dependent on promises from parties who want to ensure approval from
the Justice Department,'' said Thane Scott, an antitrust attorney
at the Boston law firm of Palmer &AMP; Dodge. ``Their purpose is to
make sure competition makes those promises unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will get a very, very close look from Justice,
and unlike the telecommunications industry and the intricacies of
operating system software, airline tickets are understood by
consumers,'' Scott said. ``Most consumers would not see this as
likely to improve service, lower price or increase efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokeswoman said Wednesday that the merger
would receive very careful review.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican and
the chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and
Transportation, said: ``Consolidation in the airline industry is
always a cause for concern, although this initiative has exciting
possibilities, such as a new, potentially low-cost carrier
operating out of Reagan National. We plan to pay particular
attention to what this means to the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   And US Representative Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican and the
House Judiciary Committee chairman, said the proposal will be the
focus of a previously scheduled June 14 hearing on airline
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm deeply concerned that this merger may further lessen
competition in the airline industry,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hudson, executive director of the Aviation Consumer Action
Project, was even more blunt. He said: ``If this merger were
approved without major divestiture of routes and other
restrictions, the `Big Six' (United, American, Delta, Northwest,
Continental, and US Airways) will quickly become the `Big Three'
and US airline passengers will be the major losers.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were also dubious.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's Ray said: ``Size matters and one of the real issues
that will crop up is what kind of competition you have left in this
corridor.'' In order for the deal to win regulatory approval,
United would have to give up gates and landing slots at LaGuardia
and gates in Pittsburgh and Baltimore, he added.
</P>
<P>
   At Logan, United has eight gates in Terminal C and is spending
millions to expand to 10 gates. US Airways has 16 gates at Terminal
B and is in the second phase of an expansion there that will add
four more gates.
</P>
<P>
   United spokesman Kurt Ebenhoch said the airline will review
gates and terminal options at virtually all airports where both
carriers operate. ``Certainly, we want our customers to have as
seamless and hassle-free travel as we can provide and there will be
cost savings in facility consolidation, but whether that means
United will move into US Airways or vice versa will vary, but it is
too early to say what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kinton, director of aviation for the Massachusetts Port
Authority, which owns and operates Logan International Airport,
said the merger ``bodes well for increased service from Boston,
maybe some new international routes, and at the end of the day, you
end up with a stronger carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not have the concerns that Pittsburgh or Charlotte
might have,'' he said, referring to US Airways hubs. But United
said it would add domestic and international one-stop flights to
Pittsburgh, Charlotte and Philadelphia. The one area where United
had been considered weak was along the eastern seaboard. United
said it also would keep its flights from Washington National
Airport to US Airways hub cities.
</P>
<P>
   Kinton said he did not know how the Boston gates would be
consolidated, but said, ``It is high on my list of priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   If United, for example, were to move to Terminal B and take over
US Airways space there, it would free up gates at Terminal C.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are new entrants out there circling Logan and they are
interested,'' Kinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The low-cost start-up JetBlue, flying new Airbus aircraft out of
John F. Kennedy International Airport, has been considering
starting service to Boston, but officials at the airline said that
the gates currently available at Logan, in Terminal D, are
unattractive because the taxiing time is too long from runway to
gate and planes can get held up on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways and Delta Air Lines have been locked in fierce
competition along the East Coast. Wednesday a Delta spokesman said
the airline would have no comment on the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will monitor the situation carefully in terms of the
implications with respect to the industry and we will explore, as
we always do, the strategic options available for Delta,'' the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines, the second-largest airline in terms of
revenue, also was mum, posting this statement on its Web site:
``There are a number of parties with more than a passing interest
in this transaction, including labor unions and employees,
government regulators, elected officials and airline customers. We
recognize the public fascination in the airline business and in
this matter, and the news media should not be lacking commentators
on the proposed merger. For the time being, however, American
Airlines will decline comment.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to regulatory approval, the merger would have to
receive the approval of unions, and the inability to merge
seniority lists has led to other planned mergers dissolving.
</P>
<P>
   The United pilots' union _ currently engaged in contract
negotiations with the airline _ Wednesday issued a statement
expressing strong concern over the proposed merger, and the US
Airways pilots' union said it needed to study the details of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are cautious and need to determine what the career
expectation for our pilots would be under the agreement,'' said
Royt Freundlich, a spokesman for US Airways Master Executive
Council of the Air Line Pilots Association.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, reaction to the deal was muted, with UAL stock
falling 11.9 percent, or $7.1875, to close at $53.1875, and at
least one analyst downgraded the stock. But investors swarmed to US
Airways stock, seeking the $60 premium that UAL is offering. The
stock rocketed 86 percent, or $22.6875, to $49.00.

 &HT;    Giant pandas are big stars at home, too
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chairman Mao and the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
   Both are icons of China. And it should come as no surprise that
the tourists from the hinterlands flocking into Beijing these days
pay tribute to both.
</P>
<P>
   Two stops are musts for Chinese tourists visiting their capital,
said Liu Yingling, a representative of the All China Journalists
Association.
</P>
<P>
   One is Tiananmen Square, where the visitors may see Mao's tomb
and will certainly pause to have their pictures taken before his
portrait looming over the massive plaza. In the West, the image
that persists of Tiananmen is tanks rolling over a brief flowering
of democratic protest in 1989. But for most Chinese visitors,
Tiananmen, for better or worse, remains the symbolic heart of their
nation. And Mao, though long dead, still casts a giant shadow.
</P>
<P>
   The second mandatory stop is the panda compound at the Beijing
Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   No giant portrait looms here. But if one did, it should perhaps
show Wang Wanmin.
</P>
<P>
   Wang knows little of power politics. But 22 years ago his
government assigned him to feed the pandas at the zoo, and he has
taken to the task with total devotion.
</P>
<P>
   On a breezy, sunny day, Wang was waiting near the zoo's front
gate to meet a visitor. He began to talk immediately about how he
has petted and cuddled his charges as babies, fed them milk when
their mothers couldn't and nursed them to health when they were
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Caring for these creatures, who can grow to 350 pounds, is ``a
heavy responsibility,'' he said gravely.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may feel some attachment to their bald eagle. But the
Chinese are passionate about their pandas. And Wang is as
passionate as you are likely to meet.
</P>
<P>
   He was pleased _ but not at all surprised _ to hear that the two
pandas who arrived at Zoo Atlanta last November have become a huge
attraction, already seen by hundreds of thousands of zoo-goers.
</P>
<P>
   What's so special about these Chinese ambassadors? Wang thought
for a moment. They are rare and famous and ``their appearance is
special,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the zookeeper had difficulty articulating his thoughts,
he made the depth of his feeling clear as he ambled through the
complex talking through a translator about each of the pandas he
and 14 other workers monitor around the clock. Wang, who wore
rubber boots, speckled khakis and a windbreaker with a panda image,
said the zoo has more than 10 pandas but some were at a breeding
farm and others were on loan to selected zoos.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping frequently, he launched into lengthy accounts of the
life stories of the five on display, their frightening moments and
especially their occasional triumphs in producing offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Yuan Yuan, he said, still has to drink milk at 8 months old, but
most of the pandas in his care eat bamboo for much of their waking
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Ying Ying has had 11 babies _ Wang recited their years of birth
_ and he flinched as he explained how part of her ear was bitten
off by a male panda.
</P>
<P>
   Le Le has had seven babies, and, according to Wang, gave birth
to the only surviving panda born in captivity in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'90s he and other workers nursed Ji Ni back to health
over a two-year period after a thoughtless visitor tossed bread and
fruit into her pen _ still in a plastic bag. ``I get very sad when
my pandas get hurt,'' Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   The zookeeper _ who had worked with hippopotamuses and horses
before coming to the panda house _ was an animal lover from
childhood. ``When I was young, I had birds, dogs, cats and
rabbits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even on his days off, he comes to the zoo. ``I cannot feel
at ease if I cannot see the pandas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He frets about the fate of the thousand or so pandas still left
in China's wild. Strict efforts are underway to preserve their
remaining habitat, but Wang confided, ``We are not too
optimistic.'' Not only are the numbers dwindling but the size is
growing smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope may be teaching the roughly 200 pandas in
captivity to mate, and Wang, his brow furrowing, detailed the
efforts his zoo is making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you cannot understand why, but it's very hard,'' he
said. ``We might think that the male is really good looking, but
she won't like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he is very protective of the animals and keeps a wary eye
on anyone who throws stones when the pandas are outside or thumps
on the glass of their interior cages, he does not romanticize them.
</P>
<P>
   They can be fierce. ``They look very sweet, but they can lose
their temper,'' Wang said. And the people who feed them have been
hurt many times. Wang himself has merely been scratched. But he
warned that pandas' personalities are ``difficult to predict. . . .
They are more dangerous than tigers or lions.''
</P>
<P>
   As a panda waddled in his direction, Wang turned and shouted for
her to sit. He has taught others to circle before being fed, to
somersault and to wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panda is quite clever,'' he said. ``A grown-up panda is
just like a 3- to 4-year-old child.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, Kang Zitong, 3 1/2 years old and peering
through a fence nearby, was at just the right age to relate to the
lumbering creatures. She had come from Xi'an, home of China's
famous terra-cotta warriors, with her parents. And she appeared
delighted just to watch the bulky but nimble animals scratch
themselves and roll in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the pandas is a highlight for anyone who comes to the
Beijing Zoo, said her father, an electrical plant worker named Kang
Tao.
</P>
<P>
   Even far away in Washington, it seemed the powerful appeal of
the panda could be felt this week. Opponents of a bill to normalize
trade relations with China accused supporters of being ``panda
huggers.'' Meanwhile, officials at the National Zoo were putting
final touches on a trade deal of their own with China. The last of
the zoo's pandas died last year, leaving Atlanta and San Diego as
the only American facilities to showcase them. But, in an agreement
announced Sunday, Chinese pandas will soon return, pleasing
zoo-goers in America's capital as much as they do in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   As national symbols go, China could do worse.
</P>
<P>
   Pandas ``are a treasure of the state,'' mused Gu Yankui, a
retired teacher of Chinese literature strolling the zoo grounds
with his wife. ``Pandas are liked all over the world.''

FREQUENT FLIERS WILL BE BIG WINNERS IF UNITED, US AIRWAYS MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sidebar with AIR-MERGER) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL    
 c .2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the proposal by the UAL Corp. to buy US Airways clears
government and shareholder hurdles, members of the US Airways
frequent-flier program could find themselves in the unaccustomed
position of winners.
</P>
<P>
   Even though much of the fine print has not been made public,
Kurt Ebenhoch, a spokesman for United Airlines, which is owned by
UAL, said Wednesday, ``By the time this deal is consummated next
year, our two airlines will be one and US Airways frequent-flier
members will become United Mileage Plus members.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference,'' he said, ``is that US Airways members will
then have the opportunity to accrue miles faster, to redeem them
for more places and to earn flights with our 22 airline partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those partners are the 11 members of the Star Alliance,
comprising United as well as airlines from Austria, Australia,
Brazil, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Scandinavia, Singapore
and Thailand _ in short, much of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, US Airway's alliance with American Airlines, which
includes honoring each other's frequent-flier programs, remains in
force. ``Until the acquisition takes place,'' said David
Castelveter, a US Airways spokesman, ``it's business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Although United promises to freeze some domestic fares for two
years after the acquisition, except for increases to pay for fuel
costs and inflation, some industry experts think the deal will
ultimately lead to higher prices for passengers, especially in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the merger will be a good one,'' said Terry Trippler,
the airline writer for 1Travel.com. ``But if a lessening of
competition does not result in higher prices, it will be the first
time in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even outsiders agree that US Airways' frequent-flier
passengers stand to benefit by gaining access to more flights and
more destinations. ``Except for Southwest, US Airways is the only
one of the major airlines without flights to Hawaii, which is by
far the preferred destination of most frequent fliers,'' said Randy
Peterson, the editor and publisher of Inside Flier magazine. United
has daily flights to Hawaii from Chicago, San Francisco and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``While US Airways' frequent-flier program has always been a
competent follower,'' Peterson said, ``it has never been a leader.
Now it will be aligned with a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Trippler added that United's extensive routes to Asia and the
Pacific and South America will also be a big plus for US Airways
frequent-flier members, as will United's many more flights to
cities in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, United has far fewer flights to Florida than does US
Airways, so the acquisition is likely to give United's Mileage Plus
passengers a wider choice of flights and destinations to that
state. But Peterson and Trippler pointed out that frequent-flier
``reward'' flights to Hawaii are often very difficult to get and
Florida destinations are scarce much of the year.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways has hubs in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and
Charlotte, N.C., while United hubs are in Chicago, Denver, Los
Angeles and San Francisco and at Dulles International Airport in
Washington. United has already said that it will increase flights
from Pittsburgh and possibly Philadelphia and Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, passengers to and from Washington are likely to
benefit if DC Air _ the airline start-up that is expected to be
owned by BET Holdings II, the parent company of the Black
Entertainment Network _ becomes a low-fare carrier. BET's owner,
Robert Jackson, has been a member of the US Airways board since
1998. The airline, which will operate from Ronald Reagan National
Airport in Washington, will fill the void created by United's plan
to sell its slots and other operations there to satisfy regulators.

   ``I Gave Dating a Chance'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Jeramy Clark &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (WaterBrook Press, $9.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, Jeramy Clark isn't ``reeaally'' the Drill Sergeant of Love.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the not-quite-29-year-old author of ``I Gave Dating a
Chance'' says, ``I wholeheartedly believe Christians need to clean
up their dating act.'' He argues that Christians have no business
dating unbelievers _ not even casually. But despite what you hear
in some church circles, ``I don't believe you have to reject dating
to be godly in your relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   The drill from this Colorado youth minister: Get your spiritual
house in order before you start going out; push yourself to
maintain sexual purity and modesty (specific suggestions are
included); make yourself accountable to other believers for your
thoughts and behavior (a big one for Clark).
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clark's arguments _ particularly his stress on
``emotional boundaries'' in singles' relationships _ merit caution.
The book addresses everyone from young teens to young adults but
seems geared more for the older half of that range. ``I Gave Dating
a Chance'' may not be the final word, but it's a word worth
considering. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Amazing what a little editing can do.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, when last we heard from Detroit's Fred
Hammond, the burly, rich-voiced
singer/songwriter/multiinstrumentalist, he and his group were
releasing the two-CD ``(Pages of Life) Chapters I &AMP; II.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there were some commendable songs, the format made
``Pages'' feel bloated: The first CD was 16 originals cut in the
studio; the second was 13 live cuts, many of them songs that were
on the first CD. Only this time, the songs were stretched, made far
too long. It was overkill, plain and simple.
</P>
<P>
   I'm happy to report that ``Purpose by Design'' _ currently No. 3
on the national gospel charts after several weeks at No. 1 _ is a
shorter and more effective affair: 13 songs, recorded either in a
Detroit studio or live in Houston, and abrim with songs that
effortlessly build on Hammond's ability to fuse funk, gospel and
pop. Hammond can still be faulted for turning what would have been
a good 3 1/2-minute song into a not-so-good five-, six- or
seven-minute song, but he does that far less often here.
</P>
<P>
   Vigorously uptempo funk numbers such as the opening ``I Want My
Destiny'' are nicely balanced with ballads: The Stevie Wonderish
``Give Me a Clean Heart'' is a light confection built on electric
piano and acoustic guitar, and the live ballad ``Thank You Lord
(For Being There for Me)'' builds to a satisfying climax. A cover
of Sam Cooke's ``Jesus Be a Fence Around Me'' follows, and it's the
CD's high point: old-school gospel with a bright, modern sheen and
the momentum of a freight train.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond &AMP; Radical for Christ are supporting ``Purpose'' with a
summer tour. With him is John P. Kee, the North Carolina native who
went from a life of crime to being saved at a revival meeting to
forging one of the biggest careers in modern gospel with CDs such
as ``We Walk by Faith.'' &QL;

ANALYSIS: BUSH PATTERN ON THE ISSUES IS BROAD IDEAS WITH FEW
DETAILS
</HEADLINE>
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With his recent speeches on Social Security and
nuclear weapons defenses, Gov. George W. Bush has established a
pattern: He puts forward broad ideas with great appeal to the
Republican base and then leaves the details to be filled in later
should he be elected.
</P>
<P>
   In rapid succession, Bush pledged to introduce individual
investment accounts into Social Security but left out fundamental
details like what portion of the payroll tax he would devote to
them. And similarly this week, he opened the door to unilateral
nuclear weapons reductions coupled with a missile defense system
that would protect all 50 states and many of America's allies.
</P>
<P>
   But once again he included no specifics _ or any notion of what
it would cost.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides and supporters argue that on certain kinds of
issues this is the most effective way to lead, that locking into
particulars now ensures failure later. Yet it is also the case that
Bush's style has some other effects: it allows him to look like a
leader while making it much more difficult for his opponents to get
a handhold to grapple with him and his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is the master of picking apart the
details of a proposal. Just remember what he did to former Sen.
Bill Bradley's health care plan in the Democratic primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Social Security debate he has been left assailing
Bush's ``secret plan'' and trying to fill in the details for his
Republican opponent, as he did on Wednesday in an interview on
National Public Radio. Gore said that the transition to individual
accounts would inevitably also entail ``raising the retirement age
or cutting benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Still Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman, acknowledged that it
was harder to have a real debate on the issues, when Bush ``refuses
to say what he really intends to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The move toward individual investment retirement accounts and
the idea of a missile defense shield have long been dear to
Republicans and some of their constituencies. It was Ronald Reagan,
after all, who first called for a Strategic Defense Initiative in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   But these ideas have foundered in the past, not just because of
partisan strife, but because of details. Missile defense technology
is still largely unproven. The Pentagon suffered a serious setback
in January when a missile fired from the Marshall Islands failed to
hit a mock warhead fired from a California air base.
</P>
<P>
   And the costs are high.
</P>
<P>
   The limited missile defense system under development, which
envisions bases in Alaska with 100 interceptor missiles, has been
estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to cost $60 billion. A
broader system, which Bush is considering, might cost $116 billion
or more.
</P>
<P>
   On Social Security, while many congressional plans contain some
elements of individual accounts like those proposed by Bush, the
details have been problematic. Several plans contain painful
medicine like benefit cuts, lower cost-of-living increases or an
increase in the retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, conservative Republicans found that the only way to
create such accounts and still keep Social Security solvent was to
require people to hand their accounts back to the government when
they retired and then receive a fixed annual annuity.
</P>
<P>
   That is hardly what Bush has been describing when he says his
plan will allow Americans to build wealth that they can then pass
on to their children.
</P>
<P>
   Should voters know the full costs and benefits of Bush's ideas?
Anita Dunn, who was Bradley's communications director, argues that
they should _ even if such details could make the plans a fat
target in the way Bradley's health care proposal became.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that we failed to effectively defend a
well-thought-out, comprehensive plan, does not mean that's not the
right way to go,'' Dunn said. ``It just means you should
aggressively defend your plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides and some political scientists counter that there
are some issues on which too much detail is counterproductive to
governing.
</P>
<P>
   And they point to the fate of another doomed health care plan:
the one championed by Hillary Rodham Clinton. ``Anybody who
announces something initially and provides enormously great detail
runs a terrible risk of having it fall because of particular flaws
rather than the overall genius of the idea,'' said Ross Baker, a
professor of political science at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   By leaving out the details of his Social Security plan, Bush
aides say that the governor will allow Congress to help shape the
plan and have pride of authorship. They note that this is how the
governor operated in Texas, presenting basic concepts and allowing
the Legislature to shape the details.
</P>
<P>
   And on nuclear deterrence, they say, detail must be left to the
military.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong for a politician to arbitrarily set the
number of missiles needed to defend the nation,'' said Ari
Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush. ``That's exactly why you have a
Pentagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Bush eventually have to provide more detail on these issues
as November nears? Some supporters of Bush say no, that what voters
want now _ particularly independent voters _ is a sign that a
presidential candidate will put forward ideas that may break the
gridlock in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But others say he will be forced to fill in more particulars as
time goes on or pay a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial excitement in getting a new idea out is not a
measure of where the idea ends up,'' Dunn said, speaking from
Bradley's primary experience. ``It is early. He hasn't had to
debate Gore. And he hasn't been challenged.''

INJURY HAS ALTERED LINEBACKER'S OUTLOOK 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a conflicted corner of Ted Johnson's mind, he thought maybe
this injury thing would ruin his blossoming football career.
Johnson was on his way to a Pro Bowl. A ferocious middle linebacker
for the New England Patriots, he hadn't got there yet, but he'd be
there soon.
</P>
<P>
   But after tearing both biceps tendons, and enduring each arduous
rehabilitation, he began thinking of second careers.
</P>
<P>
   He helped his parents open an upscale restaurant next door to
the barbecue joint they already owned in a small Houston suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that would be it. Proprietor: Ted Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he'd be an in-studio TV football analyst after earning
rave reviews for the ESPN gigs he did while injured.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, that would it. Football analyst: Ted Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   What he was certain about in the less-confused segment of his
mind was that he never wanted ``quitter'' attached to his name. As
tough as it was to come back and as many post-football thoughts as
he had, being at peace with himself would have been difficult had
he not made it back to the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny. You start to explore those ideas in crazy ways,''
said Johnson during a break in his workouts at Foxboro Stadium
recently. ``Even though football is what I know, I had to take a
step back and be a realist for a minute. What if I can't make it
back? For me to stand and watch . . . it was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played this game all my life, but it was a mental strain.
It's like the movie `Groundhog Day.' I feel like Bill Murray
sometimes where I was getting up and doing the same thing and
seeing no progress and seeing the same thing over and over again.
With me, I need to get up and have a purpose every day. I wasn't
contributing. I wasn't helping out. It's difficult for a guy who's
always enjoyed what I do. To not be able to do it . . . it got
tiresome.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aching to play
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has a purpose now, learning Bill Belichick's 3-4 defense
while trying to forget Pete Carroll's defense. Johnson said the
left biceps tendon, the one he ripped Aug. 9 during an intrasquad
scrimmage is ``90 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the woods? Johnson knows that he'll never be that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no guarantees that it won't happen again,'' said
Johnson, who says he puts the possibility of reinjury out of his
mind when he's on the field. ``I've let it go, those thoughts of,
`What if it happens again?' Those things are out of my control. It
has made me aware of my body more. What I eat, how I sleep, and how
I work it. I take care of my body a lot more now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to back off the mentality of just lifting weights
all the time. I don't think I overtrained as some people claim, but
I don't think I was smart about it. I was taking my flexibility for
granted. I'm not a flexible guy and never have been, but it had
never been a problem. This injury shed some light on that. So now,
I stretch more, I do yoga, I see a massage therapist who works on
deep tissues. I'm always trying to get an edge medically with the
joints or whatever. I'm taking stuff geriatrics take for arthritis.
I'll do whatever I have to do to help prevent what I've been
through. But guarantees? Naw.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can prevent what happened in Pittsburgh Dec. 6, 1998,
when Jerome Bettis steamrolled through the middle of the field and
into the end zone, leaving Johnson's right arm gimpy and lifeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bettis had a full head of steam and Lawyer (Milloy) hit me
from behind as Bettis was running,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't play in another regular-season game for 365 days,
until Dec. 5, 1999, against Dallas. Because after the
rehabilitation came the biceps injury, suffered when he reached
back to bring down teammate Kevin Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin came up on me on another off-tackle play,'' he said. ``I
tend to dive for the ballcarrier if I'm out of position. You have
to make sure you're in better position. It was just me trying to
make a play, trying to trip a guy up. You just react. Your limbs
are everywhere. You just react. I don't have time to think, `I
should pull my arm back, because I don't want to get hurt.' You
don't have that kind of time.''
</P>
<P>
   That means when the situation arises, his instincts will take
over again. He will do what made him a terrific player: He will
reach out and try to make the play.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned last season for the last five games, his
friends, like former Patriot linebacker Todd Collins, were advising
against it. They thought he was jeopardizing his career.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson played with a brace that prevented him from reaching
back. It also prevented him from tackling well, though he amassed
59 tackles in five games and had two sacks in the season finale
against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   He's tossed the braces. He will play this season like Ted
Johnson. All or nothing. It was a sense of reckless abandon that
made him one of the best run-stoppers in the league. There will be
no compromising that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played at about 60-70 percent late last year,'' said
Johnson. ``It was good enough to play. I had a brace and I was
assured it would prevent it from happening again. I didn't want to
go out there and be half-speed either, but I got through the year
as tough as that was, with no highlight reels. I just got through
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was publicly nudged to come back quickly by Carroll. But
Johnson, after a long talk with Carroll, came to understand the
former coach wasn't trying to jeopardize his well-being, but just
trying to be optimistic for the media.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson remembers having arguments with trainer Ron O'Neil, who
was being cautious, over when he would get to play. Johnson said he
never felt pressure from the organization, but he did feel pressure
because of the five-year, $25 million contract and the $8 million
signing bonus he didn't feel he was earning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I said the money didn't affect me,'' said
Johnson biting his lower lip. ``You feel guilty. People try to
rationalize it by saying if I got hurt at my job I'd be paid
workman's comp, but it was practice . . . it wasn't even a game. I
felt a tremendous amount of guilt. I think its human nature to
bring those pressures on yourself and I did. Then someone said to
me that the reason I got the money is because of what I was doing
on the field. And that nobody expects more than what you're doing.
It put it into perspective for me. I should just be the same guy. I
don't think anyone questioned that.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 (Undated): ...questioned that.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A stickler for structure and routine, Johnson was thrown off. He
was irritable. He had difficulty feeling he was a part of the team,
despite Carroll telling him he was contributing by helping rookie
Andy Katzenmoyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just lost my focus,'' said Johnson. ``I'm a routine guy and
I wasn't held to that structure. I had an edge to me. I had a good
camp and then . . . I had some self-pity parties. I should have
been bigger than that and realized that things happen that are out
of your hands. I think I learned my lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of having surgeries. I've had four in the past two
years and that's enough. It's taken its toll. You can't do the
things you want to do. I took my health for granted, but now I
don't anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did he take the game for granted. When he wasn't on the
field, he was working on the intagibles. Coaches often say that
players learn from stepping off the field and watching. Johnson
thinks that happened. There were good things that came out of it,
but they never overshadowed the bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it did was reinforce how much I do enjoy this job and what
it provides for me,'' he said. ``To be honest with you, it's very
difficult to stay in the game when you're not in the game plan.
What I did do was get a great idea from an old coach of mine and
that was to go over all the film of my career, my second year and
up, watch every play. The good plays I marked and put them on a
highlight reel. I learned a lot doing that. I have glaring
weaknesses and glaring strengths. And I learned how to avoid the
things that get me in trouble on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   He shouted words of encouragement to Katzenmoyer and the other
linebackers, but he remembers feeling strange because ``when you're
on the sideline, everything is so obvious. It's easy to be critical
from the sideline,'' he said. ``But when you're out there, you have
all of those external forces going on. There are so many things
going on on the field that keeping your focus is so important. I'd
be yelling, do this and do that and why didn't you make that play?
I forgot, but I remembered it quickly when I got back out there,
how much more faster the game is and you have to make decisions
almost instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I benefited from was I studied the offenses more,
their tendencies in certain situations. When you're a young player,
you tend to just focus on what your assignment is. But as you grow,
there's more to understanding what's going on on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   But five years have already ticked off his career. He enters the
season with a huge salary cap number that will rise to more than $7
million in 2001. Those numbers are attached to impact players,
which Johnson was. Now he must prove he is that again.
</P>
<P>
   He looks at his career as fragmented. ````My rookie year is my
rookie year. In my second year, I was still so young and it was the
first year I was calling the defenses, so that was unsettling,'' he
said. ``In my third year, we switch coaches (from Bill Parcells to
Carroll). so I have to learn a new defense. I've never been to the
point where I feel completely comfortable with the defense and I'm
completly healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I want more field presence. The more comfortable I
am, the more field presence I'll have. When I came back last year,
it was like I was starting two-a-days again. I was still trying to
figure it out. The first game back was so crazy, I was just hoping
I was lined up right. We got through that game. I feel like I
should have a lot more to show for five years than I do now. That's
just my mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New and improved
</P>
<P>
   Almost healthy again, Johnson faces another coaching change.
When Belichick was the assistant head coach in charge of the
secondary under Parcells in 1996, Johnson said he spoke to him
``five or six times, tops.'' Two months into Belichick's reign,
Johnson said he's had two conversations with Belichick, all
coach-player matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been like the guy in the `Wizard of Oz' behind the
curtain. I haven't seen him. Honestly. The guy behind the curtain
struck fear in a lot of people,'' he said. ``Maybe he doesn't want
to make himself that accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson sees signs of a significant change for the better, where
the coaches coach and the players play. Little intermingling. Short
on small talk, but big on football.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this team, making a change was a good call. We're a very
young team,'' he said. ``We have Willie (McGinest), Drew (Bledsoe),
Chris (Slade), Larry (Whigham), guys who have six or seven years
logged in. But this team isn't full of 10-12 year vets. Discipline,
structure and accountability work for this team. I've seen it
before. That's what we're going to get.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different from Parcells. There's only one Parcells. You
can try to emulate him, maybe. Belichick has his own way of doing
it that can work. I'm not guaranteeing a divisional championship,
but I guarantee we'll be a more exciting team to watch. I hope our
record shows that. I think we'll be more disciplined. You'll see it
and feel it. I hope it is. If not this year than over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this league, if you don't have the three things I
mentioned, you're in trouble because the players will let you down.
The head coach sets the tone. He really does. He can take us in
what ever direction he wants to take us and we'll follow him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Belichick gets a certain amount of respect because
he was Parcells's right-hand man. He said he thinks some players
will test Belichick and ``they'll see what they can get away with
and how he responds.''
</P>
<P>
   What Johnson also likes is the shift to the 3-4 defense, which
he played at the University of Colorado and as a young Patriot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a welcome relief for me. It's one-on-one,'' he said. ``In
a 4-3, you're in gaps and slanting and it's more double-teams. This
is one-on-one. It's lets see whose stronger and tougher. It's the
game in the purest form. You bring back the old principles instead
of trying to trick them by pulling their nose tackle off and
sending him 15 yards down the field or bringing the safety in. You
just get to the point where you hurt yourself rather than help
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wait and see
</P>
<P>
   Johnson lived as a nomad in the offseason, bouncing from friend
to friend, spending a few days at his base in Houston before
skiing, scuba diving, water skiing, golfing, and sightseeing. A
trip to Australia was canceled when ``our head coach called a March
15 mandatory meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The offseason was spent getting his mind and body back to what
they used to be, trying to find the old Ted Johnson, but really
wanting to find the new and improved one.
</P>
<P>
   With a smile returning to his face and a new bounce to his step,
he seemed to find the one who was more understanding. The one who
didn't have to apologize for his injuries. The one who was more
focused and more determined. And that the TV and the restaurant
will have to wait.

KILLING RENEWS DEBATE ON PROTECTING WITNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two days after a 15-year-old Providence girl was
fatally shot before she could testify in a murder trial,
Massachusetts legislators quietly refused to create a statewide
witness-protection program.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Tuesday night by the state Senate to study, rather
than provide $100,000 to fund, the long-pending proposal drew
little notice in the crush of votes on the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the move, particularly in light of Jennifer
Rivera's death, revealed a longstanding failure by Massachusetts
and most other states to adequately protect crime victims and
bystanders who risk retribution by pointing a finger in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to ignore the impact of participating in criminal
cases and the dangers people face. We expect that people will see
this as a civic duty, but we don't help them fulfill it,'' said
Susan Herman, executive director of the National Center for Victims
of Crime in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As the search continued for Rivera's killer, a dispute raged
over whether police ignored her pleas for help, as her family
claims, or she rebuffed their repeated offers of protection, as
police maintain. As a result, even before police determine whether
Rivera was killed to keep her silent, her murder has put the
spotlight on local witness protection efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the vaunted federal Witness Protection Program that has
turned more than 7,000 ex-Mafia killers and other criminals into
protected courtroom songbirds with new identities, state and local
programs focus mainly on law-abiding citizens whose only connection
to crime is their proximity to its occurrence. Rarely do
non-criminal witnesses undergo identity changes.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen states have enacted programs to help such people,
authorities said, often after highly publicized cases involving the
deaths of witnesses. Most such programs aim to to relieve the
burden on local police and prosecutors _ and increase the
likelihood of protection _ by making funds available for temporary
or permanent relocation.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's program, for instance, was enacted last July, six
months after the murders of 8-year-old Leroy ``B.J.'' Brown Jr. and
his mother, Karen Clarke, of Bridgeport. They were allegedly killed
on orders from a man who feared their testimony in a murder case.
</P>
<P>
   Considered a national model, Connecticut's program requires the
chief state's attorney to provide protection for high-risk
witnesses and makes it easier to obtain restraining orders or
revoke bail if authorities perceive a risk to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, in light of the dispute in the Rivera case, the
Connecticut law also requires the state to decide within three days
whether to overturn a parent's decision to reject protection for a
minor. Upon enacting the law, Governor John G. Rowland said cost
would be no object in fulfilling the state's promise to ``do
whatever is necessary'' to protect witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   California, meanwhile, in 1998 authorized $3 million in the
first year of its program. At the same time, the state sought to
decrease financial liability that might accompany creation of such
a system. Fearful of lawsuits in cases where protection is declined
and someone gets hurt, the law provides immunity to public
officials for decisions about witness protection.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts remains among the majority of states that have yet
to enact a comprehensive witness protection program, relying
instead on individual district attorneys and local police officials
to assess dangers and pay for protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our worst nightmare in the area of law enforcement,
recognizing the vulnerability of witnesses in violent cases we're
prosecuting,'' said Plymouth District Attorney Michael J. Sullivan,
who has studied the issue for state prosecutors. ``You really have
to applaud the courage of the ordinary person to go forward and
offer testimony to see justice served.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, say bravery should be irrelevant, and
prosecutors should be given more resources to protect witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not be seen as a matter of special courage or
heroism that one is cooperating with police. Rather, it should be
seen as a routine public service for which one is not going to be
put in any jeopardy,'' said Eric E. Sterling, president of the
Criminal Justice Policy Foundation, a Washington think tank funded
by conservative groups.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to create a Massachusetts program was sidetracked
despite the recommendation of the Criminal Justice Committee. The
Senate moved instead to create a special commission to study the
idea, focusing on the potential cost and how the funds would be
administered.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of a study commission reflected a concern among
Massachusetts district attorneys, who worried that the funds would
come from their budgets and recoiled at the proposal's plan to have
the attorney general supervise their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsor, Senator Cynthia S. Creem, a Newton Democrat
who is chairwoman of the Criminal Justice Committee, said she
understood those concerns but was disappointed nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a no-brainer that this has to happen,'' said
Creem, who reduced her original $250,000 budget request to $100,000
in a fruitless attempt to win last-minute passage.
</P>
<P>
   While the Legislature studies the issue, time has run out for
Donna Bryant of Roxbury, whose family has been repeatedly
threatened since her 14-year-old son testified in an armed robbery
case. She said in an interview that she is moving her four children
out of state to avoid further incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's there to help,'' she said. ``Nobody's trying to make
sure your life isn't in danger. When I heard about that girl
(Rivera) this  &UR; morning  &LR; I was so upset. I thought that could be me
or my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk District Attorney Ralph C. Martin II defended his
office's response to Bryant's fears. He said the family declined a
transfer to a different Boston housing project.
</P>
<P>
   On the larger issue, Martin said prosecutors are stymied by some
witnesses' refusal to accept protection, as well as by the
difficulty of predicting witness attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great if someone could come up with a formula for
how to assess the appropriate level of risk, but hell, even the CIA
couldn't do it,'' Martin said. He noted that his own office never
imagined that gang member Jeffrey Bly would kill Assistant District
Attorney Paul McLaughlin in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said his office spends at least $50,000 a year on witness
protection, mostly to relocate witnesses until after they testify,
when the risk is perceived to have diminished.
</P>
<P>
   There are no state or national statistics, but a 1996 federal
study found that law officers in eight urban areas reported that
violent acts of witness intimidation occur on a daily or weekly
basis. The study by the National Institute of Justice, the research
arm of the Justice Department, found that 81 percent of prosecutors
in the nation's largest jurisdictions said witness intimidation
inhibited prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The study's author, Massachusetts criminologist Kerry Murphy
Healey, said the question of which witnesses receive protection has
been largely unexplored. She said a witness in a domestic violence
case is less likely to get help, in part because prosecutors are
more focused on winning higher profile cases such as homicides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decisions about who receives protection are based on the
severity of the crime witnessed, not on the severity of the danger
to which the person is likely to be subject,'' Healey said.
</P>
<P>
   To Herman, the executive director of the National Center for
Victims of Crime, the answer is improving state and local programs
so they provide more aggressive intervention and more services for
protected witnesses and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victims and witnesses should be able to make informed choices
about whether to participate, but they need help predicting,
understanding what the risks are, and they need to understand what
they can do and what the police and district attorneys are really
offering them,'' Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victims and witnesses are much more than pieces of evidence,''
she said. ``In some states, and in some cities, they are getting a
lot of help. In most they are not.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk of not improving protections will be an increasing
number of people who refuse to testify, Herman said. Donna Bryant,
for one, has reconsidered her son's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd want him to testify, but I probably wouldn't let him
now,'' she said. ``It's been too hard for me and my family.''

 &HT;    Ramsey-hired lie detector backs claims couple didn't kill child
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John and Patsy Ramsey unveiled the results of a
lie-detector test Wednesday that concluded they did not kill their
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The lie-detector test, administered by a firm hired by the
Ramseys, also determined the couple were telling the truth when
they disavowed any knowledge of the killer, and when Patsy Ramsey
denied writing the ransom note in the 1996 slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on extensive polygraph examinations, neither John nor
Patsy Ramsey were attempting deception when they gave the indicated
answers,'' said polygraph examiner Edward Gelb, a past president of
the American Polygraph Association who has conducted more than
30,000 polygraph tests.
</P>
<P>
   But in Boulder, Colo., Police Chief Mark Beckner all but
discounted the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we would be foolish to take it very seriously,'' said
Beckner, who has insisted that the FBI administer the test to the
Ramseys. ``How seriously can you take information presented by
their own expert.''
</P>
<P>
   During a press conference in Atlanta, Patsy Ramsey said she
hoped the police would heed the results and jump-start the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they would open their minds and their hearts and know
that we did not kill our daughter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But John Ramsey reiterated his bitterness toward the Boulder
police. The couple have not been charged but remain under
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not one ounce of trust in the Boulder police,'' said
John Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   During media appearances following the release of their recent
book, the Ramseys expressed a willingness to undergo a lie-detector
test. But they maintain the FBI's objectivity has been compromised
since the agency has assisted Boulder police during the probe.
</P>
<P>
   John Ramsey bristled when a reporter suggested that the FBI test
might be tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked me, `Did you kill your daughter?' What's next, a
bed of coals?''

COMMENTARY: HIGH STAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Voters may not pay much attention to potential Supreme Court
appointments, but interest groups sure do. And the National Rifle
Association, the right-wing religious organizations, anti-abortion
zealots and other extremist wanderers of the nation's far-right
terrain are praying that George W. Bush becomes president and gets
to appoint two or three more Clarence Thomases or Antonin Scalias
to the court.
</P>
<P>
   There are no more liberals on the Supreme Court, just moderates
and conservatives. And one important decision after another has
been determined by a slender 5-4 majority.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a 5-4 decision, the court struck down a provision
of the Violence Against Women Act that allowed victims of rape,
domestic violence and other crimes ``motivated by gender'' to sue
their attackers in federal court. The Times, in an editorial, said
the ruling ``left women more vulnerable to gender-motivated
violence.'' The headline on the editorial was ``Violence Against
the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters who care about civil rights and civil liberties, about
abortion rights or gun control or campaign finance reform, about
protecting the environment or protecting the cherished liberties
enshrined in the First Amendment _ such voters would do well to pay
close attention to the possible makeup of the Supreme Court in the
very near future.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the rights and liberties that Americans have come to
take for granted over the past few decades are now in the
cross-hairs and well within the firing range of the right-wing
extremists. The next president will likely appoint two or three new
justices to the court, and possibly four. (Three of the current
justices are 70 or older.) And Bush has made it clear that he
favors justices in the mold of Scalia and Thomas, the court's two
most right-wing members.
</P>
<P>
   The People for the American Way, a progressive policy group in
Washington, is out Wednesday with a new study, called ``Courting
Disaster,'' that takes a close look at the opinions of those two
justices. It's chilling.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that Scalia and Thomas are ``eager'' to
overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision legalizing abortion; that
their approach to the financing of election campaigns would make
campaign finance reform ``all but impossible''; that they took such
an extreme position on the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that four of
their fellow justices determined that 28 previous Supreme Court
rulings based on that law would have to be reconsidered if their
view prevailed; that they would prohibit the use of affirmative
action, ``even where it is shown to be carefully constructed to
remedy past discrimination''; that they ``would have made cigarette
companies virtually immune from most lawsuits by completely
forbidding any suits accusing the companies of intentional fraud
and deliberate concealment of cigarette dangers''; and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's decision on the Violence Against Women Act affirmed
a ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.,
one of the most right-wing courts in the nation. The 4th Circuit
opinion was written by Judge J. Michael Luttig, who is frequently
mentioned as a potential Bush appointee to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The report from the People for the American Way does not pretend
to be a nuanced analysis of the complex fight for control of the
Supreme Court. It is narrowly focused on the extremist positions
staked out by Scalia and Thomas, and the way life in the United
States would be altered if those positions were to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Neas, the group's president, said, ``Two or three new
justices in the mold of Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas would
lead to a reversal of decades of Supreme Court precedent in civil
rights, reproductive rights, privacy, separation of church and
state, worker and consumer rights, environmental protection and
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The right wing knows what's at stake. The report notes that Gary
Bauer, speaking to a Christian Coalition gathering last October,
``exhorted the crowd'' with the following comments about the court:
</P>
<P>
   ``Abortion ought to be over. Gay rights ought to be blocked.
School prayer ought to be back already.''
</P>
<P>
   Two more appointments would do it.

BOSTON DOCTOR EXPECTED TO HEAD WATCHDOG AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Boston anesthesiologist, Dr. Greg Koski of Massachusetts
General Hospital, is in line to head a new federal watchdog agency
to protect those who volunteer for medical research, capping a year
of mounting pressure on the government to improve policing human
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   But already there is skepticism about whether the new office
_elevated from the National Institutes of Health to the office of
Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala _ will really
be tougher on researchers and their institutions than the one it is
replacing.
</P>
<P>
   Koski, who is director of human research at Partners Healthcare,
is expected to be named shortly to the new Office of Human Research
Protection, which will have authority over all human trials funded
by the NIH and overseen by the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is heralding the new office, which
would be based in Washington, as a major strengthening of federal
oversight of human research, an assertion with which Koski agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major, major move,'' said the Harvard physician, who
oversees about 2,600 human studies at Mass. General, Brigham and
Women's Hospital, and affiliated institutions. ``It's an indication
of the importance that is attached to ensuring the protection of
everyone participating in a human study.''
</P>
<P>
   Koski acknowledged he is a top candidate for director of the
Office of Human Research Protection but declined to confirm the
appointment. A spokesman for Shalala referred inquiries to the NIH,
where a spokesman said, ``No appointment has been made yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously the federal government's main watchdog agency, the
Office for Protection from Research Risks, oversaw only research
funded by the NIH. A federal advisory panel last year recommended
that the job of protecting human research subjects be removed from
the funding agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``They considered that unseemly at best,'' Koski said.
</P>
<P>
   However, some government insiders, as well as nongovernment
specialists in research ethics, said the new office is
window-dressing to mask the Clinton administration's intent to back
off from strong sanctions of research institutions caught violating
human studies regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In some observers' views, the new office is intended to de-fang
the NIH Office for Protection from Research Risks, which alarmed
major academic research institutions by suspending all federal
funding for human research last year at Duke University, Virginia
Commonwealth University, West Los Angeles Veterans Administration
Medical Center, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The academic research establishment was caught entirely
unawares and really felt blindsided'' by those actions, said one
ethicist, who asked not to be identified. ``No one had ever
suggested that they could get in trouble for violating human
research regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of the NIH office, Gary B. Ellis, said he has been
``quashed'' because he and his staff have been ``too active in
protecting human subjects.'' Federal officials reportedly have
rebuffed Ellis's offer to join the new agency.
</P>
<P>
   Koski disagreed with those who say the Clinton administration
wants to relax enforcement of human protection guidelines. He cited
Shalala's proposal on Tuesday for legislation permitting officials
to fine institutions up to $1 million and individual researchers up
to $250,000 for violating human studies rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary made it very clear that her intention is to
strengthen the process for protection of human subjects and to
rebuild the confidence of the American people,'' Koski said.
</P>
<P>
   Even some who have been highly critical of the government's
laxness in policing human research praised the decision to elevate
this function to the secretary's office and give the new office
clear authority over human trials conducted by pharmaceutical
companies under the auspices of the FDA, as well as NIH-funded
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes absolute sense,'' said Arthur Caplan, director of
the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania.

MICROSOFT REMEDY RULING COULD COME AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust
case raised serious questions Wednesday about the government's plan
to break up the company, seeming to suggest that he did not think
the plan went far enough.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, praised a brief submitted by
a group of computer industry executives _ including many of
Microsoft's rivals _ that called for breaking the company into
three parts instead of two, as the government has proposed. He
called it ``an excellent brief.''
</P>
<P>
   And with an uncharacteristically determined manner, the judge
bluntly rejected Microsoft's request for months of additional
hearings on the remedy for its antitrust violations, telling
stunned Microsoft lawyers near the end of the day, ``I am not
contemplating any further process.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson asked the government to submit a revised version of its
remedy proposal by Friday, cleaned up and modified in small ways to
reflect questions he asked in court Wednesday. And he gave
Microsoft 48 hours after that to comment on the form, not the
substance, of the revised proposal.
</P>
<P>
   And then, two years and six days after the landmark antitrust
suit was filed, Jackson formally closed the proceedings, saying:
``The matter is submitted. Thank you, counsel.'' His remedy ruling
could conceivably come as soon as next week.
</P>
<P>
   On April 3, Jackson found Microsoft in wide violation of federal
and state antitrust laws. The next day, he told lawyers for both
sides that he wanted to conclude the proceedings quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But after the government put forward its breakup plan on April
28, Microsoft responded with a request for six months of
preparation followed by a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   The company was surprised and upset by the decision to close the
record Wednesday, and a few minutes after the hearing adjourned,
William H. Neukom, Microsoft's chief counsel, said: ``We had sought
to have our day in court on remedies, but the judge has decided not
to do that. So this case will now be decided at the court of
appeals, and we will be raising issues of procedure in our appeal,
as well as issues of fact and law.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as soon as the remedy hearing opened Wednesday morning,
the judge asked questions suggesting his state of mind _ though he
never explicitly said his ruling would call for a breakup of the
company or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   The government's plan would create one company for Microsoft's
operating systems and a second that would hold everything else,
including applications software, like the word processor Word and
the spreadsheet program Excel, and Microsoft's Internet properties.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Kevin O'Conner, a deputy attorney general from
Wisconsin who represents the 19 states that are partners in the
suit, began describing the plan's merits, the judge interrupted,
saying, ``The effect of a bisection will in effect be to create two
separate monopolies, with no incentive to interfere with each
other's profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that one friend-of-the-court brief he received in
recent weeks had made that point. He was apparently referring to a
plan proposed recently by several prominent academic economists to
break Microsoft into five companies, including three competing
operating-system companies.
</P>
<P>
   Later the judge asked David Boies, the Justice Department's lead
trial lawyer, about another friend-of-the-court brief, submitted by
the Computer and Communications Industry Association and the
Software and Information Industry Association. It proposed breaking
Microsoft into three companies, including one that sold only
Internet Explorer, the company's Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than reorganizing Microsoft into only a Windows company
and a single applications company,'' the brief said, ``the court
should supplement plaintiffs' proposed final judgment by separating
the Internet Explorer product and personnel into a third,
independent company.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies did not criticize the idea and said it might hold merit,
but added that the government was trying to reduce the complexity
of its proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said: ``You talk of the simplicity of implementation of
your proposals, but they are anything but simple. I don't think
they will be willing to cooperate.'' He then wondered aloud why the
government plan gives Microsoft the responsibility for determining
how the company should be divided.
</P>
<P>
   Boies responded, ``We give them the opportunity to do it first,
but if they come back with something that simply doesn't meet our
requirements, the government will have to do it.'' The judge
nodded. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Microsoft's turn came to promote its own proposed remedy,
the judge asked no questions. And to Microsoft's request for delay,
the judge told a company lawyer: ``I find it somewhat ironic that
your client believes its travails will end at the court of appeals,
and yet wants to spend more time in this court.''
</P>
<P>
   John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, insisted that he found the idea
``that we would have some final resolution Wednesday really
incredible.'' When another company lawyer made the same point, the
judge snapped, ``This case has been pending for two years.'' Later
Warden complained that the government's remedy proposal had been
pending for less than one month.
</P>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the government position say Microsoft
has known for more than a year that the government might seek to
break up the company _ since abortive settlement talks in March
1999. A specific breakup proposal was put on the table during
court-sponsored mediation talks early this year. Microsoft refused
to discuss the idea at either juncture.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Along with the breakup plan it submitted to the judge, the
government proposal includes several temporary rules altering
Microsoft's conduct while the breakup is being carried out. Warden
complained that one of them, requiring Microsoft to divulge
technical information on Windows to other software companies, was
``confiscatory.'' It would require Microsoft to turn trade secret
over to ``all of our fiercest competitors'' as well as ``pirates
and counterfeiters,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, responding to Microsoft's complaints, the
judge remarked: ``I ask you if forfeiture is not a traditional,
equitable remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   As their day in court seemed to be slipping away from them
Wednesday afternoon, Microsoft's lawyers hurriedly entered into the
record an ``offer of proof,'' which included summaries of testimony
that the company would have hoped to offer in further hearings on a
remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 16 academic experts, Microsoft executives and others
cited in the 35-page brief were Bill Gates, the company's chairman,
and Steven Ballmer, the president. Microsoft said both would have
come to testify.
</P>
<P>
   In Gates' printed declaration, he said the company was working
on ``a new vision of the future,'' specifically ``making the
Internet more useful by creating the first Internet-based platform
for software developers.'' But Gates added that the ``project will
be doomed to failure at the outset if Microsoft is split along the
arbitrary lines proposed by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said the declarations were not ready when it filed its
response to the government plan this month. It said it wanted to
enter them into the record now so the court of appeals would see
it.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Jackson's comments and actions Wednesday might bode,
investors did not seem disheartened. Microsoft's stock closed up
$2.3875, at $65.5625.

 &HT;    Flag flap can't be folded up, put away
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Governors don't usually go live on statewide
television to sign a bill, much less one that has left as many
sides unhappy as the Confederate flag compromise legislation that
Gov. Jim Hodges signed Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Most bill-signings are staged to call attention to an issue.
This one was handled in a special way in an earnest, at times even
plaintive, attempt to put this thorny issue to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we bring this debate to an honorable end,'' Hodges
said.
</P>
<P>
   Three times in the course of a five-minute address, the South
Carolina governor repeated the same point, as if to invest the
stroke of his pen with a power no politician attempting to work out
a compromise has managed to attain.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate prospects for Hodges achieving his wish don't look
great.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the legislation that will move the flag from the
state Capitol dome in Columbia to another location on the Capitol
grounds have initiated a ``No votes for turncoats'' campaign to
punish those who voted for the bill. NAACP officials, unsatisfied
with the alternate flag location, have vowed to continue the
economic boycott that forced the state legislature to take action
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   If there's any real hope this compromise will bring an end to
the debate, it rests on the exhaustion of most of those who place
themselves somewhere in the middle on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that it does (settle the issue). My hope is that
it does. Then they (the NAACP) can turn their attention to
Georgia,'' said Greenville Mayor Knox White.
</P>
<P>
   Greenville, the bustling and newly cosmopolitian Upcountry
business and manufacturing center, has played a key role in the
compromise. Hodges, a Democrat, credited Greenville Republican
David Wilkins, the House speaker, with a key role in working out
the compromise that finally passed both legislative chambers with
support from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   But another Greenville Republican, Sen. David Thomas, expressed
doubts the compromise will hold.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had a proposal, supported by the Greenville Chamber of
Commerce, that would have moved the flag to a location on the west
side of the Capitol, on the site of the old statehouse that was
burned by Sherman's army in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   While he feels the NAACP erred in not offering more positive
suggestions for a solution, Thomas said the organization's
opposition to the present compromise is consistent with the
position it has held all along.
</P>
<P>
   Although he identifies himself with the ``heritage'' movement to
protect the flag, Thomas said the compromise location, at the
Confederate memorial at the front of the Capitol, is arguably a
more prominent spot than the top of the dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to achieve some balance with this thing,
you've got to get it out of people's faces,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of people's faces, and back into the history books. That's
what a lot, probably most, South Carolinians would like to see
happen with this issue. Time will tell if they get their wish.

   IRVING _ The Western Conference Finals has reached a point at
which everything that doesn't ache throbs.

<P>
   Every Stars and Avalanche player has fatigued legs and bruised
bodies that can't seem to take another slash, check or double
shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``You reach a stage as a performer in these type of series where
the mind takes over the body. I think both teams are at that stage
now,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``That means that your body
can endure anything that your mind sets it out to do.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Stars have set out to do is eliminate the Colorado
Avalanche in Game 6, which begins at 7 tonight in Denver. Don't
give the Avs a sliver of hope. Don't let them think for a second
they can come back from a 3-2 series deficit and win. Don't let the
series go to a Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to a Game 7, and you don't know what can happen,''
Stars center Mike Modano said. ``You start to get bad bounces and
bad breaks that can happen. We've always been good at realizing
when you have them down, keep them down and not let anybody up and
give them a second day.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, whether the Avalanche is exactly ``down'' is up for
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Many, including the ESPN folks who did the broadcast Tuesday
night, say the Avs have outplayed the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. Do we have them down?'' Stars winger Scott
Thornton asked. ``I don't think these guys are down yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avs' players certainly don't talk as if they are. They talk
like a team that has outshot the Stars 110-56 in the past three
games, has a 7-1 mark at the Pepsi Center this playoffs and is
already packing for Game 7 on Saturday in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 7-1 at home. So if you look at the finish, it should be
a pretty win'' tonight, Avs forward Peter Forsberg said. ``We have
to play our best game of the whole playoffs here and get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avs simply point to the shot differential and sigh. They say
they easily could have won Games 4 and 5 and been packing for the
Stanley Cup Finals. The difference, they say, has been Stars goalie
Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock disagrees vehemently. He doesn't think Belfour's play
is the only reason the Stars aren't on the beach sipping margaritas
instead of one game away from the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that's not fair at all,'' Hitchcock said. ``Goaltending is
a big part of your game, and I've said this before: There are
certain times in the series where your goalie has to win games for
you. My experience has always been they come up later in series for
you. We expect if we're going to win in Colorado \Rtonight\S he has
to be one of the game stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we still have to score goals; you still have to play
strong defense at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but in Game 5, Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk was able to
score the winning goal in overtime because Belfour made the huge
saves minutes before.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour hasn't been as good as Colorado goalie Patrick Roy. He's
been better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he's played very well, and we know he's won some
games for them single-handedly,'' Avs winger Dave Andreychuk said.
``I think we still feel he's beatable.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Avs, they've put themselves in a situation
in which they have to beat him twice to avoid losing to the Stars
in the Western Conference Finals for a second consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars came back from a 3-2 deficit last season, winning
Games 6 and 7 to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals. It's a fact
that isn't lost on the Avs or the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our situation is, for myself, unfortunately,] to find out how
Dallas was feeling last year,'' Colorado coach Bob Hartley said.
``We're in the same situation as Dallas was last year, and it's up
to us to face the challenge. We can win two games in a row, but
right now our focus is on Game 6 as a game we have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will try to close out the Avs without the services of
winger Jamie Langenbrunner. He will miss at least Game 6 after
injuring his right knee in the first period of Game 5. Hitchcock
said Langenbrunner had an MRI exam yesterday, but the results
wouldn't be known until today or tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see whether we can get him healthy enough to play in
Game 7,'' Hitchcock said. ``There just isn't enough time to turn
him around and play in Game 6. ... The original diagnosis was some
type of sprain, and whether he's day-to-day or week-to-week, it's
really the first 48 hours that are going to determine it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said he'll either use Jon Sim on the second line with
Thornton and Joe Nieuwendyk or insert Blake Sloan into the lineup,
which would put Roman Lyashenko on the second line.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever plays, they're likely to hear Guy Carbonneau say a few
words before the game. See, Carbonneau has this saying that fits
perfectly for games like tonight's.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get paid any more for playing extra,'' he says, ``so
you might as well win it in 16.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, 16 victories are needed to win the Stanley Cup, 12 to get
to the big dance. The Stars have 11. They have two games to get No.
12.
</P>
<P>
   If it's all the same to the rest of us, they'd rather just do it
in one.

SPORTS COLUMN: MULLIN AWAITS CALL THAT MAY NOT COME 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ While Jalen Rose received his most improved
player award Wednesday, the proud veteran he replaced got his
shooting in. For all his years as a starter, an All-Star, Chris
Mullin was always last man out of the practice gym. Why change now,
just because he couldn't tell you when he might put it to use?
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what's going to come up,'' Mullin said, running
his hand through his haircut in the familiar flat-top.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird might call on him Thursday night in Game 2 of the
Eastern Conference finals against the Knicks. Probably not, though.
Rose was given Mullin's minutes this season and proved he deserved
them. Not surprisingly, Mullin accepted his demotion to 11th player
in the Pacers' 10-man rotation with dignity, with class, with his
most unattractive thoughts kept to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's different emotions,'' he said. ``One thing I've
learned, to not act on your initial ones. Let them play out.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Patrick Ewing hold his thoughts and tongue? John Stockton?
Karl Malone? There was a time not too long ago when Chris Mullin
was equal to them all, their original Dream Team peer. Even Bird by
then could at best only match Mullin shot for shot.
</P>
<P>
   After the Pacers were beaten by the Knicks in last spring's
conference finals, he knew it was just a matter of months before
the coach would be coming to see him. Mullin wished to make it easy
for Bird, his friend, by meeting him halfway. It was awkward, he
admitted, but then Mullin said: ``I came here basically because of
you. We've had two good years. It's his time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was time for the younger man, the prospective free agent, to
grow into his game.
</P>
<P>
   Time for Mullin to do what always came naturally, play for the
team, give up the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Surrendering the court _ that was something else entirely,
though he hadn't kidded himself. Even as a kid in Brooklyn, he knew
he couldn't play forever.
</P>
<P>
   At 37, Mullin was already feeling conflicted by the commitment,
the travel, the opportunities missed at home. Why, just Tuesday,
his oldest of three boys, 8-year-old Sean, demanded to know the
reason his father would be the only one missing at a school
presentation later that night. ``You know I have a game tonight,''
Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't even play,'' Sean said.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin didn't know what hurt more, the boy's disappointment or
the realization that his sons would never see him as he once was,
pumping in the southpaw jumpers, just as he watched Rose do in the
second half of Indiana's Game 1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kind of things, you can only look at them as helping you
in dealing with life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much pride he's swallowed, it isn't life and it
isn't death, and how insignificant even this conference final
rematch with the Knicks seemed when the telephone rang last
Saturday and someone from the Pacers' organization delivered the
news that Malik Sealy was dead.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mullin's job to telephone his brother Terrence, who had
played with Sealy for four years at St. John's. His 30-year-old kid
brother did not want to believe him. Car crash? Dead? How could
this be? Just the day before, a letter had come to him from
Minneapolis, a season-ending update from his good friend Malik.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Malik from working out over the summers at St.
John's,'' Mullin said. ``But Terrence loved him. I guess Malik had
a big family, lots of siblings and relatives around New York, and
Terrence used to say that seeing them reminded him of when it was
me playing for St. John's.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the mid-1980s, Terrence Mullin was the kid in the
green Celtics jacket whose favorite player was Bird. In many
respects, Chris Mullin was a smaller version, though his career was
never quite the storybook and was sometimes much worse. Chris
battled alcoholism early on. Still in his prime, he buried his
parents, Rod and Eileen, within a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Bird brought him to Indiana, and Mullin said he does not regret
a single moment. He smiles every day when he walks into Conseco
Fieldhouse, the New York gym rat in the ultimate Hoosier gym. He
wants to play again next season, somewhere. He can still shoot.
When Reggie Miller was ejected from Game 4 of the conference
semifinals in Philadelphia, Bird sent Mullin into a game that was
supposedly over. Mullin cranked up a couple of 3-pointers, a few
jumpers. The Pacers almost won.
</P>
<P>
   That is what keeps him working, shooting, outlasting all the
others on the Pacers' practice floor. There's another game Thursday
night, and even if the 8-year-old at home knows he probably won't
play, no one knows what the night will bring, what's going to come
up. It's a team game, basketball is. A game of roles. Chris
Mullin's role is to root, be ready, and keep his frustrations to
himself.

   BALTIMORE _ Jasmine's dream is to be ``a doctor or a
hairdresser.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben's is to be ``a motorcycle person.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman's is to ``be a chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   They hand-printed their wishes on paper leaves and hung them on
the dream tree at Port Discovery, which calls itself ``the
kid-powered museum'' in Baltimore's Inner Harbor district.
</P>
<P>
   Jasmine, Ben and Sherman are surfing a wave of interest in
informal family learning that has doubled the number of U.S.
children's museums in the last decade and nearly doubled the number
of people served by such museums within the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 32 million people _ nearly half of them adults _
visited children's museums or saw their traveling exhibits last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a growth of 98 percent over the last three years,''
said Janet Rice Elman of Washington, D.C., executive director of
the Association of Youth Museums. ``Children's museums are the
fastest-growing cultural institutions in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred members of her group, which includes just over
200 of the more than 250 children's museums in the United States,
plus a handful from other countries, convened here for three days
earlier this month to discuss trends and research and to trade
tips.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the association's museums have opened since 1990,
pointed out its new president, Lou Casagrande, who is also
president of the Children's Museum in Boston, which was founded in
1913.
</P>
<P>
   ``We represent the values of children, family and education that
this whole country shares,'' he said. ``I think within the next 10
years, we'll have 500 museums with 50 to 75 million visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The newest, opening in stages between April and July, is
Exploration Place, a $62 million complex of paid-admission and free
attractions for children and science lovers of all ages on a
20-acre tract along the Arkansas River in downtown Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can create 40-foot-tall wind patterns by navigating a
life-size airplane propeller, touch a 20-foot tall tornado of mist,
solve a food poisoning mystery, or climb inside a giant egg and
hear a fetal heart beat.
</P>
<P>
   Others can wear goggles that let them see how the world looks to
someone with age-related macular degeneration, explore a
three-level storybook castle, or play with award-winning toys,
which can also be purchased in the museum's gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has to worry about being bossed around or hurried,''
said Alan Edstrom, director of interdisciplinary programs and
exhibits. ``In our fossil dig area, if toddlers want to, they can
just sift through sand and rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Exploration Place attracted more than 30,000 visitors in the
month after its first facilities opened in April. Its predecessor,
the Children's Museum of Wichita, had 42,000 _ not in a month, but
in a year.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, Robert Buck of Orlando, who has been
designing huge and tiny children's exhibits for three decades, said
his favorite is a log.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children roll back the log and they see the bugs
underneath,'' Buck said. ``This is a learning experience for a city
kid who never saw that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new museums are small. The Chesapeake Children's
Museum, which opened in 1994, serves about 17,000 children and
parents a year in Annapolis, Md. It shuns glitz, obtains less than
one percent of its $50,000 annual budget through its gift shop, and
stresses baby and toddler programs, like ``Early Language Fun,''
``Mom's Morning Out'' and ``Toddl-Art.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We promote that you can do a lot of things with inexpensive or
free or cast-off materials,'' said the museum's executive director,
Deborah Woods. ``I want parents to go home and find the
toilet-paper tubes and know that here is valuable material that can
lead to a resourceful and creative mix of education and play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's intriguing is that the explosive growth in the number
of museums is all a result of grassroots efforts in local
communities as large as New York City or as small or smaller as
Monroe, La.,'' said Andy Ackerman, executive director of the
Children's Museum of Manhattan. ``Fortunately, or unfortunately,
there is no big federal program or national committee of businesses
pushing this.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional adds follow)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those who run children's museums say they offer a richer
experience than conventional schooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are so stressed right now to perform on tests that a
lot of creative teaching and hands-on teaching has been
neglected,'' said Mebane (cq) Boyd, executive director of the
Wilmington Children's Museum in North Carolina. ``I think
children's museums are providing a place for that kind of
experience that the schools want to fill but don't have time for
any more.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Ackerman's museum not only keys some exhibits
to New York City curriculum, it has joined three other museums in
operating a ``hands-on'' public school in which students in grades
six through 11 rotate between the museums in eight-week stints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things, technology and commercialization, that you might
think would move people away from what we do, are actually pushing
them toward us,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the more time people are in front of the computer
screen at work, the more they want real reality, hands-on
experiences, that get them and their families out of their
houses,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adults and children are so bombarded now by commercial
messages that to find an oasis where those messages are
non-existent or very subtle is like breathing fresh air,'' he said.
``We hear that all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Several museum officials stressed the value of children's
museums as a safe ``town plaza'' or ``community gathering place''
where parents and other caregivers go to show off their children
and watch or meet other adults with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I learned quickly when we first opened is
that over 50 percent of the people who walked through our doors
were adults, because children can't come by themselves,'' said
Paula Januzzi, founder of the new Busy Street children's museum in
Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing we found is that people don't necessarily feel
safe going out to the park or neighborhood any more to meet friends
and take their children to play with other children,'' she said.
``We are a safe haven.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   A lot of those parents are being misled, said Michael Spock of
the University of Chicago, whose pioneering work as director of the
Boston Children's Museum earned him laurels as the godfather of
modern ``hands-on'' museums decades ago. The son of the famed
pediatrician, he threw out the glass cases of exhibits and
introduced innovations like manholes that children could climb down
to see the cables and pipes that run under a street.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few neighborhoods where it really is unsafe, but I
think there have always been some relatively unsafe
neighborhoods,'' Spock said.
</P>
<P>
   He said peer pressure and the media influence some parents to
try too hard to guarantee that their children ``get the right kind
of start in life'' and scare others into worrying about ``if
something happened, how would they feel, and, secondarily, would
they be criticized by others about it or even brought into court
for not taking the proper care of their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In museums, neighborhoods and homes, he said, ``My argument is,
we need to give kids a longer leash.''
</P>
<P>
   That might not be easy, because today more government and
private givers demand that the museums measure the ``outcomes'' and
``impact'' of their institutions on the learning of children.
</P>
<P>
   But exact measures are difficult, according to two major
studies, one guided by researchers for Case Western Reserve
University and the other by researchers from Harvard University and
Philadelphia's Please Touch Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all trying to grapple with how you assess or evaluate
the museum experience when some of the most desirable results don't
appear until years afterwards,'' said consultant Barbara Beach of
Vienna, Va., who worked on the five-year study directed by Nina
Gibans at Case Western Reserve.

   Those who run children's museums say they offer a richer
experience than conventional schooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are so stressed right now to perform on tests that a
lot of creative teaching and hands-on teaching has been
neglected,'' said Mebane (cq) Boyd, executive director of the
Wilmington Children's Museum in North Carolina. ``I think
children's museums are providing a place for that kind of
experience that the schools want to fill but don't have time for
any more.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Ackerman's museum not only keys some exhibits
to New York City curriculum, it has joined three other museums in
operating a ``hands-on'' public school in which students in grades
six through 11 rotate between the museums in eight-week stints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things, technology and commercialization, that you might
think would move people away from what we do, are actually pushing
them toward us,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the more time people are in front of the computer
screen at work, the more they want real reality, hands-on
experiences, that get them and their families out of their
houses,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adults and children are so bombarded now by commercial
messages that to find an oasis where those messages are
non-existent or very subtle is like breathing fresh air,'' he said.
``We hear that all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Several museum officials stressed the value of children's
museums as a safe ``town plaza'' or ``community gathering place''
where parents and other caregivers go to show off their children
and watch or meet other adults with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I learned quickly when we first opened is
that over 50 percent of the people who walked through our doors
were adults, because children can't come by themselves,'' said
Paula Januzzi, founder of the new Busy Street children's museum in
Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing we found is that people don't necessarily feel
safe going out to the park or neighborhood any more to meet friends
and take their children to play with other children,'' she said.
``We are a safe haven.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   A lot of those parents are being misled, said Michael Spock of
the University of Chicago, whose pioneering work as director of the
Boston Children's Museum earned him laurels as the godfather of
modern ``hands-on'' museums decades ago. The son of the famed
pediatrician, he threw out the glass cases of exhibits and
introduced innovations like manholes that children could climb down
to see the cables and pipes that run under a street.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few neighborhoods where it really is unsafe, but I
think there have always been some relatively unsafe
neighborhoods,'' Spock said.
</P>
<P>
   He said peer pressure and the media influence some parents to
try too hard to guarantee that their children ``get the right kind
of start in life'' and scare others into worrying about ``if
something happened, how would they feel, and, secondarily, would
they be criticized by others about it or even brought into court
for not taking the proper care of their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In museums, neighborhoods and homes, he said, ``My argument is,
we need to give kids a longer leash.''
</P>
<P>
   That might not be easy, because today more government and
private givers demand that the museums measure the ``outcomes'' and
``impact'' of their institutions on the learning of children.
</P>
<P>
   But exact measures are difficult, according to two major
studies, one guided by researchers for Case Western Reserve
University and the other by researchers from Harvard University and
Philadelphia's Please Touch Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all trying to grapple with how you assess or evaluate
the museum experience when some of the most desirable results don't
appear until years afterwards,'' said consultant Barbara Beach of
Vienna, Va., who worked on the five-year study directed by Nina
Gibans at Case Western Reserve.

STARS' BRENDEN MORROW FRETS ABOUT ANKLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL and CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stars winger Brenden Morrow's return to the Western Conference
Finals has been much celebrated, considering that he has a hairline
fracture in his right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   But Morrow, who has played in the past two games after missing
Games 2 and 3, is still feeling the effects of his injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have confidence right now in my ankle,'' Morrow said.
``Just pushing off, the strength isn't there in turning and I am
not sure if it's going to hold.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has. But, after playing in his normal spot on the top
line with Mike Modano and Brett Hull in Game 4, he was moved down
to the fourth line for Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not really at 100 percent, and the role I am playing now
I feel a little more comfortable doing,'' Morrow said. ``There
isn't quite as much pressure when I am not with \RModano and
Hull\S. I am not afraid to hold on to the puck now. When I played
with them I wanted to give them the puck all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrow has taken and given his share of hard hits in his two
games back. But, he doesn't believe there is an invisible target on
his body because he's playing hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I am a target anymore than anyone else,'' he
said. ``I think \RModano\S is the target.'' \Nsubheds:Been there,
won Entering Game 6 tonight in Denver, the Stars have a distinct
advantage over most playoff teams who have played in the Pepsi
Center: They have won there.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche was 7-0 at home in the playoffs before the Stars'
4-1 Game 4 victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just getting that win gives us the confidence that we can do
it again,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``I think if we had
been 0-2 in that building with everyone else's \Rrecord\S in
Denver, it would have been a difficult mountain for us to climb. We
know how to play that building now, which is important because you
have to play it differently than ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, pucks fly much more quickly around the boards in
Denver than in Dallas. \Nsubheds:A little woozy The Stars left Game
5 with one injured player, winger Jamie Langenbrunner. There was,
however, another player who left the ice a little woozy. Forward
Grant Marshall took a hard hit near the end of the game from
Avalanche center Chris Drury and had to be helped off the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fine. He got whacked a good one,'' Ken Hitchcock said.
``He got the wind knocked out of him. .... I think Drury
cross-checked him.'' \Nsubheds:Face it The Stars lost 42 of 71
faceoffs in Game 5. Guy Carbonneau, who won 13 of 21 faceoffs in
Game 4, won only six of 23 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been good all playoffs _ this series anyway,'' said
Carbonneau, who has won 39 of 98 (39.8 percent) this series. ``It's
something I have to work on. I think I just have to be a little
more hungry and maybe cheat a little more than I used to. I've had
a tough time against \RJoe\S Sakic all year, so it's nothing new.''
\Nsubheds:Powered up The Stars are 3-for-22 (13.6 percent) on the
power play in the series after Brett Hull scored in the second
period of Game 5 while Serge Aubin was in the penalty box for
boarding. The Stars' first goal was scored by Jere Lehtinen just as
their power play expired and before Avs forward Adam Deadmarsh, who
was serving two minutes for high sticking, could get back into
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those power plays have been coming up big for us the last
couple of games,'' Stars center Mike Modano said. ``If you can get
one goal on that, that's a big plus. It tends to back them up a
little bit five-on-five if we're playing aggressive. We're able to
get some power plays from that, and we've been able to generate
some chances. It's forced them maybe to get a little frustrated.''

 &HT;    KIDS' MUSEUM STRUGGLES BACK AFTER HURRICANE
 &HT;    With KIDS-MUSEUMS for release Sunday, May 28
 &HT;    SPECIAL ATTN: North Carolina Papers
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (l) lifestyle and (a) national
categories

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Candy Madrid of Rocky Mount, N.C., blinked, wiping
happy tears from her eyes, as hundreds of colleagues from across
the country cheered her museum's struggle to return to life after a
devastating flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her museum was lost last September in Hurricane Floyd and two
staff members also lost their homes,'' Janet Rice Elman, executive
director of the Association of Youth Museums, said at the opening
of the group's national conference here. ``We're thrilled that they
are rebuilding.''
</P>
<P>
   Before it was inundated, the Rocky Mount Children's Museum had
hosted about 50,000 visitors a year and brought its exhibits to
another 35,000 to 40,000 children at scouting, day care,
after-school and community locations in 14 counties in eastern
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Madrid, the executive director, said her museum resumed its
outreach programs within a month, using traveling and temporary
exhibits loaned or donated by museums in her state's Grassroots
Science Museums Collaborative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received e-mails from people in museums as far away as
South America, Australia, England, wanting to help,'' she said.
``I've been telling my colleagues here to forgive me for not
getting back in touch with them, but we don't have a place to put
anything more at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum, which had 10,800 square feet of space, is joining
the city's arts center in temporarily sharing 8,000 square feet of
space in a former store in downtown Rocky Mount.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect it to open at some point between the Fourth of July
and Labor Day,'' said Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Madrid said plans for a fund-raising drive for a much larger,
permanent complex, to be shared with the city's arts center and
community theater, are well under way. The museum's Web site, with
details of what was lost and information on how to assist in the
rebuilding, is www.ci.rocky-mount.nc.us/museum/.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to have a grand re-opening within five years,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other museum directors, most of whom also scrape by with small
or non-existent endowments and minimal insurance, paged with
fascination through Madrid's scrapbook of photos documenting the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a rushing river inside our building, a river nine
and a half feet high,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a 600-gallon Saltwater Living Marsh touch pool that
literally floated up, ripped out the ceiling, broke into three
parts and slid into another gallery,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dome of our planetarium kind of floated and came loose,
and tilted, and it is the only part of the structure that could be
salvaged,'' she said. ``We lost the projection system, the
furniture, every record, every exhibit, every bit of paper, the
rainforest solarium, the...''
</P>
<P>
   She broke off and summed up: ``We lost it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Without records, she and the five other full-time staffers _ the
part-timers had to be laid off _ spent days in rubber gloves,
pawing through the slimy rubble to create a precise inventory of
the losses in order to apply for insurance proceeds and federal
aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a horrible thought: You know, a fire is so much kinder
than flooding, because you don't have to see stuff again,'' Madrid
said.
</P>
<P>
   Only two collections _ some model trains and wooden model wagons
_ were salvageable. Conservators in Virginia expect to finish the
meticulous work of restoring them by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Madrid said her hardest moment came when some Girl Scouts who
had held a camp-in at the museum asked her about the 18 abandoned
pets, ranging from ferrets to iguanas, that the museum had rescued
through the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used our animals to talk about the responsibility of pet
ownership, you know, that you just don't buy this cute, cuddly
little thing, without realizing that it will grow up and you will
still be responsible,'' she said. But Madrid had to tell the
scouts, ``Sweeties, so many of our babies didn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   All but three of the 18 live animals were lost. A veterinary
student is caring temporarily for the three survivors: Lizzy, a
Burmese python who is about 15 years old, as well as Samantha, an
American alligator, and Snarf, a red tail boa constrictor, who are
each more than twice that age.

IRL-CART FEUD LARGELY MUFFLED AT INDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ If you're bound and determined to collect some
juicy quotes on the ongoing IRL-CART feud at the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway this week, you always can hang out at the Gasoline Alley
garage of Texan A.J. Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   The first four-time winner of the Indianapolis 500, Foyt has
emerged as ``de facto'' guardian angel of the history and
traditions of the Speedway, and chief advocate of Tony George's
all-oval Indy Racing League. As such, A.J. habitually rips into his
former running buddies from the Championship Auto Racing Teams at
the slightest provocation.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. makes for hot copy from here to Houston that way. But the
truth is, the underlying mood here in the wake of the return of
Target/Chip Ganassi Racing, the undisputed and reigning four-time
CART champions, has been decidedly apolitical. Yes, there were some
relieved faces and snickering on Saturday, when reigning IRL
champion Greg Ray of Plano knocked reigning CART champion Juan
Montoya of Colombia off the provisional pole with a dramatic
four-lap qualifying run.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, it could be argued, had saved face for the IRL on its most
hallowed ground by out-qualifying Montoya, the Indy 500 rookie with
the cocky sneer and the concrete right foot. But neither Ray nor
car owner John Menard walked into their post-qualifying news
conference with an Indy Racing Northern Light Series banner draped
across their shoulders. And you can't even find the
purple-and-orange CART FedEx Series logo on the press kits
circulating here for Montoya and teammate Jimmy Vasser, the 1996
series champion.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of bickering over the direction of domestic
open-wheel racing _ including the false hopes of reconciliation
first raised here last May _ the principal players have accepted
the fact that the series have gone their separate ways. Enough fans
and corporate sponsors have been alienated, enough trash talked.
When they throw the green flag to start the 84th Indy 500 on
Sunday, what we'll get is a little glimpse of the open-wheel racing
we've all been missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep bringing up this CART-IRL issue. And to me, that's
not a big issue,'' Ray said after securing his first Indy 500 pole.
``As a driver or an athlete in any sport, you always want to
measure yourself against the best, whether it's CART drivers or IRL
drivers. I respect all of the drivers, not just Juan Montoya and
Jimmy Vasser.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have said the last couple of years they thought that
being on pole or winning the Indy 500, it wasn't quite the same.
Well, they weren't driving it, so I'm here to tell you there's some
very good drivers and teams here. This race is just a measuring
stick.''
</P>
<P>
   IRL officials originally hoped several of CART's top guns _
including Team Rahal and defending race champion Kenny Brack _
would have crossed over. For budgetary and/or engine-related
reasons, only Chip Ganassi and Derrick Walker are here. And they
aren't here to hand out warm-and-fuzzy photos of CART president and
CEO Andrew Craig on the corner of 16th Street and Georgetown Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to show what CART drivers can do,'' said
Montoya, who _ as a gesture of respect _ was allowed by IRL
officials to waive the series' Rookie Orientation Program here.
``We're coming with my team to do our best.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Montoya admitted that he did not know how he, as CART
champion, would be received at the Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single fan has been really good, and the drivers and
teams also,'' Montoya said. ``It's a fun racetrack, a huge
racetrack. But what makes Indy special is not only the track, it's
the people that come and enjoy everything. The people _ how do you
call them? _ the Alley Cats. It's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasser, who competed in the Indy 500 from 1992-95, already knew
that Indy means a great deal to a driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anybody racing in the CART FedEx
Championship that doesn't want to be racing here,'' said Vasser,
who led 20 laps of the 1995 Indy 500. ``I know a lot of drivers
that are in the CART series are envious of Juan and I, and would
like to be in our position. Hopefully in the future you'll see more
CART teams take Chip's lead.''
</P>
<P>
   And leave the juicy quotes to A.J.
\Npcredit:Triumph Books The autobiography of Johnny Rutherford is
305 pages, and he's concerned who among his many friends didn't
make the final cut.
\Nsubheds:SPOTLIGHT ON... \Nt36:Rutherford recalls a life in the
fast lane The four-color jacket has been slipped over his
autobiography, and Fort Worth's Johnny Rutherford says he can't
wait to read how the story of ``Lone Star J.R.'' has turned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to trim this thing down, and I don't know how much
got left on the cutting room floor,'' said Rutherford, thumbing
through the hard-cover, 305-page chronicle published by Triumph
Books of Chicago. ``I've had so many friends over the years, and
I'm sure somebody's going to say I left them out. So I'm anxious to
read through it _ and see who they did leave out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford, a three-time winner of the Indianapolis 500 and one
of racing's most respected ambassadors, began collaborating with
author David Craft a year ago at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
In addition to jogging each other's memories, Rutherford said he
and his wife, Betty, called in some favors while compiling the
extensive statistical records covering the various types of race
cars he has driven over three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Betty worked very, very hard on this book, editing and trying
to put things together,'' Rutherford said. ``Her name ought to be
here \Ron the cover\S.''
</P>
<P>
   J.R. recounts the races, cars and peers of his career in an
anecdotal style. Although the interview process got tedious at
times, Rutherford said he found the experience of chronicling his
life exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's been enlightening,'' said Rutherford, who won the
third and last of his Indy 500s exactly 20 years ago today.
``There's a tendency to say, `That's behind me, that's history.'
But you remember you had a good time. If I were to check out
tomorrow or this afternoon, you know, I got no qualms or kicks. I
had a good run. But this highlights everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's national launch is scheduled for today, appropriately
enough Carburetion Day in Indianapolis. Rutherford, 62, is special
projects coordinator for the Indy Racing League, and his signing
tour largely will coincide with the Indy Racing Northern Light
Series schedule. The series will visit Texas Motor Speedway for the
Casino Magic 500 on June 10. Rutherford is scheduled to appear at
the Barnes &AMP; Noble store on University Drive from 7 to 9 p.m. on
June 6, and at Border Books on South Hulen from 11:30 a.m. to 1
p.m. on June 10.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to an autographed copy of the book ($24.95), each
buyer will receive an artwork poster created by Rutherford that
highlights the various stages of his racing career.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the movie rights?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I would be very surprised if anybody wants to make a movie
out of ``that'','' Rutherford said. ``But Kevin Costner _ we do
have the same, thin face ...''
\Nsubheds:PIT STOPS Hollansworth hunts ride Dallasite John
Hollansworth Jr., released by Rockwall-based TeamExtreme earlier
this year, never turned a lap at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway
this month. But Hollansworth knocked on a lot of garage doors in
Gasoline Alley in hopes of putting together a deal that will get
him up and running in the Casino Magic 500 at Texas Motor Speedway
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Hollansworth had talked to Nienhouse Motorsports about possibly
qualifying a 2000 Dallara/Aurora last weekend at IMS, where he
finished 13th as a rookie in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty confident we'll have a package starting from Texas
on,'' said Hollansworth, who is working to secure Lycos as his
primary sponsor. The only rookie to start all 10 IRL events last
year and the fastest rookie qualifier in the 1999 Indy 500,
Hollansworth was dumped by TeamExtreme after starting 14th and
finishing 21st in the season-opening Delphi Indy 200 at Orlando,
Fla. Ownership believed that Hollansworth and chief mechanic John
King were not clicking, and opted to hire series veteran Davey
Hamilton as stablemate to rookie Airton Dare. Both qualified for
Sunday's 84th Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   Hollansworth, an attorney, said he was one race into a new
three-year contract when he was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's likely going to be some legal ramifications from that,
so it's not something I should get into,'' he said. ``But we didn't
work all the years to get here to get bounced around by management
of a team, and give up. Hopefully we'll be back there for the
remainder of the season.'' \Nsubheds:Unser backs Fisher, LSJ
Two-time Indianapolis 500 champion Al Unser Jr. will not have a
problem racing against rookie Sarah Fisher and veteran Lyn St.
James on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and St. James are the first two women to qualify for the
same Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think racing is a science and can be taught,'' said Unser,
who is competing at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway for the first
time since failing to qualify for the 1995 race. ``Doesn't matter
about size, color or sex. It's a science and can be taught. I think
it's wonderful there's two girls in the field. I got a little
redhead at home who's 11 \RShannon Lee\S, and you betcha we're
going to get her involved in racing. I think it teaches
sportsmanship and competition, and I think it's wonderful.''
\Nsubheds:The last practice Today is Carburetion Day at the
Speedway, and the two-hour practice will be the last time the cars
will be on the track until Sunday morning. The worst-case scenario
for any driver is that he or she would crash a qualified car,
necessitating use of a backup and a move to the rear of the 33-car
field.
</P>
<P>
   But John Menard, owner of the cars driven by pole-sitter Greg
Ray of Plano and No. 4 starter Robby Gordon, has envisioned an even
bigger ``worst-case.'' Ray will be lined up directly in front of
Gordon when the green flag falls for the traditional flying start.
</P>
<P>
   ``My nightmare,'' Menard said, ``is that Robby and Greg will
crash into each at the start.'' \Nsubheds:The last word ``''No man
is an island, but the Speedway is. It pulls you in, and then it
won't let go.''''

THE GRILL OF YOUR DREAMS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   With today's penchant for outdoor living, creating a luxurious
contemporary patio and back yard and investing in a fabulous custom
built-in barbecue _ an extension of the great room _ is one of the
hottest trends.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to have a lavish setting or a fancy grill to
enjoy wonderful succulent foods cooked outdoors. A simple charcoal
or gas grill _ or even a hibachi _ will do.
</P>
<P>
   Grilling is still the all-American pastime. Seventy-five percent
of U.S. households own and use a barbecue grill _ and more than 60
percent of gas grill owners cook out several times a week
year-round, according to the Barbecue Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grilling is so easy and tasty, it's no wonder it is one of
America's favorite outdoor pastimes,'' says Kristi Fuller, editor
of ``Better Homes and Gardens The New Grilling Book'' (Meredith
Books; $29.95). The down-to-earth volume covers all the basics _
including information on regional preferences, starting a fire,
heat control, timing tips, food safety, grilling gadgets and how to
select a grill. You'll also find a grilling glossary along with
grilling charts and tips sprinkled throughout the 372 pages, which
feature more than 500 recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Taste was the primary focus, although simplicity and ease of
preparation _ along with straightforward ingredients readily
available in supermarkets _ were also considerations in recipes,
Fuller says. All include prep and cooking times, as well as
nutritional information.
</P>
<P>
   Recipes run the gamut from condiments, appetizers, sides and
desserts to beef, veal, lamb, pork, chicken, turkey, fish,
shellfish, game and fowl. A separate chapter covers smoke cooking
with recipes like Pecan-Smoked Pork Chops, Texas Beer-Smoked Ribs
and Double-Smoked Salmon With Horseradish Cream.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to smoke cooking, Fuller favors an electric smoker
because it's the most reliable. However, she suggests getting
acquainted with the smoking process on a simple scale by using a
charcoal or gas grill before investing in other equipment such as a
vertical water smoker or a horizontal dry smoker.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking on gas or charcoal grills is done by one of two cooking
methods _ direct or indirect heat. Direct grilling _ where foods
are placed directly over the heat source (and should be turned
halfway through the cooking time) _ is similar to broiling and
best-suited to foods that are tender, small or thin and cook
quickly in less than 25 minutes. That includes burgers, steaks,
kabobs, chops, hot dogs, boneless poultry, fish and most
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Direct grilling can be done with the lid up or down, but when
the cover is closed, the grill begins to simulate an oven. You can
cook larger items such as roasts or bone-in poultry more slowly
this way and impart a smoky flavor.
</P>
<P>
   When food is cooked by indirect heat, it is placed adjacent to,
rather than directly over the coals _ and the cover is down. This
method is used for large cuts of meat, ribs, whole fish and birds,
and other foods that require longer, slower cooking.
</P>
<P>
   When starting a charcoal grill, figure on mounding and igniting
about 30 briquettes per pound of meat to be cooked with the lid up.
Since it'll take about 20 to 30 minutes for the coals to turn ash
gray, start the grill 30 minutes before you're planning to grill
the food. Begin preheating a gas grill 10 to 15 minutes prior to
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   A key to successful grilling is determining the point when the
charcoal or gas will have attained the ideal temperature for
cooking the food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too-high heat can char and dry out the food, while too-low can
defeat the quick-cooking benefit of grilling,'' says Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   You can judge the approximate temperature of the coals by how
long you can hold your hand above the coals at the cooking level
(of the food). If you can hold your hand comfortably over the coals
for only two seconds, figure that the fire is hot and the
temperature will be around 400 to 450 degrees F. Coals should
appear barely covered with gray ash and be burning when done. A
medium fire equates to a four-second hand count, a temperature
reading of 350 to 375 degrees, and coals should be glowing through
a layer of gray ash.
</P>
<P>
   A low fire is the equivalent of a five- to six-second hand
count, a temperature of about 300 to 350 degrees, and the coals are
covered with a thick layer of gray ash.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling and keeping the grill at the proper temperature
during cooking is one of the biggest problems for grill cooks. If
you have a gas grill, adjust the heat with the control knobs,
advises Fuller; otherwise adjust the vents in the grill bottom or
sides (close to restrict airflow and heat; open to increase heat).
To avoid smothering the fire, keep top vents in grill cover open
during cooking.
</P>
<P>
   If it's difficult to alter the grill temperature, change the
distance between the food and the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The three most frequently grilled foods are steaks, chicken and
hamburgers, according to the Weber Grill company.
</P>
<P>
   Hamburgers are always popular, says Fuller. There are all kinds
of things you can do with them to make them flavorful _ such as
adding fresh herbs _ or topping them with condiments, salsas or the
like that you can make or buy. Try stirring some ginger and crushed
pineapple into prepared mustard, she suggests. You can also add
things like Green Tangy Avocado Salsa, Smoky Sicilian Salsa or Red
Sweet Pepper Relish to gussy up grilled chicken and steaks.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to cooking ribs on the grill, for best results,
Fuller opts to bake them, covered, in the oven first before tossing
on the grill for 15 minutes to finish them off.
</P>
<P>
   She also advises adding barbecue or other sauces to meats and
other foods only during the last 10 minutes of grilling time to
avoid ending up with excess browning and burned, unpleasant-tasting
results.
</P>
<P>
   And if you plan to marinate foods before grilling, always
discard the marinade mixture; DO NOT reuse or serve as an
accompaniment to the cooked food.
</P>
<P>
   Grilling offers plenty of versatility. Fuller likes to cook
vegetables on the grill in a little oil in a grill-wok, which looks
like a wok but has holes in it. ``They get a nice carmelized
flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   The most innovative grill recipe in the cookbook, says Fuller,
is the Peanut and Banana Pizza using a grill pizza pan (with holes
in it) and a package of refrigerated chocolate chip cookie dough.
Topped with caramel ice cream topping, chocolate chips, peanuts and
sliced bananas, it's a fun recipe for kids.
</P>
<P>
   For some tasty grilling, Memorial Day weekend and beyond, try
these ideas culled from ``The New Grilling Book'' and other
sources.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday
proposed strict new regulations of arsenic in tap water, reducing
by 90 percent the public's maximum exposure to the chemical, which
causes cancer and is found at harmful levels in at least 1 out of
10 of the nation's community water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The agency wants to lower the limit on arsenic from 50 parts per
billion to 5 parts per billion, an approach that it estimated would
cost $374 million a year and would prevent scores of cancer cases
each year and provide other major health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Water utilities, while agreeing that the rules should be
tightened, contended that this level of control would cost about
four times as much as the agency claimed and that the health
benefits were not worth such an effort. Environmentalists called
for an even stricter rule, saying the agency was accepting
unusually high cancer risks in this approach.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA missed a deadline of Jan. 1 under the Safe Drinking
Water Act of 1996, and environmentalists threatened to sue the
agency if it did not move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The subject of arsenic has been debated at the EPA for the
better part of a decade or more,'' said Charles J. Fox, assistant
administrator of the EPA for water programs. ``We think this is
affordable, and it is important for public health protection. But
in some communities they will see increases in drinking water rates
to pay for this additional health protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency said the costs per household might be about $28 a
year in households in larger cities, and about $85 per household in
communities of fewer than 10,000 households. The agency makes
billions of dollars of federal loans to cities to help them meet
drinking water regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The burden would fall most heavily on states in the Southwest,
where many communities have tap water with high levels of arsenic.
Other communities in the West, the Midwest and New England would be
affected, especially those that rely on water found underground
rather than streams and other surface water for their drinking
water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Albuquerque, N.M., water system, which serves
more than 400,000 people, has an arsenic level of 14 parts per
billion, and the Norman, Okla., water system, which serves 80,000
people, has arsenic levels at about 36 parts per billion, according
to federal data complied by the Natural Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   The agency estimated that 6,600 utilities, or about 12 percent
of all water suppliers in the nation, would have to take corrective
action, and that the vast majority of them serve 10,000 homes or
fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenic in drinking water comes from industrial pollution, but
more commonly from natural sources in the ground. Its occurrence
varies widely: New York City's water is already essentially
arsenic-free and meets the new standards.
</P>
<P>
   In some communities, people may face a risk as high as 1 in 100
of developing cancer from contaminated water, according to a study
published last year by the National Research Council. For decades,
Congress has called for the agency to review its rules, but the
agency has never before issued a proposal, citing uncertainties
over the costs and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   While few experts argue against taking action to improve
protections from arsenic, there is still a dispute over how
strictly the agency should regulate it. Arsenic can cause not only
lung, skin and bladder cancer but also diseases of the liver, blood
vessels and other organs.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Olson, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense
Council, objected that the EPA proposal would provide a cancer risk
of 1 in 10,000, a claim that the agency confirmed. ``Although it is
a very significant step forward, it would still provide a higher
cancer risk than any other EPA rule for tap water,'' Olson said.
``I think that is a pretty serious precedent for the agency to be
undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   His environmental advocacy group has urged the agency to adopt a
standard of 3 parts per billion, the strictest standard that is
considered feasible with existing technology.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Marsano, a spokesman for the American Water Works
Association, which represents water utilities, said the group had
called for a standard of 10 parts per billion _ twice what the EPA
was proposing, and equal to the recommendation of the World Health
Organization. He said that would bring reductions in the vast
majority of cities where arsenic was a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's draft proposal, prepared after years of discussions
with health officials, water districts and the public, was held up
at the White House for review until this month.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's new proposal is a compromise, but leaves open the
possibility of seeking higher or lower standards after a period of
public comment.
</P>
<P>
   The agency asks the public to comment on several alternatives: a
20 parts per billion standard, the 10 parts per billion standard
that the water utilities have endorsed, the 5 parts per billion
standard that the EPA favors, and the 3 parts per billion standard.
A decision is to be made within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's economic studies conducted over the past few years
found that the standard of 10 parts per billion would cost only
half as much as its proposal, and that the standard of 3 parts per
billion would cost twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   For each notch that the regulatory vise is tightened, there
would be a corresponding reduction in cancers, the agency's
scientists found. But the improvements would be relatively slight.
And because most of the cancers at each level of control would be
curable, the agency deemed that the health gains were worth only so
much money spent cleaning up water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Large water systems probably would treat their water with
relatively efficient technologies like filtering and adding lime.
But systems that serve fewer than 10,000 people would probably
choose less efficient approaches like reverse osmosis, and the
costs of treatment per household would probably be higher there.
Large systems would be given three years to comply, and small
systems, five years.
</P>
<P>
   Because it recognized that the rule might be costly, Congress
specifically told the environmental agency to consider a less
stringent rule if it found the benefits of strictly controlling
arsenic too costly to justify.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CONSUMER CONFIDENCE REPORTS: Beginning last year, local water
utilities are required to send a consumer confidence report once a
year with their water utility bill. The report has information on
all contaminants, including arsenic, and the amounts found in the
local water supply.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO GET INFORMATION: Call the Environmental Protection
Agency's Safe Drinking Water Hot Line at (800) 426-4791 for the
number of your water utility and ask for a consumer confidence
report. Or check the EPA's Web site for more information:

<P>
   MERJ 'UYUN, Lebanon _ This hillside Christian village, with its
church spires and sweets shops, was the picturesque military center
of the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon for two decades.
Before noon Wednesday, the morning after the occupation zone
precipitately collapsed, its stores were shuttered and its
cobblestone streets nearly empty but for two young men with a
clipboard.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, Nadir Abdelkhalek, 25, a clean-cut financial
analyst and member of a small occupation resistance group, checked
the clipboard and pronounced his job done. Working off a roster, he
and a colleague had gone door to door, rounding up 60 South
Lebanese Army members who did not flee to Israel. All had
surrendered, no weapons were drawn, and the town was now officially
``collaborator free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We acted in a calm manner, and told them that it was all over,
welcome back to Lebanon,'' Abdelkhalek said. ``We didn't yell at
them. We didn't rough them up. We just turned them over to the
Lebanese police. And, of course, we pitied them.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that the Israeli withdrawal happened so suddenly, southern
Lebanon was gripped by tumult Wednesday, exultant but chaotic as
the national landscape was redrawn in a night. Official Lebanon
improvised a reaction to the instant reunification of the country,
but it quickly became apparent that much remains undecided,
starting with whether the military conflict with Israel was indeed
over or was still on.
</P>
<P>
   Young men like Abdelkhalek _ most brandishing AK-47s or M-16s
rather than clipboards _ took over the countryside. Six competing
resistance groups, led by the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, roamed the
400 square miles of southern Lebanon, jumping feet first into the
power vacuum left by Israel's quick withdrawal. So far, there is
surprising calm, but it is a volatile situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the army or a major internal security force moves in
here quickly, you have to fear that the different groups will argue
among themselves, and they are basically kids with guns,'' said
Mohana Rafa, the police chief of the 20,000-resident town of
Hasbeya.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-backed militia men are another potential friction
point, and their fate is unclear. The Lebanese army is holding some
1,250 men in army barracks in Baalbek; some are former militiamen,
but some are people who crossed the border to work or even just for
medical treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say those men will proceed immediately to military
tribunals to be judged on charges of treason. Based on what
happened in the town of Jezzin, which was abandoned by Israel last
year, experts expect short sentences of several months to a year
for a most. Lebanon has few available prison beds. But it remains
to be seen whether the government seeks to make an example of a few
high-ranking militia officers to allay a demand for vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Also unclear is the future of the half-deserted Christian towns,
whose mood swung wildly between confusion and panic Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father, father, come quickly,'' yelled a woman who ran to
fetch the priest from the St. George's Church in the town of Qlaia,
adjacent to Merj 'Uyun. ``They are searching our houses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Fedi Salameh, 30, whose parish was cut in half on
Tuesday, when 2,000 local Christians packed their cars and fled to
Israel, said ``Not to worry. Nothing will happen. The Hezbollah has
given its word.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel spent its final night in Lebanon blowing up its positions
and discharging its ammunition supply, so it went out in a fury of
sound and smoke, but more uneventfully than anyone would have
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, for the first time in decades, international monitors
reported no Israeli violations of Lebanon's land, water and
airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers worked furiously to dismantle their border
posts that overstep the 1923 international border. Israel wants the
U.N. certification teams to be able to move in quickly and judge
whether the withdrawal is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese officials have uttered contradictory opinions on
whether they will accept the U.N. certification, since the
organization has put aside Lebanon's claim over a piece of property
at the edge of the Golan Heights. Israel is not planning to abandon
the property, the Shebaa Farms, which the United Nations accepts.
</P>
<P>
   The Shebaa Farms area was in Syrian hands when Israel occupied
the Golan, and U.N. officials said they did not want to get
involved in a dispute over the land. There is another problem that
they avoided, too: Lebanese guerrilla demands, which have been
echoed by the Lebanese president, that Israel release the two
remaining Lebanese detainees as part of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Middle East envoy, Terje Roed-Larsen, arrived Wednesday
night to work with Lebanese officials on resolving their
contradictions into an official position that helps end the
conflict. For if Lebanon does not accept the withdrawal, it signals
guerrilla groups that the violent fight against Israel is still on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key at the end of all of this is Lebanon has to accept our
determination,'' said Timor Goeksl, spokesman for the U.N. forces
here. ``Then we will be able to move to the border zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Hezbollah moved into the border zone, planting its
yellow flags atop such formerly Israeli-controlled sites as the
Beaufort Castle overlooking northern Israel. Lebanese families,
with picnic baskets, poured into the area, too, digging through the
rubble of the abandoned posts as if they were archaeological sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some were giddy with reorientation. ``I am staring down into
Misgav Am, Israel,'' said a reporter for a local radio station. ``I
can see the asphalt on the road. And the houses. Look, there's
people walking there. Israelis! It's really amazing, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to appearances, as the fighters rode Israeli armored
personnel carriers along mountain roads, the Lebanese army
recovered most of the weapons and equipment left behind in the
hasty pullout, Goeksl of the United Nations said.
</P>
<P>
   Granting the resistance fighters their moment of glory,
President Emile Lahoud of Lebanon sang their praises as he traveled
into the southern zone for the first time _ although advance teams
distributed posters of the president and Lebanese flags to towns
slathered with Hezbollah imagery.
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud tried to allay the anxieties of the Christian townspeople
of the south, as did several Hezbollah sheiks and U.N. officials.
``Tell your relatives who left the country to come back because the
state of Lebanon will protect everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Qlaia, so long on the fringes of Lebanon, they were not sure
whom to believe. The South Lebanese Army's forerunner, the Army of
Free Lebanon, was born in the small hilltop town, which long ago
allied itself with Israel out of alienation from local Shiite
Muslims and out of fear that Palestinian radical groups would use
their town as a base.
</P>
<P>
   The residents mingled in the church courtyard Wednesday morning
after Hezbollah rode through their town shooting in the air. One
woman said she had shivered with each shot, but another, Josephine
Nahara, who was shouted down as she talked, said: ``I thank them.
It will be nice to see Muslims and Christians holding hands.''

</P>
<P>
   The sky blue dome of the chapel is riddled with bullet holes,
and the paint peels off the forlorn walls. Salameh, cradling a cell
phone in his black cassock, said he was struggling to assess the
town's fragile situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large part of the town has left,'' he said. ``Imagine having
50 percent of your population emigrate in one day. There were three
kinds: Officers and soldiers of the South Lebanese Army, who left
for obvious reasons, and people who had worked in Israel, who
feared they would be imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can one explain what happened in this town?'' he
continued. ``It was the situation of war that warped us and debased
us. By the end, the people were cut off from Lebanon, and serving
Israel was the only way to make a wage. But it's clear now that
Israel used them. Look at those who fled across the border. They
have put them in camps, in tents.''
</P>
<P>
   The priest jumped to his feet as Lebanese army officials strode
into his church unannounced, their first foray into the area in 22
years. The strapping officers, in their camouflage khakis, sat down
as townspeople trickled into gape. The officers talked quietly with
the priest, telling him that the people should not worry about
reprisals. And then they were gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be happier if the army stayed,'' Salameh said. ``Who's to
stop the Palestinians from coming in and causing problems across
the border?''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Merj 'Uyun the villa of Antoine Lahad, the South
Lebanese Army chief, was trashed. In Israel, Lahad faced a bruising
confrontation with his troops, who harangued him for the
humiliating way in which they were forced to flee their homes.
Lebanese television showed a clip of the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Hasbeya, the Rafa family, many of whom served in
the South Lebanese Army, hope that those who chose to stay in
Lebanon will not be treated like collaborators or agents. ``We love
that we are Lebanese,'' said Gamal Rafa, 30, who served seven years
with the Israeli-backed militia. ``But the wars here made us crazy.
We grew up on guns. Guns were muscles. And in this area, the guns
were in the hands of the SLA.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were poor,'' he said. ``The only work was their army. If
you're in their army, you can live. If you're not, you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   When he learned that the occupation zone had folded, Rafa, who
quit the militia four years ago to pump gas, set off to track down
his cousins who were militiamen. They were still obediently
standing at their posts. He took them to his house, dressed them in
civilian clothes, and then drove them to an army checkpoint and
turned them in.
</P>

   ``If they're in prison for a month or a year, I can still see
them,'' he said. ``If I didn't take them in, maybe they would have
been tempted to go down to Israel. And that would be the saddest
end to our story.''

BARAK VOWS TO HOLD SYRIA RESPONSIBLE FOR GUERRILLA ATTACKS AGAINST
ISRAEL
</HEADLINE>
   (See also LEBANON-SCENE, ISRAEL-LEBANON-BORDER)

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak warned Lebanon and Syria
on Wednesday that any cross-border attack on Israeli territory
would be considered ``an act of war,'' now that Israel has
withdrawn from Lebanon, in a rush completed before dawn on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Generals vowed to retaliate against incoming rockets or
artillery from Hezbollah guerrillas with strikes against Syrian
military targets deep inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The planes are ready,'' said Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli
military's chief of staff. ``The pilots are on call. Their quality
is known.''
</P>
<P>
   The warnings suggested the degree to which Israel's enthusiasm
over the safe return of its troops and the end of a costly
occupation is undercut by a portent of tension.
</P>
<P>
   Along Israel's northern border, the bombing of recent days
subsided into silence. But the few remaining residents were ordered
into their bomb shelters, and Israeli military warily watched
Hezbollah forces across the border without the hoped-for constraint
of Lebanese army troops or U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to withdraw is correct, but the implementation is
miserable,'' Dan Naveh, an opposition legislator, said in a typical
comment in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But by and large, Barak received credit for keeping his central
campaign promise _ a full withdrawal from Lebanon _ a year after
that pledge helped secure his election.
</P>
<P>
   The few hundred remaining Israeli soldiers emerged from Lebanon
before dawn on Wednesday ``without a scratch,'' the prime minister
boasted, and some 5,000 militia allies were given asylum in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers that on Monday featured Kosovo-like portraits of
fleeing refugees on Wednesday printed their headlines in patriotic
blue. ``Mom, We've Left Lebanon!'' declared a giant banner atop
Yedioth Aronoth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Barak appeared to be trying to tamp down the elation. ``This
is a happy day and a painful day,'' he said on television Wednesday
night. ``Happy because we brought the boys home. Sad, because a
thousand of our dear sons did not live to see this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has shown a striking readiness to assign the blame for any
renewed violence to President Hafez Assad of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any attack on the north will now be interpreted as an attack
by Syria,'' said Itamar Rabinovoch, a former Israeli ambassador to
the United States and an expert on the Syrian regime. ``The dire
warnings to Syria reflect the general sentiment that this could
take us into the mouth of the abyss.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli presence in Lebanon acted as a constraint against an
escalation of tensions with Syria, as troops in the zone were
exposed to retaliation from the Hezbollah. But future Israeli
attacks on Lebanese targets would be conducted principally from the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's overnight shift from a ground occupation strategy on
the border to reliance on an aerial offense will limit casualties
and accentuate its technological superiority, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 18 years, Israel has been fighting a guerrilla war, a war
of attrition, that nullifies all of its technological advantages,''
said Gerald Steinberg, a defense specialist at Bar-Illan
University. ``Now, by fighting from the air, Israel can use its
real capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   While the returning Israeli soldiers were welcomed across the
country with family celebrations and politicians' applause, there
was ambivalence in the reception given the 5,000 refugees from the
South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israelis were angered that many militia members were
captured by Hezbollah forces and turned over to Lebanese
authorities. Antoine Lahad, the former commander of the militia,
said on Wednesday that Israel and the South Lebanon Army had
``worked together for 24 years, and then Israel decided within 24
hours to change direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Interior Ministry on Wednesday hastened to provide
the militia members many of the benefits accorded immigrants here,
including work visas, health insurance, temporary housing and help
in finding jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel will be tested on how we deal with them,'' said Ephraim
Sneh, Israel's deputy defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had become caustic in his condemnation of the original
strategic logic of the occupation, contending that it had failed to
protect northern border towns while causing the needless deaths of
more than 900 Israeli soldiers and thousands of Lebanese combatants
and civilians. His implicit target has been the leader of the main
right-wing opposition party, Ariel Sharon, the former defense
minister who led a full-scale invasion into Lebanon in 1982
</P>
<P>
   Sharon on Wednesday termed the withdrawal ``a disgraceful
retreat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The government had 10 months to organize this, and if it had
been organized right, Israeli weapons would not have fallen into
Hezbollah hands,'' he said.

<P>
   I remember a time, learning about jazz, when I was thrilled by a
musician stepping up to take a solo. It struck me then that the
solo was a vector of musical truth and insight, and all the other
stuff around it was just set-up, material that could be learned
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improvisation is the ultimate human endowment,'' wrote the
scholar Albert Murray, concluding ``The Hero and the Blues,'' an
essay on American literature that showed how the best art came
directly from a people's survival tactics. Murray adeptly connected
jazz to great fiction, and this line of thinking excited me back
then: I felt that one had to be all ears at the threshold of each
solo _ for this was where a musician could be ``read,'' where
native genius would spring out of him and be ready for measurement.
</P>
<P>
   I think that I, like many other people, came to understand
soloing roughly to be the same thing as ``improvisation,'' as
Murray intended it. In fact, the former is a subset of the latter.
Improvisation is the mindset, the impulse; the solo is one product
of that impulse. You can be a very improvisatory musician,
especially rhythmically, without taking a lot of big, spotlighted
solos.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more often than not, I brace myself at that moment when all
members of a group simmer down to accompany a solo from a frontline
musician. Because it often means that I'm going to hear not just
one solo, but a bunch of them. They may be long, far longer than
they need to be. They may seem like place-fillers for what could be
stronger, shorter, more memorable music. By the end of the tune,
I'm often left wondering how it is that solos _ and especially that
theme-solos-theme format _ became such a necessary part of jazz.
Not everybody solos particularly well, after all, and the number of
bona fide stars whom you'd always want to hear solo, because you
identify with them, is at an all-time low. Sometimes _ too often _
solos make listening to jazz drudgework yet are nevertheless
applauded, when the real strength of the piece lay in some other
part of it.
</P>
<P>
   The solo is certainly the primary symbol of jazz to the outside
world _ a rail-splitting statement made within a rail-splitting
music. In the history of jazz scholarship, solos have been taken as
the highest mode of assertion; there are more analyses of solos
than those of rhythm sections, for example, and they're much
better-known pieces of criticism. And most of the great heroes of
the music have been powerhouse soloists. Jazz solos first grew into
special moments, things of art, in the early 1920s, and they may
have reached their peak in the 1960s when John Coltrane's 15-minute
performance on ``Chasin' the Trane'' made him an icon. Now, some of
the best jazz has pressed the solo back into the context of written
music or made it an ongoing collective endeavor throughout a piece
of music, thereby lessening its iconic stature. In the huge volume
of jazz to be presented in New York during next month's jazz
festivals, we will be sure to see both an effusion of the old
style, for nostalgia's sake, as well a good dose of the new.
</P>
<P>
   I started to think about this shift a few years ago when I
noticed that some of the great performances of current jazz that I
saw didn't seem to be about solos anymore. One of two things
generally happened to make the music sound fresh: either the entire
band seemed to be improvising all together, with emphases on one
musician or another, controlled by the bandleader, or the music had
become heavily arranged. Those arrangements were new to bandstands;
that arranging impulse had largely dropped out of small-group jazz
from the 1960s to the 1980s, and via the influence of composers
ranging from Wynton Marsalis to Henry Threadgill, it was coming
back.
</P>
<P>
   Improvisation is always a relative term. The jazz ensemble
retains the spirit of improvisation, even if much of the material
is notated or known by heart; and in the realm of rhythmic
improvisation, there is much that the jazz musician can do by
making small free-hand inscriptions on the walls of a predetermined
tune. In early jazz, the solo began as a deeply woven part of the
ensemble _ little variations that amounted to embellishments of the
written line. By the 1920s, the notion was expanded, but the best
solos were still worked out in advance; there's a reason why King
Oliver's 32-bar solo in his 1923 ``Dipper Mouth Blues,'' with its
stubborn variations on a handful of blues phrases, sounds so
authoritative and why Bubber Miley's solo on the 1927 RCA Victor
version of Ellington's ``Black and Tan Fantasy'' holds your
attention from the first sly, four-bar long-tone to the last
bouquet of wahs and growls. But you can't charge these performances
with sounding canned: they are mirrors of the best creative acts,
and even though they are no doubt shaped by practice, the urgency
within them isn't faked. They're beautiful diversions: they take
the listener away from the piece, then return him to it.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz reached a high point in the '50s: it was widely understood
both as art music and as entertainment. The jazz musician loomed
larger _ in popular movies and novels, on the cover of Time
magazine and, thanks to Norman Granz's Jazz at the Philharmonic
tours, concert halls. Jazz at the Philharmonic enshrined the jam
session, the loose-limbed aggregation of players running through
well-known tunes, for a large audience. Naturally, when the jazz
musician's casual hours turned official, solos got longer.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, they got even better _ more rattling, more
immediate. The blues form helped musicians find themselves in three
memorable solos: Sonny Rollins' ``Blue Seven,'' Paul Gonsalves'
``Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue'' and Coltrane's ``Chasin' the
Trane.'' ``Chasin the Trane,'' in 1961, proved a solo could sound
gloriously unplanned, as if the musician were actually leaving the
present tense and going into the subconscious, where the narrative
of time didn't matter; Coltrane's only preserved remarks about the
tune's recorded version are to the effect that he was surprised by
how long it was. In the early 1970s, musicians like Roscoe Mitchell
and Lester Bowie took the process one step further, lampooning
well-worn gestures of the blues and bebop language and sometimes
even the very idea of solos; Mitchell has played solos of nothing
but one pitch or one phrase, repeated over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that wasn't the end of the jazz solo. But it was
around that time that the myth of the jazz musician started to be
deflated. Now, the figure of the jazz musician is even more modest.
Instead of some sort of tortured, celebrated loner, he's frequently
merely a scholar, and in an age when the cause of jazz education
has been hotly taken up, he's understood for what he is: a
hard-working artist whose parents encouraged a rather esoteric
desire through years of private lessons and music school. The myth
is leaving, and the audience credulity it takes to absorb endless
solos from the bandstand is leaving too.

<P>
   When Herbie Hancock played material from his ``Gershwin's
World'' album at the Blue Note last month, it was a performance not
about solos, not even about melodies, but about rhythm and
interplay. Dave Holland, performing at Birdland in early May,
presided over intricate bursts of form, often anchored by
persistent vamps; when a musician did take a solo, it was big and
commanding and statuesque, and not simply one in a series of rote
pirouettes. The pianist Jason Moran's forthcoming record, ``Facing
Left,'' presents a rattling set of pieces in which all three
musicians seem to be soloing simultaneously, and improvisation
largely hangs off the repeated melody. The wilder side of jazz has
been making adjustments, too: groups like Tim Berne's Bloodcount
and Peter Broetzmann's Tentet use arrangements that continually
recombine members of the group, keeping the emphasis away from
strings of solos and leaning toward shifting duets or three-way
improvisations.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions, of course _ musicians whose lengthy
improvisations are to be savored: Keith Jarrett, Joe Lovano, Dewey
Redman, Lee Konitz, Marcus Roberts and Wynton Marsalis, for
instance, all have superior senses of improvised form.
</P>
<P>
   But Roberts' last album, ``In Honor of Duke,'' is jazz trio
music so schematically worked out that it leaves little to chance.
Jazz records in general are turning toward more closely arranged
projects; the '50s notion of the ``blowing date'' record is more
passe than ever, replaced by recordings like Lovano's new ``52nd
Street Themes,'' featuring meticulous arrangements for a 10-piece
band, or Greg Osby's ``Invisible Hand,'' which manages by clever
forethought to corral Jim Hall and Andrew Hill, two musicians whom
you'd never think of putting together on the bandstand for a few
ad-libbed choruses. Such albums are not only easier to market _
there's often a story and something of an aesthetic argument behind
them _ but they're often more engaging to listen to than informal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis, recently asked in Jazz Times magazine what he thought
the future of jazz held, said: ``I think there's going to be an end
to the old style of jamming on the bandstand that was really
initiated during Charlie Parker's time. Historically, that was
never a part of jazz music, not in the beginning ... solos didn't
come into fashion until Louis Armstrong and didn't become ingrained
into jazz until the bebop thing came along. So I think there will
be more emphasis put on presentation and composition as opposed to
just soloing, which is really a boring and predictable way of
presenting music.''
</P>
<P>
   If Marsalis, who spends a great deal of time concerned with jazz
education, is thinking along the lines of building something that
will last _ a jazz literature for the future, rather than just a
few exploding minutes of genius in a B-flat blues _ he's not the
only one. It only takes a look at the schedules of the Bell
Atlantic and JVC festivals this year to know that the music, across
the board, is deep in its compositional phase. But this time
composition doesn't just mean old repertory; it means new music
that can survive, as written, into the future.

 &HT;    Witness says Lewis was `tussling,' not punching, victim
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A key witness who told police he saw Ray Lewis
punching a man who was later stabbed to death testified Wednesday
he only saw the NFL star ``tussling'' during the deadly melee in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gwen, a 26-year-old rap artist from Akron, Ohio, was
expected to be a strong witness for the prosecution. On Feb. 9,
Gwen told police he saw Lewis ``hitting'' Richard Lollar, one of
two men killed Jan. 31 after a night of post-Super Bowl partying.
</P>
<P>
   But Gwen testified Wednesday his initial account of Lewis
striking Lollar was ``a mistake.'' Instead, he said Lewis and
Lollar each grabbed at each other's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen is one of only two witnesses who have told police they saw
Lewis throwing punches during the melee. Lewis' limousine driver
Duane Fassett, who could testify as early as today, is the other.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen also testified he saw Lewis take off his gold necklace,
which prosecutors contend was an unmistakable indication he was
ready to fight. Lewis paid $45,000 for the two-foot-long white gold
necklace, studded with 28 carats of diamonds, two days before the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, Reginald Oakley, 31, of Baltimore and Joseph Sweeting,
34, of Miami are charged with murder in the stabbing deaths of
Lollar, 24, and Jacinth Baker, 21.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors brought home to jurors the horror of the fight by
displaying photos of Lollar lying dead in the street. The close-up
photo, with Lollar's eyes staring blankly, sent a relative bolting
for the courtroom doorway Tuesday and a half-dozen others consoling
each other.
</P>
<P>
   The photo, State's Exhibit No. 29, was flashed up on a screen
for the jury as Akron friend Christopher Shinholster identified
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Richard laying on the ground dead,'' Shinholster said
in a low voice. The series of photos caused some jurors to look
away.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen, who had recorded a rap CD under the name of Chino Nino,
also testified that he told Assistant District Attorney Clint
Rucker about his change in testimony during an interview with the
prosecution team on Feb. 28. Steve Sadow, a lawyer for Sweeting,
noted that prosecutors had not told the defense of the discrepancy,
which he said they were, by law, obligated to do.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner said she was
``extremely concerned'' about the development and ordered the
prosecution team into her chambers for an accounting Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen is a key figure in the case because his words caused a
misunderstanding that led to the deadly melee. Gwen said he left
the Cobalt lounge and discovered his ride had left him but saw
Akron friend Chris Shinholster, who said he'd give him a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen complained to Shinholster, using a profanity-laced racial
epithet.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, who was walking by, overhead Gwen and rushed back at
them, Gwen and Shinholster testified.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis walked up and grabbed Oakley around the waist, pulling him
toward the parked limousine. Gwen said he saw Oakley holding a
knife.
</P>
<P>
   Another man told them to stay back. That man held a knife but
was not a defendant, the two men testified. The two Akron men
testified this man was dressed in black, although Gwen said he wore
a leather jacket and Shinholster said he wore a mink coat. Gwen
also said that, during the ensuing fight, this man swung at him
with the knife.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, both Gwen and Shinholster admitted they
were drinking and smoking cigar-sized marijuana ``blunts.''
</P>
<P>
   After court adjourned, Rucker, when asked about this
unidentified man, said, ``We're still dealing with that,'' and
indicated that the state's investigation is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Lollar were walking behind Gwen and Shinholster. As
they passed the limo, Gwen said he heard Lollar say, ``(Expletive)
them, (racial epithet), this is OH-10,'' a reference to their
native Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley then came out of the limo and Baker smashed a champagne
bottle over his head, Gwen said, noting that he later saw Oakley
pull Baker's coat over his head and punch him four or five times in
the chest area. Baker died from stab wounds to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Shinholster, a stocky construction worker, testified that after
Baker popped Oakley with the champagne bottle, he ran up and
appealed to the football star to control Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when Ray Lewis ran up,'' to the fight, Shinholster
said. Lewis did not have a knife, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him to grab his dude; I asked him two or three
times,'' Shinholster testified. Lewis did not break up the fight,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He then heard Lollar scream ``Get your hands off my cousin,''
referring to Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Shinholster said he then saw Oakley shaking Baker, who appeared
to be unconscious. Shinholster ran over to Baker and grabbed him by
the foot. ``I tried to get a reaction,'' he said, adding that he
did not get one.
</P>
<P>
   He then saw Lollar walk over with his hand over his chest saying
he had been cut. ``It was in a calm manner like it was a small
cut,'' he said. But Lollar fell to the ground oozing blood and
Shinholster ran.

KEY REPUBLICAN VOTES SECURED VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was an unusual sight: There was Republican
loyalist and Bill Clinton nemesis Richard Armey, a congressman from
Texas, fighting passionately on the House floor for a bill Clinton
has described as his biggest legislative priority this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the Republicans _ the same party that voted
to impeach Clinton and has held endless hearings on alleged Clinton
scandals _ who gave the president the critical base to pass the
landmark legislation expanding trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the beginning of a new era of good feeling? Have the
Capitol Hill Republicans and the White House decided to make nice
for their final six months together?
</P>
<P>
   Nah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be like `Groundhog Day' again,'' David Wade, a
spokesman for Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, said
Wednesday. ``Tomorrow morning, the hatred begins again.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Republicans and the White House have been a bit
more cooperative with each other recently. They came together on a
bill this month to increase trade with Africa and the Caribbean
Basin, and on Tuesday they agreed to a ``new markets'' package to
help ailing urban areas in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But any thawing in the working relationship between the two
sides is more a function of their separate political concerns,
Republicans and Democrats admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker and the president have been working together
pretty well for awhile,'' said John Feehery, spokesman for House
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, a Republican of Illinois. The reason?
``The speaker wants to get things done, and the president wants to
have a legacy,'' Feehery said. ``Our interests coincide.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was an important personal victory for Clinton, who has
a small window of opportunity to establish some kind of legislative
legacy to define his presidency with something more dignified than
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill is in a special category, congressional and White
House officials note, because it is not a straight partisan issue.
Those who opposed the measure in the House fell loosely into two
categories: Democrats concerned about the impact on organized
labor, and Republicans and Democrats who think the United States
shouldn't reward China because of its poor human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   But when the president goes back to Congress to plead for
passage of other elements of his domestic legislative agenda, he is
likely to have a tougher time with his temporary Republican allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as (the China vote) meaning something for the next four
or five months, it's hard to say,'' said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart. ``We have an agenda. We have differences, whether it be
on Patient's Bill of Rights or prescription drugs for Medicare.
We'll have to wait and see over the next few months to see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Republicans in Congress are not finished with
their inquiries into various Clinton matters, such as the status of
numerous White House e-mails that House Republicans suspect may
have been kept hidden.
</P>
<P>
   And the investigation topics continue to emerge, even at this
late stage in Clinton's presidency. Representative William
Goodling, a Republican of Pennsylvania, is looking into why the
National Endowment for the Humanities asked Clinton to be the
speaker at this year's Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities.
</P>
<P>
   The honor is usually bestowed on an academic scholar, said Becky
Campoverde, a spokeswoman for the House Committee on Education and
the Workforce, of which Goodling is the chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declined the request to speak at the March event. But
Goodling has nonetheless demanded from the endowment a full
accounting explaining why Clinton was invited to speak to begin
with.

   Cut me some slack for often sounding repetitive in this column.
But game companies make just a few types: fighters, role-playing
games, sports titles, Mario/Lara Croft adventure games and, well,
everything else is Doomed.
</P>
<P>
   More than any of the aforementioned genres, though, racers are
perhaps not only the most cloned but the most popular. Gamers buy
these things like they're going out of business, but there's hardly
any difference to 'em. What, you pick a vehicle, pick a highway and
try to run everyone else off the road? Do we really need 50
e-versions of Dallas' Central Expressway?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently so. Here are three new racers:
</P>
<P>
   F1 World Grand Prix (Sega for Sega Dreamcast): You really gotta
hand it to Sega: It truly is the brilliant underdog of the vid-game
world. Who else but the company that slipped into one of its hockey
games an intercom announcement about someone leaving their car
lights on would dream of this: a racing game that features the
exact same weather conditions as the event on which the game is
based. How cool is that?
</P>
<P>
   Based on the 1998 FIA Formula One Championship, Grand Prix is a
lot better than other racers simply because of the realism: the
real-life drivers such as Mike Schumacher and Eddie Irvine, the
weather, the fully modeled cars and tracks from the '98 race, and
customizable car settings. I have no idea what a gear ratio is, but
it sure is cool that I can change it around.
</P>
<P>
   Topgear Pocket 2 (Kemco/Vatical for Gameboy Color): Here's a
rarity: a Gameboy racing game that doesn't look like Ms. Pac Man.
Credit that to the big, colorful and, most important, decipherable
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Players choose from 15 rally cars, including a Toyota GT-4 ST
(those are so cool), and 36 courses, ranging from dirt roads to
sun-paved highways and rainy, slick streets. Cars are tweakable via
various gadgets and gizmos. Mighty impressive for Gameboy.
</P>
<P>
   Excitebike 64 (Nintendo for Nintendo 64): Here comes another
motorcycle-racing game. Can I get a big WHO CARES?
</P>
<P>
   MX freaks will love this, though: You can do a bunch of midair
stunts, like cliff-hangers and heel-clickers, create your own
courses and, yep, knock the tar out of other racers. With 20
stadiums, some beautiful outdoor tracks and solid graphics, E64 is
probably the best MX-racer out there. With all the other ones
available, it's just kinda hard for me to care.

   PRINCETON, N.J. _ No baby sitter? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, a growing number of movie theaters, supermarkets,
gyms and casinos are adding playrooms where parents can leave their
children for a few hours while they spend money, watch a film or
work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents tell us they love it,'' said Dave DeMascole, manager
of the Wegmans supermarket here, which opened in August with a
large W-Kids Play Center. ``We're getting about 500 kids a week,
and there have been times when we've had to turn people away
because it's too full. It's free, and it gives them an hour or two
to shop in an enjoyable way. I have two young children myself, and
I understand, no matter how much you love them, how nice it can be
to get away from those interruptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, Wegmans Food Markets has opened play
centers at 29 of its 51 stores in New York, Pennsylvania and New
Jersey, and plans to open more as it expands. Wegmans is not the
only one: even in the absence of proof that in-store child care
increases profits, a 1998 survey by the Food Marketing Institute
found that almost one in five new supermarkets nationwide would
include such care.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 15 years since Ikea created a stir with its store
featuring a ``ballroom'' where children could romp in a sea of
plastic balls while their parents shopped for home furnishings. But
it is only in the last few years that on-site child care has caught
on more widely.
</P>
<P>
   Just what this trend means is open to debate. Many see it as
auspicious evidence of a more family-friendly world. Others say it
is simply _ and crassly _ a matter of businesses working harder to
turn parents into customers. Some child-care experts worry that,
however convenient for parents, the playrooms are symptomatic of a
society in which children dwell in a separate sphere devoted to
their entertainment, rather than being included in adult life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know what to make of it,'' said Ellen Galinsky,
president of the Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit research
group in Manhattan. ``On one hand, it's certainly a positive thing
that some businesses or stores that might not have welcomed
children at all a few years ago are now making a place for them.
It's also true that businesses are looking at parent-consumers in a
more sophisticated way. But I can imagine some people seeing it as
sad, as encouragement for parents to be apart from their kids more,
to leave them outside the daily routines.''
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, riding the tide of baby boomer
child-centeredness, a flurry of ``mommy-and-me'' programs emerged
in which mothers and children exercised together, swam together and
did art projects together. But now, the programs tend to separate
``mommy'' from ``me.''
</P>
<P>
   Many mothers say the baby-sitting programs are a godsend in an
era when parents are harried and teen-age baby sitters are scarce
and expensive.

<P>
   ``I don't have anyone to watch my 3-year-old daughter, so until
this began about a year ago, the only movies I went to were kiddie
things,'' said Ingrid Roberts of Pembroke Pines, Fla., who uses the
child-care center at Muvico's Paradise 24 movie theater whenever
she can. ``For the last three Friday nights in a row, my
girlfriend's come from the beach with her daughter, and we put the
two girls in the playroom, and we see movies while they play
together there. It means a lot to me. I know she's safe, I know
she's having a ball, and I get a night out, which I really need.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Muvico Theaters in Florida began offering care centers for
children 3 to 8 at its multiplexes in Tampa, Davie and Pompano
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had talked to moviegoers about why they didn't go more
often, and baby-sitting was one of the main reasons,'' said Randi
Emerman, a Muvico spokeswoman. ``Movies are usually spontaneous,
something you decide to do that day, but usually baby sitters have
to be lined up a week in advance. So we saw this as an amenity that
would get parents going to the movies more.''
</P>
<P>
   Muvico gives parent and child matching wristbands like those
used in hospitals, and releases the child only to an adult wearing
the wristband. The theater also gives parents a vibrating beeper so
they can be reached in an emergency without disturbing other
moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   Wegmans has a similar system. ``We page for potty runs,'' said
Jo Natale, a corporate spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the security can be cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one mom, in the midst of shopping, who remembered
she had to go get another child off the bus,'' Natale said. ``She
went home, then remembered she'd left the younger child with us, so
she snipped off her wristband and gave it to a neighbor to come do
the pickup. But of course we wouldn't release the child to the
neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some parents use the Wegmans in Princeton as semiregular child
care, arranging to meet friends for coffee or lunch at the store's
spacious cafe, while their children have an instant play group,
playing on the padded climbing structure, doing puzzles, or
watching a tape of ``Madeline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one mom who drops her twin 4-year-old boys every
Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and goes to the cafe for the full
two-hour limit,'' said Ruth Sommer, the W-Kids supervisor. ``That's
fine with us. She's still spending money in the store.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not fine with Wegmans, though, when parents deposit their
children and go off to shop elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a couple isolated incidents when we've paged
someone and they weren't in the store, and we've had to explain
that that's not what this is for,'' said DeMascole, the Wegmans
manager.

<P>
   There are still a few parents _ but only a few _ strolling the
aisles with little children in their shopping carts, some because
the child does not like being left with strangers and others
because shopping together is a pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we like to do together, so we can talk about
what we're going to have for dinner and she can pick out what she
likes,'' said Lisa Gill, whose daughter, Chelsea, was happily
holding a pudding pack she had selected herself. ``I do leave her
at the child care at my gym, but shopping for food is something we
can share.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though the child care at Wegmans is free, many of the programs
charge a fee _ about the price of a movie ticket at Muvico
theaters, and $5 to $6 an hour at many gyms and casinos. Either
way, most of the companies have only a hazy sense that the programs
are making a bottom-line difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really know how it's affecting our profits,'' said
Emerman of Muvico. ``We think it's doing well, but we look at it as
an amenity to get people going to the movies.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Generally, for-profit hourly child care has been tough going:
several baby-sitting ventures at shopping malls have folded after a
year or two. And New Horizon Kids Quest, a publicly traded company
that runs the hourly child care at Minnesota's Mall of America and
19 casinos in six states, has had its struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy business,'' said Susan K. Dunkley, the
president of New Horizon. ``It's so unpredictable and you need to
staff people even if there are no children there. We're doing very
well in casinos in Las Vegas, Michigan and Connecticut, but the
hosts, whether it's casinos or shopping centers, need to understand
that it's an amenity they're going to have to subsidize in some
way, shape or form.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the overall financial impact of child-care programs is
unclear, many parents who use the programs say the availability of
child care is what made them customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only reason I joined this gym,'' said Lisette
Reisman, as she picked up her daughter, Simone, this week at the
Crunch gym on the Upper West Side in Manhattan, where child care
for children 6 months to 4 years is free to members. ``I looked at
other places with child care, like Reebok and New York Sports Club,
but they all charged extra, and here it's free to members. And
Simone loves it. I always have to drag her out.''

AIR TRAFFIC TAPES FROM ALASKA FLIGHT 261 CAPTURE DRAMATIC
STRUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The last radio transmission from the pilots of Alaska
Airlines Flight 261 to air traffic controllers was a calm ``thank
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then controllers heard only chilling reports from pilots of
other planes who watched the Alaska jet make a horrifying, inverted
dive into the Pacific Ocean from 17,900 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That plane has just started to do a huge plunge,'' the pilot
of a corporate jet flying in the same area radioed controllers at
4:19:39 p.m., according to air traffic control tapes released
Wednesday in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute later, he added: ``Plane's inverted, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by this transmission from the crew of a Sky
West jet at 4:20:59 p.m.:
</P>
<P>
   ``He, ah, hit the water, he's down.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the Federal Aviation Administration made
public a transcript of the taped conversations between the doomed
jet and air traffic controllers that began soon after Flight 261
took off from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to Seattle, with a scheduled
stop in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   All 88 people aboard the MD-83 jetliner, including about 50 from
Washington state, died in the Jan. 31 crash off the California
coast.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes confirmed much of what is already known about the
accident from briefings by the National Transportation Safety
Board. But the pilots words captured their dramatic struggle as
they repeatedly lost and then regained control of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Before the tapes were released, the safety board mailed a
transcript to the families of crash victims.
</P>
<P>
   The two pilots of Flight 261, Capt. Ted Thompson, 53, and First
Officer William Tansky, 57, were not identified on the air traffic
control tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Their first report of a problem came at 4:09:55 p.m., some 11
minutes before the crash. Air traffic control had earlier cleared
the jet to maintain its cruising altitude of 31,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Center, Alaska 261, we are, uh, in a dive here,'' one of the
crew told controllers.
</P>
<P>
   The control center asked Flight 261 to repeat the transmission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we're out of 26,000 feet, we're in a vertical dive _ not
a dive yet _ but, uh, we've lost vertical control of our
airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant the jet had already plunged a mile from its assigned
altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 was falling at 7,000 feet per minute, more than three
times the normal rate of descent for a commercial aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who listened to the tape said the pilot who made the
call to controllers sounded winded, underscoring the effort it was
taking to control the jet.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts have said both pilots may have been pulling
back as hard as they could on their control columns to recover the
plane from its initial dive when the stabilizer jammed.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer is the winglike piece on top of the MD-83 tail
that is moved up or down _ ``trimmed'' _ to help keep the plane
stable. A jetliner's nose has a tendency to pitch up or down in
flight because of the aerodynamics of the wings.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder on Flight 261 that was recovered after
the crash showed the stabilizer jammed in the full up position,
which pushed the nose down and caused the jet to suddenly dive.
Flight 261 had plunged to about 23,700 before the crew radioed
controllers they had regained some control.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... we've got it back under control there,'' one of the
pilots said. But a second or two later, he added, ``No we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   At 4:15:19 p.m., the crew radioed they would attempt to make an
emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport. The jet was
at 22,500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A., Alaska 261, uh, we're with you, we're at
twenty-two-five, we have a jammed stabilizer and we're maintaining
altitude with difficulty, uh, but, uh, we can maintain altitude we
think and our intention is to land at Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   The control tower asked the crew what they wanted to do. The
crew said they wanted to descend to about 10,000 feet and remain
over the water when they put the flaps down for landing (change
configuration).
</P>
<P>
   ``Center, Alaska 261, I need to, uh, get down about ten, change
my configuration, make sure I can control the jet and I'd like to
do that out here over the bay if I may.''
</P>
<P>
   After the jet was cleared down to 17,000 feet, the crew made the
final transmission to controllers. It was 4:17 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' one of the pilots said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hall, chairman of the safety board, previously said that
when the plane was at about 18,000 feet, ``things began to happen
very quickly.'' The jet was flying at 270 knots, with its nose
pitched down 2.7 degrees and the stabilizer in the full nose-down
trim position.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the pilots extended the flaps to 11 degrees.
(Flaps are extended for landing to provide more lift.)
</P>
<P>
   Four seconds after the beginning of the flap deployment, Hall
said, the plane began to fall out of control. Its nose pitched down
at 26 degrees a second, eventually reaching 70 degrees. The plane
experienced a negative force of 3 ``G's,'' or three times the force
of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 rolled into an inverted dive and plunged into the
ocean in about a minute. The air traffic control tapes captured
that final dive from the perspective of several pilots in planes
flying in the area.
</P>
<P>
   After the pilot of the corporate jet radioed that the Alaska
plane had just started to make a ``big, huge plunge,'' the pilot of
the Sky West jet radioed that Flight 261 was ``nose down'' and
``descending quite rapidly, definitely out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   A Navy air controller at the Point Mugu, Calif., Naval Air
Weapons Center, watched on his radar as the jet plunged into the
ocean. His voice is also heard on the tapes, calling out the jet's
altitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at 7,600 feet ... He's at 5,700 (feet) right now 4,600.''
</P>
<P>
   The jet hit the water a few miles off Point Mugu some 11 minutes
after the crew had first reported the initial dive.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the FAA nor the safety board would comment on the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska posted an employee notice on its Web site that the tapes
were being released.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this information is very personal to all of us, the
ongoing National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the
accident inhibits what we and others can say so it would be
inappropriate at this time ... to comment on the tapes or
transcripts,'' Alaska said in the notice.
</P>
<P>
   It warned ``there will be a high level of coverage and the tapes
are likely to be played repeatedly. The coverage may be cold and
factual or sensational. But it will have great meaning for the
families of all of those lost and for all of us here at Alaska
Airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the safety board probe into the cause of the
crash, Alaska Airlines is the subject of a federal criminal
investigation of its maintenance practices.
</P>
<P>
   Questions also have been raised by investigators about
maintenance work done on the jackscrew mechanism that controlled
the movement of the stabilizer on the plane that crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The jackscrew is located inside the 40-foot long stabilizer and
runs up and down through a large fixed gimbal nut. Hall has said no
grease was found on the operational part of the jackscrew, although
Alaska claims pictures of the jackscrew show there was grease on
it.
</P>
<P>
   The threads of the nut were found stripped, and metal shreds of
the same material were found on the 22-inch-long jackscrew
recovered from the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder suggests that the problem with the
stabilizer started early in the flight, but was not considered
serious enough for the pilots to land the plane. The stabilizer
apparently would only move in one direction _ one that caused the
plane's nose to want to pitch down. The pilots would have had to
counter this using the elevators that are attached to the rear of
the stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   It is not all that unusual for a modern-day commercial jetliner
to experience minor stabilizer problems during flight.
</P>
<P>
   But on Flight 261, the problem turned deadly serious when the
stabilzier jammed in the full nose-down position.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts say the final dive from which the pilots did
not recover may have been caused when the jammed jackscrew ran
suddenly through mechanical stops and the stabilizer deflected to
an extreme position.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board is expected to hold its initial hearing into
the cause of the crash later this year. That hearing may be held on
the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   A transcript of what can be heard on the jet's cockpit voice
recorder is likely to be released at that hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The board is prohibited by law from releasing the tape from a
cockpit voice recorder. In the case of Flight 261, the cockpit
voice recorder captured the final 30 minutes of conversations
between Capt. Thompson and First Officer Tansky.
</P>
<P>
   The board also has not yet released tapes of conversations the
two pilots had with Alaska personnel on the ground in Seattle and
in Los Angeles as they tried to troubleshoot the stabilizer
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they had already radioed their thanks to
controllers, Thompson and Tansky were still talking to an Alaska
mechanic when their jet made its final, inverted dive toward the
Pacific.

REVISITING AN IMPETUOUS YET PROBING VIRTUOSO ON CD 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 28) 
 By JOSEPH HOROWITZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the 20th century, a special glamour surrounded concert
pianists. Franz Liszt, the progenitor of the piano recital a
century before, was, of course, the king of this species. But
Liszt, who stopped touring at 35, was also a major composer and an
important teacher and conductor. The performance specialist,
championing previous generations of canonized composers, was a
20th-century phenomenon, embodied by such keyboard luminaries as
Vladimir Horowitz, Rudolf Serkin and Sviatoslav Richter: recreative
interpreters divorced from the creative act.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the purest exemplars of the solo pianist were Arthur
Rubinstein, and Claudio Arrau, who may be reheard in a recent
flurry of recordings. Unlike Serkin, Rubinstein and Arrau were not
major pedagogues. Unlike Richter, they rarely performed chamber
music. Unlike Horowitz, they maintained an uninterrupted schedule
of recitals and concertos, tirelessly visiting the musical capitals
of the world, performing more than 100 times a season: a rarefied
calling.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein's public career lasted 82 years; he gave his final
recital and made his last recordings at 89. Arrau's career,
strangely enough, also spanned 82 years; he last played in public
at 86 and recorded at 87. It seems safe to predict that no concert
pianist will again pursue a comparable regime.
</P>
<P>
   Liszt proclaimed, ``Le concert, c'est moi.'' The Rubinstein
experience radiated joie de vivre. Arrau embodied scenarios of
suffering and redemption. His life story, stranger than fiction
(unless by Garcia Marquez), mapped an exotic and tortuous odyssey
that was itself a source of fascination, not least for a young New
York Times critic _ this writer _ whose first book, in 1982, was a
study of Arrau the man and musician.
</P>
<P>
   Arrau was born in 1903 in Chillan, Chile, a dusty seven-hour
train ride from Santiago. His earliest memory was of his home
caving in during an earthquake. The ``Chilean Mozart,'' he read
music (and scribbled clefs and notes) before he could read words.
At 8, a national celebrity, he was sent abroad with a government
stipend. He wound up in Berlin, the favorite pupil of Martin
Krause, himself a pupil of Liszt. He played for kings and queens,
and under Nikisch and Steinbach.
</P>
<P>
   Krause, a surrogate father, died in 1918. Arrau refused to
submit to another teacher. In postwar Berlin, his career as a
prodigy collapsed. He supported himself and his mother, sister and
aunt by giving lessons; the family was reduced to pawning the
necklaces and bracelets with which he had once been showered by
royalty. With the help of psychoanalysis, he arduously consolidated
a mature artistic identity.
</P>
<P>
   World War II drove Arrau to the United States and a keyboard
culture, crowned by Horowitz, into which he did not fit. He lived
in Douglaston, Queens. He died in Munich. He was buried in Chillan.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, when I undertook my ``Conversations With
Arrau,'' he had begun to retreat into a world without words. More
than ever, his world was music, and it ensnared him absolutely. To
see and hear him perform the Liszt Sonata was a frightening
experience. Then, in 1989, his wife of 52 years died. He told
friends he would never perform again, and he never did.
</P>
<P>
   I had lost touch with Arrau by the time he died in 1991. My
collection of Arrau LPs gathered dust for more than a decade. But
the recent spate of Arrau CD's reanimated my interest. ``Claudio
Arrau: The Early Years'' (Marston 52023-2; two CD's) includes
everything Arrau recorded from 1921 to 1939. And Philips' Great
Pianists of the 20th Century series includes three Arrau sets (456
706-2, 456 709-2, 456 712-2): six CD's with recordings extending
from 1928 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Though the repertory on these discs _ embracing Albeniz, Bach,
Balakirev, Busoni (an unforgettable 1928 version of the ``Carmen''
Fantasy), Debussy, Granados, Mozart and Stravinsky _ is remarkably
catholic, Arrau's core affinities included Chopin, Liszt and
Schumann at both ends of his long career. Comparing early and late
Arrau in the same music, I again find myself gripped by evidence of
an exceptionally fruitful and eventful artistic life cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Of the early recordings, the longest is of Schumann's
``Carnaval'' (1939). This is a ``modern'' performance, literal and
straightforward. Unlike Edwin Fischer, also a Krause pupil, Arrau
does not rewrite dynamics or poetically blur rests. Unlike Fischer,
he is an impetuous virtuoso. In fact, this is a dazzling
``Carnaval.'' But it is not, like Rachmaninoff's famously
diabolical version of 1929, specifically personal.
</P>
<P>
   To judge from recordings, Arrau did not acquire a highly
distinctive interpretive signature until he was in his 60s. This is
when he began probing every musical crevice, burrowing under and
around the written note to extract expression. The outcome was
complex: slower tempos, grander rubatos and, in profusion, the
accents pianists call agogics: stresses produced by delayed attack.
Arrau's style grew microscopically detailed. The straight lines of
his earlier interpretations acquired curves and detours.
</P>
<P>
   All this would have proved anarchic but for three consolidating
features of the Arrau style. First, rubatos aside, Arrau remained a
dogged literalist. Second, he retained his youthful facility: he
mastered the performer's art of combining poised physical
relaxation with maximum emotional expenditure. (His recommended
books included Eugen Herrigel's ``Zen in the Art of Archery.'')
Third, he commanded a liquid piano sonority, unsurpassed for tonal
depth and fullness of texture. No other pianist could flood a great
space with sounds as luminous and majestic.
</P>
<P>
   For some, Arrau's marriage of refinement and angst was perverse
or ponderous. For others, Arrau was revelatory. A performance like
his 1973 version of the Chopin Preludes (in the Great Pianists
collection) does not sound like any Chopin the composer might have
imagined. Discussing this music, Arrau used words like
``desolation,'' ``exasperation,'' ``desperation'' and, for the
opening C major salvo, ``orgasmic.'' The dark opulence of Arrau's
tonal palette and the 10-fingered breadth of articulation forge a
tragedy of epic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other performances in the Great Pianists sets, Chopin's F
minor Fantasy (1977) and Brahms' ``Paganini Variations'' (1974) are
distinctively regal. The Liszt Sonata (1970) and Beethoven's
``Waldstein'' Sonata (1963) and ``Emperor'' Concerto (1984), all
Arrau specialties, were recorded too early or too late.
</P>
<P>
   Arrau, who could claim no national cultural identity, took pride
in his eclecticism. But his later style _ like those of the
conductors Toscanini and Klemperer, also fanatic literalists _
formidably (yet unwittingly) personalized everything he touched.
That said, the composer he most inhabited was Liszt.
</P>
<P>
   He utterly lacked Lisztian irony or ease. His repugnance for
pianistic display canceled the fun of the Hungarian Rhapsodies. Yet
the Arrau sound _ its velvet blues and blacks _ ennobled Liszt. And
Liszt's religious strivings found in Arrau a true believer, immune
to sham. From Krause, Arrau inherited a reverence for Liszt the
man. He even portrayed Liszt in a 1936 Mexican film biography,
``Sueno de Amor,'' and wept playing the final scene.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein said of Busoni that he made Liszt's compositions
``sound even more important than they actually were.'' So it was
with Arrau (who heard and worshiped Busoni). The Great Pianists
CD's include two indelible examples.
</P>
<P>
   The first is a 1971 recording of a late and obscure paraphrase
of themes from ``Aida'': not a medley, but a concentrated
exploration of several ``Egyptian'' numbers and the final duet. On
the page, this music looks unprepossessing. In Arrau's hands, it is
grandly erotic: ``Tristan'' revisited.
</P>
<P>
   The second example, a 1976 recording of the ``Transcendental
Etude'' ``Chasse-Neige,'' defines Arrau's greatness in microcosm.
The vortex of shuddering, writhing tremolos peaks tremendously,
then recedes in exhaustion. The turbulence of Romantic
introspection and the pathos of Romantic retrospection are made
unbearably real. The combination of visceral intensity and
pianistic integrity _ every tremolo is thick with incident _ is
shattering. The performance is a fearless act of surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering Arrau, listening to his seven decades of recordings,
I mainly recall his humility.  &QL;

MARYLAND PROSECUTOR DROPS CHARGES AGAINST LINDA TRIPP 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chief state prosecutor of Maryland decided
Wednesday to drop criminal wiretap charges against Linda Tripp, the
Pentagon employee whose secretly recorded conversations with Monica
Lewinsky exposed an affair that led to President Clinton's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Stephen F. Montanarelli, said it would be
impossible to successfully pursue a trial, which was to begin on
July 10, because a judge this month suppressed testimony by
Lewinsky that, Montanarelli said, was crucial to obtaining a
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The decision concludes the only criminal case against a major
figure in the most serious Oval Office scandal since Watergate.
Tripp had faced the possibility of a 10-year prison sentence and a
$10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no choice'' but to drop the case, Montanarelli said in
an interview Wednesday, noting that in Maryland, a judge's ruling
on suppression of evidence cannot be appealed to a higher court.
``I'm not pleased, but that's the life of a prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement posted on her Web site Wednesday afternoon, Tripp
called the Maryland case an example of ``selective prosecution''
and vowed to ``continue to fight the shameful smear tactics of this
corrupt administration in civil court.'' Last year she sued the
White House and the Defense Department, maintaining that they had
used her confidential personnel records to impugn her reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp did not attend a news conference held Wednesday by her
lawyer, Joseph Murtha, on the courthouse steps in Ellicott City,
the Baltimore suburb where the trial would have been held. ``We
firmly believe that Tripp did nothing wrong,'' Murtha said, ``and
that she did not violate any laws when she exposed the criminal
behavior and wrongdoing committed by President Clinton and
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Laws on taping telephone calls vary from state to state. In
Maryland, where Tripp lives, it is against the law for one party to
tape a phone conversation without the consent of the other. At a
preliminary hearing in the case, Lewinsky testified that she had
not given permission for any taping of her conversations with
Tripp, who was once her close confidante.
</P>
<P>
   Montanarelli's decision to drop the charges was widely expected
after the judge presiding over the case, Diane O. Leasure of Howard
County Circuit Court, suppressed the testimony of Lewinsky in a
decision issued on May 5.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's office had faced the task of building a case
against Tripp that did not rely on evidence Tripp gave to Kenneth
Starr, then the Whitewater independent counsel, while she was under
a federal grant of immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the case was a Lewinsky-Tripp conversation that Tripp
taped on Dec. 22, 1997. This was the last talk between the two
women that Tripp ever recorded, and it occurred, prosecutors said,
just after her lawyer had informed her that secret tape-recording
was illegal in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky testified last winter that she was certain this
conversation had in fact occurred on that December day two and a
half years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Leasure's decision held that the testimony was not credible
and was tainted by the Starr investigation. Lewinsky's recollection
of the date of the conversation, the judge said, was influenced by
her contact with the independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe her, the court does not and that resolves the
matter,'' Montanarelli said Wednesday of Lewinsky's testimony that
she had an independent recollection of the date.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no other witnesses to the conversation whom the
state can call to testify,'' the prosecutor said, ``and Tripp
cannot be compelled to testify.''
</P>
<P>
   In their conversation of Dec. 22, the two women discussed what
they should say about Lewinsky's sexual relationship with the
president in the testimony that each expected to give in a sexual
misconduct suit filed by Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state
employee, against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an extremely important and memorable event in her
life,'' Montanarelli said of Lewinsky, ``which was, shortly after
it occurred, published in detail in the national news media.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp was also charged with illegally disclosing the details of
her conversation with Lewinsky to Newsweek magazine, which
published a transcript of the talk in its issue of Feb. 2, 1998.

 &HT;    Driver's testimony is key
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ray Lewis' limousine driver is one of the state's best
bets at getting incriminating testimony against the NFL star
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Fassett cares deeply for Lewis, can identify all the
suspects and initially told police that he saw Lewis punch at one
of the stabbing victims.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Fassett gave a slightly different story.
</P>
<P>
   Then he gave another slightly different story. And then, again.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for all three defendants are sure to hammer away at
inconsistent statements he gave during a two-month period, trying
to show the jury that Fassett wasn't sure what he saw. Fassett also
is expected to give damaging testimony against Lewis'
co-defendants, Joseph Sweeting and Reginald Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably the most unreliable and untrustworthy person
who'll get into that witness stand,'' John Bergendahl, Sweeting's
defense attorney, said in opening statements. Bergendahl counted
off four versions of Fassett's story, calling it an ``evolutionary
process to get testimony that fits the state's version.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassett appears to be the backbone of the prosecutors' case in
the double killing, because he identified all three defendants
attacking the two victims, Jacinth Baker, 21 and Richard Lollar,
24, and has no ties to the victims' party. Statements from Fassett
and Akron, Ohio, rap artist Jeff Gwen, who testified Wednesday, led
to the murder indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett has flown to Atlanta from Baltimore and may testify
today.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Fassett, 52, appeared to be a solid witness for
prosecutors. He not only admires Lewis, but he's a two-tour Vietnam
War veteran and is able to identify Lewis' co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He idolizes and loves Ray Lewis,'' said Paul Howard, in his
opening statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the consistent statements have left ample room for defense
attorneys to counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett's lawyer, David B. Irwin of Baltimore, said Wednesday
that his client ``will do his absolute best to be straight down the
middle on exactly what he remembers.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin acknowledged that Fassett has given different versions to
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``But every witness gives inconsistent statements if they're
repeatedly asked questions over hours at a time on several
different occasions,'' he added. ``This can be because they're
tired or worried or a lot of other things.'' Fassett will give
jurors ``his best recollection of what happened,'' Irwin said.
</P>
<P>
   A review of those finds that Fassett originally said he knew
little about the deadly brawl, then more and again, more. Then he
seemed to back off and hedge in a later statement.
</P>
<P>
   And in a murder scene re-enactment in Baltimore, Fassett
recounted the events of the fatal night as if conjuring up a
vision.
</P>
<P>
   In his initial statement to police, just four hours after the
incident, Fassett said, ``I did not see (the fight); I do not know
why it occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said ``I do not know where Ray was at or what he was
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, Fassett told police he was ``pretty sure''
that Oakley flipped Baker and then started punching him in the
torso. He also said he saw Sweeting hitting another man by the
tree. That man, police said, was Lollar.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Fassett said he saw Lewis throw a punch at Lollar.
</P>
<P>
   However, in that statement, he said Sweeting hit one of the
victims with a bottle. In reality, it was Baker who smashed the
bottle over Oakley's head.
</P>
<P>
   As they fled in the limo, Fassett told police, ``I could hear
someone saying `I took care of him' or `we took care of them', I
believe it was (Oakley) saying this. I am not sure if (Sweeting)
said this.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Fassett made this statement, Lewis was arrested on
murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Fassett was more definitive.
</P>
<P>
   The punch he said Lewis threw landed in Lollar's lower chest.
</P>
<P>
   Also, ``I heard (Oakley) say `I stabbed him' and (Sweeting) say
`I stabbed him, too,' '' Fassett told police.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he heard Lewis make a comment, Fassett responded,
``Nothing but `let's get out of here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But in a later statement, Fassett expanded on that: ``Let's get
the (expletive) out of here. Keep your (expletive) mouths shut. My
football career is not going to end like this.''
</P>
<P>
   This statement was used by prosecutors in the grand jury to gain
Lewis' indictment date.
</P>
<P>
   On March 30, Fulton prosecutors and Atlanta police went to
Baltimore to perform a re-enactment at the limousine service's
office. According to notes taken by homicide detective Ken Allen,
Fassett recalls what he saw as if conjuring up a vision.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett recounted the fight and then stopped, Allen wrote,
noting he then pressed Fassett to continue. At this point, Allen
wrote, Fassett's hands started shaking, he lit a cigarette and
looked toward the area where the stabbings where to have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said he continued to press Fassett, asking him what he
saw. ``I see Ray,'' Fassett finally replied. ``He is down by
(Sweeting).''

  (For release Sunday, May 28)

<P>
   PARIS _ Of all the world's well-worn romantic pilgrimage routes,
perhaps none is more potholed than the road to Paris. There are
couples who come here for the first time to get engaged or even
marry; some feel more in love in Paris and never recover from the
hangover once they go. If you fall for Paris first, you might find
love among the natives, for what is a native but another part of
the scenery? But a Frenchman can't share your Paris dream, and it
might be his incomprehension that drives you into the arms of a
starry-eyed Englishman _ who tells you why he came to Paris in a
sidewalk cafe on your first night together by motioning in the
amber-lit air: ``For this.'' Dreamers of the same dream _ heroin
addicts, mountain-biking fanatics, husband-and-wife political teams
as well as expatriates _ often find themselves tied as much to the
dream as to each other, all the edges of loyalty and desire blurred
and inextricable.
</P>
<P>
   Films like ``The Talented Ripley,'' ``The Beach,'' ``Out of
Africa,'' ``The Sheltering Sky'' and the recently released ``I
Dreamed of Africa'' have attempted to explore what happens when
people join hands and parachute into the wilderness of a shared
dream. Those who chase their fantasies to Paris or Kenya, Thailand
or Morocco usually learn that dreams are promises waiting to be
broken: love in a new climate withers as often as it blooms.
</P>
<P>
   In some films, the exotic locations of our romantic imaginings
are used like the cheap trick of a pink lightbulb, to add a glow to
an ordinary love story: the incidental geography that throws
Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart together on a steamboat in
``The African Queen'' or lands Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke in the
same European train cabin in ``Before Sunrise.''
</P>
<P>
   But the romance between the characters played by Jude Law and
Gwyneth Paltrow in ``The Talented Ripley'' seems a perfect
complement to the idyllic Italian scenery. They frolic on the beach
and sip martinis on the terrace, their love heightened by the
backdrop of an endless playground. But the luminous surfaces of the
film's Italian vistas only emphasize the discrepancy between
appearance and reality for Americans who have left their moral
compasses in another time zone.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) who comes between them,
it is the dream of paradise itself. Law's Dickie is so ruthless in
his pursuit of pleasure that he forgets that no amount of cash,
charm or beauty can save him. Blinded by the delirious whims of
possibility, far from home, it can be hard to see the danger signs.
To remember that our chosen paradises are indifferent to our wills
and desires. At best, they allow us to pass through them unscathed.
Sometimes, they swallow us whole.
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney Pollack's 1985 film, ``Out of Africa,'' based on Isak
Dinesen's memoirs, Karen Blixen (Meryl Streep) sets her sights on
anywhere. ``We might be all right,'' the weary Dane tells the man
she hopes will come along for the ride, ``and if we fail, at least
we'd have been somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But the punishing tests of East Africa, like any challenging,
unfamiliar territory, have a way of breaking weak ties. Their bond
doesn't strengthen in Kenya, it tears. She resigns herself to
making her tobacco grow and fighting lions and putting out her own
fires. It is when she seems most alone that true love appears, in
the form of Denys Finch Hatton (Robert Redford), a solitary veteran
of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Inviting her on the safaris he usually takes alone, he tells
her: ``I wanted to show you these things. I thought you'd
understand them.''
</P>
<P>
   Together and in their own separate ways they pour their hearts
into Africa. And when he takes her up in his two-seater airplane to
give her ``a glimpse of the world through God's eyes,'' they hold
hands in the sky, suspended with Africa in a moment of eternal
grace.
</P>
<P>
   When Denys dies and the farm burns, so does the dream life of
Africa. ``If I knew a song about Africa,'' she reflects years
later, ``does Africa know a song of me? Will the air over the plain
quiver with a color that I have had on? Or will the children invent
a game in which my name is? Or will the full moon throw a shadow
over the gravel of the drive that was like me? Or will the eagles
of the Ngong hills look out for me?''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to view Hugh Hudson's much less affecting ``I
Dreamed of Africa'' without drawing comparisons. The film is about
Kuki and Paolo Gallmann, a real-life Italian couple (played,
jarringly, by Kim Basinger and Vincent Perez, speaking in their
respective American and French accents), who pursue a mutual
fantasy of life in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Paolo has returned to the land of his boyhood and is drawn to
the risk and adventure that eluded him in Italy _ and that take him
away from home for weeks at a time. Kuki has naively come in search
of a ``new life,'' in which she imagines their shared adventure
will bring them together. But she soon learns how the demands of a
place can take away as much hope as they give. Feeling abandoned,
she consoles herself with passing such homebound tests as driving
an elephant from her garden. No, this is not the Africa she dreamed
about.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallmanns grapple with their expectations, learning such
trite lessons as how to submit to the new ``rhythm'' of Africa. But
the film most reveals how two people can never share exactly the
same dream. Their Africa feels more like an infidelity, each person
alone with a harsh and tempting mistress.
</P>
<P>
   Kuki loses her husband and young son to the unknown dangers of
foreign soil, but she stays on in Africa as the film ends _ and
before we can witness the real growth that must accompany such a
loss.
</P>
<P>
   That ``I Dreamed of Africa'' fails to engage us in the reality
of these people's experience _ despite a compelling story and a
camera-ready landscape _ illustrates that in this age of stale,
overpublicized fantasies, it requires a subtle hand to convey the
dream logic that leads people to forsake their given lives for the
sound of a single word: Paris, Africa, America. From the armchair,
it is easy to see each journey as an escape, a tired trek down a
predictable path. Only passion makes a journey new.

   In the opening scene of Bernardo Bertolucci's adaptation of Paul
Bowles' ``Sheltering Sky'' (1990), Port (John Malkovich) explains
the difference between a tourist and a traveler: a tourist is just
passing through, whereas the traveler moves from one place to the
next, perhaps never to find his way back. For the rich dilettante,
wandering the earth is his sole occupation, his only religion. He
studies maps and follows the wind and does not stop. ``My only plan
is: I have no plan,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He might be a born dreamer, but it's a journey he does not want
to make alone. Port's wife, Kit (Debra Winger), follows along,
simply enduring the transience of their troubled union in the hope
that they will one day end up back home in New York. ``Don't you
ever think we should stop?'' she asks him. ``Stay somewhere just
for a while?'' When he falls ill with typhoid in the middle of
rural Africa, she scolds, ``If you just stay in one place for a
while, you'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is too late for that. Kit has been waiting out Port's
wanderlust, hoping to return to real life one day soon _ as if real
life were not just the sum of all our days. Port has always known
that he might not go home again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we don't know when we will die, we get to think of
life as an inexhaustible well,'' says Bowles, the narrator, at the
end of the film. ``Yet everything happens only a certain number of
times, and a very small number, really. How many more times will
you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, some afternoon
that's so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive
of your life without it? Perhaps four or five times more. Perhaps
not even that. How many more times will you watch the full moon
rise? Perhaps 20. And yet it all seems limitless.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps every journey is at its heart a battle against limits, a
vain attempt to trick destiny into giving us more than our share of
lives.
</P>
<P>
   In Danny Boyle's film ``The Beach,'' Leonardo DiCaprio isn't
just seduced by the dream of paradise; he wants someone to share it
with, and breaks up the happy French couple played by Virginie
Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet. By the end, we're pretty sure he'll
hold onto the girl, but paradise has been lost. In Bertolucci's
``Stealing Beauty'' (1996), Liv Tyler is busy trying to art-direct
the loss of her virginity at a beautiful Tuscan villa, the home of
a couple beginning to wonder whether they might be snapping out of
their expatriate dreams.

   For it seems that three rarely last long in the bed. The man
with whom you once shared your love for Paris might leave you both
for the Cote-d'Ivoire. But even if you stay on forever, Paris will
never love you back. We can't really lose our hearts to places near
or far. It is human love, in the end, that breaks us. In ``The Last
Time I Saw Paris'' (1954), the city is just the resting place for
Elizabeth Taylor and Van Johnson's great unraveled expectations. If
Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman will always have Paris, it is
only because they have lost each other for good in ``Casablanca.''
Paradise isn't necessarily where we end up: it's where we've been;
where we're about to go. Sometimes there is nothing left to do but
get the map out.(BOX)  &QL;

 &HT;    Witness says Lewis was `tussling,' not punching, victim
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A key witness who told police he saw Ray Lewis
punching a man who was later stabbed to death testified Wednesday
he only saw the NFL star ``tussling'' during the deadly melee in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gwen, a 26-year-old rap artist from Akron, Ohio, was
expected to be a strong witness for the prosecution. On Feb. 9,
Gwen told police he saw Lewis ``hitting'' Richard Lollar, one of
two men killed Jan. 31 after a night of post-Super Bowl partying.
</P>
<P>
   But Gwen testified Wednesday his initial account of Lewis
striking Lollar was ``a mistake.'' Instead, he said Lewis and
Lollar each grabbed at each other's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen is one of only two witnesses who have told police they saw
Lewis throwing punches during the melee. Lewis' limousine driver
Duane Fassett, who could testify as early as today, is the other.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen also testified he saw Lewis take off his gold necklace,
which prosecutors contend was an unmistakable indication he was
ready to fight. Lewis paid $45,000 for the two-foot-long white gold
necklace, studded with 28 carats of diamonds, two days before the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, Reginald Oakley, 31, of Baltimore and Joseph Sweeting,
34, of Miami are charged with murder in the stabbing deaths of
Lollar, 24, and Jacinth Baker, 21.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors brought home to jurors the horror of the fight by
displaying photos of Lollar lying dead in the street. The close-up
photo, with Lollar's eyes staring blankly, sent a relative bolting
for the courtroom doorway Tuesday and a half-dozen others consoling
each other.
</P>
<P>
   The photo, State's Exhibit No. 29, was flashed up on a screen
for the jury as Akron friend Christopher Shinholster identified
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Richard laying on the ground dead,'' Shinholster said
in a low voice. The series of photos caused some jurors to look
away.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen, who had recorded a rap CD under the name of Chino Nino,
also testified that he told Assistant District Attorney Clint
Rucker about his change in testimony during an interview with the
prosecution team on Feb. 28. Steve Sadow, a lawyer for Sweeting,
noted that prosecutors had not told the defense of the discrepancy,
which he said they were, by law, obligated to do.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner said she was
``extremely concerned'' about the development and ordered the
prosecution team into her chambers for an accounting Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen is a key figure in the case because his words caused a
misunderstanding that led to the deadly melee. Gwen said he left
the Cobalt lounge and discovered his ride had left him but saw
Akron friend Chris Shinholster, who said he'd give him a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen complained to Shinholster, using a profanity-laced racial
epithet.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, who was walking by, overhead Gwen and rushed back at
them, Gwen and Shinholster testified.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis walked up and grabbed Oakley around the waist, pulling him
toward the parked limousine. Gwen said he saw Oakley holding a
knife.
</P>
<P>
   Another man told them to stay back. That man held a knife but
was not a defendant, the two men testified. The two Akron men
testified this man was dressed in black, although Gwen said he wore
a leather jacket and Shinholster said he wore a mink coat. Gwen
also said that, during the ensuing fight, this man swung at him
with the knife.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, both Gwen and Shinholster admitted they
were drinking and smoking cigar-sized marijuana ``blunts.''
</P>
<P>
   After court adjourned, Rucker, when asked about this
unidentified man, said, ``We're still dealing with that,'' and
indicated that the state's investigation is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Lollar were walking behind Gwen and Shinholster. As
they passed the limo, Gwen said he heard Lollar say, ``(Expletive)
them, (racial epithet), this is OH-10,'' a reference to their
native Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley then came out of the limo and Baker smashed a champagne
bottle over his head, Gwen said, noting that he later saw Oakley
pull Baker's coat over his head and punch him four or five times in
the chest area. Baker died from stab wounds to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Shinholster, a stocky construction worker, testified that after
Baker popped Oakley with the champagne bottle, he ran up and
appealed to the football star to control Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when Ray Lewis ran up,'' to the fight, Shinholster
said. Lewis did not have a knife, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him to grab his dude; I asked him two or three
times,'' Shinholster testified. Lewis did not break up the fight,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He then heard Lollar scream ``Get your hands off my cousin,''
referring to Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Shinholster said he then saw Oakley shaking Baker, who appeared
to be unconscious. Shinholster ran over to Baker and grabbed him by
the foot. ``I tried to get a reaction,'' he said, adding that he
did not get one.
</P>
<P>
   He then saw Lollar walk over with his hand over his chest saying
he had been cut. ``It was in a calm manner like it was a small
cut,'' he said. But Lollar fell to the ground oozing blood and
Shinholster ran.

PRESBYTERIAN COURT VOTES TO ALLOW GAY UNIONS
</HEADLINE>
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The highest court of the Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.), a denomination long divided on issues of homosexuality,
ruled on Wednesday that its ministers may conduct religious ``holy
union'' ceremonies for same-sex couples, as long as the ceremonies
are not regarded as marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Although the decision was made by the church's highest court, it
is not the last word on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the only way now to ban holy union ceremonies is
to change the church's ``Book of Order,'' or constitution, which
currently prohibits same-sex marriages, but says nothing about holy
unions. Three regions of the church plan to propose such a
constitutional ban at the meeting of the Presbyterian Church's
General Assembly, which begins on June 24 in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with the decision,'' said Scott Anderson, a
moderator of More Light Presbyterians, a group that advocates gay
rights in the church. ``But nothing is ever definitive in the
Presbyterian Church. The General Assembly is going to be dealing
with the holy union issue in Long Beach, and we are prepared for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The case originated with a ceremony for two men at South
Presbyterian Church in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., in 1998. A conservative
minister at another church read an article about the couple in a
local newspaper and brought suit in church courts against the
minister who had performed the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm disappointed,'' said the Rev. Marc G. Benton,
of Bethlehem Presbyterian Church, in New Windsor, N.Y., who brought
the suit. ``The difficulty is that nobody on my side of the
complaint knows what makes up holy union ceremonies. The line is as
blurry as the pastor who is performing the ceremony wants to make
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My suspicion is that some pastors perform what is basically a
wedding, and call it a holy union ceremony,'' said Benton. He said
that he is opposed to either ceremony for gay couples because
``that is based upon what we believe God has said'' in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the court directed church districts to clarify
the distinction between weddings and holy unions.
</P>
<P>
   The court said: ``Ministers should not appropriate specific
liturgical forms from services of Christian marriage or services
recognizing civil marriage in the conduct of such ceremonies. They
should also instruct same-sex couples that the service to be
conducted does not constitute a marriage ceremony and should not be
held out as such.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was one of three involving gay issues argued before the
church's high court, whose 16 members each represent one geographic
division of the Presbyterian Church, which has 2.6 million members.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the court ruled that a gay candidate for the
ministry who said he did not plan to remain celibate should not be
dropped from candidacy. Church rules require all clergy to observe
``fidelity in marriage'' or ``chastity in singleness.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court ruled that the ministry candidate's behavior
should be evaluated just before ordination and not during
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The court did not rule on the third case.
</P>
<P>
   Gay marriages and ordinations have become watershed issues for
many mainline Protestant denominations in the last two decades.

 &HT;    Driver's testimony is key
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ray Lewis' limousine driver is one of the state's best
bets at getting incriminating testimony against the NFL star
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Fassett cares deeply for Lewis, can identify all the
suspects and initially told police that he saw Lewis punch at one
of the stabbing victims.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Fassett gave a slightly different story.
</P>
<P>
   Then he gave another slightly different story. And then, again.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for all three defendants are sure to hammer away at
inconsistent statements he gave during a two-month period, trying
to show the jury that Fassett wasn't sure what he saw. Fassett also
is expected to give damaging testimony against Lewis'
co-defendants, Joseph Sweeting and Reginald Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably the most unreliable and untrustworthy person
who'll get into that witness stand,'' John Bergendahl, Sweeting's
defense attorney, said in opening statements. Bergendahl counted
off four versions of Fassett's story, calling it an ``evolutionary
process to get testimony that fits the state's version.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassett appears to be the backbone of the prosecutors' case in
the double killing, because he identified all three defendants
attacking the two victims, Jacinth Baker, 21 and Richard Lollar,
24, and has no ties to the victims' party. Statements from Fassett
and Akron, Ohio, rap artist Jeff Gwen, who testified Wednesday, led
to the murder indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett has flown to Atlanta from Baltimore and may testify
today.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Fassett, 52, appeared to be a solid witness for
prosecutors. He not only admires Lewis, but he's a two-tour Vietnam
War veteran and is able to identify Lewis' co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He idolizes and loves Ray Lewis,'' said Paul Howard, in his
opening statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the consistent statements have left ample room for defense
attorneys to counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett's lawyer, David B. Irwin of Baltimore, said Wednesday
that his client ``will do his absolute best to be straight down the
middle on exactly what he remembers.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin acknowledged that Fassett has given different versions to
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``But every witness gives inconsistent statements if they're
repeatedly asked questions over hours at a time on several
different occasions,'' he added. ``This can be because they're
tired or worried or a lot of other things.'' Fassett will give
jurors ``his best recollection of what happened,'' Irwin said.
</P>
<P>
   A review of those finds that Fassett originally said he knew
little about the deadly brawl, then more and again, more. Then he
seemed to back off and hedge in a later statement.
</P>
<P>
   And in a murder scene re-enactment in Baltimore, Fassett
recounted the events of the fatal night as if conjuring up a
vision.
</P>
<P>
   In his initial statement to police, just four hours after the
incident, Fassett said, ``I did not see (the fight); I do not know
why it occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said ``I do not know where Ray was at or what he was
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, Fassett told police he was ``pretty sure''
that Oakley flipped Baker and then started punching him in the
torso. He also said he saw Sweeting hitting another man by the
tree. That man, police said, was Lollar.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Fassett said he saw Lewis throw a punch at Lollar.
</P>
<P>
   However, in that statement, he said Sweeting hit one of the
victims with a bottle. In reality, it was Baker who smashed the
bottle over Oakley's head.
</P>
<P>
   As they fled in the limo, Fassett told police, ``I could hear
someone saying `I took care of him' or `we took care of them', I
believe it was (Oakley) saying this. I am not sure if (Sweeting)
said this.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Fassett made this statement, Lewis was arrested on
murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Fassett was more definitive.
</P>
<P>
   The punch he said Lewis threw landed in Lollar's lower chest.
</P>
<P>
   Also, ``I heard (Oakley) say `I stabbed him' and (Sweeting) say
`I stabbed him, too,' '' Fassett told police.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he heard Lewis make a comment, Fassett responded,
``Nothing but `let's get out of here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But in a later statement, Fassett expanded on that: ``Let's get
the (expletive) out of here. Keep your (expletive) mouths shut. My
football career is not going to end like this.''
</P>
<P>
   This statement was used by prosecutors in the grand jury to gain
Lewis' indictment date.
</P>
<P>
   On March 30, Fulton prosecutors and Atlanta police went to
Baltimore to perform a re-enactment at the limousine service's
office. According to notes taken by homicide detective Ken Allen,
Fassett recalls what he saw as if conjuring up a vision.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett recounted the fight and then stopped, Allen wrote,
noting he then pressed Fassett to continue. At this point, Allen
wrote, Fassett's hands started shaking, he lit a cigarette and
looked toward the area where the stabbings where to have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said he continued to press Fassett, asking him what he
saw. ``I see Ray,'' Fassett finally replied. ``He is down by
(Sweeting).''

TO SLEEP, PERCHANCE TO DREAM; UH-OH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of us escape into fantasy lives, usually through something
as simple and harmless as daydreaming. Few of us find our dreams as
complicated or distressingly realistic as Marie (Demi Moore) does.
Marie's a widow and free-lance book reviewer raising a couple of
daughters in the French countryside. Life is pretty normal until
she nods off to sleep at night _ and wakes up in Manhattan, where
she's a hotshot literary agent named Marty, and her mama pajamas
have been replaced by designer silk.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it the other way around _ is Marty dreaming she's Marie?
That's the mystery behind ``Passion,'' which takes an intriguing
psychological premise and dresses it up in romance-novel colors.
Extra shadings are provided by the moody writer (Stellan Skarsgard)
who woos her in France, and the breezy nice guy (William Fichtner)
who pursues her in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other recent movies about dual realities, ``Passion''
presents us with a protagonist who knows that one of her realities
is an illusion. She's just not sure which one, and even has a
psychiatrist in each version to help her figure things out. Because
she enjoys a healthy amount of lovemaking, it's tough to see why
she would complain, except that the guys are getting jealous of
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Director Alain Berliner (''Ma Vie En Rose'') manages to tread a
fine line between the movie's Harlequin-paperback sensibilities and
its darker psychological tone, and Moore is pretty good. The
resolution is predictably unsatisfying and wraps things up too
neatly, and the movie stumbles toward sappiness a little too often.
But it's one of the better recent meditations on fate, and just
interesting enough to keep you watching in spite of its flaws. Or
did I just dream that? &QL; 
 &QL; 
FILM: ``Passion of Mind'' &QL; 
RUNNING TIME: 105 minutes &QL; 
RATING: PG-13 &QL;

 &HT;    Labor dispute may pose quandary for Gore
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Gore, who has taken heat from union
leaders over his position on free trade with China, will soon find
himself in the midst of another labor battle brewing in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees union
plan to launch a union organizing drive today at the Loews Santa
Monica Hotel, one of six major beachfront hotels in the ritzy Los
Angeles suburb, and one of the many hotels that will house
Democratic committees and organizations during the Democratic
National Convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury hotel is managed by the Loews Hotels chain out of New
York. Jonathan Tisch, the company's president and CEO, is a friend
of Gore's and one of his top fund-raisers on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, HERE, the 300,000-member restaurant and hotel union,
is aggressively backing Gore for president.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting a tough fight over the Loews, Maria Elena Durazo, a
HERE vice president and the head of Local 11 in Los Angeles, said
she hopes Gore and other Democrats _ including Tisch _ will ``take
the side of the workers'' and support the organizing effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not going to have the kind of money to compete with
the big dollars, but I think if Mr. Tisch cares about the
Democratic Party . . . he understands how important this is,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The union's drive to organize the maids, bartenders and waiters
at the Loews hotel, part of a citywide campaign to organize
nonunion hotels, could also threaten the tranquillity of the
Democratic convention Aug. 14-17. Unlike Philadelphia, where
Republican convention organizers secured written promises of labor
peace when the party comes to town July 31, Democratic convention
organizers have received no such assurances.
</P>
<P>
   Convention organizers are seeking an agreement from Los Angeles
labor leaders not to strike or disrupt the Staples Center, where
the main convention events will take place, but it won't cover any
of the scores of hotels and off-site venues where delegates will be
staying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want our right to picket at nonconvention sites to be
respected,'' said Durazo, singling out the Loews.
</P>
<P>
   The support of organized labor is critical to Gore's election
prospects, and the vice president has been careful to nurture his
relationship with the major unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO,
which endorsed him last fall.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Gore joined striking janitors in a Santa Monica park
and voiced his support for a new contract between the janitors
union and commercial building owners.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Gore refused to cross a picket line of striking
hotel workers in Cleveland to address the National Summit on
Africa, whose members were meeting at the Grand Hyatt there.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, facing labor's anger over his support of
permanent normal trade relations with China, Gore has delivered two
speeches to labor groups, emphasizing his support of minimum-wage
increases, commitment to Social Security and other priorities of
organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the vice president strongly supports giving workers
the tools they need to organize,'' said Gore spokesman Chris
Lehane. ``We make every effort, when possible, to stay at union
hotels. About Tisch, he's obviously a friend and supporter and we
have great respect for him. But the vice president has a policy of
not involving himself in the private business of his supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore also has a long history with Tisch, one of the heirs to
the $21.5 billion Loews empire that includes the nation's
third-largest property and casualty insurance company and Lorillard
Tobacco, makers of Kent, Newport and True cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Tisch, who declined to comment, served as a vice chairman to
Gore's 1993 inaugural committee, and he contributed $35,000 to a
fund established to make improvements to Gore's official residence
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to regulated contributions to Gore's presidential
campaign, Tisch has also contributed $65,500 in soft money to the
Democratic Party, according to the databases at the Center for
Responsive Politics. During the 1998 elections, Tisch contributed
$120,000 in soft money to the Democrats, according to the center's
records.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Kelman, a spokesman for Loews, said Tisch's political work
for Gore was ``completely separate'' from his job with Loews.
Regarding the organizing drive at the Loews Santa Monica, Kelman
said, ``It's the decision of the employees of the property to
decide whether or not to unionize.''
</P>
<P>
   The Loews Santa Monica Hotel is one of Loews Hotels' 16 luxury
hotels in the United States and Canada, four of which are
unionized.
</P>
<P>
   It occupies a prime piece of real estate on Ocean Avenue in
Santa Monica, a palm tree-lined boulevard with breathtaking views
of the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say the housekeepers at the Loews recently
staged a work stoppage to protest working conditions, and they
point to the situation of workers such as Favian Gonzalez as proof
that Loews workers need union benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, a 29-year-old lobby bar waiter, said he was, until
recently, working as a banquet hall waiter for 12 to 14 hours a
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't know if I was going to eat or not,'' he said.
``We literally had to hide in corners and eat something real
quick.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a stunning victory for the Clinton
administration and corporate America, the House on Wednesday swept
aside economic restrictions on China that were part of
anti-Communist policy for over a quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   By a surprisingly wide margin of 237-197, lawmakers granted
Beijing permanent normal trading privileges after months of fierce
lobbying that pitted business against organized labor. A
larger-than-expected Republican majority delivered President
Clinton's top remaining legislative priority: three out of four
Republicans voted in favor, while two out of three Democrats voted
against.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote virtually assures the end of the annual review
of China's trade status, a ritual for 20 years that Beijing
considers humiliating but opponents say maintains leverage over
improving human rights. Congress has approved the trade status
every year. The Senate is expected to endorse the permanent measure
as early as next month, but may question some of the amendments the
House added to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   In his waning days in office, Clinton threw the powers of the
presidency behind passing what he considers a crowning foreign
policy triumph. He met with more than 100 lawmakers face-to-face or
in groups, sometimes on Air Force One, telephoned scores more and
traveled to congressional districts in the Midwest and California
to rally support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House of Representatives has taken an historic step toward
continued prosperity in America, reform in China and peace in the
world,'' Clinton said in a Rose Garden ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee who has many times voiced support for the
legislation, also hailed Wednesday's House action. ``Passage of
this legislation will mean a stronger American economy, as well as
more opportunity for liberty and freedom in China,'' Bush said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who has walked a political tightrope
between his labor allies and Clinton, also voiced support on
Wednesday for the bill, but qualified it by saying that more had to
be done to guarantee workers' rights. ``We must continue our
efforts to assure that workers will succeed in a global economy,''
he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   American companies and farmers _ from Internet moguls in Silicon
Valley to orange growers in Florida _ sought permanent trade ties
to benefit fully from an accord that Washington and Beijing
negotiated last November. The agreement slashes tariffs on a wide
range of farm and industrial products and removes some barriers to
service providers, such as banks and telecommunications companies.
The agreement paved the way for China to enter the World Trade
Organization, the 135-member trade group that sets the rules for
global commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Wednesday's vote, China will enter the
international trade club. But without the blessing of Congress,
Beijing could withhold some trade benefits from the United States
that it extends to other WTO members. A coalition of labor unions,
religious groups, environmentalists and veterans organizations
waged a furious campaign to deny Beijing this trade plum, arguing
that it wrongly rewarded a Communist government that threatens its
neighbors, represses its citizens and thumbs its nose at the rule
of law.
</P>
<P>
   Unions have also voiced fears that passage would encourage
American companies to move high-paying industrial jobs to China.
</P>
<P>
   A frantic final round of lobbying, including some horse-trading
on home-district issues that have little to do with China, corraled
enough undecided members on Tuesday to put the measure just over
the top. When debate resumed on Wednesday morning, opponents
privately conceded defeat and what 24 hours earlier looked like a
cliffhanger turned into a solid victory after four hours of largely
pro-forma debate.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the agreement would open China's vast commercial
market to American business. ``For America, this agreement is a
one-way street,'' said Rep. Thomas M. Davis III, R-Va. ``Our
markets are already open to China. What this does for the first
time is make China's markets more accessible to American companies
and American products.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert said: ``More trade will expose the
Chinese people to powerful new ideas. Thanks to the American
business presence in China, thousands of Chinese employees already
have access to foreign newspapers, the Internet and to worldwide
e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents urged Congress not to sacrifice its annual vote, and
criticized this measure as one that would undercut America's moral
authority in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must stand up for human rights and democracy throughout the
world,'' said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. ``We have a chance to vote for
the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., said, ``Today China is locking
people up and torturing them, big time.''
</P>
<P>
   During the long run-up to Wednesday's vote, Clinton repeatedly
argued that the trade measure was more about national security than
economic gain. He argued that rejection of permanent trade ties
would undercut China's reformers and remove the one firm pillar of
bilateral relations, potentially leaving the world's leading
democracy and the most populous country on a global collision
course.
</P>
<P>
   But the real fight from the corridors of Congress to labor halls
and chambers of commerce nationwide cast the lobbying and
advertising muscle of corporate America and farming groups against
of a fervent grass-roots coalition of organized labor, human rights
groups, veterans organizations and religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, two
leading business groups, spent close to $10 million dollars on ads
_ their largest-ever campaign for a single legislative issue _ and
assigned waves of lobbyists to buttonhole lawmakers. Even labor
lobbyists admitted that business had stolen a page from their
playbook by turning out their employees and managers, not just
senior executives, to lobby members.

AIR TRAFFIC TAPES FROM ALASKA FLIGHT 261 CAPTURE DRAMATIC
STRUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The last radio transmission from the pilots of Alaska
Airlines Flight 261 to air traffic controllers was a calm ``thank
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then controllers heard only chilling reports from pilots of
other planes who watched the Alaska jet make a horrifying, inverted
dive into the Pacific Ocean from 17,900 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That plane has just started to do a huge plunge,'' the pilot
of a corporate jet flying in the same area radioed controllers at
4:19:39 p.m., according to air traffic control tapes released
Wednesday in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute later, he added: ``Plane's inverted, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by this transmission from the crew of a Sky
West jet at 4:20:59 p.m.:
</P>
<P>
   ``He, ah, hit the water, he's down.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the Federal Aviation Administration made
public a transcript of the taped conversations between the doomed
jet and air traffic controllers that began soon after Flight 261
took off from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to Seattle, with a scheduled
stop in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   All 88 people aboard the MD-83 jetliner, including about 50 from
Washington state, died in the Jan. 31 crash off the California
coast.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes confirmed much of what is already known about the
accident from briefings by the National Transportation Safety
Board. But the pilots words captured their dramatic struggle as
they repeatedly lost and then regained control of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Before the tapes were released, the safety board mailed a
transcript to the families of crash victims.
</P>
<P>
   The two pilots of Flight 261, Capt. Ted Thompson, 53, and First
Officer William Tansky, 57, were not identified on the air traffic
control tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Their first report of a problem came at 4:09:55 p.m., some 11
minutes before the crash. Air traffic control had earlier cleared
the jet to maintain its cruising altitude of 31,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Center, Alaska 261, we are, uh, in a dive here,'' one of the
crew told controllers.
</P>
<P>
   The control center asked Flight 261 to repeat the transmission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we're out of 26,000 feet, we're in a vertical dive _ not
a dive yet _ but, uh, we've lost vertical control of our
airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant the jet had already plunged a mile from its assigned
altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 was falling at 7,000 feet per minute, more than three
times the normal rate of descent for a commercial aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who listened to the tape said the pilot who made the
call to controllers sounded winded, underscoring the effort it was
taking to control the jet.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts have said both pilots may have been pulling
back as hard as they could on their control columns to recover the
plane from its initial dive when the stabilizer jammed.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer is the winglike piece on top of the MD-83 tail
that is moved up or down _ ``trimmed'' _ to help keep the plane
stable. A jetliner's nose has a tendency to pitch up or down in
flight because of the aerodynamics of the wings.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder on Flight 261 that was recovered after
the crash showed the stabilizer jammed in the full up position,
which pushed the nose down and caused the jet to suddenly dive.
Flight 261 had plunged to about 23,700 before the crew radioed
controllers they had regained some control.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... we've got it back under control there,'' one of the
pilots said. But a second or two later, he added, ``No we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   At 4:15:19 p.m., the crew radioed they would attempt to make an
emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport. The jet was
at 22,500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A., Alaska 261, uh, we're with you, we're at
twenty-two-five, we have a jammed stabilizer and we're maintaining
altitude with difficulty, uh, but, uh, we can maintain altitude we
think and our intention is to land at Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   The control tower asked the crew what they wanted to do. The
crew said they wanted to descend to about 10,000 feet and remain
over the water when they put the flaps down for landing (change
configuration).
</P>
<P>
   ``Center, Alaska 261, I need to, uh, get down about ten, change
my configuration, make sure I can control the jet and I'd like to
do that out here over the bay if I may.''
</P>
<P>
   After the jet was cleared down to 17,000 feet, the crew made the
final transmission to controllers. It was 4:17 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' one of the pilots said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hall, chairman of the safety board, previously said that
when the plane was at about 18,000 feet, ``things began to happen
very quickly.'' The jet was flying at 270 knots, with its nose
pitched down 2.7 degrees and the stabilizer in the full nose-down
trim position.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the pilots extended the flaps to 11 degrees.
(Flaps are extended for landing to provide more lift.)
</P>
<P>
   Four seconds after the beginning of the flap deployment, Hall
said, the plane began to fall out of control. Its nose pitched down
at 26 degrees a second, eventually reaching 70 degrees. The plane
experienced a negative force of 3 ``G's,'' or three times the force
of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 rolled into an inverted dive and plunged into the
ocean in about a minute. The air traffic control tapes captured
that final dive from the perspective of several pilots in planes
flying in the area.
</P>
<P>
   After the pilot of the corporate jet radioed that the Alaska
plane had just started to make a ``big, huge plunge,'' the pilot of
the Sky West jet radioed that Flight 261 was ``nose down'' and
``descending quite rapidly, definitely out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   A Navy air controller at the Point Mugu, Calif., Naval Air
Weapons Center, watched on his radar as the jet plunged into the
ocean. His voice is also heard on the tapes, calling out the jet's
altitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at 7,600 feet ... He's at 5,700 (feet) right now 4,600.''
</P>
<P>
   The jet hit the water a few miles off Point Mugu some 11 minutes
after the crew had first reported the initial dive.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the FAA nor the safety board would comment on the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska posted an employee notice on its Web site that the tapes
were being released.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this information is very personal to all of us, the
ongoing National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the
accident inhibits what we and others can say so it would be
inappropriate at this time ... to comment on the tapes or
transcripts,'' Alaska said in the notice.
</P>
<P>
   It warned ``there will be a high level of coverage and the tapes
are likely to be played repeatedly. The coverage may be cold and
factual or sensational. But it will have great meaning for the
families of all of those lost and for all of us here at Alaska
Airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the safety board probe into the cause of the
crash, Alaska Airlines is the subject of a federal criminal
investigation of its maintenance practices.
</P>
<P>
   Questions also have been raised by investigators about
maintenance work done on the jackscrew mechanism that controlled
the movement of the stabilizer on the plane that crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The jackscrew is located inside the 40-foot long stabilizer and
runs up and down through a large fixed gimbal nut. Hall has said no
grease was found on the operational part of the jackscrew, although
Alaska claims pictures of the jackscrew show there was grease on
it.
</P>
<P>
   The threads of the nut were found stripped, and metal shreds of
the same material were found on the 22-inch-long jackscrew
recovered from the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder suggests that the problem with the
stabilizer started early in the flight, but was not considered
serious enough for the pilots to land the plane. The stabilizer
apparently would only move in one direction _ one that caused the
plane's nose to want to pitch down. The pilots would have had to
counter this using the elevators that are attached to the rear of
the stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   It is not all that unusual for a modern-day commercial jetliner
to experience minor stabilizer problems during flight.
</P>
<P>
   But on Flight 261, the problem turned deadly serious when the
stabilzier jammed in the full nose-down position.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts say the final dive from which the pilots did
not recover may have been caused when the jammed jackscrew ran
suddenly through mechanical stops and the stabilizer deflected to
an extreme position.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board is expected to hold its initial hearing into
the cause of the crash later this year. That hearing may be held on
the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   A transcript of what can be heard on the jet's cockpit voice
recorder is likely to be released at that hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The board is prohibited by law from releasing the tape from a
cockpit voice recorder. In the case of Flight 261, the cockpit
voice recorder captured the final 30 minutes of conversations
between Capt. Thompson and First Officer Tansky.
</P>
<P>
   The board also has not yet released tapes of conversations the
two pilots had with Alaska personnel on the ground in Seattle and
in Los Angeles as they tried to troubleshoot the stabilizer
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they had already radioed their thanks to
controllers, Thompson and Tansky were still talking to an Alaska
mechanic when their jet made its final, inverted dive toward the
Pacific.

A NORTH CAROLINA TOWN PROSPERS AS THE VALHALLA OF NASCAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Texas, Nev., Calif., Ill., Kan., N.C., Va., Ind.,
Mich., Wis.)   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOORESVILLE, N.C. _ Nothing about the reflecting glass exterior
of DEI Inc. offers a clue that inside is an exalted garage built to
harvest the fastest 720-horsepower beasts in stock car racing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet starstruck pilgrims in shorts and T shirts know this
Brobdignagian race shop with unexpectedly elegant touches was built
by Dale Earnhardt, stock car racing's all-time money-winner, and
that once past its doors, homage is paid to the deities of speed.
</P>
<P>
   They arrive in cars, vans and motor homes to gaze at a complex
created by Earnhardt and his wife, Teresa for their three drivers _
including Dale Jr., who has won three Winston Cup races this year _
and to tour the 8,000 square feet devoted to a showroom and gift
shop brimming with souvenirs like Earnhardt caps, Earnhardt robes
and Earnhardt Monopoly games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my temple,'' Nick Smith, a carpet layer from Newburgh,
Ind., said last week, raising his arms to the ceiling of the $15
million racing shop dubbed the ``Garage Mahal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my friends came here last year and said, `You
definitely have to come here,''' Smith said. ``I've been a fan for
15 or 16 years. He's just Earnhardt. `The Intimidator.' He's the
man.''
</P>
<P>
   The splendor Earnhardt has created would be unrecognizable to
past drivers for Nascar, or the National Association for Stock Car
Auto Racing, like Earnhardt's father, Ralph, Junior Johnson and
Fireball Roberts. But so would nearly all the other one-
and-two-story racing shops in Mooresville.
</P>
<P>
   As auto racing heads into its biggest weekend of the year _ with
not only the Indianapolis 500 taking place on Sunday, but Nascar's
Coca-Cola 600 at nearby Lowe's Motor Speedway as well _ tens of
thousands of fans will converge on what has become home to the
nation's largest cluster of Nascar race shops.
</P>
<P>
   The passing of the grease monkey image here in the booming
suburbs north of Charlotte mirrors Nascar's growth into a
juggernaut with total revenues of $1.56 billion this year,
according to Paul Kagan Associates, the media research firm.
</P>
<P>
   That includes sponsors paying millions of dollars to tack their
names on cars and races, retail sales of more than $1 billion in
licensed merchandise and new TV deals worth $400 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Tracks in Florida, Texas, Nevada and California opened recently
to exploit Nascar's popularity. New speedways near Chicago and
Kansas City will open next year, while speculation continues that a
track may be built in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Everything in Nascar starts with four-speed Chevy Monte Carlos,
Ford Tauruses and Pontiac Grand Prix that are assembled, filleted,
reassembled, engineered, tested, painted and covered with logos at
shops like Earnhardt's.
</P>
<P>
   The shops, including those not associated with Nascar, employ
1,444 workers in Mooresville, more than any other local industry.
This former textile mill town saw its last plant, one that made
denim for Burlington Industries, close last summer.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Mooresville had reinvented itself as ``Race City USA,''
because of the 24 Nascar race shops that fabricate vehicles for 32
drivers on Nascar's Winston Cup, Busch Grand National and Craftsman
Truck circuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the mills died, the shops gave Mooresville the identity it
needed and an economic engine for growth,'' said Jack Cathey, an
accounting professor at the University of North Carolina at
Charlotte, who publishes an annual Zagat-like guide and rating
service for Nascar shops.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Mooresville believed that tourists would come to the town
of 18,000 to vacation on Lake Norman. ``Everybody thought that was
the attraction of the future,'' said Dan Wallace, executive
director of the Mooresville/South Iredell Chamber of Commerce.
``Then came the racing business. Who knew?''
</P>
<P>
   The town and county have never offered tax or financial
incentives to lure the race shops to Mooresvile. They just kept
coming.
</P>
<P>
   The concentration of shops has made it common to see families
and tour groups enter Lakeside Business Park (make a left at the
Chick-Fil-A on Highway 150) to make the rounds of 12 Nascar race
shops, another dozen shops unrelated to Nascar, and the North
Carolina Auto Racing Hall of Fame. Tourism soars in the days before
the Winston Cup races at Lowe's Motor Speedway, 15 minutes away in
Concord, N.C.: the Coca-Cola 600, which takes place Sunday night,
The Winston, which was run last Saturday and the UAW-GM Quality 500
in October.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance concerns persuaded all but a few shops from offering
behind-the-scene tours, where visitors could see a dozen or more
cars per driver in various stages of construction. Tourists are
left to admire cars from behind viewing windows or they get only as
close as a lobby with souvenirs and race-used cars.
</P>
<P>
   Everett Brooks was examining one of Ricky Rudd's (NU)28
Texaco/Havoline Fords last week at Robert Yates Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a fascination,'' said Brooks, a retired machine shop
supervisor from Petersburg, Va., who was making the rounds of shops
for the first time in three years. ``I like to see what's new. It's
unbelievable. Half the shops that are here now weren't here then.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, who owned the shop before selling it to Yates last year to
refocus on racing, said his one regret in designing the shop in
1994 was not offering fans a viewing window. ``In hindsight, I
would have let them look in,'' he said. Next door, fans quietly
watched Roush Racing mechanics tend to Mark Martin's and Jeff
Burton's Fords for The Winston.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Dale Earnhardt Jr. won the $500,000 prize for first
place, a pedestrian walkway outside Lowe's Motor Speedway
collapsed, injuring more than 100 people leaving the 175,000-seat
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fans who journeyed here for the race was Tom Bowen, a
construction worker from Battle Creek, Mich., on a Nascar holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared with seeing these cars on TV, this is the only chance
to see them up close,'' said Bowen, wearing a Dale Earnhardt Jr. T
shirt. ``Being this close to things I've seen all my life is
amazing. My father raced `55 Chevys and he hated Dale Earnhardt.
But he's getting old now.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Lakeside rejected two owners of race shops
who wanted to relocate to the hilly business park. ``We were
unfamiliar with racing and thought they'd be dirty, with wrecked
cars out front,'' said Cecile Ebert, the park's general manager.
``Turns out you can eat off the floor of these garages.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebert now comprehends the full meaning of Nascar: 60 percent of
Lakeside's 170 businesses are racing related. Even if nearby
Concord is offering incentives for shops to relocate, she's certain
teams will stay in Mooresville for its low-key lifestyle and its
proximity to interstate highways, airports and Lowe's Motor
Speedway and other southeastern tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Said Rudd, ``I live on the lake 7 miles away, so when I was
looking to build a shop, I wanted to be nearby. And my wife has a
knack for real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Felix Sabates Jr., whose Team Sabco is led by the Winston Cup
drivers Sterling Marlin and Kenny Irwin, said Mooresville's shops
are too crucial to the local economy to lose to rival cities like
Concord.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iredell County won't let them take anybody away,'' said
Sabates, who has more than doubled the size of his complex since
moving to Lakeside in 1995. ``Our first shop could have fit in
here,'' he added, gesturing from behind a massive desk to his
massive second-floor office.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Berken, a carpenter from Fox Valley, Wis., walked
respectfully through the trophy room of Penske Racing South, Rusty
Wallace's shop, which lets fans peer into the working garage. ``I
took three days off to see the shops and go to the race,'' he said.
``This is as close as we've ever gotten to the cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Berken, who lives near Green Bay, is a Packers' fan. ``They'd
never let you this close to a practice field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The behemoth of Mooresville is Earnhardt's elegant
176,000-square-foot complex. He doesn't drive for DEI _ racing
instead for Richard Childress, out of Welcome, N.C. _ but he is the
undisputed icon here, a regular presence to employees, occasional
visitors and fans admiring his and his drivers' trophies, their
race-winning cars and his knife and boat collections.
</P>
<P>
   DEI has a dining room that resembles a gentleman's club, red
velvet elevator walls, cream-colored carpeting and an array of
ceilings with reflective tiles, gold medallions and polished wood.
``That comes from my wife's experience as an interior decorator,''
Earnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can also watch a loop of his TV commercials or buy his
leather jackets, diecast miniatures of his (NU)3 GM Goodwrench
Chevrolet, backpacks and energy bars.

<P>
   But he will not permit fans to view the mechanics at work.
``These guys work hard, and to have interruptions is no good,'' he
said. ``They're doing a job and they have business to do. I didn't
build this to give tours.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every race team can afford a $15 million shop. MB2, which
owns Kenny Schrader's M&AMP;M's Pontiac, is in a hangar-like shop too
cramped for its production needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building doesn't make you go faster,'' said Jay Frye, the
general manager of MB2, which is contemplating a new, larger home
in nearby Concord. ``So we don't use our building as an excuse. We
see a lot of great buildings and when you look at the points
standings, we're higher.''

 &HT;    Al-Amin attorneys probe mystery
 &HT;    By Joshua B. Good
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Could there be another suspect in the slaying of
Fulton Deputy Ricky Kinchen?
</P>
<P>
   A sheriff's dispatch tape from the night Kinchen and his partner
Aldranon English were shot reveals fellow deputies searched for a
wounded gunman and surrounded an abandoned house in Atlanta's West
End where blood was found.
</P>
<P>
   English thought he shot his assailant. And minutes after the
shooting, a man was seen bleeding and begging for a ride five
blocks from the shooting scene, recently released Atlanta police
records show.
</P>
<P>
   The only person charged in the case is Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin,
formerly known as H. Rap Brown. Federal agents caught him in
Alabama four days after the shooting. Al-Amin had not been shot and
had no wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin says he's innocent, and the case is a government
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancies are certain to be exploited by Jack Martin and
Bruce Harvey, Al-Amin's defense attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Martin filed a motion seeking any police evidence of
another person at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is looking for the dispatch tape, reports about the blood
and any evidence about anyone wounded in West End the night of
March 16.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, one 911 caller reported an injured man on
Westview. ``Caller advises perp in a vacant building on Westview
bleeding begging for a ride,'' a dispatcher typed into the log of
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Police have not released further details about the bleeding man
or the 911 caller.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic tape of Fulton County Sheriff's Department radio
traffic is filled with discrepancies from deputies who showed up
after the shooting was over. Most important, the tape records the
account of the state's best witness _ English.
</P>
<P>
   On the recording, the night starts out routinely. English asks a
dispatcher to find out who a car is registered to. The car, which
doesn't appear to be connected to the shooting, was parked on Oak
Street in front of Al-Amin's grocery store. English and Kinchen
were there to arrest Al-Amin on a warrant from Cobb County.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, English comes back on the radio screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officer down! Officer down! 63! Officer Down! Officer Down!
Officer Down! 63!,'' he shouts, breathing heavily as six shots are
heard.
</P>
<P>
   The number 63 is the signal for officer down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unit. Advise your unit number,'' the dispatcher says.
</P>
<P>
   ``82! 82! Radio. 82!,'' English yells as four more shots ring
out. ``At Oak Street. 1182 Oak Street. 1128 Oak Street. Radio. I've
been shot. Officer down.''
</P>
<P>
   A deputy who is not on the scene but hears English's call for
help comes on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you advise a location?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   English says: ``1182. 1182. I've been shot. 1182 Oak Street.
Officer down. 1182 Oak Street, West End. Off of West End Place.''
</P>
<P>
   Before help arrives, English tells the dispatcher that the
shooter drove away in a black Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   Separate ambulances took English and Kinchen to Grady Memorial
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies who arrive on the scene begin to search for the
shooter. It's chaotic. Several deputies try to talk on the radio at
the same time. They give conflicting reports of where the shooter
might be. Some say he is in a car; others say he is on foot. One
report mentions the possibility of a man with an M-16 rifle in a
trench coat behind the nearby video store.
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta officer finds blood drops around an abandoned house
at 1180 Eggleston St. Police surround the house. The SWAT team goes
inside, but no gunman is found.
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen died the next day. He had been shot by a .223-caliber
rifle and a 9mm handgun.
</P>
<P>
   In the hospital, English looked at a group of photographs of men
and identified Al-Amin as the shooter.
</P>
<P>
   A rifle and handgun were found in the woods where Al-Amin was
arrested in White Hall, Ala. Tests showed they were the same guns
used to shoot Kinchen, according to the FBI. Al-Amin's shot-up
black Mercedes was also found in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution, defense attorneys and police would comment
about the the possibility of another suspect, citing a court order.
</P>
<P>
   But Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter said it is
not unusual to have different versions of what happened in a
violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Porter prosecuted Byron Fleming, who was convicted of killing
Gwinnett County Deputy Ken Wimberly, though three witnesses gave
varying accounts of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to sift through lots of evidence to reach a coherent
version of what happened out there,'' Porter said of Fulton County
prosecutors. ``That's what a prosecutor's job is.''
</P>
<P>
   Who was the closest to the action? Who is more credible? How was
Kinchen shot? Who does the blood match?
</P>
<P>
   Porter said those are all questions the prosecution will try to
answer.

JASPER JOHNS CAN STILL HIT THE TARGET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW MARTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is always heartening to realize that, at least occasionally,
our youth-obsessed culture still can be stopped dead in its tracks
by an old-guard artistic presence.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper Johns is just the artist to make even the most callow of
culture's young arbiters take notice. The title of the Dallas
Museum of Art's new exhibit, ``Jasper Johns: New Paintings and
Works on Paper,'' delivers the news flash that the 69-year-old
Johns has emerged from a noticeable absence with fresh work. The
dozen paintings, drawings and prints in the exhibit are hardly an
overwhelming canon, but they do allow one to explore the new vistas
Johns has chosen and to become reacquainted with his distinctive
style.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to absorb the full impact of this exhibition requires
a bit of history. As one of the great levers in abstract
expressionism's move toward pop art, Johns developed a distinctive
iconographic style during the 1950s, when his target and flag
motifs became legendary. In a series of influential works during
that period, he called upon assertive tints of orange and cobalt
blue _ and used wooden stretchers as striking appendages to his
canvases _ to brand his work on the collective memory.
</P>
<P>
   Johns secured his influential place in 20th-century American art
by using a highly personal, quasipsychological take on the everyday
as a guiding theme. By adopting definite symbols such as numbers or
the flag, Johns persevered in his representational style while the
entire American art movement was consumed with abstract
expressionism and that school's steadfast avoidance of identifiable
objects.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces in this DMA exhibition not only echo but expand on
Johns' early command of boisterous color and his unusual flair for
using wood and string. ``Bridge'' (1997) immediately sets the tone
for the exhibit with its cluster of harlequinlike diamond shapes
filled with pastel colors on one border, and a piece of string
draped across the canvas, a lithe ``bridge'' defying gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Untitled (Halloween)'' (1998) shifts the focus but keeps
certain aesthetic ingredients intact. The harlequin shapes have
been expanded to include triangles and pentagons as their colors
become muddier. A naively traced Big Dipper is reprised as well, a
constellation ally to Johns' ever-present string bridge.
</P>
<P>
   What the string traverses, and the harlequin shades revitalize,
is a Johns canvas that is an expanse colored a dark pewter. It is
the lugubrious tint of sea fog, creating a soupy opaqueness found
most often in the mist hanging over a New England fishing village
at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Catenary'' (1998) lacks Johns' leavening use of
jester colors, the work's pond-algae tone represents a welcome
shift in hue. In fact, the thickness of Johns' application of paint
on this and the other works in his ``Catenary'' series call to mind
the aquatic rippling one perceives in Monet's ``Waterlilies.''
</P>
<P>
   As if Johns understood that the thematic territory he was plying
needed some shaking up, his ``Untitled'' (1999) brings a welcome
contrast. While keeping the motifs of string and diamonds, Johns
has pushed his palette toward a softer lilac hue. And he has made
the jarring inclusion of a lime-green, prison-barred window in one
corner balanced by a sepia-toned family portrait in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, in this new exhibit, Johns' confidence in his craft has
reached such a zenith that the ultimate in representational art _ a
family photo _ does not diminish the dexterity of his abstraction. &QL;

GORE'S SECOND THOUGHTS ON STOCK INVESTMENTS
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday that the
stock market was an attractive place for Americans to invest over
the long run, but that it was the wrong place to seek a solution to
Social Security's problems.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gore reiterated his strong opposition to Gov.
George W. Bush's proposal to allow people to invest part of their
Social Security taxes on Wall Street. And he defended his own
decision to back away from his early support for allowing the
government itself to invest in stocks on Social Security's behalf,
citing problems created by having the government as a major
shareholder of a company.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, the market has not generated returns as
consistently strong as he had once assumed it would.
</P>
<P>
   ``The learning experience that we went through convinced all of
us that it was a bad idea,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing the evolution of his thinking about Social Security and
the financial markets, Gore said that he had kept an open mind to
many possible solutions to the retirement system's problems when
the Clinton administration first began examining the issue in
earnest a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the administration proposed a plan, backed by Gore,
under which the government would begin channeling hundreds of
billions of dollars in additional money into Social Security out of
general tax revenues starting in 2011. Under the plan, half of the
new money going to Social Security would be invested by the
government in stocks, up to a maximum of 15 percent of Social
Security's total reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The administration dropped the plan last year in the face of
intense opposition from Republicans, revived it in its budget
proposal early this year, then dropped it again as it became clear
that Social Security would be one of the most heatedly debated
issues of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has sought to use Gore's on-again, off-again
support for government investment in the stock market to undermine
the vice president's assertions that Social Security benefits
should not be dependent on Wall Street. And Bush's aides said
Gore's reversal on the issue suggested that he was prepared to
sacrifice principles to make a short-term political point.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing sense that Al Gore has never had a
conviction which he could not easily change,'' said Ari Fleischer,
Bush's spokesman. ``He was clearly on record as advocating and
supporting government investment in the market. Now he's walking
away from something he advocated as recently as 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers to Gore said the vice president had dropped his
support for government investment in part to make it easier for him
to attack Bush's approach.
</P>
<P>
   But in the interview, on the porch of his home on the grounds of
the Naval Observatory, Gore sought to play down the degree to which
he had supported the concept, and said that in any case he had
changed his mind as he learned more about the tradeoffs it would
require.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he had been swayed in part by criticism of the idea
from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Greenspan
opposed the plan on the grounds that politicians would not be able
to resist using the government's role as a shareholder to favor or
punish certain industries or to meddle in corporate decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnitude of the government's stock ownership would be
such that it would at least raise the question of whether or not we
had begun to change the fundamental nature of our economy,'' Gore
said. ``Upon reflection, it seemed to me that those problems were
quite serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gore said, he became convinced that Wall Street's ups
and downs were large enough to create a risk that the government
might be making a bad investment. During long stretches, including
one from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, Wall Street was by no
means the one-way bet it has often been viewed as in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore receives income from some stock technically owned
by his mother, he owns no stock, and has never actively invested in
the market. He said he had chosen to stay out of the market when he
first was elected to Congress in 1976 to avoid any conflicts of
interest, not out of fear of risk, and that he supported a variety
of proposals to promote savings and investment.
</P>
<P>
   But he said investment in the markets should ``come on top of
Social Security,'' rather than as a replacement for it. And he said
that Bush's economic policies, including his big tax cut and his
need to use much of the Social Security surplus to pay for the
creation of private accounts, would undermine the fiscal discipline
that helped propel the markets upward in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's approach ``contains the seeds of its own destruction by
virtually guaranteeing a weaker economy, and thus, you would
expect, a weaker market, with lower returns than what we've seen in
these boom years,'' Gore said.

 &HT;    FOR CHINESE CITIZENS, HOUSE BILL'S PASSAGE WILL IMPROVE
U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS
 &HT;    With CHINA-TRADE-0525.

<P>
   BEIJING _ Ordinary Chinese citizens say they know China has
human rights problems, but they're sure glad that from now on they
won't have to hear about them every year from American politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing,'' said Chi Lianhua, 35, who works at an
insurance company, ``for such a big country to always be criticized
and have others playing the cop. We always feel like we're
inferior.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House of Representatives vote Wednesday to approve a
landmark trade bill with China restores normal trade ties with the
world's most populous country, and ends the annual debate in
Congress over human rights and just about everything else in China.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese government had not commented on the House bill's passage
as of Wednesday night (EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the economic implications, many Chinese citizens see the
vote as a sign that the United States will finally treat the
relationship between the two countries _ which has fluctuated
dramatically for at least a decade _ as one of two equals rather
than that of a parent scolding or rewarding a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, America wasn't too friendly to China,'' said Shi
Yue, a 23-year-old bank employee. ``When it persists in pushing
human rights, that limits progress in other areas. (Passage of the
trade bill) means definite improvement in China-U.S. relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress' annual review of China's trade status has been loud
and contentious since 1989, when the Chinese government opened fire
on democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen Square. That yearly debate
``held all other issues hostage,'' said a China scholar, while
politicians and interest groups battled it out over China's
treatment of everything from dissidents and workers to religious
groups and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``That rhetoric fueled tension in the relationship that
exaggerated all problems and contributed to oscillations,'' said
Mary Brown Bullock, who has been studying China for 30 years and is
a member of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations.
``Passage (of the trade bill) will stabilize U.S.-China relations
in a way it has not been stable for at least 12 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The next 10 years you'll be forging a relationship between a
more mature China and the United States ... a less paternalistic
relationship,'' added Bullock, also president of Agnes Scott
College in Atlanta, and now in Beijing on one of her annual visits.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese citizens interviewed in Beijing say they see the annul
debate as anti-China forces trying to restrict China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just politicians playing games,'' said Yang Min, who
works at a British petroleum company. ``Their main issue is not
trade. Now they will lose their bargaining counter for pressuring
China.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill, which is expected to easily win Senate approval,
will permanently guarantee Chinese goods the same low-tariff access
to U.S. markets as products from nearly every other nation.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, its passage was also part of a trade
agreement reached between the two countries last November, in which
China agreed to open its market to a wide range of products in
order to gain entry into the World Trade Organization. After
Wednesday's vote, U.S. businesses will be able to take advantage of
the concessions _ including elimination of trade barriers on
everything from agriculture to semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies in China were predictably elated and relieved by
the vote, which came early Thursday morning (Beijing time). United
Parcel Service expects American companies will ship a lot more
things like computers and telecommunications and medical equipment
to China, and it hopes UPS will be the carrier of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be more high-value products to ship to
China,'' said Stephen Monaghan, UPS spokesman for the Asia-Pacific
region. ``I think that's going to have a direct impact on the trade
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a Chinese labor activist feared that elimination of the
annual review of China's trade status will remove pressure on the
Chinese government _ as U.S. labor unions and other interest groups
have argued _ but not on U.S. companies running sweatshops in
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an encouragement for them to keep doing bad
things ... and exploiting Chinese workers,'' said Han Dongfang,
arrested after the 1989 protests for organizing workers and now
living in exile in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton and others have argued that only by
engaging China and urging it to open economically can other reforms
follow, such as allowing workers to organize unions.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Chinese, Chi, the insurance company employee,
acknowledges China needs reform in many areas but doesn't like
other countries telling it what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if we won't care about it if other countries don't
press us on it,'' she said. ``Besides, human rights is just a
slogan for them.''

in a way it has not been stable for at least 12 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The next 10 years you'll be forging a relationship between a
more mature China and the United States ... a less paternalistic
relationship,'' added Bullock, also president of Agnes Scott
College in Atlanta, and now in Beijing on one of her annual visits.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese citizens interviewed in Beijing say they see the annul
debate as anti-China forces trying to restrict China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just politicians playing games,'' said Yang Min, who
works at a British petroleum company. ``Their main issue is not
trade. Now they will lose their bargaining counter for pressuring
China.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill, which is expected to easily win Senate approval,
will permanently guarantee Chinese goods the same low-tariff access
to U.S. markets as products from nearly every other nation.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, its passage was also part of a trade
agreement reached between the two countries last November, in which
China agreed to open its market to a wide range of products in
order to gain entry into the World Trade Organization. After
Wednesday's vote, U.S. businesses will be able to take advantage of
the concessions _ including elimination of trade barriers on
everything from agriculture to semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies in China were predictably elated and relieved by
the vote, which came early Thursday morning (Beijing time). United
Parcel Service expects American companies will ship a lot more
things like computers and telecommunications and medical equipment
to China, and it hopes UPS will be the carrier of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be more high-value products to ship to
China,'' said Stephen Monaghan, UPS spokesman for the Asia-Pacific
region. ``I think that's going to have a direct impact on the trade
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a Chinese labor activist feared that elimination of the
annual review of China's trade status will remove pressure on the
Chinese government _ as U.S. labor unions and other interest groups
have argued _ but not on U.S. companies running sweatshops in
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an encouragement for them to keep doing bad
things ... and exploiting Chinese workers,'' said Han Dongfang,
arrested after the 1989 protests for organizing workers and now
living in exile in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton and others have argued that only by
engaging China and urging it to open economically can other reforms
follow, such as allowing workers to organize unions.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Chinese, Chi, the insurance company employee,
acknowledges China needs reform in many areas but doesn't like
other countries telling it what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if we won't care about it if other countries don't
press us on it,'' she said. ``Besides, human rights is just a
slogan for them.''

A QUANDARY ON GENERIC AUTO PARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do the use of generic parts in auto repairs compromise vehicle
safety?
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, an obscure Massachusetts board narrowly
concluded they do. After weeks of intense lobbying from insurance
companies and auto body shops, the board will now decide whether to
stand by its earlier vote or move in a different direction.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome could affect whether cheaper generics or more
expensive manufacturer parts are used for auto repairs in
Massachusetts and possibly lead to higher rates for insurance, by
some estimates as much as $37 a year more per vehicle. Other state
are facing a similar quandary.
</P>
<P>
   To keep insurance rates down in Massachusetts, state regulations
require the use of cheaper generics (or rebuilt or used brand-name
parts) unless a new brand-name part is available at a lower price
or the car being repaired has less than 15,000 miles on it. Generic
parts are supposed to be used only if they are ``of like kind and
quality'' to a brand-name part manufactured by the likes of Ford,
Toyota, and GM.
</P>
<P>
   Auto-body shops have long insisted that generic parts don't fit
properly and don't match the quality of manufacturer parts. But
their complaints usually were dismissed as sour grapes, since they
make more money installing the more expensive manufacturer parts.
</P>
<P>
   But concern about generics, sometimes called aftermarket parts,
intensified in the wake of a scathing Consumer Reports article last
year that suggested the parts may be unsafe, and a billion-dollar
court judgment in Illinois against State Farm Mutual Life Insurance
Co. for using inferior generics.
</P>
<P>
   After the State Farm decision, many Massachusetts automobile
insurers stopped using generic parts outside the state but kept
using them here because of the state regulation.
</P>
<P>
   With all the controversy, state Insurance Commissioner Linda
Ruthardt asked the appraiser board to investigate and report back
to her. They held a series of hearings that were packed with
officials from both sides of the debate but almost no real
consumers, since they largely are unaware of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the board voted 3-2 in favor of a motion that
stated: ``All structural aftermarket parts are not of like kind and
quality to original equipment manufacturers and therefore
aftermarket structural parts compromise the overall safety of the
vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert W. Cox Jr. is chairman of the Auto Damage Appraiser
Licensing Board, which was directed by Ruthardt to investigate the
safety of generic automobile hoods, bumpers, and fenders. Cox said
one of the things the board will have to refine is what is meant by
structural aftermarket parts. Those who support the use of generic
parts say the hoods, fenders, and bumpers in question are cosmetic
parts that don't affect the safety of a vehicle. Generic parts are
used already, with little fuss, for many other auto parts,
including brake pads, batteries, spark plugs, and other
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   If the board ends up condemning generic parts as unsafe and
Ruthardt decides to ban their use, it would mean manufacturer parts
would gain a monopoly in auto repairs. Insurers have estimated an
insurance rider requiring the use of manufacturer parts for repairs
would cost drivers an extra $37 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gillis, executive director of an organization that
certifies the quality of generic parts, said he was puzzled by the
board's initial vote. ``I don't know of anything that would have
enabled them to come to that conclusion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Colo, president of the Massachusetts Auto Body
Association, said he was surprised how strong the initial motion
was worded. But he wasn't sure what the final motion will say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're funny like that. When they reconsider, they sometimes
go the other way,'' he said.

 &HT;    Effect of United Airlines merger still up in the air
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - With its bold move to buy US Airways, United Airlines
has trumped rivals Delta and American and forced them to pursue
their own acquisitions in coming months to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   That's one widely held view of the fallout from the United-US
Airways deal, which was formally announced Wednesday by the two
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, doing nothing is not a tenable option for American
and Delta,'' said PaineWebber analyst Sam Buttrick.
</P>
<P>
   Another view is that regulatory approval is so uncertain and
airline mergers so notoriously messy that predictions of looming
consolidation are premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is approved, United is going to be screwed up for the
next three years trying to stitch it together,'' said aviation
consultant Mike Boyd of the Colorado-based Boyd Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``US Airways has high costs and labor problems,'' he said. ``By
the time the dust settles, the strategic benefits may not live up
to the hype.''
</P>
<P>
   The $11.6 billion buyout will take effect early next year _
provided it passes what is expected to be a stiff antitrust review
by the U.S. Justice Department. United is paying $60 a share for US
Airways stock, a 130 percent premium over the closing price on the
eve of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   On paper the acquisition would give United, already strong in
the West and overseas, a powerful presence up and down the East
Coast through the absorption of US Airways' routes and hubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect strategic fit for our company,'' said James
Goodwin, chairman of United parent UAL Corp.
</P>
<P>
   United's expanded route structure would put pressure on American
and Atlanta-based Delta, the No. 2 and No. 3 U.S. carriers behind
United, to broaden their own route systems or slowly lose market
clout, some analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination inexorably ... alters the tenuous balance of
power in the industry,'' Buttrick said in a report issued
Wednesday. ``There is no question this transaction, if consummated,
will drive competitive response.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed to agree. Stock in Northwest and Continental
airlines, viewed as possible takeover candidates in any round of
consolidation, rose Wednesday while shares in potential acquirers
Delta and American fell.
</P>
<P>
   But even analysts who believe consolidation is likely agree the
list of options for Delta and American is limited.
</P>
<P>
   For Delta, the most obvious move might be to rekindle its
on-again, off-again courtship of Continental. The two carriers have
complementary routes and mostly non-union work forces outside of
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   However, Continental in 1998 spurned a Delta buyout bid and
instead sold a controlling stake to Northwest as part of a
code-share alliance in which the two book passengers on each
others' flights. Northwest's partial ownership is an obstacle to
any new Delta bid.
</P>
<P>
   Continental management has expressed interest in buying back the
stake, but Buttrick said Northwest is unlikely to sell unless it
has an alternative deal _ such as a buyout offer from American.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta spokesman declined comment Wednesday, other than to say
the carrier's reciprocal frequent flier awards program with United
remains in place.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Delta pilots union said he expects
management will be looking at all the options.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top six airlines have been in a sort of delicate balance
of power for the past few years, and this appears to tip it,'' said
Andy Deane of the Air Line Pilots Association. ``We think it
increases the likelihood'' Delta management will attempt an
acquisition in coming months, Deane added.
</P>
<P>
   Third-tier major carriers Alaska Airlines, TWA and America West
are constantly rumored as acquisition candidates but aren't
considered big enough to have a major strategic impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though it wouldn't accomplish a great deal, Delta could
certainly acquire America West to fortify its West Coast
position,'' Buttrick said.
</P>
<P>
   American, for its part, could mount a competing buyout bid for
US Airways. American would gain many of the same strategic
advantages as United and has long been viewed as a potential US
Airways acquirer.
</P>
<P>
   A competing bid by Delta for US Airways appears impractical
because the two carriers' routes overlap heavily.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertain regulatory climate may prevent hasty moves, as
Delta and American wait to gauge the Justice Department's attitude
toward consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   United and US Airways have a ``little better than 50-50 chance''
of gaining antitrust approval for their merger, said analyst Ray
Neidl of ING Barings.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department already is challenging Northwest's
partial ownership of Continental, he and other analysts noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Approval of a United-US Airways merger without significant
modifications and conditions would be inconsistent with the DOJ's
legal challenge of the Northwest-Continental structure,'' Buttrick
said.
</P>
<P>
   United and US Airways, however, went to great lengths to craft
the deal to appease regulatory concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, United has promised to sell its operations at
Washington-Reagan National Airport _ the place where it overlaps
most with US Airways _ to US Airways board member and Black
Entertainment Network founder Robert Johnson. He would use the
assets to start a new carrier, DC Air.
</P>
<P>
   In addition United has promised to freeze fares for two years,
except to match inflation or fuel price increases. It has also
promised that no US Airways workers below the executive level will
lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a try-and-see effort,'' said US Airways Group
Chairman Stephen Wolf. ``We're going to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks started last fall, when Goodwin said he approached Wolf.
US Airways, after a period of sustained profits in the late '90s,
had hit a losing streak amid higher fuel costs and intensifying
competition on the East Coast. The company's stock was down and its
major shareholder, Tiger Management, restless.
</P>
<P>
   United, which has enjoyed sustained strong profits for several
years, saw an opportunity to create what Goodwin called ``the first
truly efficient nationwide route network.''
</P>
<P>
   But airline mergers historically have been fraught with problems
ranging from operational glitches and service problems to labor
strife. US Airways itself is the product of mergers and has
suffered all those problems at various times.
</P>
<P>
   United is 55 percent employee-owned, and representatives from
the pilots and machinists unions sit on its board. Corporate bylaws
require approval of such a transaction by at least one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Dubinsky, who heads United's Air Line Pilots Association
unit, said the union has strong concerns because the airline and
the union have not reached a new contract agreement. The new
company must also take on what Dubinsky called a difficult task _
merging the US Airways pilots into the United pilot seniority list.

   House Approves Trade Bill Granting China Privileges
</P>
<P>
   By a surprisingly wide margin of 237-197, House lawmakers
granted China permanent normal trading privileges after months of
fierce lobbying that pitted business against organized labor. The
vote virtually assures the end of the annual review of China's
trade status, a ritual that Beijing considers humiliating but
opponents say maintains leverage over improving human rights. The
Senate is expected to endorse the measure as early as next month
but may question some of the amendments the House added to the
bill.

   Judge Questions Microsoft Remedy
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust case raised
serious questions about the government's plan to break up the
company, seeming to suggest that he did not think the plan went far
enough. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson rejected Microsoft's request
for months of additional hearings. While Microsoft's lawyers
pleaded with the judge not to break up the company, Bill Gates and
other company executives were painting a rosy picture of a
software-enhanced future for chief executives of some of the
world's largest companies.

   Cisco's Help Doesn't Come Cheap
</P>
<P>
   Getting a vote of confidence from Cisco Systems can be very
important to fledging technology companies. For example, Selectica,
a company that makes software to help businesses sell complex
products over the Internet was so eager to make Cisco its customer
that in a recent deal, Selectica went beyond giving Cisco its
software all the way to effectively paying Cisco to take it.

   The Fox network appointed Gail Berman as president of

months. Berman will report to Sandy Grushow, who last November was
named chairman of the Fox television entertainment group.

MARKET PLACE: CISCO'S SUPPORT IS HARDLY CHEAP 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A vote of confidence from Cisco Systems can be very important to
fledging technology companies, especially if they have initial
public offerings on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Just how important? Ask Selectica, a San Jose, Calif., company
that makes software to help businesses sell complex products over
the Internet. Selectica was so eager to make Cisco a customer that
in a recent deal, it wound up paying Cisco to take its software.
</P>
<P>
   In January, only a couple of months before its public offering,
Selectica proudly announced that its system had been chosen to run
Cisco's World Wide Web site. Cisco, currently the world's
second-largest technology company in market value, is the leading
manufacturer of Internet equipment and will sell more than $15
billion of its routers and switches over its Web site this year.
</P>
<P>
   Selectica noted that Cisco's imprimatur had come after ``a
six-month evaluation cycle and successful pilot implementation.''
The contract gave the company instant credibility with other
potential customers _ and potential investors. In the marketing of
its stock offering to institutional investors _ the ``road show'' _
Selectica executives pointed out that they had contracts with two
of the world's leading technology companies, Cisco and Dell
Computer, which will use Selectica's software on part of its Web
site, according to investors who saw the presentations.
</P>
<P>
   That support resonated with potential investors. Even those who
are very sophisticated about technology acknowledge that the
complexity of modern software leaves them generally unable to judge
the technical merits of competing products. So the verdict of
widely respected companies like Dell and Cisco is extremely
important, said Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology
Stock Letter.
</P>
<P>
   On March 10, Selectica became one of the hottest initial public
offerings of the year. It had first planned to offer its shares in
the range of $9 to $11 each, but scorching demand enabled the
underwriters to raise the offering price to $30. On Selectica's
first day of trading, the shares soared as high as $154. At that
price, Selectica was valued at more than $5 billion, 300 times its
revenue for the preceding 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something that Selectica did not disclose in its
press release announcing the software sales to Cisco. As part of
the deal, Selectica sold Cisco warrants for 800,000 shares of its
stock, a sweetener that has proved to be worth much more than the
software contract.
</P>
<P>
   Selectica's action is not without precedent. Big companies often
use their leverage to take stakes in would-be suppliers, especially
in the technology business. But these deals are usually portrayed
as partnership agreements or strategic investments, and they
usually take the form of a direct investment by the larger company.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Selectica, which disclosed the warrants in a few
sentences in its book-length registration statement, explicitly
linked the warrants to the licensing deal. ``On Jan. 7, in
connection with a license agreement, we issued a warrant to
purchase 800,000 shares of common stock to Cisco, one of our
customers, for $800,000,'' Selectica said.
</P>
<P>
   And by buying warrants instead of shares, Cisco assured itself
of gaining from any increase in Selectica's stock price without
taking on much risk, since it had effectively paid $1 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the agreement has proved lucrative for Cisco, which
will pay Selectica just $3 million this year for software and
technical support.
</P>
<P>
   The warrants, which have a strike price of $13 and can be
exercised beginning in January 2001, had a value of almost $24
million at Selectica's closing stock price of $42.625 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's gain, though, was Selectica's loss. In the quarter
ending in March, Selectica reported a loss of $18 million on
revenue of $7 million, largely because of the cost of the
warrants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, did the warrants affect Cisco's decision to choose
Selectica? Both companies say no, because Cisco would never
jeopardize its enormous Internet sales for a short-term gain of a
few million dollars. ``Cisco chose Selectica on the strength of its
technology,'' a Cisco spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   A Selectica spokeswoman said her company was chosen from a pool
of 30 competitors after a rigorous competition that lasted almost a
year. ``Anybody who really knows Cisco knows you can't buy Cisco,
especially for something that they identify as a core part of their
business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is not yet using Selectica's software to run its site.
That will not happen until at least October, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal raised eyebrows even among supportive analysts. US
Bancorp Piper Jaffray, which helped underwrite Selectica's
offering, tried to quantify the effect of the Cisco warrants, along
with other, smaller sweeteners that Selectica offered Intel, Dell
and Samsung, near the end of its first research report on the
company in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a financial impact to the warrants,'' said
Michael Marzolf, a Piper Jaffray research analyst. Still, Marzolf
said the long-run marketing benefits of winning Cisco and the other
big companies as customers would outweigh the costs of the
warrants, which he estimated at $35 million, or double Selectica's
revenue for the recent fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with traditional advertising, being able to use Cisco
as a reference is extremely effective, Marzolf added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that it isn't expensive, but I do think that it
will pay off _ that it is paying off,'' Marzolf said. ``If Cisco is
using Selectica to configure routers, 3Com looks at that and says,
`This stuff works, we're going to do this for ourselves as well.'''

ANALYSIS: ROUNDING OUT A CLEAR CLINTON LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-TRADE, CHINA-TRADE-SCENE) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With his victory Wednesday on trade with China,
Bill Clinton has finally defined his imprint on American foreign
policy: the president who cemented in place the post-cold-war
experiment of using economic engagement to foster political change
among America's neighbors and its potential adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   It is a path he chose in 1993, when 10 months into his
presidency he defied his party and pushed through the North
American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. At the same
time, he reversed course on China, despite his 1992 campaign
criticisms of his predecessor for ``coddling dictators,'' and
concluded that denying China trading rights as a weapon to change
its behavior was a policy doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, eight months from the end of his presidency _ and
with even fewer Democrats on his side _ he convinced a Congress
skeptical about trade and even more suspicious about China that
normalizing trade relations was the best bet for encouraging
political reform in the world's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   And he persuaded them that rejecting the trade bill would
bolster hard-liners in Beijing who are convinced that America's
secret agenda is to contain China's power, economically and
militarily.
</P>
<P>
   It will be years before anyone knows if the economic roll of the
dice behind Wednesday's vote, or the strategic one, will pay off.
On paper, the accord promises vast new openings for American
agricultural goods, telecommunications and Internet firms, among
others. But history suggests that as soon as China's tariffs come
down, new bureaucratic barriers will magically appear.
</P>
<P>
   As in the NAFTA debate, the economic benefits were undoubtedly
oversold. China is already at work on ways to slow the promised
influx of American competitors in its market, at least until it can
figure out what to do with the tens of millions or even hundreds of
millions of workers, mostly in state-owned industries, whose
livelihoods are threatened by the country's promise to open its
markets to the world.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Clinton prevailed because he was able to sell a
long-term vision of how America could use its economic power to
change, and perhaps undermine, the nature of one-party rule in
China. And his opponents in the floor debate _ both those who
feared the loss of American jobs and those who fear China's rising
power _ offered no real alternative, no convincing strategy of how
America would expand its presence in China or attempt to open up
its political system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was never a fight about the nature of the problem in
China. It was a fight about the nature of the solution,'' Sandy
Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said in an interview
on Wednesday morning as the final House debate was getting under
way. ``It's about whether we best deal with China in a punitive way
or by a combination of promoting internal change and external
validation of that change.''
</P>
<P>
   That Clinton won the China argument at all is somewhat
remarkable. Few countries evoke such deep emotions in Congress and
among political activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people are imprisoned today for their beliefs than at any
time since the Cultural Revolution'' in 1966-76, said Rep. Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif., and long-time opponent of trade relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
   While it is impossible to verify Pelosi's count _ the number of
political detentions in China is kept secret by the government in
Beijing _ administration officials do not deny that the crackdown
on the Falun Gong religious group has sent imprisonments soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican and defense hawk,
charged that America's trade with China was simply building up
Beijing's nuclear capacity, and compared Clinton's engagement
policy to Neville Chamberlain's failed effort to moderate Germany's
behavior in the 1930s. ``You don't make a liberal by hugging a
Nazi,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in this debate, Clinton's approach to trade was as divisive
as his approach to China. Despite America's incredible prosperity,
trade policy still runs like a huge geologic fault through the
Democratic party. For seven years now, Clinton has argued endlessly
that international economic development ultimately offers
opportunities for workers in the world's most innovative economy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he has convinced few.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions fought fiercely against him _ and a pained Al Gore
_ arguing that ``economic engagement'' was simply a code word for
moving American jobs to China.
</P>
<P>
   Just compare Wednesday's vote tallies to the battle over NAFTA.
In 1993, when the American economy was just crawling out of a
recession and unemployment had yet to fall, Clinton got 102 out of
258 Democrats to vote for the free trade accord with Mexico and
Canada _ or 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he persuaded far fewer Democrats: 73 out of 211
voting on the bill, or 35 percent. In one of the great turnabouts
of modern times, it was the House Republicans _ who impeached
Clinton last year _ that saved his foreign policy legacy on
Wednesday, voting overwhelming for the China deal, 164-57.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The decline in Democratic support is all the more remarkable
since this may have been, in Clinton's words, the ``most one-sided
trade deal in history.''
</P>
<P>
   While NAFTA required huge openings of the American market _
threatening American tomato farmers and car parts makers _ the
accord to usher China into the World Trade Organization put all the
market opening obligations on Beijing. China got no reciprocal
trade openings, just an agreement to let them into the organization
that sets the rules for world trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the conundrums that all of us have had to
wrestle with,'' said Gene Sperling, the head of Clinton's National
Economic Council who helped negotiate the deal struck with China in
November, an accord that Congress indirectly approved on Wednesday.
``Despite the growth in our economy, despite the record-low
unemployment, you see nothing but increased anxiety about
globalization, technology and trade. It's everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Clinton's success had little to do with the
bill's economic merits. He won over the undecided using a bit of
Lyndon Johnson-style vote-buying _ one congressman got a zip code
for a small town, and two more got a natural gas pipeline near El
Paso _ and a large dose of Richard Nixon's geostrategy.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nixon and all the presidents who followed him, Clinton has
become a passionate enthusiast of engagement. And while economic
interdependence was the course advocated by George Bush, Clinton
has become a far more articulate proponent of the notion than Bush
ever was.
</P>
<P>
   So if he leaves office with a Clinton Doctrine, it is this: That
doing well for American business can _ under the right conditions _
do good for the cause of liberalization and democracy in
authoritarian corners of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that trade alone will not bring freedom to China or
peace to the world,'' Clinton said late on Wednesday afternoon in
the Rose Garden, before celebrating what clearly will be one of the
last legislative victories of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded: ``We will have more positive influence with an
outstretched hand than with a clenched fist.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is a doctrine Clinton has subscribed to only when it is
politically convenient _ Cuba, for example, is still a notable
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Now the hard part _ making the leap between economic openings
and political progress _ will be left to Clinton's successor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   China's record of compliance with trade accords is poor (though
Europe's and the United States' is not much better.) There is
little doubt that, once a member of the World Trade Organization,
Beijing will use its clout there to work against the international
regulation of labor and environmental rights that Clinton says are
so necessary.
</P>
<P>
   And while China's intelligentsia sees the pressure to open
China's markets as a huge boost to economic and political reform _
and to the country's embattled chief reformer, Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji _ the opposition to true market opening will be fierce.
</P>
<P>
   China's real political constituencies are its wildly
inefficient, often bankrupt state-owned enterprises. As foreign
competition pours in, many will go belly up. When the workers
demonstrate, the country's insecure officials may well decided to
crack down _ moves that would inevitably inflame American opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one said this would be an easy path or a short one,'' said
Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative who led the
China negotiations. ``There will be setbacks, lots of them. But
we've tried the other means of effecting change in China and they
have failed. This has a chance, a good chance.''

 &HT;    EDs: updates, writes thru with Fox announcement to join the
debate
 &HT;    LEADING OPPOSITION CANDIDATE JOINS MEXICAN PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After a strange week of impromptu mini-debates and
public squabbling on television, Mexico's three top presidential
candidates appear to have all agreed to hold a final formal debate
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The country was left guessing about whether there would be a
debate until Wednesday evening, when top challenger and
conservative party contender Vicente Fox Quesada finally announced
he would ``participate with pleasure'' in the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   With less than six weeks to go before Mexico's July 2 election,
Fox is neck-in-neck with Francisco Labastida Ochoa, candidate of
Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from opinion polls, Fox stands a good chance of becoming
the first non-PRI president in 71 years. He was widely hailed as
the winner of a first debate in April.
</P>
<P>
   But commentators here said Fox may have lost ground by engaging
in a game of political chicken and fumbling negotiations he
orchestrated over the debate on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Because a debate originally scheduled for Tuesday had been
cancelled over disagreements on format, Fox challenged his rivals
to meet on live television on Tuesday evening to try to revive a
formal debate.
</P>
<P>
   Fox squabbled with Labastida and leftist candidate Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas while reporters watched in disbelief. Fox tried to insist
on holding the debate later that night as originally scheduled,
noting that two Mexican TV networks had agreed to stand ready.
</P>
<P>
   He had previously accused his rivals of being afraid because
they had rejected his proposal that a speaking order for the debate
be announced shortly before the encounter. Fox also wanted
reporters to be allowed to ask questions, a format that has never
been used in Mexico campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he was also angry because Labastida and Cardenas met
alone on Tuesday for 20 minutes with the president of Mexico's
television industry association _ a group that has been accused of
being too pro-Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, however, Fox's attempts to attack his rivals
appeared to have backfired. He was widely criticized in the media
for being stubborn and refusing to yield to the other candidates'
agreement to debate on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening Fox relented, sending out a brief memo
attacking Labastida and Cardenas for mounting ``an alliance''
against him ``to preserve the system of corruption and privileges
that have been imposed on Mexican society for 70 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will go to the debate without any conditions, so that
(Labastida and Cardenas) won't continue to impose pretexts and will
not continue to deceive Mexican society,'' Fox's press release
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As United Airlines officially announced its proposed $4.3
billion acquisition of US Airways, the two companies began
confronting the obstacles and challenges that they will have to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   In order to capture US Airways, a prize Wall Street analysts
said was a nearly perfect strategic complement, United needs to run
a gantlet of federal regulators, rank-and-file members of its
unions and its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to bet, I would bet this thing is doable,'' said
James Higgins, an airline industry analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. ``But it is not going to be pretty getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   James Goodwin, the chairman and chief executive of United's
parent, the UAL Corp., is mindful of the challenges but optimistic
about UAL's ability to deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, there are two major hurdles,'' said Goodwin,
who will run the combined company. ``The first is to get US Airways
shareholders to approve this transaction. I don't think that is a
major hurdle. The real work ahead of us is the regulatory work,
which revolves around the Department of Transportation, the
Department of Justice and the European Union. Our real challenge
will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Skepticism was apparent on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting a stock that has received a takeover offer that was
about 130 percent above its closing price on Tuesday, shares of US
Airways soared Wednesday but settled well below the $60 a share
that United agreed to pay. US Airways closed at $49, up $22.6875.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, shares of United and those of its main rivals
declined. UAL fell $7.1875, to $53.1875. The AMR Corp., the parent
of American Airlines and the company most threatened by the merger,
slipped $2.5625, to $30.0625. And Delta Air Lines lost $3.6875, to
$51.50.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming United can meet all the challenges, it will then find
itself encumbered with huge amounts of debt _ $7.3 billion in debt
and lease obligations from US Airways alone _ obligations that
could threaten its financial viability if the economy were to slide
into recession sometime in 2001, the year the airline has said it
expects the deal to close.
</P>
<P>
   ``The probability of this transaction being consummated is
materially less than 100 percent,'' said Samuel Buttrick, an
airline analyst at Paine Webber. ``The probability of a significant
and swift competitive response is 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, United's
biggest rivals, chose not to comment on the proposed combination.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said the competitive reaction from within the
industry might be swift and could come in several forms.
</P>
<P>
   They said the most obvious counterattack would be if American,
owned by the AMR Corp., topped United's offer for US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want US Airways, you better step in quickly,'' said
Glenn Engel, an airline analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``And I
don't know why AMR's attitude about US Airways would have
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said that American, which considered a run at US Airways
in 1995, would be ``permanently marginalized'' if United is able to
complete the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that United did not appear to fear a higher bid.
Part of that has to do with the $60-a-share price, a figure most
consider to be generous, if not rich. In addition, United attached
a fairly low breakup fee of $160 million, which is not likely to
scare off a would-be suitor.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Maldutis, global aviation analyst at CIBC World Markets,
said that in the wake of the transaction, ``AMR, Continental
Airlines and Northwest will have to make some strategic moves.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk to United-US Airways, he said, is if all the carriers
decide to make moves in short order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that can queer the United deal is if there are
a number of mergers that are proposed that leave us with three
major carriers,'' Maldutis said. ``If that were to happen, then the
Justice Department and the Department of Transportation would have
a major migrane.''
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts said Wednesday that they expected the proposed
acquisition to be under review for many months by both the Justice
Department and the Transportation Department, a process that could
last into the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   The review would involve an examination of every market where
the two companies have a presence. Because it is not known who
would be leading the antitrust division at the Justice Department,
it is impossible to predict the results of that review.
</P>
<P>
   But experts and securities analysts expect that at the very
least the two companies may have to divest beyond just their
holdings in the Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, regulators most likely will consider what might happen
next.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this succeeds, which is by no means certain, it could
trigger further industry consolidation,'' said Philip Baggaley, a
managing director at the Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. ``The regulators
will have to be thinking about follow-on combinations, as well as
the UAL-US Airways merger.''
</P>
<P>
   As an opening gambit, UAL and US Airways have agreed to sell
significant parts of its routes that operate in and out of Ronald
Reagan National Airport in Washington. But Washington has more than
one airport. United and US Airways, which rank No. 1 and No. 2 in
terms of market share at Washington Dulles International Airport,
may have to give up more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington, D.C., area is glaringly anti-competitive,''
said Higgins of Donaldson, Lufkin. ``I firmly believe the fix they
are proposing is highly inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin said that Robert Johnson, a US Airways board member and
the founder of Black Entertainment Television, had agreed to pay
more than $100 million for the assets at Reagan Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has no experience operating an airline, will have a
fleet of 37 planes operating out of the airport. Ten of those, 737
200s, will be leased from United.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is another city where United may be forced to give
ground, Baggaley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest competitive impact outside the direct overlap
would be in Chicago,'' the Standard &AMP; Poor's analyst said, ``where
both United and American have hubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there is close to competitive balance out of Chicago,
he said, because United dominates flights going West while American
has those going East.
</P>
<P>
   While regulators scrutinize the deal, Congress will also be
watching closely.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, and Sen. Herb
Kohl, D-Wis., said: ``The proposed merger between United Airlines
and US Airways will require very careful scrutiny. If this action
precipitates a wave of consolidation in an already consolidated
industry, it is hard to see how that result will be good for
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   DeWine is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's
subcommitee on antitrust, business rights and competition. Kohl is
the panel's ranking member.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then there is labor.
</P>
<P>
   Objections from United's pilots in 1995 were a big factor behind
the airline's decision to back off a combination with US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the most recent deal, United has agreed to retain
virtually all 45,000 US Airways employees. Job security will likely
be popular with that carrier's unions. But seniority questions will
likely be important issues for United's unions, particularly the
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin said he was optimistic the company's unions would
support the deal. But Wednesday the pilots, whose representative on
United's board voted to reject the takeover, were far from
enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Dubinsky, chairman of the master executive council of the
pilots' union, issued a statement Wednesday expressing ``deep
disappointment'' that the company had agreed to buy US Airways
without reaching ``full agreement'' with the pilots on ``all
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters further, contract negotiations with the
pilots and United's machinists will be conducted over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor integration issues are a real risk,'' said Higgins of
Donaldson, Lufkin. ``I am not sure that union leadership is the
question, but the rank and file. The risk is you can't make
everybody happy. And this is an industry where it doesn't take much
operational disruption to screw up earnings.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Objections from its pilots was only one reason United backed
away from a 1995 deal for US Airways. The company was also worried
about the effect a purchase would have on its balance sheet and
credit rating.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier has long coveted an investment-grade rating for its
bonds. And over the last four years it has slogged toward that
goal.
</P>
<P>
   But its bonds are now rated BB+ by Standard &AMP; Poor's, one notch
below investment grade status.
</P>
<P>
   That is almost certain to change if the US Airways deal goes
through. As part of the deal, United will assume $1.5 billion in US
Airways debt and $5.8 billion in lease obligations. And it will
also borrow $3 billion of the $4.3 billion in cash it has agreed to
pay to US Airways shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Effectively, all of the $11.6 billion of the acquisition price
would represent increased financial obligations of one sort or
another,'' Baggaley said. ``We have calculated that would raise
UAL's debt-to-capital ratio from 71 percent to 81 percent and
weaken other credit measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's said Wednesday that it had placed UAL on
credit watch with negative implications, and US Airways on credit
watch with positive implications. Moody's Investors Service took
similar action.
</P>
<P>
   The combined debt of the two airlines, including off-balance
sheet leases, is $28 billion, Baggaley said, a number that exceeds
1999's combined revenue of $26.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Riding with that much debt could be a real risk in the event the
economy sours next year or in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``A downturn would make them more vulnerable, no question,''
said Michael Mulvaney, a managing director who follows the airline
industry for Moody's.

BARAK VOWS TO HOLD SYRIA RESPONSIBLE FOR GUERRILLA ATTACKS AGAINST
ISRAEL
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs 12th graf to correct spelling of Rabinovich) 
 (See also LEBANON-SCENE, ISRAEL-LEBANON-BORDER) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak warned Lebanon and Syria
on Wednesday that any cross-border attack on Israeli territory
would be considered ``an act of war,'' now that Israel has
withdrawn from Lebanon, in a rush completed before dawn on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Generals vowed to retaliate against incoming rockets or
artillery from Hezbollah guerrillas with strikes against Syrian
military targets deep inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The planes are ready,'' said Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli
military's chief of staff. ``The pilots are on call. Their quality
is known.''
</P>
<P>
   The warnings suggested the degree to which Israel's enthusiasm
over the safe return of its troops and the end of a costly
occupation is undercut by a portent of tension.
</P>
<P>
   Along Israel's northern border, the bombing of recent days
subsided into silence. But the few remaining residents were ordered
into their bomb shelters, and Israeli military warily watched
Hezbollah forces across the border without the hoped-for constraint
of Lebanese army troops or U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to withdraw is correct, but the implementation is
miserable,'' Dan Naveh, an opposition legislator, said in a typical
comment in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But by and large, Barak received credit for keeping his central
campaign promise _ a full withdrawal from Lebanon _ a year after
that pledge helped secure his election.
</P>
<P>
   The few hundred remaining Israeli soldiers emerged from Lebanon
before dawn on Wednesday ``without a scratch,'' the prime minister
boasted, and some 5,000 militia allies were given asylum in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers that on Monday featured Kosovo-like portraits of
fleeing refugees on Wednesday printed their headlines in patriotic
blue. ``Mom, We've Left Lebanon!'' declared a giant banner atop
Yedioth Aronoth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Barak appeared to be trying to tamp down the elation. ``This
is a happy day and a painful day,'' he said on television Wednesday
night. ``Happy because we brought the boys home. Sad, because a
thousand of our dear sons did not live to see this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has shown a striking readiness to assign the blame for any
renewed violence to President Hafez Assad of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any attack on the north will now be interpreted as an attack
by Syria,'' said Itamar Rabinovich, a former Israeli ambassador to
the United States and an expert on the Syrian regime. ``The dire
warnings to Syria reflect the general sentiment that this could
take us into the mouth of the abyss.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli presence in Lebanon acted as a constraint against an
escalation of tensions with Syria, as troops in the zone were
exposed to retaliation from the Hezbollah. But future Israeli
attacks on Lebanese targets would be conducted principally from the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's overnight shift from a ground occupation strategy on
the border to reliance on an aerial offense will limit casualties
and accentuate its technological superiority, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 18 years, Israel has been fighting a guerrilla war, a war
of attrition, that nullifies all of its technological advantages,''
said Gerald Steinberg, a defense specialist at Bar-Illan
University. ``Now, by fighting from the air, Israel can use its
real capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   While the returning Israeli soldiers were welcomed across the
country with family celebrations and politicians' applause, there
was ambivalence in the reception given the 5,000 refugees from the
South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israelis were angered that many militia members were
captured by Hezbollah forces and turned over to Lebanese
authorities. Antoine Lahad, the former commander of the militia,
said on Wednesday that Israel and the South Lebanon Army had
``worked together for 24 years, and then Israel decided within 24
hours to change direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Interior Ministry on Wednesday hastened to provide
the militia members many of the benefits accorded immigrants here,
including work visas, health insurance, temporary housing and help
in finding jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel will be tested on how we deal with them,'' said Ephraim
Sneh, Israel's deputy defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had become caustic in his condemnation of the original
strategic logic of the occupation, contending that it had failed to
protect northern border towns while causing the needless deaths of
more than 900 Israeli soldiers and thousands of Lebanese combatants
and civilians. His implicit target has been the leader of the main
right-wing opposition party, Ariel Sharon, the former defense
minister who led a full-scale invasion into Lebanon in 1982
</P>
<P>
   Sharon on Wednesday termed the withdrawal ``a disgraceful
retreat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The government had 10 months to organize this, and if it had
been organized right, Israeli weapons would not have fallen into
Hezbollah hands,'' he said.

MARYLAND PROSECUTOR DROPS CHARGES AGAINST LINDA TRIPP 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add clarifying sentence to end of final graf.)  
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chief state prosecutor of Maryland decided
Wednesday to drop criminal wiretap charges against Linda Tripp, the
Pentagon employee whose secretly recorded conversations with Monica
Lewinsky exposed an affair that led to President Clinton's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Stephen F. Montanarelli, said it would be
impossible to successfully pursue a trial, which was to begin on
July 10, because a judge this month suppressed testimony by
Lewinsky that, Montanarelli said, was crucial to obtaining a
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The decision concludes the only criminal case against a major
figure in the most serious Oval Office scandal since Watergate.
Tripp had faced the possibility of a 10-year prison sentence and a
$10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no choice'' but to drop the case, Montanarelli said in
an interview Wednesday, noting that in Maryland, a judge's ruling
on suppression of evidence cannot be appealed to a higher court.
``I'm not pleased, but that's the life of a prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement posted on her Web site Wednesday afternoon, Tripp
called the Maryland case an example of ``selective prosecution''
and vowed to ``continue to fight the shameful smear tactics of this
corrupt administration in civil court.'' Last year she sued the
White House and the Defense Department, maintaining that they had
used her confidential personnel records to impugn her reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp did not attend a news conference held Wednesday by her
lawyer, Joseph Murtha, on the courthouse steps in Ellicott City,
the Baltimore suburb where the trial would have been held. ``We
firmly believe that Tripp did nothing wrong,'' Murtha said, ``and
that she did not violate any laws when she exposed the criminal
behavior and wrongdoing committed by President Clinton and
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Laws on taping telephone calls vary from state to state. In
Maryland, where Tripp lives, it is against the law for one party to
tape a phone conversation without the consent of the other. At a
preliminary hearing in the case, Lewinsky testified that she had
not given permission for any taping of her conversations with
Tripp, who was once her close confidante.
</P>
<P>
   Montanarelli's decision to drop the charges was widely expected
after the judge presiding over the case, Diane O. Leasure of Howard
County Circuit Court, suppressed the testimony of Lewinsky in a
decision issued on May 5.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's office had faced the task of building a case
against Tripp that did not rely on evidence Tripp gave to Kenneth
Starr, then the Whitewater independent counsel, while she was under
a federal grant of immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the case was a Lewinsky-Tripp conversation that Tripp
taped on Dec. 22, 1997. This was the last talk between the two
women that Tripp ever recorded, and it occurred, prosecutors said,
just after her lawyer had informed her that secret tape-recording
was illegal in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky testified last winter that she was certain this
conversation had in fact occurred on that December day two and a
half years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Leasure's decision held that the testimony was not credible
and was tainted by the Starr investigation. Lewinsky's recollection
of the date of the conversation, the judge said, was influenced by
her contact with the independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe her, the court does not and that resolves the
matter,'' Montanarelli said Wednesday of Lewinsky's testimony that
she had an independent recollection of the date.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no other witnesses to the conversation whom the
state can call to testify,'' the prosecutor said, ``and Tripp
cannot be compelled to testify.''
</P>
<P>
   In their conversation of Dec. 22, the two women discussed what
they should say about Lewinsky's sexual relationship with the
president in the testimony that each expected to give in a sexual
misconduct suit filed by Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state
employee, against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an extremely important and memorable event in her
life,'' Montanarelli said of Lewinsky, ``which was, shortly after
it occurred, published in detail in the national news media.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp was also charged with illegally disclosing the details of
her conversation with Lewinsky to Newsweek magazine, which
published a transcript of the talk in its issue of Feb. 2, 1998.
Maryland is dropping those charges as well.

HOUSE APPROVES CHINA TRADE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted Wednesday to liberalize trade with
China, approving a historic measure that supporters hailed as a
stimulus for widespread US business expansion, but opponents
condemned as an irreversible threat to American jobs and Chinese
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The 237-197 vote to normalize trade relations with China on a
permanent basis was a notable victory for President Clinton, who
had turned the proposal into a personal crusade. The bill, which
requires that China lower tariffs on many computer and electronics
products, also signaled a new political force in the
high-technology community, which helped direct a lobbying blitz at
dozens of wavering congressmen in the final days before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote was a serious blow to labor unions and human rights
advocates, and it deeply divided congressional Democrats, forcing
many to choose between local interest groups and their allegiance
to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the victory depended largely on Republican leaders,
who formed an unusual alliance with Clinton to line up the
necessary number of supporters, including 164 Republicans. Minutes
after the bill passed, Republican leaders emerged from the House
chamber beaming. ``This is an incredible day,'' said House majority
whip Tom DeLay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Clinton said: ``Today the House of
Representatives has taken an historic step toward continued
prosperity in America, reform in China and peace in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, known as permanent normalization of trade relations,
is expected to pass the Senate in the coming weeks, despite a
pledge Wednesday from Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Jesse Helms to block it.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, a North Carolina Republican and a frequent critic of the
Clinton administration, said he felt ``obliged to make clear that I
do not intend to allow the Senate to simply rubber-stamp the
president's plan to reward the Chinese Communists,'' threatening to
force uncomfortable votes as the bill came to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the Senate, including both senators from
Massachusetts, have a record of supporting free trade, and few
aides expect the deal to be blocked at this late stage. Then, once
Clinton signs it into law, China will be guaranteed normal US trade
status _ instead of waiting for Congress to vote on it every year
as it does now. In exchange, China has agreed to reduce many of its
tariffs and barriers, including those that affect the financial
services, insurance, and technology industries.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the loudest opponents of the bill during Wednesday's
debate on the House floor were members from New England, despite
the region's burgeoning high-tech and financial services
industries. Representative Bernard Sanders, an Independent from
Vermont who called the vote a ``sad situation,'' opposed the deal,
largely on human rights grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying by the White House reached a fever pitch over the
last month, as Clinton invited dozens of undecided congressmen to
the White House for a personal lobbying session.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Clinton appeal appeared to have a significant
effect: Some 10 Democrats announced their support for the
legislation Tuesday night. Several said they were swayed after
striking bargains for their districts. In one case, Representative
Martin Frost of Texas said he would support the bill after the Navy
agreed not to close the Northrop Grumman defense plant in his
district.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, some 200 business lobbyists in favor of the
bill crowded into a conference room on Capitol Hill to compare
notes on negotiations with undecided members. They sounded
increasingly confident about their victory; at one point,
Representative Philip M. Crane, a Republican of Illinois, dropped
by to boost spirits further with a pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Capitol _ where 10,000 labor union activists had
congregated in protest the month before _ about 40 free-trade
advocates carried signs and American flags Wednesday morning in a
jubilant show of last-minute support. At almost the exact same
time, opponents inside the building seemed to be bracing for
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   In the weekly Democratic caucus meeting, House minority leader
Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri announced that he hoped
disagreements over the bill would ``remain high-level,'' rather
than deteriorating into rancorous debate among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, who vehemently opposed the bill, told fellow Democrats
``to remember that when the vote was over, we had to be a unified
party,'' according to members who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But just hours later, Representative Patrick J. Kennedy gave a
speech suggesting the wounds might not immediately heal. The Rhode
Island Democrat shouted, ``What would we do today if this were
apartheid? I guess we would do even more deals with P.W. Botha,''
referring to the white South African leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a travesty,'' he said.

CHINESE EXPECT BILL'S PASSAGE TO SPEED DEVELOPMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (With CHINA-TRADE) 
By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ News that China has taken the first step toward
permanent normal trade status with the United States was greeted
with joy here, tempered by worries about the wrenching economic
changes that are expected as China opens its markets to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fantastic,'' said Zhang Linan, a 24-year-old accountant
in a bank. ``I think it will be a boost for our economic
development and personally it means more choices for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese have placed enormous hopes on membership in the
World Trade Organization, with its rules for market opening, as a
force for dismantling inefficient state industries and modernizing
the country.
</P>
<P>
   And since most people yearn for cooperation with the United
States, which they see as the world's economic and cultural leader,
defeat of the trade bill would have been seen as a stinging
betrayal. Reactions in Beijing were tinged with feelings of relief
that a crisis in U.S.-Chinese relations had been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so good that it passed,'' said Luo Hui, 36, a computer
programmer. ``And it's even better that it didn't fail to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Free trade and investment, Luo said, ``will bring many
opportunities here, but also will put lots of pressure on Chinese
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if Congress hadn't passed this law,'' he added, ``it would
have been a shock, a setback, a big international incident. Now we
can get on with business.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Chinese government had not yet issued an official
reaction, top officials had to be pleased and relieved. President
Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji had both staked their
prestige on China's entry into the global trading regime and on
closer economic ties with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Xu Xiaonian, the senior economist at the China International
Capital Corp., a government-linked investment bank, noted that
passage of the bill helps clear the way for China's entry into the
WTO, which he predicted ``will mark a new era in China's economic
opening.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about speeding up the economic reforms and integrating
China into the world economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The news from Washington will speed along what is already a
remarkable revival in U.S.-Chinese relations since the bombing of
China's Embassy in Belgrade last year, during the NATO campaign
against Yugoslavia. President Clinton, who earlier had been
portrayed as a great statesman for cultivating relations with
China, was all but declared an enemy after the embassy bombing,
even though the United States insisted it was an unfortunate
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's efforts to push the trade bill were widely reported in
China and now he is a hero again. Still, foreign policy experts
warn of pitfalls ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the trade vote in Congress, two big problems threatened
Chinese-American relations, trade relations and Taiwan,'' said
Xiong Zhiyong, dean of the Foreign Affairs College here. ``Now
there's only one.''

MEXICAN WAR NOVEL LACKS THE PUNCH OF PREVIOUS EFFORTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Gone for Soldiers: A Novel of the Mexican War'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   by Jeff Shaara &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Historical fiction &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ballantine, $26.95 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing sadder than a great literary concept that's
been pushed over the edge. Larry McMurtry's ``Lonesome Dove'' led
logically to ``Streets of Laredo,'' but ``Dead Man's Walk'' and
``Comanche Moon'' were sequels that readers had to endure rather
than savor. Similarly, Fort Worth native Patricia Highsmith created
an anti-hero for all time in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' but no
one recalls that masterwork's four lackluster sequels.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Gone for Soldiers'' is legitimate cause for mourning.
Michael Shaara's justly award-winning ``The Killer Angels,'' which
chronicled the Civil War battle of Gettysburg from the
fictionalized but brutally realistic perspective of specific
real-life combatants, was a revelation. A decade or so after his
father's death, Jeff Shaara took up the same theme with the
exceptional ``Gods and Generals,'' a ``Killer Angels'' prequel that
brought Robert E. Lee, Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson, Joshua
Chamberlain and other Killer Angels vets to the brink of
Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   He followed with ``The Last Full Measure,'' taking these
now-beloved men on to Appomattox (Jackson excepted; he died before
Gettysburg). A final scene in ``The Last Full Measure,'' when Union
troops have the scattered Confederate forces at bay, was absolutely
stunning in its clarity and resonance.
</P>
<P>
   That should have been the last scene in the series. Shaara's
latest effort, ``Gone for Soldiers,'' a pre-prequel about the
Mexican War, is a listless exercise in milking a literary cow that
has given its last drops. Capt. Robert E. Lee is the central figure
as U.S. forces head south across the border and eventually breach
the walls of Mexico City. We meet, fleetingly, Jackson and George
Pickett and U.S. Grant, all prepping for their Civil War roles in
subordinate military positions, but distinguishing themselves
nonetheless. Much of the book, though, concerns itself with U.S.
commander Winfield Scott and his chief opponent, Gen. Antonio Lopez
de Santa Anna, back from the political dead to rally his people to
another humiliating defeat.
</P>
<P>
   In a near-apologetic ``To the Reader'' note before the novel
begins, Shaara calls the U.S.-Mexican war ``one of the most
overlooked stories in American history,'' which is true enough. An
exceptional PBS TV series (produced by Dallas' KERA staff) did
much, a few years ago, to remedy that. What Shaara adds with ``Gone
for Soldiers'' simply never gets going, storywise, perhaps because
the conflict it describes was so confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Scott spends as much time fighting his own generals as he does
the Mexicans; President Polk is no admirer of Scott's, and has a
government lackey on hand in Mexico to negotiate peace without
necessarily consulting the commander of the U.S. forces. Shaara
manages to turn the complex Santa Anna into a parody; there are
lengthy passages describing the one-legged general's elaborate
dinners in the field. Far less attention is given to why such an
established military loser remained beloved among the very peasants
whose lifestyle was the antithesis of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Even the battle scenes drag on. Shaara's description of the
Americans storming the great Chapultepec castle ought to be
masterful, considering his expertise with such descriptions in
``Gods and Generals'' and ``The Last Full Measure.'' But the
results in ``Gone for Soldiers'' elicit yawns, not gasps. This is
especially disappointing because most devotees of the series
probably were already familiar with Gettysburg and Shiloh and
Appomattox before they started the books, but they're far less
likely to know about Veracruz and Chapultepec. Learning ought to be
at least as engaging as reaffirming, but Shaara doesn't get the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely that ``Gone for Soldiers'' is the last of the Shaara
father/son series. Like the combatants whose exploits he has
chronicled, Shaara has clearly lost his zeal for battle.

CHEST PUMPING IS TOUTED OVER TRADITIONAL CPR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pumping the chest of a cardiac arrest victim is as effective as
the universally-taught CPR method that combines pumping with
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, according to a surprising study that
could change the way emergency dispatchers instruct people trying
to save someone.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors recommend a radical paring of one of the
pillars of emergency medicine: 911 operators should abandon
instructing bystanders at cardiac arrest scenes to perform
combination CPR and instead urge them to immediately begin chest
pumping alone.
</P>
<P>
   The faster a victim is attended to, the more likely he or she
will be saved. A 911 operator can explain how to chest pump quicker
than he can issue instructions on standard CPR, pointed out Alfred
Hallstrom, a biostatistician at the University of Washington in
Seattle and an author of the study, which appears in the New
England Journal of Medicine. The minutes saved could mean lives
saved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instructions for chest compression take 1.4 minutes less than
for mouth-to-mouth and compression. It doesn't make sense to waste
time giving lengthier instructions, especially if we know that
chest compression alone works just as well,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom pointed out that jettisoning mouth-to-mouth would also
eliminate a major reason why bystanders avoid CPR in the first
place: fear of the contents of another person's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Mouth-to-mouth and CPR have long been synonymous in both the
public mind and first-aid training around the world. Change will
come about slowly if at all, said the study's authors. Still,
colleagues hailed their work as groundbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   The study is of ``immense importance and will have worldwide
implications,'' wrote Dr. Gordon A. Ewy, a longtime CPR researcher
at the University of Arizona, in an editorial accompanying the
article.
</P>
<P>
   Local fire and rescue departments reacted cautiously to the
criticism _ seemingly from left field _ of a practice long
considered gospel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more time to absorb and digest this study before we
comment or give any of our policies a second look,'' said Steve
MacDonald, spokesman for the Boston Fire Department, after a copy
was provided to him.
</P>
<P>
   Among CPR researchers, however, the venerable practice of
mouth-to-mouth has been suspect for almost two decades. In the
early 1980s, Seattle embarked on an ambitious effort to train the
public in CPR. Almost 40 percent of its residents took classes.
Hallstrom and his colleagues wanted to see if Seattle had actually
improved at it. They did find that slightly more people than usual
were performing CPR by the book. But a far more stunning result
emerged: how well CPR was done had no bearing on who survived.
Those who did incomplete jobs _ such as chest pumping only _ saved
about as many people as those who met the paramedic's gold
standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that either CPR was doing nothing or you didn't
have to do very good CPR to have a real impact,'' said Hallstrom.
``We were surprised by that. Everyone assumed that doing really
rigorous CPR was essential.''
</P>
<P>
   Further CPR studies, first in dogs then pigs, confirmed that
simple chest pumping, where both hands are placed just below the
breastbone and pushed down in rapid intervals, was just as
effective as the standard procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart ceases to pump blood around
the body. Crucial bodily functions come to a halt. A victim can die
within mintues. In CPR, mouth-to-mouth ventillation may help
restore breathing. Chest compression may allow the heart to start
pumping blood again.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the authors used a computer program to randomly
instruct Seattle's 911 operators to tell cardiac arrest bystanders
to either do standard CPR or chest pumping alone. The study said
14.6 percent of the victims who were given only chest pumps later
walked out of the hospital; 10.4 percent of those given standard
CPR did the same. The difference is too small for researchers to
claim chest pumping alone is superior but they can say the two
methods are equal. They also found it takes 911 operators one
minute to instruct callers on how to chest pump, compared to 2.4
minutes to explain standard CPR, which involves clearing the
airway, administering mouth-to-mouth then chest pumping and
alternating between the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't surprise me that chest compression worked slightly
better than mouth-to-mouth and compression,'' said Hallstrom. ``It
was a reasonable conclusion to draw from our earlier studies.
Moreover, if you only give chest compression instructions you're
starting about a minute and half earlier.''

DEMOCRATS RAISE RECORD $26.5 MILLION TO COME TO AID OF PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most people shelled out just $50, but some could
not help giving or gathering $500,000. So there were different
``tiers'' of donors in kind of a class system sprayed throughout
the giant MCI Center Wednesday night, but all of them were part of
a history-making event _ the biggest political fund-raiser ever,
raising $26.5 million in three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was the Democrats, the party of the little people, who
set the record. It was billed as a tribute to President Clinton,
and the donors, from those in black tie to those in blue jeans,
were beckoned by the Midas of fund-raisers, Terry McAuliffe, who,
in the end, squeezed 13,645 people into a space for 12,000.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe accomplished his task: beating the Republicans, who
raised a mere $21.3 million at their gala a month ago. McAuliffe
let them gloat at their treasure chest and low-balled his estimates
of what the Democrats could raise, only to be able to trumpet his
success later.
</P>
<P>
   The event featured McAuliffe's friend, Clinton, and assorted
other luminaries, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President
Al Gore and Tipper Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It also featured entertainers like Robin Williams, Stevie
Wonder, LeAnn Rimes, Lenny Kravitz and Darius Rucker.
</P>
<P>
   The money goes to the Democratic National Committee and will be
used to help Gore pay for commercials for his presidential
campaign, although he has insisted he wants to overhaul the current
campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal Democrats like Bill Richardson, the secretary of energy,
were on hand. He acknowledged that the money would come in handy,
especially when the advertising wars begin on television. ``I think
neither party is going to unilaterally disarm,'' he said, as he
stood by a table of donors who had raised up to $500,000. Then he
added, ``We're the party of the small donors, the grass roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Tables for dignitaries were spread across the floor of the
sports arena, where guests were served barbecue from restaurants in
Arkansas and Tennessee, home states of the president and vice
president, along with bottles of Merlot and Chardonnay. John
Vergos, whose family owns Rendezvous, a popular barbecue restaurant
in Memphis, flew in 800 pounds of barbecued chicken and beef ribs
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Up in the bleachers, guests had to buy their food at the regular
arena prices _ $3.75 for a cup of cola.
</P>
<P>
   John Bunting, 56, who works in social services in Baltimore,
paid $50 to party. He said that the Republicans were trying to cast
the presidential race as a ``personality contest and that's a much
tougher race for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the arena, he said that much of the crowd probably
came to pay tribute to Clinton. ``It's not that Vice President Gore
falls short,'' he said, ``it's that we're talking about the king.''

TELEVISION PLOY BACKFIRES FOR OPPOSITION CANDIDATE
</HEADLINE>
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Hastily improvised negotiations among the main
presidential candidates demonstrated the power that television has
gained in Mexican politics when the talks went sour for the
opposition contender.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was called to discuss whether to go ahead with the
second of two presidential debates that had been canceled. Vicente
Fox, the opposition candidate who has taken the lead in opinion
polls, had tried to score points by demanding that the three main
candidates proceed with a planned debate on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Abruptly, his opponents, Francisco Labastida of the ruling party
and the leftist candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, agreed to get
together with him to discuss the rules. Fox invited TV cameras to
the negotiations, and for most of the next two hours, found himself
pummeled by Labastida and Cardenas who accused Fox of being
needlessly difficult. After hours of heated exchanges, Fox's two
opponents got up and walked out as cameras whirred.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Labastida was openly triumphant, declaring that
``Fox is going into a free fall.'' Most headlines seemed to agree,
like the one in Milenio. a daily newspaper in Mexico City, that
said, ``Fox Acts Spoiled, Live and In Color.'' And though Fox
insisted that he had achieved his goal of flushing out the
collusion of Labastida and Cardenas, his advisers acknowledged that
his performance had at least temporarily knocked the wind from his
campaign. After some hesitation, he also announced he would
participate in the next debate, scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For a country still new to the rough-and-tumble of a real
campaign after 71 years of dominance by a single party, the
confrontation offered an exhilarating glimpse of presidential
candidates slugging it out without makeup or rules.
</P>
<P>
   While much can still change before the election on July 2, for
now, at least, the awkward meeting threatened to neutralize the
lead Fox had taken as the outsider battling against the entrenched
Institutional Revolutionary Party of Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Reuters news agency published a nationwide
poll, with a margin of error of 3.2 percent, showing Fox backed by
46.3 percent of voters, Labastida by 41.6 percent and Cardenas by
9.3 percent. But several polls published since have been a
cacophony of contradictions, leaving Mexicans uncertain about who
is the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   The televised encounter on Tuesday capped three days of
programming in which the two Mexican networks relaxed their starchy
news formats and interviewed the three candidates from remote
locations simultaneously, a la ABC's Nightline, allowing them to
respond to each others' increasingly vituperative remarks
</P>
<P>
   ``This was something completely new for Mexico,'' said Raul
Trejo Delarbre, a Mexico City professor who studies the media.
``There were no clear rules, and nobody knew quite how to react.''
</P>
<P>
   This format reached an extreme in the televised encounter on
Tuesday, in which cameras rolled for two hours as the candidates
sat at a table in a garden, airing their differences about whether
to have a formal debate _ without a moderator or anyone else in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   A scowling Fox insisted repeatedly that all three men go forward
that night with the debate, as originally planned and subsequently
canceled. He also appeared to misrepresent an offer by Mexico's top
TV network to broadcast the event.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas and Labastida repeatedly jeered at Fox, portraying him
as obstinate for repeatedly pushing to debate on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Over Fox's objections, his opponents agreed to debate Friday
evening. Then they stood up and ended the meeting, with Fox sitting
alone, staring glumly at the cameras in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Fox agonized before deciding to participate in the debate on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our choice is to go into the debate, now on their terrain, in
which case Cuauhtemoc and Labastida will both attack me, or to take
our campaign back on the road, to the people, in which case they
will say I was afraid to debate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, whose campaign had been losing steam, sounded
jubilant about Fox's misstep as he drove to a rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox is going to go into free fall,'' Labastida said.
``Everyone can see he doesn't know the difference between his
fantasies and reality. He also manipulated the truth. Mexicans
don't like that.''

MEMO ON RISKS TO RENO'S JOB TOUCHES OFF DISPUTE AT SENATE HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Top officials of the Justice Department and the FBI
engaged in an unusual public debate Wednesday at a Senate hearing
over a 1996 memorandum about whether Attorney General Janet Reno's
job was at risk as a result of the government's high-profile
investigation into finances of the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the Senate hearing, a top FBI official, Neil Gallagher, said
that he attended a meeting four years ago with Lee Radek, a senior
Justice Department official, who, according to Gallagher, said that
he was under heavy pressure on the case and that Reno's job was
``in the balance'' as a result of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Radek, who also testified at the hearing, said that he had no
recollection of the meeting, but that he was sure he had not made
such a remark.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed Gallagher's statement as ``a lie.'' Gallagher,
however, said he was positive of his account of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed comments were referred to in a memorandum written
by FBI Director Louis Freeh, who was not at the meeting, but said
that another official had reported Radek's comments.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement between two high-ranking officials reflects the
acute sensitivity within law enforcement circles over the campaign
finance inquiry that has resulted in guilty pleas and convictions
of lower level fund-raisers, but has never reached the upper
echelons of the Democratic Party or the White House.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials, including Freeh, have long contended that an
independent prosecutor should have investigated the case because
the Justice Department under Reno, a presidential appointee, could
never be perceived as impartial.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno and her top advisers on independent counsel matters,
like Radek, repeatedly blocked efforts to seek an outside
prosecutor, saying the law did not require Reno to refer the case
to an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Radek's public integrity unit within the Justice Department has
managed the investigation, which congressional Republicans have
long criticized as a tepid effort.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers have continued their attacks on Reno _ even
though the independent counsel law has expired _ for her refusal to
relinquish the case to an outside prosecutor. They have said that
Reno deliberately kept the inquiry in-house to spare President
Clinton embarrassment and in effort to keep her job after Clinton
won re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's memorandum was read at Wednesday's hearing by Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., who has led an inquiry into the Justice
Department's handling of campaign finance matters.

MEXICAN WAR NOVEL LACKS THE PUNCH OF PREVIOUS EFFORTS

   ``Gone for Soldiers: A Novel of the Mexican War'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   by Jeff Shaara &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Historical fiction &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ballantine, $26.95 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing sadder than a great literary concept that's
been pushed over the edge. Larry McMurtry's ``Lonesome Dove'' led
logically to ``Streets of Laredo,'' but ``Dead Man's Walk'' and
``Comanche Moon'' were sequels that readers had to endure rather
than savor. Similarly, Fort Worth native Patricia Highsmith created
an anti-hero for all time in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' but no
one recalls that masterwork's four lackluster sequels.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Gone for Soldiers'' is legitimate cause for mourning.
Michael Shaara's justly award-winning ``The Killer Angels,'' which
chronicled the Civil War battle of Gettysburg from the
fictionalized but brutally realistic perspective of specific
real-life combatants, was a revelation. A decade or so after his
father's death, Jeff Shaara took up the same theme with the
exceptional ``Gods and Generals,'' a ``Killer Angels'' prequel that
brought Robert E. Lee, Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson, Joshua
Chamberlain and other Killer Angels vets to the brink of
Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   He followed with ``The Last Full Measure,'' taking these
now-beloved men on to Appomattox (Jackson excepted; he died before
Gettysburg). A final scene in ``The Last Full Measure,'' when Union
troops have the scattered Confederate forces at bay, was absolutely
stunning in its clarity and resonance.
</P>
<P>
   That should have been the last scene in the series. Shaara's
latest effort, ``Gone for Soldiers,'' a pre-prequel about the
Mexican War, is a listless exercise in milking a literary cow that
has given its last drops. Capt. Robert E. Lee is the central figure
as U.S. forces head south across the border and eventually breach
the walls of Mexico City. We meet, fleetingly, Jackson and George
Pickett and U.S. Grant, all prepping for their Civil War roles in
subordinate military positions, but distinguishing themselves
nonetheless. Much of the book, though, concerns itself with U.S.
commander Winfield Scott and his chief opponent, Gen. Antonio Lopez
de Santa Anna, back from the political dead to rally his people to
another humiliating defeat.
</P>
<P>
   In a near-apologetic ``To the Reader'' note before the novel
begins, Shaara calls the U.S.-Mexican war ``one of the most
overlooked stories in American history,'' which is true enough. An
exceptional PBS TV series (produced by Dallas' KERA staff) did
much, a few years ago, to remedy that. What Shaara adds with ``Gone
for Soldiers'' simply never gets going, storywise, perhaps because
the conflict it describes was so confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Scott spends as much time fighting his own generals as he does
the Mexicans; President Polk is no admirer of Scott's, and has a
government lackey on hand in Mexico to negotiate peace without
necessarily consulting the commander of the U.S. forces. Shaara
manages to turn the complex Santa Anna into a parody; there are
lengthy passages describing the one-legged general's elaborate
dinners in the field. Far less attention is given to why such an
established military loser remained beloved among the very peasants
whose lifestyle was the antithesis of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Even the battle scenes drag on. Shaara's description of the
Americans storming the great Chapultepec castle ought to be
masterful, considering his expertise with such descriptions in
``Gods and Generals'' and ``The Last Full Measure.'' But the
results in ``Gone for Soldiers'' elicit yawns, not gasps. This is
especially disappointing because most devotees of the series
probably were already familiar with Gettysburg and Shiloh and
Appomattox before they started the books, but they're far less
likely to know about Veracruz and Chapultepec. Learning ought to be
at least as engaging as reaffirming, but Shaara doesn't get the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely that ``Gone for Soldiers'' is the last of the Shaara
father/son series. Like the combatants whose exploits he has
chronicled, Shaara has clearly lost his zeal for battle.

WORLD'S BADDEST BULL, AGE 12, DIES OF KIDNEY FAILURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bodacious, who earned the reputation of ``World's Most Dangerous
Bull'' by giving cowboys a prime ride or their worst wreck, is no
longer walking the pastures.
</P>
<P>
   The muscular, 1,800-pound bull, who won three world titles, has
died of kidney failure. He was 12, or the equivalent of
approximately 60 in human years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the baddest bull that I ever saw,'' said four-time
world champion Tuff Hedemen, who made the best ride of his career
on Bodacious and also had every bone in his face shattered by the
bull.
</P>
<P>
   The cream-colored Charbray had an explosive style of jumping
that made him a rodeo celebrity. Bodacious had his own agent and
was featured in magazines and television, and appeared in
advertising for Budweiser and at rodeos and fairs. He inspired an
abundance of memorabilia, including T-shirts, caps, belt buckles,
watches, rifles and mousepads.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Andrews and her husband Sammy, renowned northeast Texas
stock contractors, owned the bull, which died May 16 in his holding
pen at the Andrews' ranch in Addielou, near the Oklahoma border. He
was buried nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Bodacious reared higher than most bulls. As a cowboy leaned
forward to stay in rhythm, Bodacious often threw back his head and
struck the rider in the face. Bodacious whipped down many cowboys
on his massive front end, including Hedeman and 1996 world champion
Terry Don West, causing facial and rib injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Bodacious never killed a cowboy, but Hedeman said the bull had
the potential of causing a fatality had he not been retired five
years ago. Hedeman, who lives in Morgan Mill, Texas, was Bodacious'
most famous foe. He finished 1-4 against the bull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletically speaking, Bodacious was the 300-pound offensive
lineman who could also star at cornerback,'' Hedeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bodacious finished as the top bull at the 1992 National Finals
Rodeo as a rookie. He also finished as the PRCA top bull in 1994
and both the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association and
Professional Bull Riders in 1995. In 135 attempts, only eight
qualified rides were made on Bodacious. The bull earned a spot in
the ProRodeo Hall of Fame last year.
</P>
<P>
   After he was retired in 1995, Bodacious was used as a breeder
and sired hundreds of offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Bodacious appeared healthy until last week. He recovered from an
infection in his left hind hoof last year, and the Andrewses
considered taking Bodacious on another promotional tour later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he had so much medication (from his hoof injury)
last year, that it ultimately caused him to have kidney problems
and die,'' Carolyn Andrew said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked good'' until the end, Carolyn Andrews said. ``He was
fat and sassy.''

<P>
   Business leaders hailed the result as evidence that they could
marshal support for a trade deal despite a string of defeats in the
mid-1990s. Many had worried that after the collapse of world trade
negotiations in Seattle late last year, the sentiment against
globalization would make it difficult to get even the simplest and
most economically beneficial trade measures through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw here is Congress telling the labor movement and
some of these other opponents that their shrill cry about how this
would destroy jobs just did not fit,'' said Thomas Donohue,
president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But labor leaders denounced Wednesday's vote. ``This is a
betrayal of workers' interests,'' said George Becker, president of
the United Steelworkers of America. ``This is about moving
factories from the U.S. so that they can export back here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuming about the Clinton administration's all-out pursuit of
China trade, Becker said the Steelworkers executive board would
meet in three weeks to discuss its political strategy in the
upcoming elections. ``Our members wrote 250,000 letters against
PNTR and that's not something you just forget,'' he said, using the
abbreviation for the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   Local labor leaders have threatened to withhold support from two
House Democrats, Lois Capps of California and Sander Levin of
Michigan. And industrial unions have signaled that Gore's backing
for the bill has undermined enthusiasm for his presidential
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton sought to begin patching up the rift the
issue opened up between the administration and labor, by twice
inviting John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, to join him on
Wednesday night at a big Democratic fund-raiser here. Sweeney
declined, aides said, unwilling to sit among the corporate
chieftains who championed the China bill.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We mounted a forceful and nearly successful challenge to an
array of money and forces unlike any before seen in a lobbying
campaign,'' Mr. Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   With the vast majority of lawmakers facing safe elections this
fall, many legislators openly put a price on their vote. For two
Texas Democrats, Silvestre Reyes and Solomon P. Ortiz, it was a
gasoline pipeline. They got a promise for speedy review and voted
yes. A Minnesota Democrat, James Oberstar, requested protection for
iron-ore workers. He did not get it and voted no.
</P>
<P>
   In the span of a month, Congress has now approved the China bill
and legislation to expand trade ties with more than 70 nations in
sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the administration's last major trade victory was
passage of the Uruguay Round in 1994 that created the World Trade
Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, a
pact that established duty-free commerce among the United States,
Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's final vote cut across party lines, as 164
Republicans and 73 Democrats voted in favor; 57 Republicans, 183
Democrats and 2 independents voted against. By comparison, the
House passed NAFTA in 1993 by a vote of 234 to 200, with 102
Democrats and 132 Republicans supporting the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade is still controversial and China is controversial,''
said Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative who
negotiated the trade agreement with China and lobbied for it
ceaselessly in recent months. ``But we've shown that if you have a
solid agreement and real presidential backing, you can get it
through.''

   Today's leading-edge video games take players through worlds
that go on forever. Just as soon as you think you've solved enough
puzzles, killed enough eight-headed dragons, and disarmed enough
malevolent wizards to conquer and rule, new enemies emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the business environment inhabited by the big
players in the gaming industry.
</P>
<P>
   Just when Sony, Nintendo, and Sega seemed to have the
game-console market all to themselves, along came Microsoft. In
March, the software giant announced that it was producing its own
machine to play games and DVD movies _ and to connect to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Like its competitors, Microsoft's machine, dubbed X-Box for now,
would connect to a television set easily and load software with
virtually no effort.
</P>
<P>
   And when released in the fall of 2001, it would have the best
graphics on the market, able to run faster, more visually detailed
games than Sega's already released Dreamcast console and Sony's
eagerly awaited PlayStation 2, due in American stores this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The X-Box's entry into the $20 billion a year video-game
industry will require investors to reexamine the competitive
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were initially keen on Sony stock following the
Japanese market's wildly enthusiastic reception of PlayStation 2
after its early March debut. Before long, though, Sony stock
plunged, as investors reacted to both the Microsoft news and
consumer complaints that Sony's console couldn't handle DVD movies.
</P>
<P>
   Sega fared even worse. PlayStation 2's runaway Japanese sales
dried up Dreamcast's sales there almost completely.
</P>
<P>
   As for Nintendo, once the category leader, little is known about
its next-generation machine, code-named Dolphin. Until now, the
company has stuck with cartridge games; its rivals all run
cheaper-to-make software disks.
</P>
<P>
   At least initially, Microsoft's entry into video-game hardware
is good news for consumers. As the hardware market gets more
competitive, prices will drop. That may spell trouble for Sony:
PlayStation 2's upfront development and marketing costs were
enormous.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese company was counting on recouping its investment
through increased hardware sales and licensing fees from game
designers. Competition is driving down the price of licenses,
placing hardware makers like Sony squarely in the middle of a
two-pronged price war.

make the most popular games, such as Electronic Arts (ERTS) and
Activision (ATVI).

MOVING NICHE MARKETING FROM CABLE TELEVISION TO THE SKIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With AIR-MERGER) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES and MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the last 20 years, Robert L. Johnson has used
Black Entertainment Television to build a financial empire,
employing skill, ruthlessness and a knack for niche marketing. With
his plan to run a spin off from the merger between United Airlines
and US Airways, the challenge for Johnson is whether those same
abilities will work in a different kind of business, the mature and
cutthroat airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   There is no hard-and-fast requirement that it takes an airline
background to run an air carrier, even a start-up, people in the
industry said Wednesday. Much of what a chief executive needs in
that business is marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in the silk-scarf-and-goggles era,'' said George
Hamlin, an aviation consultant here. ``This is no longer a business
where technicians are paramount.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hamlin and others said that Johnson's new entry, DC Air,
will need to create a unique identity through innovative marketing
and cut costs with skilled finance if it hopes to be a success.
</P>
<P>
   The deal had its origin six weeks ago at a breakfast Johnson had
at Washington's Four Seasons Hotel with Stephen M. Wolf, chairman
of US Airways. According to Johnson, Wolf informed him that he was
contemplating a deal with United Airlines and would have to divest
some ``assets'' at Reagan National Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me if I was interested,'' said Johnson, who has been
a member of the USAirways board for four years. ``He thought it
would be a great opportunity for me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson has shown himself to be a shrewd marketer with an
ability to keep both production and labor costs down, his
experience has been marketing to a largely black audience.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who took an idea he heard about creating a cable
channel that would appeal to an elderly audience and adapted it for
black viewers, used to tell friends: ``You don't have to reinvent
the wheel. You've just got to paint it black.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone news conference, Johnson, who was stuck on the
runway at La Guardia airport in New York, on his private jet, said
that he believes he could make the new airline a success. ``I feel
very comfortable about doing this, because at the end of the day,
it doesn't matter what your race or ethnicity is,'' he said.
``People want the same thing. They want good service. They want
good value.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh thinking is a plus, say old hands in the airline business.
``Showing yourself to be a demonstrated, capable leader with
out-of-the-box thinking is an imperative in the airline industry,''
said Kenneth Quinn, an aviation lawyer and former FAA official.
``If you have close contact with consumers, that's going to be the
key to your success. The fact that Johnson has driven a customer-,
consumer-oriented business to large success can be quite helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Quinn said, airlines are a notoriously tough
business where profits are often hard to come by. USAirways'
operations are the most costly in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has something else to take on in the airline business,
too _ its unions. Airlines are one of the most heavily unionized
industries in the country, and Johnson has had severe run-ins with
his unionized work force at BET.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Johnson and BET management laid off or cut the hours of
14 supporters of the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, which had recently won the right to represent technicians
at the cable operation. A judge later ordered them reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials also said BET's management was rigid during
negotiations for a new contract for the technicians, who earn
significantly less than their counterparts at other television
stations. Beyond those potential problems, there are other
challenges to making the proposed spinoff, which would fly in and
out of the airport closest to downtown Washington, a successful
operation.
</P>
<P>
   DC Air would be mostly in the short-haul market, the most
brutally competitive part of the airline business, and spun off
from a barely profitable airline, in a business where it is the
bigger networks that are prospering. That is the main reason that
United and US Airways are getting together in the first place, and
proposing to hand off everything but the USAirways shuttle at
Reagan National Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed DC Air would begin as a ``virtual airline,''
leasing 10 Boeing 737s, complete with pilots and flight attendants,
and buying from United the time of mechanics, gate agents, and
everything else needed for a flight, almost down to the
foil-wrapped peanuts. Most airlines lease some planes, the way
consumers lease cars. But ``wet leasing,'' which is what DC Air
would do, is akin to hiring a chauffeured car.
</P>
<P>
   It plans to buy eight turboprops and 19 regional jets from the
merged airline, and use USAirways and United employees, at least to
get started.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same routes, the same airplanes, the same people, just
with a different owner _ it doesn't seem like a formula for
success,'' said S. Mark Ray, an analyst at John Hancock. ``There's
got to be more to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson gave a hint Wednesday of what the something more would
be. He spoke of tie-ins with rental car and hotel companies, and
offering low fares. ``I think I'm going to bring to this airline
some of the same marketing strategy that Richard Branson brings to
Virgin.''
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be easy. The new airline would fly from Reagan
Airport, one of the few major airports that absolutely cannot
function as a hub, at a time when most in the industry think that
hubs are the easiest route to success. A hub operation requires the
ability to land and launch large numbers of planes almost
simultaneously; National, with a single runway for big jets, can
handle only a modest stream.
</P>
<P>
   But access to Reagan National itself is a major plus. ``Having
access to a major market is the only way a new carrier can
effectively compete,'' said T. Allan McArtor, who led the Federal
Aviation Administration from 1987 to 1989 and is now heading a
start-up, Legend Airlines, in Dallas, after a long legal battle to
get access to its similarly close-in airport, Love Field. He agreed
with other experts that an airline background is no longer
essential for the chief executive. ``You need airline experience,
but you don't have to have it individually, if you're a good leader
and manager and motivator.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson certainly has a reputation for making things work and
for making friends in the right places. He began BET with an
investment of $15,000, but was able to raise $10 million for his
fledgling company by selling stakes to communications giants like
Time Inc. and Taft Broadcasting. Over the years he has expanded
into restaurants, night clubs, magazines and an interactive Website
called BET.com. The privately-held company is now worth an
estimated $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob is a relentless and passionate entrepreneur who is very
smart,'' said Peter Barton, the former head of mergers and
acquisitions for TCI, the giant cable company that began carrying
BET on its cable systems in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He also has been politically well-connected. He has been a major
fund raiser for President Clinton and the Democratic Party and was
a close friend of former Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. This week he
attended a White House dinner for South African President Thabo
Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Wednesday that the parties will have 90 days to
complete the negotiations for the transfer of slots at Reagan
Airport, leases and other considerations from USAirways to DC Air.
He declined to say how much the final price would be, but declared
that he was not looking for outside investors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is some doubt, though, whether the merger and the spinoff
will pass muster with the federal government. Certainly it has
opponents, among them other airlines, like McArtor's, that would
like to divide up the slots at National among themselves. Some
consumer advocates agree.
</P>
<P>
   David S. Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Association,
which lobbies for consumers and offers discounts and safety
analyses of airlines, said that ensuring competition might be
better achieved by strengthening existing carriers at Reagan
National rather than setting up a new airline.The slots are public
assets, he said, like television broadcast licenses, and should be
distributed through a government-led process at which consumer
advocates and other companies could be held.
</P>
<P>
   United, he said, was being ``politically correct'' by setting up
a black-owned company, which, he said, might fail as Air Atlanta,
another airline managed by a black chief executive, did in 1987.
Airlines, he said, might represent ``an equal opportunity failure
mode.''

ONCE-SMUG DAD HUMBLED BY WEEK AS A SINGLE PARENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've always congratulated myself on being one of those men who
fully appreciate the labors of their wives. Catherine is a
free-lance editor and full-time mom, who also runs our household
with an efficiency that Lee Iaccoca in his heyday could never
aspire to. I have always freely conceded that her days are much
more demanding than mine.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't know the half of it. A few weeks back, my wife left
us for a week to attend the funeral of her aunt, leaving my
8-year-old son, Patrick, and me to fend for ourselves. By the time
she returned, I was droopy-limbed from exhaustion, physical and
mental. We will need a large addition to our house for the shrine I
plan on building to my wife.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, the same week would have been far less
demanding. Back then, I was perfectly content to let dirty dishes
pile up until no clean dishes were left. I washed bedding once a
year, whether the sheets needed it or not. A refrigerator was fully
stocked as long as it contained a 2-week-old carton of milk and a
half-full bottle of ketchup, which doubled as spaghetti sauce in a
pinch. (For those who haven't guessed, this was during
bachelorhood.)
</P>
<P>
   But after 10 years of marriage, some of Catherine's fastidious
(notice I didn't say anal-retentive) ways have rubbed off. While
she was gone, I washed the dishes immediately after my son and I
ate. I could not walk by our unmade bed, and I told my son to make
his, too (though he ignored me, for the most part, and a couple of
times I caved in and made it myself.) Two or three hundred times a
day, I wiped the counter free of bread crumbs and jelly. I vacuumed
the day before my wife got home. (I thought about cleaning the
bathrooms, but my own fastidiousness has its limits.) I bought real
groceries; cooked a couple of real meals (ham and cheese omelettes
one night, spaghetti another. My repertoire pretty much ends
there.) I did a couple of loads of laundry. I picked my son up from
school and drove him to hockey practice and violin lessons. I
checked his homework; helped him with spelling words; made him a
special breakfast the morning of his state achievement test; goaded
him into practicing his musical instrument; and laid out his
clothes in the morning, in an attempt to prevent a third-grade
fashion felony.
</P>
<P>
   I am out of breath now, just thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   What surprised me more than anything about that week was the
relentlessness of it. Running a house, even with standards as
meager as my own, there is always something to do. Always. Daily
private time with a book or television, time that I had come to
believe was my God-given entitlement, somehow vanished. By the time
Patrick had been put to bed, I had enough energy to read a few
paragraphs of a novel, or watch a few minutes of mindless
television. Normally a night owl, I was dead asleep each night by
10.
</P>
<P>
   So it's hard, this household duty. Harder than I ever knew. And
I haven't yet mentioned the most important task in the litany of
household-running: being emotionally present for a child when he
wakes up in the morning, or comes home from school each day. Was
Patrick nervous about the achievement test? Did he think about Aunt
Thelma, who had just died? Any trouble on the playground? I know I
asked these questions while my wife was gone, but it can be hard to
listen when thinking about a grocery list.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick and I did attend a Texas Rangers baseball game that
week, which was a wonderful break for us both. No vacuuming at The
Ballpark. There we could be just a couple of guys, hanging out, a
luxury we have when my wife is around. Have I said how happy I was
when she came home?
</P>
<P>
   I know Catherine loves her life, challenging as it is. For a
week, I loved it, too. With the challenges come immense rewards.
Washing a sink full of dishes carries its own sense of
accomplishment. Tucking Patrick in at night, knowing he felt safe
and cared for, even when his mom was gone _ well, few things in
life are better.
</P>
<P>
   But the week thoroughly depleted our reserves. How single
parents do it, I have no idea. And I caution any man who thinks he
appreciates his wife's exertions as household czarina. Until
recently, I was guilty of such smugness.
</P>
<P>
   Then she left for a week.

 MEDIA BYTES: AP HEARING PLENTY FROM JOURNALIST'S PEERS  &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A protest over a personnel move at the
Associated Press' San Francisco bureau was quelled this week _
though not by anything the AP did.
</P>
<P>
   Several Bay Area media outlets sent letters and petitions to the
AP, angry that veteran court reporter Bob Egelko had been
unceremoniously yanked from the legal beat.
</P>
<P>
   But before AP could even respond to the gripes, Egelko fled the
ranks, landing a job covering courts for the San Francisco
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   As Egelko put it, there's not a little irony in his new post.
After all, he was yet another victim of local real estate developer
Clint Reilly's lawsuit that seeks to block the sale of The
Chronicle to the Hearst Corp. _ the owners of the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Egelko covered the trial's opening day in federal district
court, but was not in the courtroom when Examiner Publisher Tim
White dropped the bombshell that he ``horse-traded'' the paper's
editorial coverage in exchange for Mayor Willie Brown's political
support of the Hearst acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the triggering event,'' Egelko conceded, while
declining to discuss the other reasons he was told he was pulled
from the beat. Egelko had been assigned to cover only the opening
arguments of the trial, and not sit through the testimony, so his
defenders wondered how he could be punished for following orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given whatever role the Examiner played in this, it's pretty
strange to end up there,'' Egelko said. ``Now my fate, like those
of so many others, depends on the outcome of this trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The new gig came about suddenly, Egelko said. He learned of his
demotion when he returned from vacation last Monday. The Examiner
called him Tuesday, and a week later _ on his 54th birthday _ he
took the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so unexpected and so welcomed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AP's San Francisco Bureau Chief Clay Haswell, a former editor of
the Contra Costa (Calif.) Times who came to the bureau last fall,
wouldn't discuss Egelko's situation at all. ``I don't discuss
personnel matters over the phone,'' Haswell said.
</P>
<P>
   Haswell received an earful from others in the media, including
reporters and editors at the legal newspapers the San Francisco
Daily Journal and the Recorder, The Chronicle, the Examiner, the
San Jose Mercury News and even the Los Angeles Times. Smaller
papers throughout the West, who depended on Egelko's coverage of
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, were also objecting.
</P>
<P>
   The letters expressed concern that AP will weaken its coverage
of the courts. ``He's been invaluable to us,'' said Philip
Carrizosa, editor of the Daily Journal. ``He's almost like a staff
writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrizosa conceded that he couldn't exactly ask that Egelko be
returned to the beat, as who gets what assignments is ``up to AP.''
</P>
<P>
   But what makes this case different from, say, a newspaper that
took a reporter off a longtime beat is the very nature of the AP:
It is a cooperative that is owned by the 1,500-plus newspapers that
it serves.
</P>
<P>
   Egelko, an attorney who has served 16 years on the court beat,
acknowledges that none of his rights were violated, and he was not
involved in any of the protests over his situation. But he was
deeply disappointed by the move.
</P>
<P>
   SALON'S NEW LOOK: Don't adjust your dial. Salon.com has
redesigned its site, and the new look comes with some glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Software bugs have kept some pictures from showing up, some
links are dead, and some of what appears on the site looks stale.
</P>
<P>
   But it's all getting fixed and should be humming along within
two to four weeks. Already, you can see a few new features on the
site. Most notably, Salon _ which made its name as a well-written
Internet magazine _ is adding sections devoted to those two popular
Internet topics, sex and business. (It's also adding a sports
column by the Wall Street Journal's Allen Barra. And it's beefing
up its e-commerce offerings.)
</P>
<P>
   Much of the content for the new Sex and Business sections was
already on Salon in different forms; the sex stuff was tucked into
the Health section, and Sean Elder's columns, which appeared in the
now-defunct Media section, will move to Business.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rosenberg, Salon's managing editor and vice president of
site development, hopes its beefed-up business and sex stories
aren't seen as mere pandering for eyeballs. ``Our hope, aspiration
and goal is that the highly literate journalism we do will be
maintained in these areas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Salon received plenty of e-mail reacting to the changes, not all
of it positive. It had so many complaints about the smaller type
size that it is reverting to the old easier-to-read type.
Ironically enough, Rosenberg said, people complained at the last
redesign that Salon was forfeiting an elegant look for a more
cluttered appearance; people again think the site is chucking a
clean design for something more cluttered.
</P>
<P>
   Which I guess goes to prove that even on the Internet, people
are resistant to change.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN THE REVOLUTION COMES: In the 1960s, rock 'n' roll was
revolutionary and Rolling Stone was there to report on it. Now rock
and Rolling Stone are big businesses and Brisbane, Calif.'s Imagine
Media thinks it has found the next revolution in search of a
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, the publisher of Business 2.0 and a number of computer
game publications, plans to launch Revolution, a magazine about
dance music spun by DJs at nightclubs across the country.
</P>
<P>
   That music _ and, in turn, the magazine _ is fostered by the
Internet, and the growing popularity of swapping songs digitally.
Editor in Chief Neil Feineman had a hard time defining the music,
as it crosses many genres; a good way to get a feel for the
magazine is to check out its Web-site-in-waiting, at
 &LR; www.planetrevolution.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The first issue of Revolution will appear on the July 4 weekend,
weighing in at 128 pages. Imagine plans a big splash, with launch
parties in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The company
won't say where the June 22 San Francisco party will be, only that
it will be big, that it will be in a place that hasn't hosted a
party before and that the place could be called ``the glass
palace.'' (E-mail me if you have a clue!)
</P>
<P>
   The magazine is aiming for a circulation of 250,000, and
ultimately thinks it could take on rock icons such as Rolling Stone
_ much as the songs of Internet-savvy artists like Moby are
challenging the dominance of the traditional rock industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance music has gone from a small divided niche subculture to
one with a huge place in the mainstream that has not been reported,
or is underreported,'' Feineman said. DJs are drawing thousands of
people in clubs from New York to Boulder, Colo., from Miami to
Omaha, Neb., he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for a magazine that puts a face on dance culture,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine represents a challenge for Imagine, which hasn't
tackled the mass market in this fashion before. But it will have
one innovation that draws inspiration from Imagine's computer game
titles: Each issue will come with a CD or two, featuring hot music
and links to artist Web sites.

WAYARD ALBATROSS IN NEW JERSEY MAY BE JUST LOOKING FOR LOVE
</HEADLINE>
 By E. VERNON LAUX   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A wayward yellow-nosed albatross that apparently strayed from
its marine habitat in the Southern Hemisphere has turned up in the
New York metropolitan area, and has even been spotted flying along
the median strip of the Garden State Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   The albatross _ a seagoing species with wingspans up to 7 feet _
is usually found in the South Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and is
an extreme rarity in the North Atlantic. But recently, bird experts
have been astonished by reports that an albatross has been seen
visiting estuaries and shorelines in the Northeast and sitting on
local beaches with sea gulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bird is doing exactly what it should be doing, only in
the wrong ocean and at the wrong time of year. The dude is
confused,'' said Peter Alden, a noted ornithologist from Concord,
Mass., who called the bird's trip through the region ``unparalleled
and unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The distinctive bird was first reported by two biologists
monitoring terns on Penikese Island, in Buzzards Bay off
Massachusetts, on May 9. It seems to have been making its way south
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But bird-lovers should not count on a close-up view. Unlike New
Jersey motorists, the albatross does not interrupt its travels
frequently. In fact, it comes to land only to find a mate, lay an
egg and raise another albatross.
</P>
<P>
   The albatross may have thought it found a willing partner off
Long Island. Several rangers at the Fire Island National Seashore
were amazed to discover it sitting in a group of herring gulls on
the ocean beach on May 15. They were able to photograph the bird
before it flew out to sea shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, early in the afternoon of May 21, Shawneen
Finnegan of Cape May, N.J., who is well-known in birding circles,
was driving along the Garden State Parkway just south of Shellbay
Landing in Cape May County when she spotted an albatross flying
along the median strip in a group of laughing gulls.
</P>
<P>
   After this sighting, no one knew where to look for such a
bizarre-acting albatross. But it apparently turned up again Monday
evening, on the New Jersey side of Delaware Bay. More than 30
birders got a good look at it at Reeds Beach and Highs Beach. At
this time of year, horseshoe crabs come ashore in abundance to lay
their eggs, which are a culinary treat for shore birds.
</P>
<P>
   The bird's travels to the Northeast may have left it somewhat
disoriented. In its natural habitat in the Southern Hemisphere, it
is now fall.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledgeable birders, including Paul Lehman, a former editor of
Birding magazine and Finnegan's husband, said the albatross
appeared to have taken up with colonies of laughing gulls on the
New Jersey shore, near Stone Harbor, and was flying with them
across the narrow tip of Cape May.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, hundreds of birders gathered along the bay shore,
hoping for a glimpse of the albatross, only to be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Albatrosses are notable not only for their size, but for their
life span, as they can often survive several decades. In fact,
there is some speculation that the bird spotted recently may be the
same one that was spotted in Buzzards Bay 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory is that the albatross _ known for dynamic soaring
in high winds _ was transplanted with the help of a hurricane and
remained in the Northern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Its travels along the coast and the fact that it seems to be
spending its time with other shore birds suggest it is looking for
a mate.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, birders say, it is in for a lonely summer.

 COMPUTING Q&AMP;A: E-BILLING SERVICES HAVE MANY PLUSES  &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I've been paying my bills electronically for several years using
Quicken. Now I'm hearing that it may be easier if I use an online
bill-paying service. Is this true, and if it is, which services are
the best?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Bill-paying services are springing up all over the Internet, and
some of them are pretty good. Among the best _ PayMyBills.com,
Statusfactory.com and Paytrust. All of them alert you when your
bills are due and give you the option of paying them automatically.
You can view bills from the past year online. And they let you
download records of your transactions into Quicken or Microsoft
Money. Expect to pay about $9 a month for up to 25 payments.
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth switching from the bill-paying system you already
have? Maybe not. If you're satisfied with your Quicken service, it
might be best to stick with it. Same thing goes if you pay bills on
the Internet directly through your bank. But if you like the idea
of total automation, an online service could be just the thing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Linux Suites Available
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'm really tempted to give Linux a shot (I have an older PC
that's just sitting around that I could install it on). The
question is, are there any decent applications yet for Linux? I'd
like to do word processing and use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: There are at least three office suites now available for Linux _
WordPerfect Office 2000, Applixware Office and StarOffice. All
include the usual office-suite components like a word processor,
spreadsheet and presentation program. The only real difference _
WordPerfect and Applixware will cost you (under $100 each), while
StarOffice is offered free from Sun Microsystems, which acquired
its maker last summer.
</P>
<P>
   I've been test driving a Windows version of StarOffice, and it's
pretty cool. Not as robust as Microsoft Office, but the word
processor is just dandy. You can open and save files in Microsoft
Word format, which lets you exchange documents with other Word
users. And, the best part _ it's free.
</P>
<P>
   For Web surfing, you'll need a Linux-based browser, and here
again you can get a good one gratis. Netscape offers a free Linux
version of its Communicator at  &LR; www.netscape.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Pick Hard Drive by Price
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'm considering getting a second hard drive for my PC. Is there
anything else besides price to consider when shopping for one?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Some drives run faster than others _ 7,200 rpm vs. 5,400 rpm,
for instance. But today's hard drives are so fast that performance
differences for common tasks are minor. And don't worry about brand
names, because any hard drive designed for a Windows PC should work
in your system.
</P>
<P>
   So, yeah, the only real consideration should be price. And
prices for hard drives have never been lower. In fact, CompUSA this
week is advertising a 20-gigabyte drive for $130.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Icons Are Movable
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: In Windows is there a way I can place the desktop icons wherever
I want and have them stay there? Right now, every time I try to
move an icon it pops back into position like a buck private bucking
for a promotion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Your problem is that your system is using Windows' Auto Arrange
feature, which puts all the icons in nice, tidy columns. But it's
an easy problem to fix. Just right-click any empty area of the
desktop, point to Arrange Icons and click Auto Arrange to deselect
it. Then you can put your icons anywhere you want.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ADDRESS UPDATE: Several readers wrote in with an easier way to
clear the Location bar list in Netscape than the procedure I
described last week. Choose Preferences from the Edit menu, click
the Navigator category, and click Clear Location Bar at the bottom
of the window.
</P>
<P>
   One reader also suggested a free program called Communicator
Clear, which can automatically erase your Netscape history list,
cache files, location bar list, and cookie files each time you exit
your browser. You can download it at  &LR; www.hotfiles.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Ever worked on a really long document in Microsoft Word and
become frustrated when you had to scroll up and down to see
different parts of it? Try splitting the Word window in two. There
are a couple of ways to do this. Here's one: With your document
open, go to the Window menu and choose Split. Then drag the
demarcation line to where you want it and click to set it. This
will give you upper and lower windows, both of which contain your
document. You can scroll the windows individually. What's more, you
can edit the document in either window. Cool? You bet.

 DIGITAL CAMERAS COMING OF AGE  &HT;     By BECKY WARING 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Vacation season is upon us, and if you've been
sitting on the fence about buying a digital camera, now might be
the time to jump off.
</P>
<P>
   A new class of 3.3-megapixel models finally rivals good 35mm
film cameras in both image quality and features, while offering all
the advantages of digital-easy transfer to your computer for
cropping and editing, and the ability to share photos on the Web.
Even better, you can join the party for as little as $750.
</P>
<P>
   If that still seems like a lot, remember that there are no film
or processing costs with a digital camera, saving a lot of money
down the road for a little more up front.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras in this class include the Canon PowerShot S20, the Casio
QV-3000EX/3000Plus, the FujiFilm FinePix 4700, the Nikon CoolPix
990 and the Sony DSC-S70. For this review, I tried out the new
Olympus Camedia C-3000 ($799) and its big brother, the C-3030
($999). Olympus has a well-deserved reputation for making top-notch
digital as well as analog cameras, and these two lived up to their
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the many computer- and electronics-oriented companies
that have waded into the digital camera market, Olympus truly
understands the needs of the 35mm camera crowd and has taken pains
to make its digital cameras look, feel and operate as much like
traditional analog cameras as possible. The shape, size, weight and
control placements of the C-3000 and C-3030 all echo those of a
35mm model.
</P>
<P>
   The main differences are that the batteries and memory card go
where you would normally load film, and there is an LCD screen with
menu control buttons on the back. All very intuitive. I was able to
take my first pics without reading the manual, and they turned out
great.
</P>
<P>
   For any camera, however, the bottom line is picture quality. To
that end, both Olympus models have everything you would expect in a
good analog camera: excellent 32-96mm zoom lenses, full auto or
manual exposure controls (in either shutter or aperture priority,
with auto-bracketing), auto or manual white balance (corrects for
fluorescent, tungsten or outdoor lighting conditions), auto-focus
from eight inches to infinity, matrix and spot-metering, and a
self-timer.
</P>
<P>
   The C-3030 also allows manual focusing. Both cameras come with
remote controls and have flash mounts as well as built-in flash, so
you can attach a high-power bounce flash.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the 35mm camera parallels, the juicy part comes when
you start exploring the digital capabilities of these cameras. Both
Camedias offer 15 different combinations of image resolution and
compression, so you can snap pictures in everything from full
2,048-by-1,536 pixel uncompressed mode down to 640-by-480 JPEG
compressed. (Compressed images save disk space at the expense of
some fine detail.)
</P>
<P>
   At the highest quality, even an 8-by-10 print will look great.
The lowest quality is perfect for shots destined for the Web.
</P>
<P>
   If you're shooting family photos for posterity, go with the
2,048-by-1,536 HQ JPEG mode. While only 20 HQ pics will fit on the
16MB SmartMedia card that comes with the C-3030 (10 on the C-3000's
8MB card), the quality and detail are worth it. We highly recommend
buying a couple of extra SmartMedia cards for either camera, so you
can take it on vacation without having to download pics along the
way. Extra 32MB cards that hold 40 HQ pics will set you back about
$70 each. Another handy add-on is a USB SmartCard reader, about
$55.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't need such high-quality pics, storage space becomes
much less of an issue. A 16MB card holds 165 standard quality
640-by-480 JPEG pics, more than enough for purposes like online
auction photos, Web site illustrations and e-mailing to friends.
Think about what you will be using the picture for before you take
it, and choose a resolution accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.8-inch LCD panel on the back lets you preview shots (you
can even use it instead of the viewfinder), as well as see the pics
you've already taken. It's also where you'll find the menus for
settings like resolution, white balance and flash mode.
</P>
<P>
   Just be warned that it draws a lot of power. If you expect to
use it a lot, keep extra batteries on hand. Better yet, use the
optional rechargeables or power adapter.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that sets the C-3030 apart from the competition (and
the C-3000) is its recording speed.
</P>
<P>
   With 32MB of internal RAM, it can take 3.3 pictures per second
in a special five-shot sequence mode, or one second between shots
in normal operation. Most cameras in this class (including the
C-3000) make you wait at least two seconds from shot to shot while
images are recorded to the card, a big disadvantage when you are
trying to capture fast motion or fleeting baby moments. Shooting
speed remains one of the primary advantages of analog cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Both cameras also have the really neat ability to capture short
movie and sound clips, as well as still pictures. The C-3000 can
shoot a full minute of 160x120 video with sound at 15 fps, or 15
seconds at 320x240.
</P>
<P>
   The C-3030, with its bigger RAM and media card, supports 191
seconds and 46 seconds, respectively. Movies are saved in QuickTime
Motion-JPEG format. Another option is to record up to four seconds
of audio after a still picture, a handy way to identify pictures or
capture your kids' words to go with their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the pictures and movies into your computer is amazingly
easy, and both PCs and Macs are fully supported. You simply install
the software, and attach the USB cable between the camera and
computer (an optional serial cable is available for the PC).
</P>
<P>
   Then, when you open the Camedia software, thumbnails of all the
pics on the card show up in a window. You can perform simple
editing tasks within the Camedia software, as well as stitch
panoramic images together (a great way to capture especially tall
or wide scenes).
</P>
<P>
   But both packages also include excellent image-editing software:
the consumer-oriented Adobe PhotoDeluxe for the C-3000 and the
pro-level Adobe Photoshop LE for the C-3030.
</P>
<P>
   While we quickly got addicted to the C-3030 due to its larger
card and faster shooting speed, most features and capabilities of
the two cameras are the same. If you're on a budget, choose the
C-3000. If you can afford the extra $200, go for the C-3030. Both
are great cameras that will make the transition from 35mm to
digital as painless as possible.

 AN EARFUL OF INTERNET  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Diane Paulsen was worried that her vacation in
Los Angeles would be rained out after beginning the drive from San
Francisco in a storm.
</P>
<P>
   To alleviate her concerns, she called the Internet. She spoke to
a computer that understands verbal commands and was ``told'' in an
automated voice that the weather in Southern California was balmy.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen companies have launched or are developing
so-called voice portals that allow people to listen to parts of the
Internet by telephone. Consumers use speech instead of a computer
mouse to navigate information like weather, sports, restaurants,
traffic reports and movie reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The primary goal is to give cellular phone users access to the
Internet with minimal hassles. Companies claim that it is more
convenient for people on the road to have the Web read to them than
to bother with the tiny screens and buttons on wireless devices
like Internet enabled telephones and Palm handheld units.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of companies at the starting gate,'' said Dana
Thorat, a consumer technology analyst for IDC, a market research
company. ``These services will work especially well for mobile road
warriors who are looking for specific things like an Italian
restaurant within 10 miles.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains whether voice portals will be popular
enough to be profitable. With such a crowded field of competing
companies and little known about consumer demand, their futures are
unclear, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the dramatic growth of the voice portal industry are
improvements in speech-recognition technology. For the most part,
users can now navigate the services without being misunderstood by
the computers that operate them.
</P>
<P>
   Executives invariably mention the 85 million cellular telephones
used in the United States as a sign of their industry's potential.
If only a small percentage of those were used to dial into voice
portals, executives say, the revenue would be substantial.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of how popular these services could be are
newspaper telephone hotlines, which have offered some of the same
information from satellite feeds for years. For example, The
Chronicle's free touch-tone telephone service, Cityline, gets
nearly 400,000 calls a month.
</P>
<P>
   However, voice portal company executives say their services are
easier to use, safer for drivers and offer more features. Indeed,
some companies already allow consumers to be connected to
restaurants, get driving directions, make free long-distance
telephone calls and browse flight information.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk to consumers, they say, `I don't want to call in
and surf the Web and listen to long news reports,' '' said Amol
Joshi, co-founder and vice president of products for BeVocal, a
voice portal in Santa Clara, Calif., that will be launched in the
Bay Area in a few weeks, but is now available on a trial basis.
``They want to call for something specific and personalized like
directions to the nearest Federal Express box and the time of the
latest pickup.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of other voice portals like Talk2 of Salt Lake City,
Utah, and Internet Speech of San Jose, Calif., believe differently.
They are working on technology that reads all Web pages, minus the
links and graphics, not just the limited selection offered by other
companies like BeVocal.
</P>
<P>
   To use a voice portal, consumers usually call a toll-free number
and say a keyword of their choice like ``restaurants.'' A recorded
voice usually asks more specific questions like ``what city'' and
``what kind of food.''
</P>
<P>
   After responding, the users are given a list of choices,
addresses and in some cases reviews. To search another topic, users
must say something like ``go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulsen, the Los Angeles-bound woman who searched for a weather
report, said the voice portal she used, Quack.com of Sunnyvale,
Calif., is relatively easy to navigate, though it has one
shortcoming _ it lists only restaurants in Minneapolis; others
could be added in the future.
</P>
<P>
   How voice portals plan to make money varies. Most are free,
though users must be willing to listen to short commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Companies expect to supplement their advertising revenue with
fees for connecting users to online commerce sites and partnerships
with telecommunications companies. For example, Tellme Networks, a
Mountain View, Calif., voice portal available to the public for
testing, announced a $60 million deal with AT&AMP;T on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Companies also hope to make money by building voice portals for
other firms. For example, Quack.com said this week that it would
build a similar service for Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   But there are potential barriers to the industry's success, at
least in the short term. Andrew Seybold, editor of the Outlook, a
monthly newsletter about mobile and wireless technologies, said the
services do not work well when users call from a noisy location
like an airport and do not yet allow access to important
information like appointment calendars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is not quite ready for prime time,'' Seybold
said. ``It's going to be a few years before they get this right.''
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the automated voice is another concern. Companies
use recorded human voices when possible but rely on computer speech
for reading some content.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk with voice is pretty high,'' said Mohan Vishwanath,
vice president for wireless technology at Yahoo, which is planning
its own voice portal. ``If it doesn't sound right, people will turn
it off.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, relatively few people know that voice portals exist,
and many of those who do use them do so infrequently. Like the
Internet industry a few years ago, voice portals must teach
consumers that they need their services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be a lot of occasional use like people
sitting in a parking lot trying to find out where to go to lunch,''
Seybold said. ``I don't think people will use it a lot. But it
depends mostly on how good the service is.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCue, chief executive of Tellme Networks, said his company
is one of the few trying to attract all kinds of consumers, not
just ones with cellular telephones. He expects people without
computers and those who don't want to go through the hassle of
logging on will use the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going after normal everyday people,'' McCue said. ``Not
superwired people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, nearly everyone agrees that Internet enabled
wireless telephones and, for that matter, personal computers, will
survive the voice portal phenomenon. Automated voices take a
relatively long time to read large amounts of text out loud and
cannot describe graphics.
</P>
<P>
   One consumer who is pleased with her voice portal is Juliette
Silvers, a blind woman from Minneapolis. She uses Quack about once
a week, usually to check the weather because she finds it more
accurate than a touch-tone phone service that she sometimes calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that they aren't charging for it,'' Silvers
said. ``It's very easy to use. You don't even think of it as a
computer.''

 DIGITAL CAMERAS COMING OF AGE  &HT;     By BECKY WARING 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Vacation season is upon us, and if you've been
sitting on the fence about buying a digital camera, now might be
the time to jump off.
</P>
<P>
   A new class of 3.3-megapixel models finally rivals good 35mm
film cameras in both image quality and features, while offering all
the advantages of digital-easy transfer to your computer for

990 and the Sony DSC-S70. For this review, I tried out the new

TRADE BILL FOR CHINA WINS EASILY IN HOUSE 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House approved permanent trading privileges for
China Wednesday by a substantial margin, handing President Clinton
the biggest foreign policy victory of his second term and ending a
long, hard-fought battle over the issue between organized labor and
corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which would end Congress' annual review of
China's trade status in return for Beijing opening its vast markets
to hundreds of U.S. goods and services, passed 237-197.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-three Democrats joined with 164 Republicans to give
supporters 19 more than the 218 votes needed for victory.
</P>
<P>
   The measure next month is expected to pass easily in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the House vote, Clinton, who spent the day doing
some last-minute arm-twisting to secure wavering Democrats,
predicted the legislation would reap huge economic benefits for
Americans by creating more jobs through increased U.S. exports and
imports from China.
</P>
<P>
   But he also stressed its importance as a tool to help ease China
toward more social and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be exporting more than our products. ... By this
agreement we will also export one of our most cherished values _
economic freedom,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``America will continue to defend our interests, but at this
stage in China's development we will have more positive influence
with an outstretched hand than with a clenched fist. The House
today has affirmed that belief.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure could boost the sales in China of hundreds of
American products ranging from agricultural goods, oil field
equipment and chemicals to telecommunications and financial
services.
</P>
<P>
   In return for lowering its own tariffs in a wide variety of
categories, Washington would guarantee the same normal trade breaks
to Beijing that are now enjoyed by most other U.S. trading
partners. Up until now, the lower tariff treatment has been
extended to China on a year-to-year basis, pending an annual review
by Congress of the country's human rights record and its dealings
with other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Extending the lower tariffs and other breaks on a permanent
basis would also help speed up China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, which sets and enforces the rules of global commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese membership in the WTO would also allow U.S. businesses
to take advantage of other market-opening concessions that Beijing
would be forced to make as a condition of joining the global
trading partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Entry into the WTO has been a long-sought goal of the Chinese
leadership, and Beijing would have likely gained access without the
support of the United States. But the Clinton administration
maintained that without a bilateral trade agreement prior to
China's entry into the WTO, American businesses would lose
potentially valuable markets to the European Union, which struck a
new trade agreement with Beijing just last week.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Houston, said the fact that China would
still have been allowed into the WTO no matter how the vote went
Wednesday was instrumental in some members deciding to support
permanent trade status. He said the legislation gives the United
States more leverage and protections on trade issues than it would
have gotten under normal WTO partnership rules.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, China hailed the ``wise'' vote by the House. But the
official Xinhua news agency quoted a Trade Ministry spokesman as
saying provisions in the U.S. trade bill setting up a commission to
monitor China's human rights record were ``unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the debate began Wednesday in Washington, opponents
of the measure acknowledged that the fight was over. Nonetheless,
they continued to urge colleagues to rethink their positions as
they offered impassioned speeches condemning Beijing's long record
of human rights abuses and its disdain for labor and environmental
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, one of five lawmakers in the
30-member Texas delegation to vote against the measure, called
China ``a great country'' that has contributed much to the world.
But he scoffed at claims that increased trade with the United
States has led China's communist regime to relax its oppressive
control over its people.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 20 years of special trade treatment by the United
States, Green said China's human rights records is still
``abysmal'' and getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, and other supporters
said the bill would open up China's huge markets to U.S. companies
and do more to promote democratic change than the current annual
review process, which usually amounts to nothing more a divisive
debate in the House over human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade,'' she said, ``is the engine of democracy throughout the
world.'' Without improved trading relations, she said, America
stands little chance of influencing Beijing's actions.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to attract more support for the bill, the president
worked closely with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill
Archer, R-Houston, and other Republican leaders to target wavering
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Members, particularly Democrats, were summoned to the White
House for one-on-one sessions with the president. Many were willing
to support permanent trading privileges for China in return for
help from the president on local issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also picked up additional support, by working with House
Speaker Dennis Hastert. R-Ill., to hammer out a new community
development and job creation initiative that will help form new
public-private business partnerships in depressed inner city and
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers were also won over after Republican leaders
agreed to a provision in the bill that would establish a
congressional watchdog commission to monitor human rights abuses in
China and to recommend trade sanctions if necessary. The GOP
leadership also included another provision designed to prevent
import surges from China, which opponents fear will happen as soon
as the president signs the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, three Democrats in the Texas delegation and two
Republicans voted against the bill. In addition to Green, the
Democrats were Ciro Rodriguez of San Antonio and Nick Lampson of
Beaumont. The Republicans were Joe Barton of Ennis and Ron Paul of
Surfside. Paul had committed to vote for the bill, but changed his
mind late Tuesday because of the changes made in the bill to
attract more support.
</P>
<P>
   As the 15-minute voting process began in the House, Rep. Max
Sandlin, D-Marshall, was the only Texan who was still undecided. He
stood in the back of the chamber, talking alternately to both
supporters and opponents of the bill. With 10 seconds to go, he
stepped forward and voted for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents argued that the China trade bill would end up
costing Americans jobs while rewarding a brutal regime that uses
forced abortions, imprisonment and forced labor to maintain its
control over the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
   Bitter over their defeat, some labor leaders warned supporters
of the legislation that they could face union opposition in the
November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has turned its back on the American manufacturing
base and America's working families,'' said James P. Hoffa,
president of the Teamsters Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are Teamster families in every congressional district in
America, and those families vote,'' he added. ``Those who would
oppose these families have done so at their own political peril.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential
contender, said in a statement after the vote that the legislation
``will mean a stronger American economy, as well as more
opportunity for liberty and freedom in China.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill has not played a major role in the presidential race
since it is supported by both Bush and Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic presidential contender.

</P>
<P>
   BARRY LOOMS AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Marion Barry, once the very popular, very visible and very
controversial mayor of Washington, is telling friends he may run
again, this time for a seat on the city council. Though out of
office for 14 months, Barry still has a large political following
in the city. But should he run, he faces a couple of major
obstacles: The person who holds the council seat Barry is eyeing
has no intention of going quietly, and the present mayor, Anthony
Williams, said he will support Barry in just about anything except
a return to city office.
</P>
<P>
   Barry served on the city council before being elected mayor, an
incumbency notable, among other things, for his imprisonment on a
drug conviction. On his release, he was elected once more to the
city council and capped his comeback by being elected mayor again.
Williams was elected mayor by campaigning largely against
mismanagement and overspending in the Barry era.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Brazil, the council incumbent Barry may challenge,
announced last week that he was running for re-election so that he
could help the city continue its recovery.

<P>
   Taking his campaign to the major swing state of Michigan, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas declared Wednesday in Detroit that
education was ``the new civil right.'' With Michigan's popular
Republican governor, John Engler, at his side, Bush spent more than
an hour discussing the importance of equal access to education with
students, teachers, parents and volunteers at the Cornerstone
Schools, a private religion-oriented group of middle and elementary
schools. ``We can't have any gaps of hope in the country,'' Bush
said. ``The American dream is available for everyone, which means
every child must be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he also believed character education courses should be
available in every school. ``Public schools should not mix religion
in the classroom.'' he said, ``but we should not fear teaching
values that are embraced by all religions.''

HOUSE PASSES CHINA TRADE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES POPE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House, by a surprisingly comfortable margin,
Wednesday agreed to normalize trade relations with China, bringing
the United States within reach of a new and potentially lucrative
relationship with a nation of 1.3 billion consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The 237-197 vote to give China permanent normal trade status
provided President Clinton and business interests with a hard-won
victory on their top legislative priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``For China, this agreement will clearly increase the benefits
of cooperation and the costs of confrontation,'' Clinton said.
``America, of course, will continue to defend our interests, but at
this stage in China's development we will have more positive
influence with an outstretched hand than with a clenched fist.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Washington state lawmakers and businesses strongly endorsed
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Co. Chairman Phil Condit said approval helps ``pave the
way for China to join the World Trade Organization and, in so
doing, will strengthen the rules-based, global trading system so
essential to the future of all of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also will stabilize the U.S.-China relationship in ways
that will create a solid foundation for resolving other important
issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It this had not passed, it would have been a devastating
defeat for United States leadership in world trade,'' said Rep.
Norm Dicks, D-Wash. ``And if we hadn't won today, Airbus (a major
competitor to Boeing) would have had an open shot at the $120
billion airline market in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also lobbied heavily for passage of the bill, saying
China will be the second-largest market for personal computers by
the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Davis, a Port of Seattle commissioner and president of
the Washington Council on International Trade, said she was
``jubilant'' over the result. ``It means opportunity for almost
every sector in this state,'' including aerospace, agriculture,
high-tech and natural resources including forest products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunities are there,'' she said, adding that the
agreement also means opportunities for reform to take hold in
China.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote was a major setback for many labor unions, human
rights groups and consumer advocates who fiercely opposed the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has turned its back on the American manufacturing
base and America's working families. ... There are Teamster
families in every congressional district in America, and those
families vote,'' said Teamsters President James P. Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   If the trade bill is approved by the Senate, as expected, China
would be required to open its borders to more U.S. goods, services
and agriculture. It would have to lower tariffs on U.S. products
from an average of 25 percent to 9 percent by 2005 and conform to
global trading rules.
</P>
<P>
   While supporters said every corner of the country would benefit,
Washington state is poised to reap especially large rewards because
of its location as a gateway to the Pacific Rim and because of
China's strong demand for the products of the state's major
industries. Supporters also said the measure would incubate social
change and democracy in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will allow us to export not only commodities but
democracy,'' said Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout three hours of impassioned debate, opponents claimed
that giving China permanent normal trade status would cost U.S.
jobs and reward a country for abusing human rights. California
Democrat Nancy Pelosi chided members for ``putting deals above
ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dicks said a defeat would have seriously undercut the United
States' status in world trade as well as put major U.S.
manufacturers at a serious disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., said ``engaging China as a
willing and confident trade partner and taking our message to her
people will prove, time and time again, to be the right course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As one of the most trade-dependent states in the nation, the
best thing we can do for our farmers and farm communities is to
open up new export markets and help level the playing field,'' said
Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash. ``China is a significant market for our
state's products, like apples and wheat, and today's vote takes a
significant step toward making sure other products can share in
that success.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the eventual margin, the outcome was in doubt as late as
Tuesday despite furious lobbying by Clinton, business interests and
Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., who led the opposition, told his
colleagues during a floor speech that awarding China normal trade
status would perpetuate harsh working conditions and pay that
averages ``three cents an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're told we need this trade deal to open vast new markets
for American goods,'' Bonior said. ``But these Chinese workers
can't even afford to buy the products they make themselves. ...
Americans value trade, but we're not willing to trade in our
values.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, lawmakers decided that the United States
will enhance democracy and improve human rights by accellerating
trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Tex.
said after the vote, ``you get to work in a very special way for
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the votes against the measure came from Democrats, but
all five of Washington state's Democrat lawmakers voted for the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not view trade with China and the advocacy of human
rights issues as contradictory,'' said Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash.
``The best foreign policy tools available to encourage political
reform abroad are policies that promote capitalism and market
reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure moves next month to the Senate where its support is
both deep and wide, including the backing of Washington's Slade
Gorton and Patty Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the opportunity to review what the House has sent us,
but then I expect us to take our turn at bat,'' said Senate Finance
Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del.
</P>
<P>
   The ride won't be completely free of bumps.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, asserted that ``I do not intend to allow the
Senate to simply rubber-stamp the president's plan to reward the
Chinese Communists in Beijing.'' He promised ``votes _ perhaps
uncomfortable votes _ on a range of issues relating to China.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Helms' threat, Senate leaders said they are confident
the bill will pass and be forwarded quickly to Clinton for his
signature.
</P>
<P>

INVESTIGATORS IDENTIFY SECURITY BREACHES AT SEVERAL U.S. AGENCIES
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Flashing fake police badges that were movie props
and other bogus law enforcement identifications, undercover
investigators effortlessly entered 19 sensitive federal buildings
including the CIA, the FBI, the Pentagon and the Justice Department
where the investigators sauntered into the attorney general's
fifth-floor suite of offices.
</P>
<P>
   The examination of security, performed by the General Accounting
Office at the request of Republican lawmakers from the House of
Representatives, was described on Tuesday in private briefings to
the agencies and will be the subject of a congressional hearing on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In written testimony prepared for the hearing, the GAO
investigators said they made the counterfeit identification cards
from software that is easily obtainable from the Internet. They
said they also claimed to be armed and carried satchels into the
buildings that were never searched or passed through metal
detectors and were large enough to carry explosives, chemical or
biological weapons or listening devices.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said they were able to roam unescorted through
most of the buildings, including at the State and Justice
departments. In all, the investigators were able to penetrate 19
buildings and two airports using the phony badges and
identifications, though at three of the buildings, they had to try
twice before getting in.
</P>
<P>
   They also managed to park a van in the courtyard of the Justice
Department without having its contents examined.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers who disclosed the results of the inquiry
Wednesday said that it highlighted significant and systemic
security problems that continue to plague the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the State Department has been reeling from a
series of security lapses, including the disappearance of a laptop
computer that contained highly sensitive files concerning
intelligence sources and weapons proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Before that incident, officials discovered an eavesdropping
device in a State Department conference room and expelled a Russian
diplomat from the country. And in 1998, a man in a tweed sport coat
strolled into the executive secretary's office, six doors down from
the secretary of state's office, and left with sheaves of
classified documents while two secretaries worked nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a shocking report revealing a dangerous vulnerability
plaguing thousands of people who work in our public buildings,''
said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who heads the House Judiciary
Committee. ``Complacency in matters of security is a serious threat
to the orderly functioning of our government.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., who asked the accounting office to
perform the review, said the inquiry had demonstrated ``that far
too many of our security facilities where top secret and sensitive
information is kept have an open door policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they were troubled by the findings
and had already undertaken to correct the security lapses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the attempts to come into the department have
caused concern,'' said Gretchen Michael, a spokeswoman for the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Michael said the department had adjusted its security procedures
as a result of the inquiry, which she said could not be disclosed
for security reasons.

ONCE-SMUG DAD HUMBLED BY WEEK AS A SINGLE PARENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've always congratulated myself on being one of those men who
fully appreciate the labors of their wives. Catherine is a
free-lance editor and full-time mom, who also runs our household
with an efficiency that Lee Iaccoca in his heyday could never
aspire to. I have always freely conceded that her days are much
more demanding than mine.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't know the half of it. A few weeks back, my wife left
us for a week to attend the funeral of her aunt, leaving my
8-year-old son, Patrick, and me to fend for ourselves. By the time
she returned, I was droopy-limbed from exhaustion, physical and
mental. We will need a large addition to our house for the shrine I
plan on building to my wife.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, the same week would have been far less
demanding. Back then, I was perfectly content to let dirty dishes
pile up until no clean dishes were left. I washed bedding once a
year, whether the sheets needed it or not. A refrigerator was fully
stocked as long as it contained a 2-week-old carton of milk and a
half-full bottle of ketchup, which doubled as spaghetti sauce in a
pinch. (For those who haven't guessed, this was during
bachelorhood.)
</P>
<P>
   But after 10 years of marriage, some of Catherine's fastidious
(notice I didn't say anal-retentive) ways have rubbed off. While
she was gone, I washed the dishes immediately after my son and I
ate. I could not walk by our unmade bed, and I told my son to make
his, too (though he ignored me, for the most part, and a couple of
times I caved in and made it myself.) Two or three hundred times a
day, I wiped the counter free of bread crumbs and jelly. I vacuumed
the day before my wife got home. (I thought about cleaning the
bathrooms, but my own fastidiousness has its limits.) I bought real
groceries; cooked a couple of real meals (ham and cheese omelettes
one night, spaghetti another. My repertoire pretty much ends
there.) I did a couple of loads of laundry. I picked my son up from
school and drove him to hockey practice and violin lessons. I
checked his homework; helped him with spelling words; made him a
special breakfast the morning of his state achievement test; goaded
him into practicing his musical instrument; and laid out his
clothes in the morning, in an attempt to prevent a third-grade
fashion felony.
</P>
<P>
   I am out of breath now, just thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   What surprised me more than anything about that week was the
relentlessness of it. Running a house, even with standards as
meager as my own, there is always something to do. Always. Daily
private time with a book or television, time that I had come to
believe was my God-given entitlement, somehow vanished. By the time
Patrick had been put to bed, I had enough energy to read a few
paragraphs of a novel, or watch a few minutes of mindless
television. Normally a night owl, I was dead asleep each night by
10.
</P>
<P>
   So it's hard, this household duty. Harder than I ever knew. And
I haven't yet mentioned the most important task in the litany of
household-running: being emotionally present for a child when he
wakes up in the morning, or comes home from school each day. Was
Patrick nervous about the achievement test? Did he think about Aunt
Thelma, who had just died? Any trouble on the playground? I know I
asked these questions while my wife was gone, but it can be hard to
listen when thinking about a grocery list.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick and I did attend a Texas Rangers baseball game that
week, which was a wonderful break for us both. No vacuuming at The
Ballpark. There we could be just a couple of guys, hanging out, a
luxury we have when my wife is around. Have I said how happy I was
when she came home?
</P>
<P>
   I know Catherine loves her life, challenging as it is. For a
week, I loved it, too. With the challenges come immense rewards.
Washing a sink full of dishes carries its own sense of
accomplishment. Tucking Patrick in at night, knowing he felt safe
and cared for, even when his mom was gone _ well, few things in
life are better.
</P>
<P>
   But the week thoroughly depleted our reserves. How single
parents do it, I have no idea. And I caution any man who thinks he
appreciates his wife's exertions as household czarina. Until
recently, I was guilty of such smugness.
</P>
<P>
   Then she left for a week.

plan on building to my wife.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, the same week would have been far less
demanding. Back then, I was perfectly content to let dirty dishes
pile up until no clean dishes were left. I washed bedding once a
year, whether the sheets needed it or not. A refrigerator was fully
stocked as long as it contained a 2-week-old carton of milk and a
half-full bottle of ketchup, which doubled as spaghetti sauce in a
pinch. (For those who haven't guessed, this was during
bachelorhood.)
</P>
<P>
   But after 10 years of marriage, some of Catherine's fastidious
(notice I didn't say anal-retentive) ways have rubbed off. While
she was gone, I washed the dishes immediately after my son and I
ate. I could not walk by our unmade bed, and I told my son to make
his, too (though he ignored me, for the most part, and a couple of
times I caved in and made it myself.) Two or three hundred times a
day, I wiped the counter free of bread crumbs and jelly. I vacuumed
the day before my wife got home. (I thought about cleaning the
bathrooms, but my own fastidiousness has its limits.) I bought real
groceries; cooked a couple of real meals (ham and cheese omelettes
one night, spaghetti another. My repertoire pretty much ends
there.) I did a couple of loads of laundry. I picked my son up from
school and drove him to hockey practice and violin lessons. I
checked his homework; helped him with spelling words; made him a
special breakfast the morning of his state achievement test; goaded
him into practicing his musical instrument; and laid out his
clothes in the morning, in an attempt to prevent a third-grade
fashion felony.
</P>
<P>
   I am out of breath now, just thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   What surprised me more than anything about that week was the
relentlessness of it. Running a house, even with standards as
meager as my own, there is always something to do. Always. Daily
private time with a book or television, time that I had come to
believe was my God-given entitlement, somehow vanished. By the time
Patrick had been put to bed, I had enough energy to read a few
paragraphs of a novel, or watch a few minutes of mindless
television. Normally a night owl, I was dead asleep each night by
10.
</P>
<P>
   So it's hard, this household duty. Harder than I ever knew. And
I haven't yet mentioned the most important task in the litany of
household-running: being emotionally present for a child when he
wakes up in the morning, or comes home from school each day. Was
Patrick nervous about the achievement test? Did he think about Aunt
Thelma, who had just died? Any trouble on the playground? I know I
asked these questions while my wife was gone, but it can be hard to
listen when thinking about a grocery list.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick and I did attend a Texas Rangers baseball game that
week, which was a wonderful break for us both. No vacuuming at The
Ballpark. There we could be just a couple of guys, hanging out, a
luxury we have when my wife is around. Have I said how happy I was
when she came home?
</P>
<P>
   I know Catherine loves her life, challenging as it is. For a
week, I loved it, too. With the challenges come immense rewards.
Washing a sink full of dishes carries its own sense of
accomplishment. Tucking Patrick in at night, knowing he felt safe
and cared for, even when his mom was gone _ well, few things in
life are better.
</P>
<P>
   But the week thoroughly depleted our reserves. How single
parents do it, I have no idea. And I caution any man who thinks he
appreciates his wife's exertions as household czarina. Until
recently, I was guilty of such smugness.
</P>
<P>
   Then she left for a week.

   ``The Snakebite Survivor's Club: Travels Among Serpents'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   by Jeremy Seal &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nonfiction &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt, $24 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Marton &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the neurotic and the phobic _ and that covers just about
everyone _ a good self-help group usually eases the pain. British
author Jeremy Seal, however, found a more solitary catharsis for
his personal fear: writing a book.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Snakebite Survivors' Club: Travels Among Serpents,''
Seal plumbs his loathing of serpents by seeking them out. By turns
harrowing and droll, historical and all-too-human, ``Club'' uses
language and history to battle a paralyzing aversion shared by
many.
</P>
<P>
   Seal's travelogue includes stops in Scottsboro, Ala., for its
copperheads and timber rattlers; Kenya, the domain of coiled puff
adders; India, for its hooded cobras; and Australia, where the
taipan packs enough fatal venom to dispatch hordes of men.
</P>
<P>
   This is resolutely the work of a Brit, filled with wonderfully
wry turns of poetry (a snake's head is ``tapered like a coffin'')
and clinical detachment. Mostly stiff-upper-lip with hardly a
quavering confession to be found, Seal's book does introduce a zany
cast of characters, from serpent wranglers to weekend snake
shamans. ALthough the book confounds the reader with its sometimes
soporific digressions into snake lore, Seal shrewdly threads his
narrative with the chilling story of an alcoholic fundamentalist
preacher who attempts to murder his wife by forcing her hand into a
box of rattlers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Seal won't be confused with Stephen King when it comes
to ratcheting up the tension, his passages still gnaw at the
nerves. One story describes ``Kevin'' who, bitten by a taipan,
deteriorates with alarming swiftness, suffering blurred vision,
vomiting, a paralyzed tongue, a pulse that races to 120 beats per
minute and, finally, the labored breathing that precedes his final
death rattle.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, poisonous snakes do prompt occasional humor. Over
time, snake-bite cures have included leeches, the use of strychnine
as a second poison to counteract the venom (Pick your poison?) and
(a personal favorite) igniting gunpowder on the bite. Blow off the
arm, blow off the snake bite, right?
</P>
<P>
   Seal never quite escapes the feeling of being stalked by
imaginary snakes. Walking in a West Kenyan field, in the glow of a
setting sun, he is convinced that a thousand pairs of orange eyes
are swiveling in the heads of a thousand deadly serpents, all
poised to strike. It is in that moment of sweaty-palmed fear, with
Seal trying desperately to keep his feeble matches lit to frighten
away his imagined enemy, that the crushing power of his phobia _
and ours _ becomes all too real.

APPEALS COURT REJECTS MEMBERS' LAWSUIT AGAINST UNION
</HEADLINE>
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal appeals court in Manhattan has refused to
reinstate a class-action lawsuit filed in 1997 against a leading
garment industry union by union members who contended they were not
fairly represented in a complex arbitration case against the
clothing manufacturer Liz Claiborne.
</P>
<P>
   The workers, who had been employed at Mademoiselle Knitware, a
now-defunct sweater factory in Brooklyn, had filed the lawsuit
against the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile
Employees, known as Unite, and two of its locals.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual dispute, which pitted the union members against
their own labor leaders at what had once been a showcase factory
for the garment industry, boiled down to the question of who
actually had the legal duty to protect the interests of the
Brooklyn workers.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling released Tuesday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals affirmed the trial judge's decision last summer that
neither the parent union nor the two locals owed the Brooklyn
workers any ``duty of fair representation'' under federal labor
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute involved the parent union, Unite; Local 23-25, which
represented Claiborne workers; and Local 155, which represented
workers at Mademoiselle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Claiborne had promised a Unite official, who was also
manager of Local 23-25, that it would order a specific volume of
sweaters from Mademoiselle. When Claiborne reneged, Local 23-25
filed an arbitration case against Claiborne on behalf of the
Mademoiselle workers, who were represented by Local 155.
</P>
<P>
   The union won that arbitration case and, when Claiborne still
did not supply the promised orders, it filed a second case in 1996
to enforce the earlier ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But in May 1997, during collective bargaining talks with
Claiborne, Unite and Local 23-25 agreed to nullify the first
arbitration award, drop the second arbitration case and free
Claiborne from its commitment to order sweaters from Mademoiselle.
In turn, Claiborne agreed to pay $750,000 into a fund to be
distributed to the Local 155 workers but to be administered by
Local 23-25.
</P>
<P>
   A group of workers at Mademoiselle later accused Unite and Local
23-25 of selling them out in exchange for a separate pact,
concluded around the same time, which obligated Claiborne to pay
$13 million in damages to the parent union and the Claiborne local.
They further accused their own local of failing to protect them in
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But under federal labor law, the trial court found, the only
union legally obligated to protect the Mademoiselle workers was
their own collective bargaining unit, Local 155.
</P>
<P>
   That local could not be held liable in the class-action case,
however, because it had played no role in the disputed settlement,
the trial court concluded. Unite and Local 23-25, which had
negotiated the settlement, could not be held liable because neither
was the designated collective bargaining unit for the Mademoiselle
workers. Thus, neither had a legally enforceable duty to act in the
best interests of Local 155's members.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court affirmed that interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, the duty of fair representation arises only with
respect to a union entity that is certified as the exclusive
bargaining representative of a group of employees,'' the appeals
court found.
</P>
<P>
   Jo-Ann Mort, a spokeswoman for Unite, said the union was
``delighted'' by the appeals court's refusal to reinstate the
Mademoiselle case, which Unite had long argued was without merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that this concludes this unfortunate chapter and
allows us to get back to doing what we have done all along, namely,
providing our members with the best representation possible,'' Mort
said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rhine, a lawyer who represented the Mademoiselle workers,
said he was considering whether to petition the U.S. Supreme Court
to take up the issue. ``There has to be a remedy if there is a
wrong,'' he said. ``But what this court is saying is that no one is
responsible.''

SELIG SAYS HE HAS VOTES FOR REALIGNMENT
</HEADLINE>
  By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, he does have the votes for his realignment plan,
Commissioner Bud Selig said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After Selig postponed an owners meeting scheduled for June 13
and 14, a baseball lawyer said the commissioner did not have enough
votes to adopt the plan that would move Arizona to the American
League and Tampa Bay to the National League, among other elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have the votes,'' Selig said by telephone from his
Milwaukee office. He postponed the meeting, he said, to explore
other possible alignments and schedules before making a final
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have only one real objective here, an unbalanced schedule,''
Selig said. ``I think this plan is the best way, but we'll look at
others.''
</P>
<P>
   The players association has to approve any change in the league
structures, and Selig acknowledged it would be a problem if the
union rejected the prevailing plan. ``But I don't think there's an
alternative,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief opponents of the plan among owners appear to be some
teams in the American League Central, which would have six teams
compared with four in the league's other divisions, and the
Cincinnati Reds, who don't like the idea of being in a Southeast
Division with Atlanta, Tampa Bay and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Selig indicated that the owners' meeting would be rescheduled
for early July. A majority in each league is needed to approve a
realignment plan.  &QR;

HEINEKEN TAKES ITS U.S. CAMPAIGN TO THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A humorous campaign in the United States for the flagship beer
brewed by Heineken NV is increasing sales. That has sold Heineken
executives on giving the agency creating the campaign an additional
major assignment: to develop and produce Heineken brand advertising
that is to run around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Heineken is significantly expanding its relationship with the
New York office of Lowe Lintas &AMP; Partners Worldwide, which since
April 1998 has created ads for Heineken USA. The worldwide
assignment is a new one; typically, Heineken campaigns are produced
by local agencies that vary country by country.
</P>
<P>
   The awarding of the new duties to Lowe Lintas New York points to
intensified efforts by giant marketers to improve the creative
content of their campaigns. Heineken joins advertisers like
Coca-Cola, Kellogg, McDonald's and Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to raise the bar on creative,'' Frazer Thompson,
global brand director at Heineken in Amsterdam, said in a telephone
interview. ``So the first place you turn is to the people who are
doing it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a creative ethos at Lowe you don't find at many
agencies,'' he added. ``It can be a challenging environment, shall
we say, but that's good for a marketeer.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Heineken's headquarters intend to strongly
``encourage local markets to use'' the Lowe Lintas New York ads,
Thompson said, or they can continue running campaigns from local
agencies _ but only ``if the creative is better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be seen as a challenge to the local agencies,'' he
added. ``Any work they're creating, we'll benchmark against the
global pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Agencies working for Heineken locally include offices of Bates
Worldwide; J. Walter Thompson, part of the WPP Group; and Lowe
Howard-Spink in London, which like Lowe Lintas New York is part of
the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Singapore office of Bates, part of the Cordiant
Communications Group, is being named to handle additional creative
responsibilities for the Heineken brand in Asia. The brand has a
somewhat different image in that part of the world, Thompson said,
where it is typically sold at higher prices than in Europe and
North America.
</P>
<P>
   The United States campaign for Heineken, carrying the theme
``It's all about the beer,'' presents light-hearted vignettes known
as ``beer moments'' in the lives of drinkers, particularly men ages
21 to 24. The ads are different from many in the beer category,
which is replete with pitches featuring broad humor and scantily
clad ``babes.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in one television commercial, a seemingly nice guy
is revealed to be a ``weasel'': he brings Brand X beer to a party
but drinks someone else's Heineken. In another spot, titled ``The
mood swing,'' a sports fan's elation turns to gloom when a
gesturing friend knocks over his cup of Heineken.
</P>
<P>
   In a third commercial, ``The premature pour,'' an eager swain
demonstrates poor technique in failing to properly transfer the
contents of a bottle of Heineken to his glass. Another spot, ``The
male bonding incident,'' depicts an awkward moment between two
buddies when one hands the other a Heineken and their fingers
accidentally touch. Those two spots were shown last week at the
Interpublic annual meeting as part of a reel of commercials deemed
to be particularly creative.
</P>
<P>
   In the American market, ``people were saying `Heineken's a great
beer,' but they weren't saying `Heineken's a great beer for me,'''
Thompson said. ``We wanted Heineken to be more relevant, to be seen
as a beer that makes any occasion special rather than a beer for
special occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lowe Lintas New York campaign, he added, ``has really made a
significant difference in the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, we're selling more beer than we used to,
and the brand equity measures are moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Corona now outsells Heineken among Americans drinking
imported beers, Heineken is growing about 8 percent annually, far
exceeding the growth rate for the total United States beer market.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe Lintas New York is completing almost a dozen TV commercials
for worldwide use that carry the theme ``It has to be Heineken.''
The approach is simiar to the United States ads as Heineken
executives look ``for the cultural similarities,'' Thompson said,
``instead of the cultural differences.''
</P>
<P>
   The new spots, still in production, include ``The torment,'' in
which a sports fan waiting in line for a Heineken is unnerved as
the crowd roars in response to plays he cannot see; ``The pain
barrier,'' in which drinkers fish inside a tub filled with icy
water to retrieve bottles of Heineken; and ``The stalemate,'' a
series of commercials about two men fighting for the last bottle of
Heineken in a refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This first presented itself to us around three or four months
ago,'' said Michael Silver, a managing director at Lowe Lintas who
is also executive vice president and worldwide account director on
Heineken, ``when a dialogue started about focusing on `beer
moments' for a global audience rather than just a U.S. audience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous win for the agency,'' he added, ``and a
huge opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the assignment is fortunate because it comes only
months after the merger that created Lowe Lintas, in which
Interpublic combined the Lowe &AMP; Partners unit of Lowe with Ammirati
Puris Lintas. There are perceptions along Madison Avenue that the
merger is taking a long time to jell, and the defections of some
employees and clients are feeding those perceptions. ``I think
we've come a long way as an agency in a short time,'' said Lee
Garfinkel, chairman and chief creative for the United States
operations of Lowe Lintas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still expect we'll have some bumps along the way,'' he
added, ``but it's a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Heineken spends about $40 million annually on American
advertising. The spending for the new worldwide ads depends on how
many local markets decide to run them. Since Heineken is sold in
174 countries, widespread acceptance could bring a beer moment or
two for Lowe Lintas.

SENATE COMPROMISE LEADS TO CONFIRMATION OF NOMINEES 
</HEADLINE>
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted on Wednesday to confirm the
nomination of Bradley A. Smith to the Federal Election Commission,
although Smith, the Republican nominee for the agency, has angered
Democrats by advocating a repeal of campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was confirmed by a vote of 64 to 35, after Republican and
Democratic leaders, who squabbled for months over this nomination
and others, brokered an agreement earlier this week. Democrats had
objected to Smith's nomination, and Republicans had opposed several
of President Clinton's nominees to the federal bench. Both sides
compromised and a swap ensued.
</P>
<P>
   With the logjam broken, the Senate also moved to re-confirm
Danny Lee McDonald, who already sits on the Federal Election
Commission, and to confirm 46 other nominees for federal posts.
Although 16 judges were approved, another 36 nominations are
awaiting action in the Senate Judiciary Committee, a source of
frustration for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Smith's nomination that stirred the most acrimony,
with the majority of Democrats and a few Republicans objecting to
the selection. Campaign finance watchdog groups lobbied heavily
against Smith. In fact, the nomination was so bitterly contested,
it drew a Senate roll-call vote, which is unusual for election
commission nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Smith ``believes that all campaign contributions, spending and
influence peddling are protected without limitation,'' said Sen.
Russell D. Feingold, D-Wisc., who was one of the sponsors of
legislation to overhaul the campaign finance system. ``He has
advocated time and again the repeal of the very law he would be
sworn to uphold and enforce. How can we seriously consider
confirming his nomination to serve as a commission?''
</P>
<P>
   The commission is made up of six members, three Democrats and
three Republicans, a delicate and deliberate balance that is
intended to avoid giving any one party an advantage. That was the
reason Democrats gave for voting for Smith.
</P>
<P>
   While the president nominates a candidate, Congress must approve
the nominee. In this instance, Clinton agreed to nominate Smith in
exchange for a vote on Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations, whose confirmation had been stalled by
Republican senators, according to a Senate Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a law professor at Capital University in Ohio, has
written extensively on campaign finance, and concludes that the way
to mend the nation's campaign finance system is to get rid of the
Federal Elections Campaign Act, which restricts the flow of money
in political races while complying with constitutional free-speech
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has argued that campaign finance laws approved by Congress
after Watergate have failed; in fact, more money is required to run
for office today, incumbents are more entrenched than ever and
voter participation is at a low point.
</P>
<P>
   On this, both Smith and his detractors agree. But they disagree
over the remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Smith says the $1,000 limit on campaign donations should be
eliminated, arguing that challengers must be free to raise more
money than incumbents to defeat them.
</P>
<P>
   He has also argued that money does not necessarily influence
lawmakers. Instead, he says, it is the lawmakers' constituency,
ideology and party affiliation that decide their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans defended Smith today, calling his positions
``well-grounded in mainstream First Amendment doctrines and case
law,'' as Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., put it.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who wrote the campaign bill with
Feingold, vehemently opposed the selection. ``Sending Brad Smith to
the FEC is akin to confirming a conscientious objector to be
secretary of defense,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   And he chastised Clinton for going along with the nomination.
``The president still had the ability and the authority to reject
this most extreme nominee for any position that I have seen in my
years here since 1987,'' McCain said.

DEATH ROW INMATE OFFERS TO SELL SEATS TO WITNESS EXECUTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GABRIELLE CRIST 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A Death Row inmate who killed three people
tried to sell five seats for his execution on an Internet auction
site Wednesday _ for several hours, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The auction on eBay, with bidding designated to start at $100,
closed several hours after it began about 1:20 p.m. EBay officials
had removed the site by early evening.
</P>
<P>
   No one bid on the seats during the four hours after the auction
was posted.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Michael Toney. Most people call me `Cowboy.' I am
on Texas' Death Row awaiting execution for a crime I did not
commit,'' the Web site stated.
</P>
<P>
   Condemned inmates in Texas are allowed to have five witnesses at
their execution. Toney decided that his seats would go to the top
eBay bidders, with the money going to his estranged children.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were not eligible to bid, the Web site stated.
</P>
<P>
   Toney, 34, was sentenced to death last year for the 1985
briefcase bombing that killed Angela Blount, 15; her father, Joe
Blount, 44; and her cousin, Michael Columbus, 18, in the Fort Worth
suburb of Lake Worth. His conviction is on appeal, so his execution
date has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   The case was unsolved for more than a decade. Then Toney, who
was in jail for another offense, bragged to another inmate about
the bombing. Investigators believe that Toney intended the bomb for
someone else but put it outside the wrong mobile home, according to
court testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the eBay auction would have been used to establish a
trust for Toney's two estranged daughters, whom he said he has
``neglected for some 13 years.'' Once the trust was set up, Toney
said on the Web site, he would have waived further appeals on his
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know what kind of people would donate money to watch
an innocent man be murdered. However, I do know there are people
out there that will,'' his Web site statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The person who helped Toney set up the Web site is an ``idiot,''
said Glen Castleberry, a spokesman for the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice. Bidders will not attend the execution,
Castleberry said, ``period, end of story.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said he could not say whether selling the seats
would have violated any written procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the woman who set up the Web site said, ``I
pretty much just did it because he asked me to.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who asked that her name not be used, testified
against Toney at his trial but has since rekindled a friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Toney told her that it would help his efforts to prove his
innocence, she said. Until the eBay auction attempt, those efforts
had been limited to an aggressive letter-writing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of several supporters outside prison, Toney has
written at least 100 letters to people including the foreman of the
jury that sentenced him to death and the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web site, Toney again proclaimed his innocence and asked
skeptics to contact him or visit him in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Toney said two kinds of people would be likely to bid for an
execution seat: compassionate people who wants to help his
children, and sadists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, sadists are not in short supply in the cold,
cruel world of which we temporarily reside. I will thank the
compassionate and I will forgive the sadists,'' the Web site
stated.
</P>
<P>
   According to the eBay user agreement, the description of the
item being sold must pertain only to that item, said Kevin
Pursglove, director of communications for the Internet auction
company, based in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Toney's description filled more than two computer screens and
``was more of a diatribe,'' Pursglove said. Besides, Pursglove
said, he wasn't convinced that Toney had the right to sell the
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Toney's attorney, Robert Ford, said he will continue with his
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that he didn't know about the Web site but that if he
had, he would have called eBay himself to try to get it removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mr. Toney's actions and comments are totally
inappropriate,'' Ford said. ``Mr. Toney would serve his own case
much better if he he didn't behave in this manner.''

PACERS' COOL TACTICS CATCH THE KNICKS OFF GUARD
</HEADLINE>
  By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ There were no signs of torture on the deadpan
face of Larry Bird, and the anti-Knicks theme Reggie Miller hissed
from beneath his floppy hat Monday seemed more theater than threat.
</P>
<P>
   There were no flashing red lights Tuesday night. No warning
before Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. The Knicks did not
realize it when they casually arrived in town, but the Pacers had
been hurting, too. Just not as dramatically as the Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the Pacers' glib demeanor, there is a team of veterans
every bit as desperate to gain redemption after losing to the
Knicks in last year's conference finals as Pat Riley's angst-ridden
troop was Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their pain from losing last year fueled a great determined
effort on their part,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said after
practice Wednesday. ``Even though we talked about it many times,
our players underestimated what it was going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   They were not prepared for what unfolded during their 102-88
loss in Game 1. Not entirely. Miller's hide-and-seek with screens?
Mark Jackson's efficiency? Jalen Rose's versatility? The Knicks
knew what to expect from that threesome. Wednesday, Larry Johnson,
the lone Knick remaining on the practice floor, was trying to
figure out just where Dale Davis came from.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, usually as offensively daring as a Victorian suit,
revealed another side to his game. The 6-foot-11-inch Davis whipped
out an uncanny string of turnaround jumpers over a bewildered
6-foot-7-inch Johnson and left having outscored his Knicks
counterpart, 14-3, while outrebounding him, 16-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Dale and them had me a little confused yesterday,''
said Johnson, who hit 1 of 5 shots. ``I didn't get as many touches
as I wanted to. They had me thinking too much. Me, I'm better when
I let it all go.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what he did so well a year ago. Johnson led the Knicks
in scoring against the Pacers until he was injured in Game 6 of the
conference finals. As the offensive go-to man in place of the
injured Patrick Ewing, Johnson's series performance included a
star-aligned 4-point play to end a 26-point night in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, his only points came on a 3-pointer with nine
minutes left in the second quarter. When it splashed into the net,
he began to launch into his Big L routine as boos were mixed with
some chuckles, too. After all, the Knicks were still down by 16
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was struggling,'' Davis said of Johnson. ``It was probably
a sign of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   A sly smile crossed Davis' face. For one night, he got the best
of his friend. On the eve of Game 2 at Conseco Fieldhouse, Johnson
was like a shadowboxer on the court Wednesday. For nearly 20
minutes after practice, he was spinning, ball-faking and slashing
against an imaginary Davis. He was trying to find a rhythm against
a player who had stunned him with his own steady beat in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``My man Dale, that turnaround jumper,'' Johnson said. ``I come
into this series, and I've never seen Dale hit no turnaround
jumper. He's put that in his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' surprise offense jumped out at Johnson like a prank snake
in a can. For the rest of the night, Johnson seemed shaken. As
practice ended Wednesday, there was plenty advice from Johnson's
teammates on what he needed to do. Chris Childs said Johnson had to
demand the ball. Latrell Sprewell suggested that Johnson should
``relax and attack.''
</P>
<P>
   For one of the few times since Johnson arrived in New York, he
is asking for the ball. He did not feel that Davis shut him down as
much as the Knicks' herky-jerky flow in Game 1 did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get the ball enough to give them too much credit,''
Johnson said. ``How many shots did I take? Five.''
</P>
<P>
   That was two fewer attempts than Charlie Ward had and four fewer
than Marcus Camby had. To create more shots for him, the Knicks
intend to go to Johnson more in the low post, let him make Davis
work harder and perhaps lure him into foul trouble. Another way to
score is to rebound. The Knicks were outrebounded by the Pacers,
43-35.
</P>
<P>
   Davis led the way. He turned rebounds into dunks, and missed
shots into opportunities. Johnson's inability to combat Davis'
effort was just a microcosm of a night when the Knicks were not
prepared for the kind of desire the Pacers exuded, right down to
the most uncelebrated members of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis is a great rebounder, and he was dominant last night,''
Van Gundy said. ``But it wasn't just on Larry. They outrebounded us
by eight. The only weakness they have is supposedly rebounding. If
their weakness is going to be a strength in this series or if we
want to wait until Game 6 like we did in Miami to start rebounding,
we will never get to Game 6 in this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy's tone was foreboding. But the initial shock of Game 1
is behind the Knicks. The sight of Austin Croshere plopping in
uncontested 3-pointers, the vision of Davis posting and turning on
Johnson, jolted the Knicks into reality Wednesday. Now, the Knicks
understand just how much the Pacers want this series: just as much
as the Heat wanted the last one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Indiana team _ and I hate this cliche, mission _ but they
have an unbelievable passion to get there,'' Van Gundy said. ``We
do, too. We didn't show that last night.''

PLAN TO CHANGE BLUE CROSSES CLEARS HURDLE
</HEADLINE>
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM with WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer withdrew his
opposition on Wednesday to plans by the big nonprofit health
insurer, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, to change into a
for-profit company.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the shift, Empire would set up a multimillion-dollar
foundation dedicated to making health care broadly accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Empire had offered to give the New York Legislature the right to
approve or disapprove the conversion and a voice in deciding its
future, and to give the public a role in governing the company and
the foundation. But hospital and union officials said they would
seek to defeat the conversion plan in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The State Insurance Department approved Empire's proposal last
year, but Spitzer delayed it, arguing that the public needed a
larger voice in the new entities. He said that after lengthy
negotiations, Empire had agreed to let the new foundation select
six of the new for-profit company's 15-member board.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates said the foundation would be valued at more
than $500 million, based on Empire's current reserves. The
foundation would not directly provide insurance, but it would try
to influence the insurance market by creating models for expanded
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 49 Blue Cross associations are still nonprofit
companies. Other Blue Cross plans in at least nine states have
converted to for-profit status. Those plans created foundations to
repay part of the tax breaks and subsidies they had received over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups and state officials pressed for the foundations
and brought lawsuits in some states. A spokeswoman for Empire said
the company structured its proposal to avert such suits.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Stocker, president of Empire, has said that it needs
the ability private companies have to sell stock and raise money
for computerized information systems so it can compete with
for-profit health insurers like Aetna Inc. and Oxford Health Plans.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association, and Dennis Rivera, president of 1199, the hospital
workers' union, said they would oppose the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Raske said that creating ``another investor-owned payer will
work against the interests of doctors, hospitals and consumers.''
He said the company's executives ``would be more concerned with the
price of their stock than their ability to deliver services.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera said the charitable foundation would not be sufficient
compensation for allowing the company to abandon its role as the
traditional insurer of people who could not get coverage elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Empire has promised that there would be no change in the
coverage it now provides for 4.1 million customers or in its rates,
if the conversion happens. And the company no longer has a special
duty to cover people with difficult problems, under changes in laws
and subsidies over the last few years. Now all health maintenance
organizations are required to accept all applicants at the same
rates.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
INDIANAPOLIS _ For the Indiana Pacers, there's no time like the
present. Mostly because the Pacers seem to think they're running
out of time.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With six of their core players about to become free agents, and
with coach Larry Bird stepping down after this season, the Pacers
are getting a bit antsy about making the leap to the next level _
the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   They took the first step in that journey Tuesday night, beating
the New York Knicks in the first game of the Eastern Conference
finals, and hope to be up 2-0 in the best-of-seven series after
tonight's Game 2 at Conseco Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Of Indiana's six free agents-to-be, four are starters _ Reggie
Miller, Jalen Rose, Rik Smits and Mark Jackson. Center Sam Perkins
and Austin Croshere, who provided a glimpse of what could be by
dropping a team-high 22 points on the Knicks in Game 1, are the
other key free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are conscious of the scenario,'' said Rose, who Wednesday
was named the NBA's Most Improved Player. ``But we are also
conscious this is our third year and we haven't won the NBA title.
It is a priority (to win). But it is also our third year trying to
get through. That makes it a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand a lot of teams would be content to have the
success we've had the last few years. But we're looking for
something bigger and something better. We think we have what it
takes to get over the hump. We also understand anything can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And against the Knicks, anything is the appropriate word.
</P>
<P>
   The fact the Pacers are playing the Knicks in the postseason for
the third straight year _ and in the conference finals for the
third time in seven years _ offers Indiana incentive enough. But
there's much, much more here.
</P>
<P>
   All the Pacers have to do is look back on Game 3 of last year's
conference finals. They appeared to have the Knicks on the ropes at
Madison Square Garden, but Larry Johnson's now-infamous four-point
play _ on which he drew a bump from the Pacers' Antonio Davis, took
an extra dribble, knocked down the 3-pointer and got the
questionable continuation call from the referees _ turned things
around in the game's final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Things like that make Miller thankful the Pacers are playing the
Knicks in this year's conference finals. Revenge, especially
against a hated opponent, is a powerful motivational tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never let your guard down against New York,'' said
Miller, who scored 19 points in Game 1. ``They've got too many
talented offensive players. They have the type of team that can
embarrass you if you let your guard down.
</P>
<P>
   ``And because of the rivalry I'm the only one who wants to say
this, but both teams don't like each other. Everybody else is
saying that, `Oh, we respect them.' No, they don't like us, and we
don't like them. Because of that, you shouldn't let your guard
down. And I don't think we will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers have played in the Eastern Conference finals in five
of the last seven years, but they have not been able to get over
the proverbial hump, losing to New York (in 1994), Orlando in
('95), Chicago ('98) and the Knicks again last season.
</P>
<P>
   That close-but-no-cigar trend is wearing on some players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a very good team, we've scored a lot of points,
we've been exciting, but for some reason people still want to put
us down and say we're going to be the Buffalo Bills (who lost four
consecutive Super Bowls),'' said Pacers point guard Travis Best.
``We've taken it with a grain of salt and moved on and played good
basketball. From this point on, we don't worry about what people
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird isn't accepting any excuses this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt we had a good enough team to get to the Finals
the last two years,'' he said. ``Obviously, Chicago got in our way
in the seventh game (winning 88-83 in '98), and then last year
against New York they (the Knicks) made the plays when they had to
make them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this year is my final chance to get back to the Finals,
and it's the first chance for a lot of the guys in the locker room
to get there, so I think it's very important for us to get over the
hump and try to give ourselves a chance to play for the world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't win a championship, it's a failed year,'' Bird
added. ``You didn't get what you set out to accomplish. My goal
here was to try to get the Pacers to the Finals. It's time.''

ABORTION RIGHTS GROUP TO BACK CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Mayor Rudolph Giuliani out of the Senate race,
leaders of the national abortion rights movement said Wednesday
that they had abandoned plans to remain neutral in the New York
contest and would endorse Hillary Rodham Clinton over her new
opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio. Clinton said she intended to make
abortion rights a central issue of her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement, by the National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League, suggests the extent to which the political
ground has shifted with Giuliani's exit from the race.
</P>
<P>
   His strong support among abortion rights advocates had been one
of the obstacles Clinton faced in mounting a campaign against
Giuliani, a moderate Republican. Giuliani and Clinton hold
essentially identical positions on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has described himself as ``pro-choice,'' and his aides
noted Wednesday that throughout his years in Congress he
steadfastly opposed laws that would outlaw abortion. But in
interviews over the weekend, Lazio also voiced his opposition to
public financing of abortion, and to the kind of abortion procedure
that critics refer to as ``partial-birth abortion,'' in both cases
drawing a contrast with Clinton's views on the subject, which he
described as extreme.
</P>
<P>
   He also supports laws requiring that the parents of teen-agers
be notified when their daughters are seeking abortions.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani was the Republican candidate, Clinton's advisers
had expressed concern about the extent to which she would be able
to campaign on the issue of abortion, a subject that has proved to
be highly effective for Democrats running statewide in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview Wednesday, Clinton pointed to the abortion
league endorsement, which is to be announced at a news conference
in Manhattan on Thursday morning, as evidence that there were clear
differences between the two candidates, and she said she would
raise them repeatedly in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abortion rights will be an important issue in this race,''
Clinton said. ``As the NARAL endorsement makes clear, New Yorkers
will have a clear choice, and New Yorkers will always be able to
count on me to protect a woman's right to choose in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Signaling a theme that she intends to use in the months ahead,
Clinton asserted that Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court decision
legalizing abortion, may be in jeopardy in the coming years,
depending on the makeup of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The estimates are that the next Senate is going to confirm
three or four justices,'' Clinton said, adding, ``I will not vote
to confirm judges who do not believe that Roe v. Wade should be
upheld.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dan McLagan, Lazio's spokesman, asserted last night that
Lazio was a supporter of abortion rights, and more precisely
represented the views of a majority of New Yorkers on the subject.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Rich Lazio's pro choice,'' McLagan said. ``But he opposes
taxpayer-subsidized abortion, supports parental notification and
opposes the heinous practice of partial-birth abortion. Those are
the abortion issues in this campaign. And that is the mainstream
New York position. Clinton is obviously staking out an extreme
position.''
</P>
<P>
   McLagan said that Lazio would not cast votes on nominees for the
Supreme Court based solely on abortion or any other issue.
``Congressman Lazio opposes litmus tests of any kind,'' McLagan
said. ``Judges should be based on their qualifications to be
Supreme Court justices.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attempt to portray Lazio as an abortion foe were
rebutted yesterday by an unlikely source: the leader of the Right
to Life Party in New York, Ken Diem. He said his party was finding
its own candidate to run in the race, and described Lazio as
``totally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very proud pro-choice Catholic, which makes him totally
unacceptable,'' Diem said.

CHARITABLE GIVING SURGED AGAIN IN '99, BY AN ESTIMATED 9 PERCENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Charitable giving grew faster than the economy last year,
although it did not quite keep pace with the tremendous
accumulation in wealth, according to figures released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ebullient stock market and the prosperous economy helped
drive donations to charity up nearly $16 billion, to $190.2
billion, 9.1 percent higher than in 1998 and well ahead of the 5.7
percent growth in gross domestic product, according to the figures,
estimates presented by the AAFRC Trust for Philanthropy, the
nonprofit arm of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   After inflation, donations increased 6.7 percent, making 1999
the fifth year in a row that they rose in ``real'' dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And, said the philanthropy trust, which uses an economic model
to estimate annual charitable contributions, donations equaled 2.1
percent of gross domestic product, the highest level by that
barometer in 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising executives and others called the growth
substantial. President Clinton's domestic policy adviser, Bruce
Reed, who spoke at a Manhattan news conference where the trust
issued its figures, referred to ``a new golden age of philanthropy
in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The new figures are remarkable,'' Reed said, adding that
giving in the last seven years now totaled $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, charitable giving has risen 53 percent, or 40
percent after inflation. The fund-raising association's chairman,
George C. Ruotolo Jr., called the rise of recent years
``meteoric.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite last year's gains _ and huge contributions from some
Internet billionaires like Bill Gates of Microsoft _ the growth in
giving appears not to have kept up with the growth in wealth. Using
the figures released Wednesday, Edward N. Wolff, an economics
professor at New York University, calculated that giving amounted
to 0.69 percent of the nation's wealth last year _ down from 0.71
percent in 1998, although slightly ahead of the 0.68 percent of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, philanthropy has pretty much paralleled
wealth,'' Wolff said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Feenberg, a research associate at the National Bureau of
Economic Research and member of the fund-raising association's
advisory council on methodology, suggests that another yardstick to
measure charitable giving is its relation to personal consumption.
He too used the figures released Wednesday, and calculated that
donations last year equaled 3 percent of personal consumption
expenditures, up slightly from 1998 and a significant jump from the
2.5 percent in 1995 but still below the 3.3 percent of the late
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been steady growth over the past five years, but we
are still not back to the historic peak,'' Feenberg said, although
he cautioned that the association figures on which he was basing
his calculations were only estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Giving by foundations last year rose at more than twice the rate
of individual giving, spurred by a law that requires them to give
away at least 5 percent of their assets each year. (They are
allowed to average their assets over several years to even out
their spending.)
</P>
<P>
   The bullish equity markets, which gave most foundations large
gains in their endowments, forced them to increase their giving
sharply. Grants by noncorporate foundations jumped 16.5 percent, to
$19.8 billion from $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Foundation Center, a New York group that gathers data on
foundations, reported that the number of them had also been surging
in recent years. By the end of 1998, there were 46,832 foundations,
up from 23,770 in 1982. (The center does not yet have figures for
1999.)
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with the extraordinarily robust growth of foundation
giving, personal giving _ which accounts for about three-quarters
of all donations _ was up 7 percent last year, to $143.7 billion
from $134.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The AAFRC Trust said philanthropic giving by individuals
amounted to 1.8 percent of personal income last year, the same as
in 1998 but up from 1.5 percent in 1995. The last time personal
giving was above the 1.8 percent level was 1973, when it reached
1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After personal giving and donations by noncorporate foundations,
the two remaining categories of charitable contributions are
bequests and corporate giving, both of which had a good year.
Bequests rose $2.8 billion, to $15.6 billion, while corporate
giving climbed $1.4 billion, to $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Religious charities remained by far the largest recipients of
charitable giving by Americans, receiving nearly $82 billion, a
rise of 5.5 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Education organizations, including universities, were the
second-largest recipient, with $27.5 billion, an 8.5 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest gain in percentage terms was to organizations
focused on international affairs, like Doctors Without Borders and
the U.N. Foundation, although the total still remained relatively
small. Donations to these groups rose 24 percent, to $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Environment and wildlife organizations also enjoyed a strong
increase, 11 percent, to $5.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The charitable giving data released Wednesday is available on
the fund-raising association's Web site (www.aafrc.org). A more
detailed picture of charitable giving in 1999 will be contained in
the association's book ``Giving U.S.A. 2000,'' which will be
available on disk in June and in book form in September.

DON GIFFORD, 81, AN AUTHORITY ON JAMES JOYCE  
 BY ERIC PACE  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Gifford, a cultural historian and authority on James Joyce,
died on Monday at a hospital in North Adams, Mass. He was 81 and
lived in Williamstown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford retired in 1984 from Williams College, where he was a
professor of English and of American studies and had taught since
1951.
</P>
<P>
   His 1974 book, ``Notes for Joyce: An Annotation of James Joyce's
Ulysses,'' which he wrote with Robert J. Seidman, an ex-student of
his, is still in print in a revised and enlarged edition, entitled
``Ulysses Annotated'' (1989, University of California Press).
</P>
<P>
   That explanatory work was praised by Stanley Goldstein, the
president of American Friends of James Joyce, a New York-based
organization with members across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, a New York accountant, said: ``Gifford composed the
most useful book for readers of `Ulysses,' whether they are
amateurs like me or professionals and academics. The book is on my
shelf, and it is used every month when we conduct a Ulysses
group-reading session.''
</P>
<P>
   His 1990 book, ``The Farther Shore: A Natural History of
Perception, 1798-1984,'' considered centuries of thought about the
interaction of the environment and the intellect. In a review in
The New York Times, the critic Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote,
``There is hardly a page of it that does not inform, provoke or
make the reader see things in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   The reviewer continued: ``To the reader's great pleasure, Mr.
Gifford proceeds by anecdote, by leaps of intuition and by quirky
insight. He knows so much that he need not be pedantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Gifford was the author, the editor, or a co-author of more than
half a dozen books. Short stories and poems by him appeared in
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Schenectady, N.Y., he received a bachelor's degree in
1940 from Principia College in Elsah, Ill., and studied at Harvard
University and at Cambridge University in England.
</P>
<P>
   He served in World War II as an ambulance driver and then in the
infantry.
</P>
<P>
   His 1944 marriage to Ruth Cleveland ended in divorce in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Honora Kammerer, whom he
married in 1963; two daughters from his first marriage, Marin
Gifford Haythe of London and Nina Gifford of Atlanta; five
grandchildren; and a brother, Edward, of Schenectady.

ON PRO BASKETBALL: FOES PLAYING MIND GAMES WITH KNICKS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ One moment the New York Knicks were locked in
mortal combat with Miami, often pulled out of bounds by their
shorts. The next, they were dazed by Indiana's bombs, retreating
for cover against another fierce playoff rival.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Camby and his teammates tried Wednesday to clear the
cobwebs. Seventy-two dizzying hours will make you do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like you have to shift gears,'' Camby said. ``You
go from a banging, physical series for seven games to a team with
new plays, new personnel, a team that can shoot the ball from the
3-point line much better than Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The lithe forward scratched his head as he sat on a wooden
bleacher at Conseco Fieldhouse. Thursday night the Knicks will
attempt to knot the best-of-7 Eastern Conference finals against the
Pacers at one victory apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have re-work your mind,'' Camby said.
</P>
<P>
   It is premature to take apart the Knicks for their wire-to-wire
102-88 loss in Game 1. Fatigue, travel and little time to prepare
for the Pacers give them legitimate excuses. Yet, as Game 2
approaches, the larger issue is whether they understand who they
are playing.
</P>
<P>
   For all the physical pain players such as Alonzo Mourning, Dan
Majerle and P.J. Brown administered, the respect between the Knicks
and the Heat deepened with each game of their riveting semifinal
series. Maybe not to a point in which you would refer to it as a
gentlemen's competition, but at least they appreciated the effort
put forth by the other side. Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said:
``You can't help but have empathy for who lost that series. It was
that close.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers' Reggie Miller has not been to the NBA finals. He
could care less how the Knicks felt about anything, much less
losing the series to his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indiana, the pain of losing to us last year, fueled a great
determined effort on their part,'' Van Gundy said. ``Even though we
talked about it many times, our players underestimated what it was
going to take to compete with this team. This team, I hate this
cliche _ mission _ but they have an unbelievable passion to get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks and Heat banged bodies and made it impossible for
either side to crack 90 points. But the rules of their duel were
also understood: You walked 10 paces before you turned and fired.
In this series, you are lucky if you get nine steps before Miller
has already taken a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Player-wise, it's more personal,'' Camby said. ``Last series
was more about Riley, he used to coach the Knicks and all the
hoopla. But now it's about Reggie, his comments he made before Game
1, saying we're arrogant, we don't respect them and stuff like
that. It's a mental adjustment, no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to overanalyze a 14-point loss, and wonder if you are
not reaching for something that is not as relevant to a contentious
playoff series as you originally thought. But even if you discount
how the Knicks need to mentally approach the Pacers, you can't
discount what they did to New York on the court Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers make a higher percentage of free throws and
3-pointers than anyone in the league. They are the fourth-best
scoring team in pro basketball. They can run or slow it down, go
inside with Rik Smits or outside with Miller. They beat teams with
their passing much easier than with their one-on-one isolations.
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose may be one of only a few Pacers who can create his
own shot. But the sum of their parts _ Miller, Mark Jackson, Smits,
Dale Davis and a deep bench _ make them the most genuine team still
left in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   They need to rely on each other more than Portland, the Lakers
or even the Knicks to win. And they do, rather efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a unique team,'' Van Gundy said. ``Most teams in this
league are probably more athletic than they are but there are no
more skilled teams than Indiana. This is a great offensive team.
They pass well, they shoot well, they know how to move the ball.
They can shoot at any range.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Patrick Ewing: ``This team definitely has more firepower
than Miami. Miami is a better defensive team than they are.''
</P>
<P>
   During the preseason, the Knicks met San Antonio in one of those
NBA money-making excursions in which you find out more about your
team before the season begins. Yet with the memory of their finals
loss fresh, the Knicks came out and treated the game as if it meant
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treated it like a seventh game all because of the pain of
losing in the finals,'' Van Gundy said. ``And they were, like,
chilling out, because it was an exhibition game.''
</P>
<P>
   He shook his head. ``Our guys just don't understand it. I think
it's not as much as adjusting to a new offense as it is a mental
adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Camby said, re-work the mind. Before Reggie turns and
fires.

DEVILS FORCE GAME 7 WITH 2 THIRD-PERIOD GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
  By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The crucial hockey game was scoreless
until 8 minutes 34 seconds were left. That is when Claude Lemieux,
the biggest money player in Devils history, took center stage as
his team faced elimination from the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   As he did so many times in leading the Devils to their Stanley
Cup triumph in 1995, when he was named the tournament's most
valuable player, Lemieux scored an important goal Wednesday night
as the Devils defeated the Flyers, 2-1, to force a deciding seventh
game in the Eastern Conference finals. The teams will play Friday
night in Philadelphia, where the Devils have won twice in this
series.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's intense battle featured the return of Eric
Lindros, who scored the Flyers' goal with 30 seconds to play after
missing a score by a fraction of a second earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux's goal, a backhander from the left side in the crease
after a shot by Bobby Holik, broke the scoreless tie. But Alexander
Mogilny's backhander with 2:27 left sailed over the glove of Flyers
goaltender Brian Boucher and proved to be the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, who had not played since March 13 because of
concussions, scored from a crowd in front of goaltender Martin
Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils spent most of the first two periods in Philadelphia's
zone. They were particularly dominant in the second period, when
they limited the Flyers to only two shots. The Devils created
several chances but failed to capitalize, even on two manpower
advantages in the session.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the second period ended, Lindros put the puck in the net
from the slot in a crowd in front of Brodeur, who had 12 saves in
the game, but the officials ruled that it came just a split second
after the clock ran out. The Flyers protested, but the officials
had the video replay to prove they made the correct call.
</P>
<P>
   Several signs by Philadelphia fans, who have been rather vocal
every time the Flyers played here in this series, welcomed Lindros,
who played on the third line with Valery Zelepukin and Daymond
Langkow.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Craig Ramsay of the Flyers said before the game that
Lindros would have a more limited role than in the past, and the
coach proved it by giving Lindros 8 minutes 41 seconds of ice time
in the first 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Robinson of the Devils used Steve Kelly, John Madden
and Randy McKay against Lindros for the most part. Lindros' first
big play in the game, however, came on a crunching check against
Lemieux in front of the Devils' bench around the 12th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Madden, who made his return after missing three games because of
a bruised right knee, had the first quality chance in the game, two
minutes after the opening face-off, but his shot from the slot
sailed wide. He showed his anger a few seconds later during a
stoppage by banging his stick on his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Malakhov also had a good chance with all the net to
shoot at in the 10th minute, but the Russian defenseman, who did so
well to pinch in at the right time, fanned on a centering pass by
Holik from the right side.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers got a bit of a scare with 2:02 left in the first
period when a shot by Scott Gomez hit Boucher in the mask and
apparently stunned him. He went down quickly, threw his glove away
and grabbed his mask in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher (24 saves) went through several hectic moments in the
first two periods, but he held his ground, even when the Devils
attacked the net with authority.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Boucher's biggest save among the 15 he made in the first
40 minutes came in the 13th minute of the second period, when Holik
broke away alone after intercepting a pass at his blue line. Holik
tried to deke Boucher with a move from left to right, but the
rookie goaltender denied him by sprawling at his left doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher came out with another brilliant save against Holik 62
seconds into the third period, when he flipped backward, a la
Dominik Hasek, to knock away the shot and prevent Lemieux from
scoring on the rebound.

19 DODGERS SUSPENDED FOR BRAWLING WITH FANS
</HEADLINE>
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the latest sign that Major League Baseball is
cracking down on unruly behavior by players, the commissioner's
office on Wednesday fined and suspended 19 members of the Los
Angeles Dodgers for leaping into the stands and brawling with fans
at Chicago's Wrigley Field last week.
</P>
<P>
   The players' union denounced the suspensions as ``intolerable,''
and the Dodgers said suspensions would be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Levin, a spokesman for Commissioner Bud Selig, said the 19
suspensions are believed to be the most in history stemming from a
single incident.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Robinson, baseball's new vice president for on-field
operations, said he was determined to curb violence on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to do with these penalties is say `We can't
stop you from doing these things but if you do them you have to
understand you will pay the consequences,''' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said there had been far too many incidents this season
in which players have charged the pitcher after being hit by a
ball, igniting bench-clearing brawls.
</P>
<P>
   On April 22, Robinson suspended 16 members of the Detroit Tigers
and the Chicago White Sox for a total of 82 games after the teams
started fighting when a batter was hit by a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't belong in baseball,'' said Robinson, who was hit
by balls 198 times in his 21-year career as a Hall of Fame
outfielder and, he said, never charged the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The fight at Wrigley, however, was particularly disturbing,
Robinson said, because players went into the stands. For days,
people around the country viewed televised reruns of players
attacking fans. It was not the sort of image baseball officials
want to project.
</P>
<P>
   The Wrigley brawl began when a fan who was evidently drunk
reached over the chest-high infield wall near the bullpen, hit Chad
Kreuter, a catcher, in the back of the head and then snatched his
cap. Kreuter had been sitting with the pitchers with his back to
the fans along the first-base wall.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter and several teammates chased the fan and ended up
trading punches with several fans, while the rest of the team stood
watching. It took stadium security officers nine minutes to restore
order.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter was suspended for eight games, as were coaches Glenn
Hoffman, Rick Dempsey and John Shelby. Fifteen other players
received suspensions for between three and five games. All nineteen
were fined as well, but baseball officials declined to say how
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The penalties are just intolerable,'' Gene Orza, an official
with the players' union, said. ``What would have happened to these
players if they didn't do anything? What would their reputations
within the sport have been? I don't know a manager or general
manager who wouldn't have fired them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Dodgers said: ``Although we fully accept and
support the notion that fans belong in the stands and players
belong on the field, we are extremely shocked and concerned about
the severity of the punishments. We have informed the
commissioner's office that we disagree with the extent of the
severity and have requested an appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said suspensions would be staggered, with no more than
three players banned for a single game.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, the Major League Baseball spokesman, said the players
would continue to play until their appeals are heard by Paul
Beeston, baseball's president and chief operating officer. It
remained unclear how long that process would take, but Robinson
said he hoped to finish it within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the players suspended were pitchers. Carlos Perez and
Mike Fetters will be forced to sit out four games, while Terry
Adams, Darren Dreifort, Eric Gagne, Onan Masaoka, Alan Mills,
Antonio Osuna and Chan Ho Park will be benched for three.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also suspended four outfielders _ F.P. Santangelo,
Gary Sheffield, Geronimo Berroa and Shawn Green _ as well as first
baseman Eric Karros and catcher Todd Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   Four fans involved in the fight were arrested and charged with
disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Though the suspensions were evidently unprecedented, they were
not unforeseen. Last week, Sandy Alderson, the executive vice
president of baseball operations, made it clear some punishment
would be meted out. ``There is really never any excuse for going
into the stands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said baseball officials have been disturbed by the
number of times fights have broken out this year between teams
because a batter was hit by a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Set off by a cap-stealing prank, the fighting at Wrigley
appeared to reflect a growing willingness among players to resort
to violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players have zero tolerance now as far as these kinds of
things,'' he said.

NASA PLEASED SO FAR WITH SHUTTLE MISSION TO SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Atlantis astronauts sailed past the half-way point
of their repair mission to the international space station on
Wednesday, wrapping up an overhaul of the faltering electrical
power system.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmonaut Yuri Usachev and astronaut Susan Helms finished the
chore as they replaced a fourth power storage battery in the
Russian segment of the two-room orbital outpost, a task they
initiated Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling station has towered nearly 80 feet above an
airlock in the shuttle's cargo bay since the Atlantis crew docked
late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The overhaul bolsters the station's power system, preparing the
orbital outpost for the arrival of the third major component in
June, the overdue Russian crew module.
</P>
<P>
   Its arrival stalled more than two years by Russian economic
problems, the crew module will equip the station for its first
resident astronauts and cosmonauts in November.
</P>
<P>
   NASA was pleased with Wednesday's milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to get too giddy yet since we have a couple of days
to go,'' said Paul Hill of NASA, the station's lead flight
director. ``But if the rest of the mission goes as well as it
already has, we will have 100 percent success.''
</P>
<P>
   Coupled in Earth orbit in December 1998, the station's first two
segments began to experience battery losses late last year,
apparently as a result of overly aggressive charging and
discharging procedures initiated by the Russian mission control
facility.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Atlantis astronauts reached the outpost, four of
the station's six batteries as well as an assortment of
charge/discharge assemblies and voltage regulators required
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   At least three of the six batteries must function to ensure the
station's power system is robust enough for the addition of the
Russian crew module in July.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians paid the $1.3 million expense of the new battery
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, the Atlantis crew raised the altitude of the
35-ton space station for a second time with the shuttle's steering
jets.
</P>
<P>
   The station has been sinking between one and two miles a week in
response to a rise in solar activity. The increase in solar energy
reaching the Earth causes the atmosphere to balloon away from the
planet's surface, creating new frictional drag for orbiting
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle astronauts executed a 10-mile boost Wednesday night,
the same as Tuesday's maneuvers. The second boost placed the two
spacecraft in a 224-mile high orbit.
</P>
<P>
   A final boost tonight Thursday night should place the station at
232 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Atlantis commander Jim Halsell offered assurances in
a series of brief news interviews that the air quality of the
station is healthy and the noise levels tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of a shuttle supply mission that visited the station in
June experienced headaches, itchy eyes and in one instance nausea,
later attributed to air flow problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had no operational impacts at all as a result of poor
air quality,'' Halsell told the Cable News Network. ``The air
quality has been just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributed the absence of problems to enhancements in the
ventilation system made by the Atlantis astronauts as they boarded
the station Monday night. The 80-degree temperatures that greeted
the visiting astronauts have also cooled to the mid-70s, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of an audible mechanical hum in some regions of the
station, the noise levels in the outpost are lower than the
noisiest parts of the space shuttle, Halsell said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their repair efforts, the astronauts had
transferred more than a ton of supplies to the station for future
residents. Nearly a ton of discarded gear had been transferred from
the station to the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis is scheduled to undock from the station Friday night.
The 10-day mission is schedule to end with a landing at the Kennedy
Space Center in Florida on Monday at 1:18 a.m. CDT.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ California taxpayers used technology in record
numbers this year to participate in e-file and direct deposit
refund programs, according to figures released Wednesday by the
Franchise Tax Board.
</P>
<P>
   The state's tax collector said the e-file program, now in its
fifth year, surpassed the 2 million mark for the first time with
2.2 million e-file returns as of May 5, up from 1.5 million for the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   While a majority of electronic-filed returns are usually
submitted by tax professionals, this year the number of taxpayers
who filed online more than doubled to 446,959, from 207,674 last
year, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the numbers show is that more and more people are
becoming comfortable with e-filing,'' said Carolina Beach, a
spokeswoman with the FTB in Sacramento
</P>
<P>
   By e-filing tax returns, she said forms have fewer mistakes and
taxpayers usually receive their refunds within seven to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hoping that those taxpayers who are filing late this
year after being granted an extension would take advantage of
e-filing,'' Beach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they owe taxes they can pay them electronically. Of
course by now they would be subject to a penalty, but this is
another option,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million Californians filed for an extension this
year and have until October to send their tax returns, she said.
</P>
<P>
   While e-filing has become more convenient and popular with
taxpayers, state officials say more than 1 million taxpayers chose
to have their refunds directly deposited into their bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Through May 5, 1.1 million direct deposit refunds totaling more
than $585 million were issued.
</P>
<P>
   Direct deposit was offered to all taxpayers, including paper
filers, for the first time this year. Beach said in previous years
it was available to taxpayers who used e-file or Telefile.
</P>
<P>
   ``With more taxpayers finding it easier to use, we expect both
programs to continue their phenomenal growth next year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on e-filing or direct deposit, Beach said
consumers can surf the FTB's Web site at www.ftb.ca.gov.

MICROSOFT ANTITRUST TRIAL SPEEDS UP, HEATS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge cut short the Microsoft antitrust
trial Wednesday, denying the company further hearings on a dramatic
breakup proposal and indicating _ at least in the eyes of Microsoft
general counsel Bill Neukom _ that he will order the company broken
in half.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom said if the judge does order a breakup, the company will
immediately launch an appeal, asking that the order be postponed
pending the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``On appeal, we will raise issues of procedure,'' including
due-process constitutional violations the judge may have committed
by denying the hearings request, Neukom said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's proceedings were intended to schedule hearings to
determine how best to repair and prevent Microsoft's antitrust
wrongdoing. The Redmond giant sought up to six months to prepare a
defense against a breakup proposal put forward by the Justice
Department and 17 of the 19 plaintiff states.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs urged immediate resolution. But even their
supporters, some of whom urged harsher breakups than the plaintiffs
themselves, endorsed the need for some hearings. It was widely
expected that U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
would grant Microsoft at least two months to prepare for a
mini-trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson shocked Microsoft lawyers Wednesday by capping three
hours of detailed hearings with the abrupt declaration, ``I'm not
contemplating any further process.'' When company lawyers again
asked for more time, he snapped, ``This case has been pending for
two years now.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jackson asked the plaintiffs to ``present me with a
clean copy'' of their breakup plan by Thursday. Despite an angry
protest by Microsoft attorney Steven Holley, he gave Microsoft just
48 hours _ until next Wednesday, because Monday is a court holiday
_ to comment on the new filing.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said both documents will likely
be filed without any sort of hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You heard the judge. The process is over,'' he said. The
company had hoped to call a series of new witnesses, including
chairman Bill Gates and chief executive Steve Ballmer, as well as
Wall Street investment bankers and academicians.
</P>
<P>
   The next step will be for Jackson to write an order, explaining
what remedy he prefers for Microsoft and his legal rationale for
choosing it. His discretion in fashioning a remedy is wide, but his
rationale must be clear, said Bob Lande, an antitrust expert at the
University of Baltimore law school.
</P>
<P>
   Writing the order is a demanding task that will take Jackson at
least a month, he estimated. The entry of that order concludes the
trial and is the final step before an appeal can be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Lande agreed with Neukom that Jackson's denial of any hearings
to Microsoft may be an appealable error.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's denial of more time for Microsoft was plain enough,
but what he meant by asking the plaintiffs for ``a clean copy'' of
their proposal wasn't immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
   At least one news report concluded he meant the revised proposal
should include discussions of splitting Microsoft not just into two
companies, as the plaintiffs have suggested, but into three or even
four companies, as Microsoft competitors and some economists have
advocated. The governments' plan proposes breaking Microsoft into
one operating-systems company and one applications company.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every question Jackson asked Wednesday suggested he's
entertaining thoughts of a breakup and is working out even the
smallest details in his head. And some questions did suggest he
might be receptive to a three- or four-way split. But a source
close to the Justice Department said the clean-up will consist only
of ``tweaking and fine-tuning'' and denied the new version of the
proposal will go beyond the original.
</P>
<P>
   The ``tweaks'' might include changing key definitions in the
proposal and adjusting the limits on how much Microsoft stock an
investor can own before being forbidden from investing in the other
company. Jackson raised questions about both those points during
the arguments.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, while the plaintiffs' attorneys congratulated
each other on the courthouse steps, Microsoft attorneys and legal
experts disagreed on what Jackson had said he will do.
</P>
<P>
   Chief litigator John Warden said, ``I did not hear the court
say'' it will order the plaintiffs' proposal to be implemented.
University of Baltimore's Lande agreed, but he said, ``Based on the
tone of the hearing, I'd say there's better than a 50-percent
chance he'll order a breakup.'' Neukom said twice he thinks Jackson
will sign the plaintiffs' breakup order.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, anyone observing the proceedings Wednesday could
have seen Jackson was headed toward summarily splitting the company
up. But judges, Lande noted, have a way of disguising their real
intentions, playing devil's advocate, and asking whatever questions
come into their heads. So even at lunch break, knowledgeable
onlookers were unwilling to put money on how the hearing would end.
</P>
<P>
   Referring early-on to the governments' plan to cut Microsoft in
half, Jackson interrupted lead state trial counsel Kevin O'Connor
to demand, ``Tell me why they (those companies) would effectively
inspire competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson closely questioned special trial counsel David Boies on
the limits the two companies would have to observe on sharing
products and technology, and how they might evade them. He
expressed doubt Microsoft would be a willing participant in the
breakup, noting, ``You've given a lot of responsibility to
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Boies discussed a Supreme Court case that had split
one company into three, Jackson interrupted to ask, ``Why aren't
you doing that?''
</P>
<P>
   Boies responded, ``It was one of the most difficult questions we
faced, and there were strong proponents of it. But our divestiture
plan meets the case before the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson heaped praise on a brief filed recently on the
plaintiffs' behalf by the Computer and Communications Industry
Association and the Software Information Industry Association, both
of which are made up of Microsoft competitors. That brief advocates
splitting Internet Explorer into its own company, for a total of
three Microsoft entities.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of Microsoft's requested hearings, Jackson queried
Microsoft attorney Jack Warden, ``Why can't I just enter judgment
on the declarations?'' referring to legal documents filed by
witnesses for the plaintiffs who say the breakup will work.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Jackson's comments and actions last night may bode,
investors did not seem disheartened. Microsoft shares rose $2.38 to
close at $65.56.

TAPES TELL FLIGHT 261'S FINAL MOMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the final terrifying minutes of doomed Alaska
Airlines Flight 261, the pilots told flight controllers of their
desperate struggle to stabilize the plane as it dived, leveled off
and finally plunged into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The last transmission was the words ``thank you,'' after the
crew was given permission to fly out over the ocean to make sure
there was no risk of ground casualties if the plane crashed on its
way to Los Angeles International Airport for an emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   Just two minutes later, the pilot of a private aircraft relayed
the tragedy: ``That plane has just started to do a big, huge
plunge.'' A commercial pilot flying nearby reported the plane had
``hit the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Audio tapes of the final minutes of Flight 261, which crashed
off the Ventura Coast on Jan. 31, killing all 88 aboard, were
released Wednesday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes reveal in vivid detail the efforts of Capt. Ted
Thompson, 53, and First Officer William Tansky, 57, to keep the
MD-83 airborne as they fought to overcome problems with the plane's
stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's crash off the coast of Port Hueneme ended what began
as a routine flight from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:09 p.m., more than three hours into the four-hour flight,
one of the pilots radioed controllers in Los Angeles that the plane
was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Center, Alaska 261, we are, uh, in a dive here,'' said the
trembling voice from the cockpit, which the FAA did not identify.
``Yeah, we're out of 26,000 feet, we're in a vertical dive - not a
dive yet - but, uh, we've lost vertical control of our airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, the pilot - growing breathless - radioed the
plane had dropped 2,300 feet. ``We've got it back under control
there - no we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   One minute later, the Alaska crew indicated they have ``kinda
stabilized'' the craft and climbed back up to 24,000 feet. ``We're
slowing down here and, uh, we're going, uh, to do a little
troubleshooting.''
</P>
<P>
   At 4:15, the crew said it had found the source of the trouble,
and had descended to 22,500 feet. ``We're with you ... we have a
jammed stabilizer and we're maintaining altitude with difficulty,
uh, but, uh, we can maintain altitude, we think, and our intention
is to land at Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Controllers gave the pilots some bearings and the OK to land at
Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Center, Alaska 261, I need to, uh, get down (to 10,000 feet),
change my configuration, make sure I can control the jet, and I+6L

DEMOCRATS SET RECORD BY RAISING $26 MILLION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as presidential candidate Al Gore is vowing to
work for campaign finance reform, the Democratic Party Wednesday
shattered fund-raising records by raking in $26 million at a ``blue
jeans and barbecue'' gala.
</P>
<P>
   The take surpassed a record for political fund-raising set
earlier this spring by the Republicans, who collected $21 million
in a tribute to their presidential candidate, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The event Wednesday, billed as a tribute to President Clinton,
attracted more than 12,000 supporters to the MCI sports arena,
where they were entertained by such stars as Robin Williams, Stevie
Wonder, LeAnn Rimes and Darius Rucker of Hootie and the Blowfish.
</P>
<P>
   The guest of honor appeared in a video touting achievements of
his administration, then spoke to the gathering. He was
unapologetic about the prodigious fund-raising, saying money from
supporters helps the party accomplish its goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it is corrupt to pass the Brady Bill instead
of beat it,'' the president said of the law requiring background
checks for firearms purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore said, if elected, his first goal will be to
pass campaign finance reform. ``If you elect me, the good news is
when we all come back here in four years, it won't cost as much,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also addressed gun control, noting that Charlton Heston,
just elected to a third term as president of the National Rifle
Association, called Gore ``the No. 1 foe of the gun lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, ``I wear that as a badge of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   He alluded to Heston's role as Moses in ``The Ten Commandments''
in a reference to his likely Republican opponent, Texas Gov. George
Bush. ``The last time Moses listened to a bush, the people wandered
in the desert for 40 years,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The gala underscored the growing fund-raising prowess of the
Democrats, who for years trailed significantly behind Republicans
in their ability to generate campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   The competition was vividly on display in the nation's capital
Wednesday evening, as Republicans held their own event several
blocks from the Democratic gala and expected to raise $11 million
for House and Senate candidates. That fund-raiser featured former
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 15 months of the 1999-2000 cycle, the Democrats
have raised $76 million in unrestricted ``soft money'' compared
with $84 million for the Republicans. That is a smaller gap than at
a similar point in the 1996 presidential election cycle, when the
Democrats raised $36 million and the Republicans collected $48
million in soft money.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans continue to be far ahead in collecting
restricted ``hard money '' contributions, raising $180 million to
the Democrats' $100 million in the first 15 months of the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials sought to deflate any suggestion that they
were catering to wealthy contributors by stressing that
three-quarters of the attendees paid $50 to attend the event. The
menu included pork ribs and cole slaw flown in from Charlie Vergo's
Rendezvous Restaurant in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the down-home theme, the event still drew its share of
influential donors who had either given or raised between $100,000
and $500,000. These donors were seated in prime front row tables on
the floor of the vast arena, while the $50 ticket holders sat up in
the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans noted the presence of these top donors as they
dismissed Democrats' claim that they were throwing a grass-roots
rally.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Paulitz, a spokesman for the Republican National
Committee, said that if everyone had paid $50 apiece the
fund-raiser would have had to attract 520,000 people to raise $26
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to bill this thing tonight as a common folk
fund-raiser. But if you had common sense you would know this is a
sham,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paulitz said that the fund-raiser also showed the weakness of
Gore because he had to rely on Clinton to help generate campaign
funds.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has been a tireless fund-raiser for his party,
much of the money he has helped bring in is intended to help his
vice president win the White House. The Gore campaign has proposed
that the party run $30 million in ads promoting his presidential
campaign in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   These party-financed issue ads have been criticized by campaign
finance advocates because they are viewed as a way of circumventing
contribution limits imposed on candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has called for the elimination of the soft money to the
political parties and vowed not to let the Democratic Party run
such ads on his behalf unless the GOP did so first. Gore spokesman
Chris Lehane said that the Democrats are now justified in running
such ads because a series of conservative organizations have begun
airing ads against Gore.

NORMAN DRACHLER DIES AT 88; HEADED DETROIT SCHOOL SYSTEM  
 BY ERIC V. COPAGE  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Norman Drachler, superintendent of the Detroit school system
during its most volatile period in the late 1960s and a champion of
integrating both the administration and student body, died on
Saturday at a hospital in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He was 88 and lived in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believed in diversity and that black and white children
should have opportunity to share their experiences,'' said Damon J.
Keith, a federal judge and friend of Drachler.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first battles over integration began just two years
into Drachler's tenure as superintendent, when a desegregation
proposal involving just 3,000 of the system's 300,000 students was
unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That very modest plan caused considerable political reaction,
ultimately leading to the recall of several school board members,''
said Arthur Johnson, who was appointed assistant superintendent by
Drachler in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1970, the Detroit school board, following state law,
decentralized the Detroit system. Afraid that the law would
maintain or increase school segregation in the city, the board
created a feeder pattern, channeling certain students from certain
lower schools to the high schools, as a preventive measure. Whites
began collecting signatures to oust the four members of the
seven-member school board who voted for the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood of that time was to drag your feet,'' said Larry W.
Hillman, a former professor at Wayne State University who was a
consultant on school desegregation in that era. ``My observation
was that he was looking at what are some of the best ways to do
these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Drachler also pushed for more black district administrators and
had a role in initiating a moratorium on buying textbooks, accusing
the publishers of failing to create positive depictions of
minorities, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Drachler was born in May 20, 1912, in Kaminetz-Podolsk,
in what is now Ukraine. He immigrated to Detroit with his family in
1929.
</P>
<P>
   Drachler received a bachelor's degree in 1937 and a master's
degree in education in 1939 from Wayne State University and a
doctorate in education from the University of Michigan in 1951. He
embarked upon a 35-year career in the Detroit school system in
1937, rising from teacher to become superintendent in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   After resigning in 1971, Drachler founded the Institute for
Educational Leadership, which specializes in training
administrators of urban school districts. The first institute was
at George Washington University in Washington. He founded another
institute with the same name three years later, when he moved to
Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Drachler is survived by his wife of 63 years, the former Evelyn
Taxey; a brother, Sol Drachler of Detroit; a son, Dr. David H., of
Phoenix; a daughter, Ruth M. Drachler of New York City; and four
grandchildren.

CHINESE EXPECT BILL'S PASSAGE TO SPEED DEVELOPMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS 3rd graf and adds 4th graf with government statement; SUBS
last 5 grafs with details of statement)  
 (With CHINA-TRADE) 
By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ News that China has taken the first step toward
permanent normal trade status with the United States was greeted
with joy here, tempered by worries about the wrenching economic
changes that are expected as China opens its markets to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fantastic,'' said Zhang Linan, a 24-year-old accountant
in a bank. ``I think it will be a boost for our economic
development and personally it means more choices for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government, in its first official reaction, expressed
``severe concern and dissatisfaction'' about conditions that the
House attached to the bill, including a new annual review of human
rights, calling it an unacceptable effort to ``interfere in China's
internal affairs and damage China's interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill's passage was expected to help China's entry to
the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   And since most people yearn for cooperation with the United
States, which they see as the world's economic and cultural leader,
defeat of the trade bill would have been seen as a stinging
betrayal. Reactions in Beijing were tinged with feelings of relief
that a crisis in U.S.-Chinese relations had been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so good that it passed,'' said Luo Hui, 36, a computer
programmer. ``And it's even better that it didn't fail to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Free trade and investment, Luo said, ``will bring many
opportunities here, but also will put lots of pressure on Chinese
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if Congress hadn't passed this law,'' he added, ``it would
have been a shock, a setback, a big international incident. Now we
can get on with business.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Chinese government had not yet issued an official
reaction, top officials had to be pleased and relieved. President
Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji had both staked their
prestige on China's entry into the global trading regime and on
closer economic ties with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The official statement, issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation, said ``it was wise of the House of
Representatives to pass'' the bill to normalize trade relations.
``The resolution of this issue will benefit the healthy and stable
development of Sino-American bilateral trade on a basis of equality
and reciprocity.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the government put a strong protest on the
record. The conditions included in the bill, the official statement
said, are ``unacceptable to the Chinese government.''
</P>
<P>
   The news from Washington should speed along what is already a
remarkable revival in Chinese-American relations since the bombing
of China's embassy in Belgrade last year, during the NATO campaign
against Yugoslavia. Still, foreign policy experts warn of pitfalls
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the trade vote in Congress, two big problems threatened
Chinese-American relations, trade relations and Taiwan,'' said
Xiong Zhiyong, dean of the Foreign Affairs College here. ``Now
there's only one.''

DEFROCKED CAPTAIN COMES BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Cold. The entire Eric Lindros saga is
cold. He probably should not even be playing, given his history of
concussions. The Philadelphia Flyers give the impression that he is
superfluous. And he may be playing for all the wrong reasons, like
retaining his value for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Wanted or unwanted, Lindros was the only Flyer to put the puck
in the net Wednesday night. Wearing his familiar No. 88, he scored
with 30.1 seconds left but the Flyers failed to eliminate the
Devils in the Eastern Finals of the Stanley Cup playoffs. The
Devils won, 2-1, on two third-period goals to avert the dreaded
handshake line ``in our building,'' as the players put it.
</P>
<P>
   The series final will be Friday night in Philadelphia, and the
joke of it is that the best player on the Flyers' roster, at 27,
one of the top players in history, seems essentially unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that but earlier in the season the team had ripped the
captain's C from his jersey, a disgrace in hockey, which values the
captaincy more than any other sport does. Cold.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey depends on camaraderie, is just old-fashioned enough that
guys affectionately call each other by such unimaginative and
ubiquitous nicknames as ``Gordie'' and ``Clarkie'' and even the
plain old ``Marty'' for the Devils' Francophone goaltender, Martin
Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey players look to their best player for inspiration. The
Rangers used to know when Mark Messier had trouble flexing a knee,
but the man they called ``Mess'' folded his arms across his rugged
chest and gave his bland Mr. Kleen smile and pronounced that the
Rangers would win the next game. And more often than not, they did.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it should have been for Eric Lindros on Wednesday
night. There should have been an aura to his gallantry in coming
back from the latest concussion.
</P>
<P>
   He has gone through the parade of team doctors and concussion
specialists, sitting out the entire playoffs while his brain tried
to stabilize itself. This is serious business. There is
considerable reason to believe Lindros should retire, the way his
kid brother did after his concussions, but there he was Wednesday
night, taking up one of the 20 uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros has as much chance of returning to the Flyers as smooth
Roberto Baggio has of returning to Inter of Milan next season. On
Tuesday, after being inexplicably buried all season, Baggio
produced two goals that qualified Inter for the lucrative Champions
League next season. Stars can have an instant impact.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Lindros almost did. The big boy was actually
the first player to put the puck in the net, but the action came
clearly after the buzzer ending the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros looked somewhat slow, not showing the brute speed that
allowed him to outrace Mark Messier in an epic duel in the 1997
playoffs, but that was to be expected. He leveled the pesky Claude
Lemieux in the first period, and got involved in a skirmish in the
third, but the durable linesman, Kevin Collins, shooed him away
from even the possibility of a stray punch.
</P>
<P>
   For all the toughness, Lindros' self-involvement, the
machinations of his agent-father, and Lindros' criticism of the
team medical process had made him virtually persona non grata. His
return was a chilly contrast to that accorded other great players
who struggled with pain.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the reception for Willis Reed, hobbling out of the
runway to help the Knicks win the 1970 championship. Think of the
way the Yankees glanced at Mickey Mantle, playing with blood
seeping into his uniform from an infection on his backside, during
the 1961 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Bruins always hoped Bobby Orr's knee was stable
enough for him to go out on the ice. The old Islanders would glance
at wan Mike Bossy sneaking a cigarette in a corner of the room,
knowing he would find a way to ignore his bad back.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Lemieux won Stanley Cups and scoring titles and came back
from Hodgkin's Disease. And the current Flyers know that their
president, Bobby Clarke, earned all those gaps in his
jack-o'-lantern smile in the ancient Stanley Cup photos of the
Broad Street Bullies, but that he played as a diabetic.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Lindros does not lack for courage, nor does he lack in
skill, but in dynamics traditionally alien to hockey, he has a feud
with Clarke, and that sets him apart from his teammates. There has
rarely been such a public disdain of a star. Cold.

MORRIS HARRELL, 80, AN INFLUENTIAL TEXAS LAWYER

<TEXT>
<P>
   Morris Harrell, an influential Texas lawyer and former president
of the American Bar Association, died on Tuesday in Dallas, where
he lived. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell was also a former president of the Dallas Bar
Association, the State Bar of Texas, the American College of Trial
Lawyers and the National Conference of Bar Presidents.
</P>
<P>
   A.P. Carlton, chairman of the American Bar Association's
Standing Committee on Judicial Independence, of which Harrell was a
member, said, ``Morris led the effort in trying to affect a change
in the way judges are selected in Texas, and to implement a merit
selection procedure, as opposed to partisan political selection.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris Harrell was born on April 16, 1920, in Grandview, Texas.
He received a bachelor's degree and law degree from Baylor
University in Waco, Texas. He was a Navy officer in World War II.
After the war, he joined his uncle's law office, where he remained,
with the exception of four years as a federal prosecutor, until
1955, when he joined Thompson, Knight, Wright &AMP; Simmons, then one
of the largest law firms in Dallas. In 1965, he was a co-founder of
the firm of Rain, Harrell, Emery, Young &AMP; Doke, which merged with
other firms over the years to become Locke Liddell &AMP; Sapp LLP, one
of the largest law firms in Texas. Harrell remained a practicing
trial lawyer there until the end of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Harrell was awarded the American Bar Association Medal,
which is given to people considered ``to have rendered
exceptionally distinguished service to the cause of American
jurisprudence.'' Previous recipients have included Oliver Wendell
Holmes, Thurgood Marshall, Felix Frankfurter and Sandra Day
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell is survived by his wife of 56 years, the former Rhoda
Baylor, who is known as Rusty; a son, Jim, of Dallas; two
daughters, Julia Harrell Boone of Houston, and Rhoda Harrell
Reynolds of Dallas, and seven grandchildren.

MOVIES, AGRICULTURE MAY REAP IMMEDIATE GAINS FROM CHINA TRADE PACT
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles-area business leaders hailed the
congressional vote Wednesday approving permanent normal trade
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   While the nation's trade deficit with China is likely to widen
initially, business sectors such as the entertainment industry and
agriculture stand to see immediate gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we're going to see the impact phase in over
a period of years,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los
Angeles County Economic Development Corp. ``The local industry that
will have the most immediate benefit is the motion picture
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the trade agreement negotiated with China as part of its
accession to the World Trade Organization, Chinese officials agreed
to double their quota of American films they allow to show in
China. The number of films allowed will go from 10 to 20 when China
enters the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles area is well-positioned to take advantage of
open trade with China, Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a market that can be significant for us, but
it's not going to happen immediately. There will be opposition to
this agreement internally in China,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   Some agriculture concerns in China already are stating their
opposition because of the threat of being undercut by American
growers.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Quarles, vice president of corporate relations for Van
Nuys, Calif.-based Sunkist Growers, said citrus producers already
have begun to see increased sales resulting from the negotiations
with China.
</P>
<P>
   In March, China agreed to reopen its markets to American citrus,
which had been quarantined since 1980, ostensibly because of the
Medfly infestation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our shipments have increased substantially on a weekly basis,
and that's all without advertising and promotion. The reason we
could not advertise and promote is we were not assured of our
market access until today,'' Quarles said. ``Chinese negotiators
made clear ... that if Congress voted PNTR down, all bets were off,
so this vote was absolutely crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ackerman, chief executive officer of the Economic Alliance
of the San Fernando Valley, said the Valley's degree of trade with
China has not been thoroughly measured. The alliance plans to
conduct a study with Kyser's help to estimate the Valley's
international trade.
</P>
<P>
   Although the measure of international trade has not been broken
down to separate out the Valley, Ackerman said he believes the
results will be surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're doing far more than most people realize,''
Ackerman said. ``There are thousands of companies out there that
are engaged in some form of import-export.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's especially positive for the Los Angeles economy because
we already have connections with China,'' Kyser said. ``As China
opens up and they develop a middle class, there's going to be a lot
of things we can send over to them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the annual reports of the Port of Los Angeles, 3.4
million tons of cargo departed the port bound for China in 1996,
the most recent year for which figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 16.2 million tons departed the Port of Long Beach for
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agriculture industry, I think, is a winner, and the
entertainment industry is a winner,'' Kyser said. ``Eventually,
you'll be able to see other industries such as technology.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gideon Waldrop, a composer and administrator, who
served for 24 years as dean of the Juilliard School of Music and
for nearly three years as president of the Manhattan School of
Music, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Waldrop was born on Sept. 2, 1919, on a ranch just north of
Abilene, Texas. He received a Bachelor of Music degree from Baylor
University in Waco, Texas., and then served in the intelligence
division of the Air Force during World War II, for which he was
awarded the Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Waldrop briefly taught at Baylor and conducted
the Baylor University-Waco Symphony. He then entered the Eastman
School of Music in Rochester, where he received his master's and
doctoral degrees in composition, studying with Howard Hansen and
Bernard Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s he was the editor of the Review of Recorded
Music as well as the Musical Courier, and also served as a music
consultant to the Ford Foundation. This work led him into the
administrative field. In 1960 he became the assistant to the
president at Juilliard and the next year was appointed dean. He was
at that post in 1969 when the school moved from its old building on
Claremont Avenue in Morningside Heights into its new $30 million
building at Lincoln Center, which he described in an interview at
the time as ``the Taj Mahal of conservatories.'' In fact, as the
school grew the building seemed increasingly crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Following the death in 1983 of the Juilliard School's president,
the composer Peter Mennin, Waldrop served as the acting president
for one year.
</P>
<P>
   From 1986 until 1989 he was the president of the Manhattan
School, which had taken over the old Juilliard building on
Claremont Avenue. Waldrop resigned this post over disagreements
with the board.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a brother, Samuel.

ELLIS KOHS, 84, COMPOSER OF WORKS IN A MODERN AND CLASSICAL MODE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill.)  By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ellis Kohs, a composer known for works in which contemporary
harmonic ideas were combined with the structural elegance of
classical forms, died at a nursing home in Los Angeles on May 17.
He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Kohs was born in Chicago on May 12, 1916, and grew up in San
Francisco, where he undertook his early musical studies at the San
Francisco Conservatory. When his family moved to New York in 1928,
he entered the Institute of Musical Art. He continued his studies
at the University of Chicago, where he was a composition student of
Carl Bricken. After he completed his master's degree there in 1938,
he returned to New York and enrolled at the Juilliard School, where
he studied composition with Bernard Wagenaar. He also studied
composition with Walter Piston and musicology with Willi Apel and
Hugo Leichtentritt at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Kohs conducted the Army and Air Force bands
at Fort Benning, Ga.; St. Joseph, Mo.; and Nashville. He also wrote
one of his more humorous works during his army service, ``The
Automatic Pistol,'' in which he set the text of an Army weapons
manual for a male a cappella choir.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to civilian life, he joined the faculty of
Wesleyan University, where he taught composition from 1946 to 1948,
and the Kansas City Conservatory, where he taught during the
summers of 1946 and 1947. In 1948, he moved to California and
undertook teaching positions at the College of the Pacific and at
Stanford University. He began teaching at the University of
Southern California in 1950, and remained on the faculty for 38
years, during which he was chairman of its music theory department
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Kohs' stage works include an opera, ``Amerika'' (1969), after
Kafka's novel, ``Lohiau and Hiiaka,'' a choreographed setting of a
Hawaiian legend, and incidental music for Shakespeare's ``Macbeth''
(1947). Among his orchestral scores were a Concerto for Orchestra
(1942), a Cello Concerto (1947), a Violin Concerto (1980) and two
Symphonies (1950 and 1957). His vocal works included settings of
Navajo songs and ``The Lord Ascendant,'' based on ``The Epic of
Gilgamesh.'' He was also a prolific composer of chamber and
keyboard works.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of several music theory textbooks, including
``Music Theory, a Syllabus for Teacher and Student'' (1961),
``Musical Form: Studies in Analysis and Synthesis'' (1976) and
``Musical Composition: Projects in Ways and Means'' (1980).
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.

EDITORIAL: OPENING CHINA TO GOODS AND IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, May 25:
</P>
<P>
   By approving legislation that permanently normalizes trade
relations with China, the House opened the way Wednesday for a more
stable and productive relationship with that country. President
Clinton and the Republican leadership also won an important victory
for the principle of bipartisan leadership in foreign policy. The
Senate is expected to endorse the China trade bill soon.
Congressional approval, however, must be seen as a first step
toward broadening relations with the Chinese and pressing them to
open their country to democracy, the rule of law and respect for
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the vote was more one-sided than many had predicted.
The House speaker, Dennis Hastert, and his deputies Dick Armey and
Tom DeLay were more successful than the president in bringing along
their party faithful, many of whom were persuaded by the business
interests lobbying furiously until the very end. Gov. George W.
Bush and a raft of respected former Republican presidents, cabinet
members and officeholders helped. On the Democratic side, Clinton
got only 73 votes against a tough campaign waged by unions and by
the House Democratic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who favored the bill essentially bet that by competing
in the global economy, the United States can advance the cause of
liberty around the world and help shape international commercial
forces to everyone's advantage, including American workers and
Chinese democrats. They correctly judged that increased trade with
China would not only expand the sale of more American goods there
but also widen the circulation of democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the trade bill will not diminish the need for
vigilance over China's human rights problems. Clinton struck the
right note after the vote when he pledged to use China's accession
to the World Trade Organization as a way of monitoring
environmental and labor standards in China, as well as the rule of
law and freedom of expression and religion. He gave appropriate
credit as well to Reps. Sander Levin of Michigan and Douglas
Bereuter of Nebraska, who crafted legislation for a commission to
monitor Chinese human rights as a way of bringing skeptics on
board.
</P>
<P>
   It will take vigorous action to continue the pressure on China
on these issues. There is understandable skepticism about the
position that simply trading with China and opening it up to
foreign investment will produce a more open society. But a striking
number of experts on China, and many in the dissident community in
China, have argued persuasively that creating wealth in the private
economy, along with more avenues of communication, will strengthen
those Chinese in a position to demand a pluralistic and democratic
society.
</P>
<P>
   The world will now be looking to China to honor its trade
obligations, including the lowering of barriers to foreign
investment and goods. But in the years ahead as China takes its
place among the world's economic and political powers, it must also
treat its own people with dignity and respect. The measure of
Wednesday's House action, and Clinton's handling of China, should
not just be the future state of the Chinese economy but the state
of Chinese society.

EDITORIAL: AN AMBITIOUS AIRLINE MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, May 25:
</P>
<P>
   There is a morbid expression that no one ever got rich hauling
passengers. Not the railroads. Not the buses. Not the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   That is the backdrop for the proposed takeover of US Airways,
the sixth-largest domestic carrier, by United Airlines, the leading
domestic carrier. Ordinarily, a merger that decreased competition
would be worrisome. But airlines are not ordinary. Though
profitable over the past couple of years during ebullient economic
times, they struggle year in and year out to make a decent profit.
They are plagued by chronic excess capacity and gigantic losses
when the economy slips. By wringing out excess costs and creating
large networks that provide lots of travel options and convenient
schedules, mergers can do consumers more good than harm. Whether
that is true in this case will not be known until the Justice
Department completes an exhaustive review.
</P>
<P>
   United, whose employees own a majority of the company, has many
international partners and domestic routes that spread out from
centrally located ``hub'' airports. The merger gives it more routes
in lucrative eastern markets and a prized asset, the shuttle route
from Boston to New York to Washington. US Airways, by contrast,
lacks international heft and even full national reach. Its labor
costs are high and its labor relations sour. It is racking up
losses even as the rest of the industry makes record profits. For
this struggling carrier, United offers a lifeline. If Justice
decides that US Airways cannot survive on its own and that the
merged airline will offer travelers better schedules, one-stop
ticketing and more attractive frequent-flier programs, then
approval will follow.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice has taken an aggressive stance against airline
mergers, for good reason. There are often specific airports _ in
this case, in Washington, Baltimore, New York and Boston _ where
mergers threaten to strip travelers of competition. To solve this
problem at Reagan National Airport in Washington, US Airways has
announced it would turn over many of its routes to a new airline,
DC Air. Justice, however, may find other pockets of diminished
competition and demand further divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers often blame the airline deregulation of the late
1970s, and the merger wave it spawned, for flight delays, baggage
mix-ups, cramped leg room and other woes. But most of this
criticism is misplaced, according to a recent study by Clifford
Winston of the Brookings Institution and Steven Morrison of
Northeastern University. Mergers, they say, have not raised fares
and have been pursued to cut costs. Indeed, average prices have
fallen by more than 25 percent under deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   True, travelers flying to locations served by only one airline
may find themselves paying prices they consider exorbitant. There
are also some troubling allegations of anti-competitive behavior,
such as attempts by large carriers at their hub airports to drive
smaller rivals out of business by cutting prices temporarily to
punishingly low levels and then raising them when the competition
is driven away. It will be Justice's task to determine whether this
proposed merger is benign or threatens to jack up prices and
diminish service.
</P>
<P>
   Labor opposition could still derail the merger. The pilots'
union at United scuttled an earlier effort to merge the two
carriers out of fear that many of its members would lose seniority.
Meshing the employee-owners of United with the often disgruntled,
costly employees of US Airways may prove a graver threat to
completing the merger than anything thrown in the way by antitrust
authorities.

NEW YORK BANS GAS ADDITIVE, EMISSION PERMIT SALES
</HEADLINE>
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki signed two major environmental
bills into law Wednesday, including a ban on the use of a common
gasoline additive that has polluted underground water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also signed legislation that tries to limit the amount of
pollutants drifting into New York from coal-burning power plants in
Midwestern and Southern states, and causing acid rain. The measure
seeks to stop New York companies from selling their federal
pollution allowances, which they now earn by cleaning up their own
smokestacks, to polluters in those other states.
</P>
<P>
   The New York laws potentially conflict with the federal Clean
Air Act of 1990 and set the stage for a protracted legal fight with
the state's energy and petroleum producers.
</P>
<P>
   Energy industry representatives called both measures illegal and
said they were considering court challenges, asserting that New
York had no authority to supersede federal law. The law banning
pollution credit sales goes into effect immediately, and the ban on
the gas additive is to take effect in January 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's aides Wednesday acknowledged the potential legal
problems with both laws, but contended the state's action should at
least send a message to Washington that there were deficiencies in
the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that neither legislation is perfect,'' said
Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the governor, adding, ``We want to
see a resolution of both these issues on the national level, and we
think this pushes that debate forward. ''
</P>
<P>
   David Cohen, a spokesman for the federal Environmental
Protection Agency, said he could not comment on the legality of the
two New York laws because it's a matter for the courts to decide.
But he said that the agency had the same concerns as New York, and
that it was seeking to address them either through EPA regulations
or new federal legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share the concerns of the state and are working toward the
same end,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The gasoline additive being banned in New York is known as
methyl tertiary butyl esther, or MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal 1990 Clean Air Act, oil companies had to
reformulate gasoline to increase oxygen content to burn more
cleanly and reduce toxic emissions. The oil industry ultimately
settled on MTBE as the gasoline additive that would best meet the
mandate. But because many underground gasoline stoage tanks leak,
MTBE tends to escape even faster than gasoline . As a result, MTBE
has tainted the water in an unknown number of places around the
country. A possible carcinogen, the chemical is also suspected of
being toxic to the nervous system when consumed in large
quantities, though the exact health effects are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The New York law would force the petroleum industry to find
another additive that would achieve the oxygen-content mandate of
the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   The legality of the new law is unclear. The Clean Air Act
explicitly says states cannot mandate what kind of gasoline
additive the petroleum industry uses to meet emissions standards.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, California was the only state to ban the additive.
California is not regulated by the Clean Air Act because the state
has tougher rules that pre-date the federal act.
</P>
<P>
   New York is the first state where the ban might face a legal
challenge. The other bill that the governor signed prohibits New
York companies from selling federal permits for sulfur dioxide
emissions to polluters in 10 states, mainly in the Midwest and the
South. Pollution from companies in these states has been blamed for
acid rain in environmentally fragile areas of New York, like the
Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   The federal permits _ essentially the right to pollute _ are
awarded to companies that cut their own emissions below federal
standards. It's legal for one company to sell its unused permits to
power companies with older facilities that find it cheaper than
spending on new equipment to reduce pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The New York law imposes a fine on companies equal to the amount
of pollution permit sales, and the money would be used to develop
clean energy sources like solar power.
</P>
<P>
   The New York law drew sharp attacks from representatives of the
state's utility industry, who said it potentially violates the
interstate commerce clause of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The law prohibits New York power companies from selling their
pollution credits to companies in 10 Southern and Midwestern
states: Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, Ohio,
Michigan, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana and Wisconsin. It also
prohibits sales to four states nearby: New Jersey, Maryland,
Pennsylvania and Delaware.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Rangers' drive toward first place has
been impressive considering they've done it with one pitcher tied
behind their back.
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed Matt Perisho, the Rangers' long reliever, has gone
more than two weeks without pitching. His long layoff, and
ineffectiveness when he has pitched, have reduced his value to
manager Johnny Oates and increased Perisho's frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think something has to be done,'' Perisho said. ``I'm
all for the team, and being on a winning team is a lot of fun. But
when you're just sitting out there day after day, it's hard to feel
a part of the team. That's the hardest thing, trying to think I'm
not just out there taking up space.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin is sympathetic and discussed the
situation Tuesday with Perisho's agent. But, even though a roster
move is forthcoming to make room for Rusty Greer, Melvin doesn't
see it being time to make a move with Perisho. The Rangers are
leaning toward returning Danny Kolb to the minors. He hasn't
pitched in a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough situation for Matt,'' Melvin said. ``You'd like
to be able to give him a shot, but it's been tough to get him in a
ballgame. He's sort of designated as our long guy, but we haven't
had that many situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Perisho's problem is he is out of options. Melvin acknowledged
Perisho would be better off pitching in Triple A, but Perisho would
have to clear outright waivers, and the Rangers are sure he would
be claimed by another team. Oakland recently tried to send pitcher
Ron Mahay through waivers, but Florida claimed him.
</P>
<P>
   As far as trading Perisho, as the Rangers did with Robb Nen in
1993 when he was in a similar situation, Melvin said: ``There's
always that thought. You think about it. You'll move anybody if you
can get value in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you talk to clubs about pitching, they're not gung-ho
about somebody who is out of options. They want flexibility, a guy
who can be moved back and forth'' from the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Perisho isn't the only player in this situation. Seattle has
three pitchers out of options: Paul Abbott, Frankie Rodriguez and
Jose Paniagua. Toronto has John Frascatore, Boston has Rich Garces
and the New York Mets have Pat Mahomes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' problem is they're turning a 24-year-old
left-hander who won 15 games at Triple A last year into a
seldom-used mop-up man. He went 10 days without pitching, then gave
up 10 runs against Oakland on May 5. Four days later, he gave up
five runs against Seattle. He hasn't pitched since.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to put me on waivers because they don't want
to lose me, but they can't come up with a solution that works for
both parties,'' Perisho said. ``It's not doing anybody any good.''

CURTIS MOVING TO RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Left fielder Rusty Greer is expected to be
activated off the disabled list tomorrow when he joins the Rangers
in Minnesota. When Greer is activated, Chad Curtis will move to
right field and share playing time with Jason McDonald while Gabe
Kapler remains sidelined with a strained hip flexor, manager Johnny
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis is a right-handed hitter, and McDonald is a switch hitter
who hits much better from the left side. Oates said Curtis will
play against all left-handed pitchers and some right-handed
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curtis is an everyday big-league player,'' Oates said. ``He'll
get a lot of playing time in right.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald has speed, and Curtis had a .500 slugging percentage
going into last night's game, with 11 doubles and six homers in 136
at-bats. He gives the Rangers a better chance of a big inning early
in the game, and McDonald's speed gives them a better chance of
manufacturing runs late.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said the ideal situation would be for Curtis to play seven
innings, then have McDonald come in for the final two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good with Curtis at the plate,'' Oates said. ``He's
been in the middle of a lot of big innings for us. But so has
Jason. They've both done well. We've gotten a lot out of both of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers need for that to continue because Kapler is likely
to miss at least two more weeks after reinjuring a hip flexor
Monday while playing for Triple-A Oklahoma on
medical-rehabilitation assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be awhile,'' trainer Danny Wheat said. ``It could be
several days before he even runs.''  &QL; 
Catalanotto still hurting
</P>
<P>
   Rangers infielder Frank Catalanotto has a new glove, but it
could be several days before he's able to use it. Catalanotto is
sidelined with a strained groin muscle, a problem that has plagued
him for most of the season, and is available only for pinch-hitting
duty.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates, growing weary of the situation, said he won't let
Catalanotto play the field until the medical staff assures Oates
that Catalanotto won't reinjure the leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go like this all summer,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Catalanotto: ``I can only go when it allows me to go, and
right now it's not allowing me to go. Hopefully, it won't linger
all year. The last couple of days I've felt encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said Catalanotto's injury isn't hurting the Rangers right
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a nice little bat to go up there once a night,'' Oates
said. ``Now is the time to let him heal; everybody else is playing
well.''  &QL; 
Alicea leads off Johnny Oates was considering using Rusty Greer as
a leadoff hitter when Greer returns from the disabled list. But
Oates has scratched that idea for now. Luis Alicea, going into last
night's game, had batted lead off in 11 consecutive games and hit
.362 in that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a leadoff hitter doing very well,'' Oates said.
``Rusty will be better in the No. 2 spot with his pop and his
on-base percentage.''

TOUGH JOB? TRY JOCKEY FOR SIZE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   As far as his doubters go, Troy Aikman said this week at Valley
Ranch that he understands and accepts the reasoning behind the
current flak. If nothing else, it comes with the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody'' is a quarterback critic. Everybody is always ready
with an instant opinion on how the quarterback played, as opposed
to say, the left guard, the linebacker, the running back, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is arguably the toughest position in sports,'' Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   For pressure and snap judgments by the masses, what else is
close? As we're now seeing, maybe goalie this deep in the NHL
playoffs, and you'd certainly have to add to the list a pitcher in
the playoffs or World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also a little fellow at Lone Star Park at Grand
Prairie yesterday who definitely measures up _ all 5-foot-3, 114
pounds of him _ when it comes to dealing with ready-made heat in
the pursuit of his chosen profession.
</P>
<P>
   Take a ride with Kent Desormeaux, arguably the best jockey of
thoroughbred racing's current era. Climb into the saddle aboard
Fusaichi Pegasus last Saturday in the Preakness at Baltimore, the
second leg of the Triple Crown. Understand that your sport and the
multibillion-dollar industry that surrounds it, is counting on
``Fu-Peg'' to be the next Secretariat, the first super 3-year-old
of the 2000s.
</P>
<P>
   A super horse, which this one appeared to be in winning the
Kentucky Derby, is sure to draw a massive audience and attention to
a sport that doesn't come close to the overall national appeal of
something like the NFL or Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughbred racing needs another Secretariat. It didn't,
however, get him last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux and ``Fu-Peg'' ran a well-beaten second to Red
Bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand where Troy is coming from, but then again, he's
kinda at the mercy of how well his offensive line plays,''
Desormeaux said. ``If the guys up front aren't doing their job,
then Troy can't do what he does best.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in this sport, you can be on the perfect horse, but if
something happens with another horse that impedes your horse, and
you don't win the race, then you're going to get blamed. And even
if you've got the perfect horse, and get the perfect trip, but
another horse happens to run better, you still get blamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiling, Desormeaux added, ``We hear it all the time _ `what was
that pin-head thinking?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing and pro football have one common trait _ wagering.
No other team sport in this country, or maybe the world, matches
the NFL for the amount of money bet on games, legally and
illegally. In wagering, it is second only to horse racing, a sport
driven by the ``handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans can be passionate without any wagering. But put 10 bucks or
so on the outcome, and the howls, plus the second-guessing from the
``losers,'' grow noticeably louder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with that,'' said Desormeaux, who has heard it all
before, many times.
</P>
<P>
   But the second-guessing of Desormeaux in the Preakness was
actually minimal, if it all. A little bit of ``did he go too wide
\Ron the turn for home\S'' was heard, but reality said Red Bullet
was simply the better horse on this particular day. Fusaichi
Pegasus was running two weeks after his monster effort in the
Derby. Red Bullet had skipped Louisville, and was well-rested for a
drying-out Preakness track rated as ``good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't go that well around the turns, which was kind of a
tipoff that the track was greasy and he wasn't taking to it,''
Desormeaux said. ``This is a huge, huge, massive beast of a horse,
and that kind of track could have been a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I still thought we'd win, and really didn't become
concerned until about the three-eighth pole \Rleading into the
stretch\S, and Jerry \RBailey on Red Bullet\S and I had one horse
in front of us. We were rubbing shoulders and eye-balling each
other, meaning the next question was, who would push the button
first?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then both of us moved at the same time. He went inside, I went
outside, but \RFusaichi Pegasus\S was struggling when I asked for
his run.''
</P>
<P>
   Just one of those days ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the time frame between the Preakness and the Derby,
and remember Red Bullet skipped the Derby,'' Desormeaux offered.
``My horse is still a super horse, and that will be proven in the
long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux, who is Southern California-based, was in Grand
Prairie to promote next month's (June 23) All-Star Jockey
Championship, one of the best events of the summer at Lone Star.
Eleven of the nation's top jockeys will be competing. ``It's the
Rider's Cup, the real one,'' said Desormeaux, ``and we're going to
be here to put on a show for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, jockeys, like quarterbacks, are only as good as
their last ride/game. Aikman knows. Desormeaux knows. It comes with
the job. {Randy Galloway is a columnist for the Fort Worth

JOCKEY'S LOSS IN PREAKNESS CAN'T COMPARE WITH SON'S HEARING DEFECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE

<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Other than his belief that Fusaichi
Pegasus couldn't handle the wet track in the Preakness Stakes,
jockey Kent Desormeaux won't hem and haw about why his colt lost.
That he and Fusaichi Pegasus had a wider trip around the track than
Red Bullet doesn't account for much in Desormeaux's book.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a pathetic excuse,'' Desormeaux said. ``Red
Bullet was one horse inside of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``That horse was fresh. He ran an awesome race.''
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux was at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie yesterday for
the announcement of the 12 riders who will compete in the All-Star
Jockey Championship on June 23. He was low on excuses, but high on
other things despite difficulty in his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Desormeaux won the Kentucky Derby on Fusaichi
Pegasus, doctors had confirmed to him and his wife Sonia that their
15-month-old son, Jacob, was deaf. As much as he's being asked
about Fusaichi Pegasus and the next race in the Belmont Stakes,
Desormeaux is being asked how things are for his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still being schooled on what his hearing defects are,''
Desormeaux said. ``The `why' and how to fix it are what we're
trying to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux, 30, will be joined by Robby Albarado, Jorge Chavez,
Pat Day, Craig Perret, Laffit Pincay Jr., Edgar Prado, Jose Santos,
Shane Sellers, Mike Smith and Alex Solis in the All-Star Jockey
Championship. The only name that's yet to be added is the leading
rider at Lone Star through June 4, and that's currently Donnie
Meche by nine victories over Glenn Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Desormeaux said he and his family _ he and
Sonia also have a 7-year-old son, Joshua _ refuse to pout or make
excuses over their circumstances. Desormeaux himself lost the
hearing in his left ear after complications from skull injuries in
a spill during the races in 1992 at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   His family is trying to make things better with Jacob by
learning sign language, though they haven't given up hope that
Jacob will someday be able to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me selfish,'' Desormeaux said, ``but I hope one day that
Jacob will hear his mother coming home through the door one day and
he can run up to her and say `Mommy, I love you.' There's nothing
more I'd like to give my wife _ and Jacob _ than that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the family is learning sign language. It's
creating togetherness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do this together as a family,'' Desormeaux said.
``We've become so much closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacob is getting pretty good at it. He knows how to ask for
food when he's hungry. And Josh loves to learn how to say things
\Rin sign language\S like `cat.' Josh is eager to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   His family watches the bonding and thinks it's great to see, but
sad at the same time. Desormeaux's older brother, Keith, is a
trainer based at Lone Star. He said he's extremely close to his
brother, only three years separating them in age, and sees how his
brother is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to think that for all of us to get stronger, it's
because of what this boy is going through,'' Keith Desormeaux said.
``But that'll be the bright side of this. It'll bring this family
closer together.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot of kid in Kent. But there's no doubt that
this will play a big part in his maturation. These are the sorts of
things that make us who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent Desormeaux has been tried by tough times professionally. In
1998, he took criticism for possibly moving too early on Real Quiet
in the Belmont Stakes. Real Quiet would have won the Triple Crown
by winning the Belmont, but he blew a four-length lead in the
stretch and lost.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, Desormeaux was jeered by a handful of vocal
fans. It couldn't have been a scene that Desormeaux would want his
kids to see, but Desormeaux wouldn't mind if Jacob could hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux said his son has deadened nerve endings in the ears.
Doctors are fitting him with a special hearing aid. If that doesn't
work, doctors will implant a device onto the cochlea inside the ear
that will transmit radio waves into the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's profound,'' Desormeaux said.
</P>
<P>
   More profound than Fusaichi Pegasus' rematch with Red Bullet in
the Belmont. nn

SCRAMBLING BECAUSE OF INJURIES NOT NEW FOR STARS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Game 6 of the Western Conference Finals isn't
normally the ideal time to search for a second-line winger.
</P>
<P>
   The better time is Game 6 of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   With winger Jamie Langenbrunner out with an injured right knee,
however, the search is on. Whether it's rookies Roman Lyashenko or
Brenden Morrow, second-year forward Jon Sim or veteran Grant
Marshall, the Stars need a winger to play alongside Scott Thornton
and Joe Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been without him a little bit before, but he's obviously
a big part of the team,'' Thornton said of Langenbrunner. ``He
works so hard. He brings a lot of grit to the line, he's a skilled
guy. He's just a hole in the lineup that is hard to replace.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone bright spot in this for the Stars is that they have
been forced to fill holes all season. So tonight's Game 6 against
the Avalanche is no different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the only line that will stay the same will be \RMike\S
Modano's line,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``Everything else
will change.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little reason to change the top line of Modano, Brett
Hull and Jere Lehtinen. Modano and Hull] have been on the ice for
eight of the Stars' 10 goals in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that is where the search starts.
</P>
<P>
   In Langenbrunner's absence, Sim, who played in 25 games during
the regular-season but hasn't played in the playoffs, could move up
to the second line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a rumor going around I'm going to play,'' said Sim,
who scored five goals with three assists this season and played in
four playoff games last season. ``Of course, I'll be nervous. But
\Rlast year\S helps. It gives me some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sim isn't inserted in the lineup, Lyashenko could stay on the
second line, where he finished Game 5 after Langenbrunner was hurt
in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   That would likely mean winger Blake Sloan would return to his
spot on the third or fourth line after being a healthy scratch in
Games 4 and 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it depends on where we're going to play Jon,''
Hitchcock said. ``I think for Jon to be effective, he's going to
have to be a top-six forward, so he would really just replace
Jamie. If we want to scale it down and play Marshall in that hole
then we could put Sloan in and he could come in as a third- or
fourth-line player.''
</P>
<P>
   The advantage Sim brings is that he's a fast, skilled player
with a solid left-handed shot. The advantage Lyashenko brings is
that he's a skilled center capable of playing wing and has seen
action in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage the Stars have is that they have done this all
season. So, whether it's game No. 66 of the regular season or Game
6 of the Western Conference Finals, search parties are part of the
routine.

 STARS' MATVICHUK HAS BEEN A FORCE (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) By CHAREAN WILLIAMS c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Colorado Avalanche seems to bring out the
best in Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Matvichuk broke the Avalanche's bones. This year, he
has broken their spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if it's Colorado or Edmonton,'' Matvichuk
said yesterday. ``I show up every night when I get to the rink
knowing that my job is to shut the top line of the opposing team
down, and that's how I look at every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk hurt the Avs' chances of winning the 1999 Western
Conference Finals when he unintentionally took out two of their
best players in Game 4. Milan Hejduk ended his season with a
cracked collarbone. Peter Forsberg was not the same after suffering
a separated left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in the Stars' 3-2 overtime victory in Game 5 on
Tuesday, Matvichuk again played the part of Avs killer.
</P>
<P>
   He was all over the place. He was behind goalie Ed Belfour
getting a big save one minute and in front of the net setting up
Joe Nieuwendyk for the game-winner in another. In between, he and
defensive partner Derian Hatcher were containing Forsberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had very strong games in Games 4 and 5 _ excellent
games,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``He's done a much better
job of moving the puck. Him and Derian are more comfortable in the
way the series is unfolding now. They've had bigger bites in every
game. Matty's defensive awareness has allowed Derian to start
roaming a little bit, so Derian's had a bigger bite in the series,
because he's been able to move up the ice again, which is good.''
</P>
<P>
   At 9:45 of the first period Tuesday, Belfour left the crease to
play the high shot of Stephane Yelle.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour thought Matvichuk was going to clear the puck, and
Matvichuk thought Belfour was going to clear it. Instead, Avs
forward Shjon Podein found an open net waiting for his shot.
Matvichuk stuck his stick down just in time for the save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just was fortunate being in the right place at the right
time,'' Matvichuk said. ``We don't want to do that too often. We
got our communication mixed up a little bit. Luckily, it didn't go
in our net.''
</P>
<P>
   In overtime, Matvichuk's shot was deflected past Colorado goalie
Patrick Roy by Joe Nieuwendyk. It was Matvichuk's second point in
two games. He scored the Stars' fourth goal in a 4-1 victory
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I'm on the ice, my job is to keep the puck out of
my net,'' Matvichuk said. ``Fortunately, the last couple of games,
I've had a couple of offensive opportunities. There's no way I look
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk and Hatcher have silenced Forsberg, which is the key
to stopping the Avs. Since 1996, Colorado is 19-7 in playoff games
when Forsberg scores a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg, who had four goals on 12 shots in the Western
Conference semifinals against the Detroit Red Wings, has one goal
on 18 shots in this series. He took only one shot in Game 5 _ a
slap shot from the right circle that Belfour caught with his glove
_ and it came on a second-period power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of shutting them \RForsberg and second-line
center Joe Sakic\S completely down, because I don't think that can
be done,'' Matvichuk said. ``It's just a matter of containment. In
key situations in the game, if we can keep them off the scoreboard,
it's going to be to our advantage. So far, it's been to our
advantage, because they haven't had four or five goals a game.''

PERISHO OUT OF OPTIONS; SO ARE RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Rangers' drive toward first place has
been impressive considering they've done it with one pitcher tied
behind their back.
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed Matt Perisho, the Rangers' long reliever, has gone
more than two weeks without pitching. His long layoff, and
ineffectiveness when he has pitched, have reduced his value to
manager Johnny Oates and increased Perisho's frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think something has to be done,'' Perisho said. ``I'm
all for the team, and being on a winning team is a lot of fun. But
when you're just sitting out there day after day, it's hard to feel
a part of the team. That's the hardest thing, trying to think I'm
not just out there taking up space.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin is sympathetic and discussed the
situation Tuesday with Perisho's agent. But, even though a roster
move is forthcoming to make room for Rusty Greer, Melvin doesn't
see it being time to make a move with Perisho. The Rangers are
leaning toward returning Danny Kolb to the minors. He hasn't
pitched in a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough situation for Matt,'' Melvin said. ``You'd like
to be able to give him a shot, but it's been tough to get him in a
ballgame. He's sort of designated as our long guy, but we haven't
had that many situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Perisho's problem is he is out of options. Melvin acknowledged
Perisho would be better off pitching in Triple A, but Perisho would
have to clear outright waivers, and the Rangers are sure he would
be claimed by another team. Oakland recently tried to send pitcher
Ron Mahay through waivers, but Florida claimed him.
</P>
<P>
   As far as trading Perisho, as the Rangers did with Robb Nen in
1993 when he was in a similar situation, Melvin said: ``There's
always that thought. You think about it. You'll move anybody if you
can get value in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you talk to clubs about pitching, they're not gung-ho
about somebody who is out of options. They want flexibility, a guy
who can be moved back and forth'' from the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Perisho isn't the only player in this situation. Seattle has
three pitchers out of options: Paul Abbott, Frankie Rodriguez and
Jose Paniagua. Toronto has John Frascatore, Boston has Rich Garces
and the New York Mets have Pat Mahomes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' problem is they're turning a 24-year-old
left-hander who won 15 games at Triple A last year into a
seldom-used mop-up man. He went 10 days without pitching, then gave
up 10 runs against Oakland on May 5. Four days later, he gave up
five runs against Seattle. He hasn't pitched since.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to put me on waivers because they don't want
to lose me, but they can't come up with a solution that works for
both parties,'' Perisho said. ``It's not doing anybody any good.''

AVALANCHE PLAYERS ARE GROWING FRUSTRATED, BUT SAY THEY REMAIN
CONFIDENT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DENVER _ The Colorado Avalanche players find themselves in the
unique position of trying to figure out how to win while knowing
they have played some of their best offensive hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Key defensive breakdowns and remarkable play from Stars goalie
Ed Belfour have the Avs on the brink of elimination. Belfour has
stopped 105 of 110 shots in the past three games and the Stars have
seven goals on 35 shots against Patrick Roy in the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think it's very odd,'' Avs winger Dave Andreychuk said
regarding their two-game losing streak and 3-2 series deficit
despite feeling as though they controlled most of Games 4 and 5.
``You have to get some breaks, some things to go your way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avs, frustrated and dismayed by their inability to beat
Belfour on all kinds of chances, firmly believe they have outworked
and outplayed the big-play defending champions in this
best-of-seven Western Conference Finals that resumes today with
Game 6 at the Pepsi Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty happy with the way we are playing,'' Avs winger
Adam Deadmarsh said. ``We are getting lots of shots on net, we're
skating very well, we're playing with lots of speed. Against
Dallas, that's what you have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's spirits are up. We're down 3-2, but it's kind of a
different feeling around this dressing room. We know we aren't
dead, our confidence is right there, we just have to keep
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avs have reason to be confident. They've been as good or
better than the Stars in all categories except one _ goaltending.
Belfour has been spectacular. Roy has been good.
</P>
<P>
   The Avs are 7-1 at home in the playoffs, although the Stars won
the last game at the Pepsi Center, 4-1, despite being outshot,
39-15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game 6 is probably going to be the toughest game we have to
face in this year's playoffs,'' Stars center Mike Modano said.
``And I expect Denver and all of their best players are going to
play their best game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avs will attempt to put more traffic in front of Belfour and
be more physical in the crease. Mostly, they will need key
contributions from some slumbering giants if the Western Finals
series is to return to Dallas for a Game 7 for the second
consecutive:
</P>
<P>
   The Avs' once-potent power play has gone sour. Ray Bourque had
seven of his eight regular-season goals with the Avs on the man
advantage. He is still looking for his first playoff goal, and the
Avs are only 1-for-18 on the power play in the past three games.
Sandis Ozolinsh has also been a nonfactor on the power play and a
liability with the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so much talent on both of our units that we have to
trust those guys,'' Avs coach Bob Hartley said. ``Those guys will
make it happen, and we just need a goal to get our swing back in
the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sakic and Andreychuk must cash in their chances. Neither has
scored a goal this series despite a wealth of opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have confidence in our abilities,'' Sakic said. ``We
know we've been playing well. We just have to tear it up a little
more and maybe get some more shots and more screens on Eddie.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Forsberg must play like the dominant player he is. He has
only one goal in the series, coming in the third period of Game 2
when the Avs trailed, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's because we are playing bad,'' Forsberg
said. ``We're playing pretty good hockey. I think we can make it
better in a few areas and just go out and put the puck in the
net.''

AVS WORRIED ABOUT POWER PLAY THAT CONTINUES TO COME UP SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Avalanche is officially concerned about their power
play that has generated only two goals in their past 23 tries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have much to be confident about on our power play,''
Avs winger Adam Deadmarsh said. ``We have to try to get some shots
at the net. When we do get the opportunity, we have to take it
because it's not there that often. It comes down to hard work and
winning battles, and we've got the extra guy out there so we're
going to have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avs have not scored on the power play since Deadmarsh
redirected a Martin Skoula shot from the point at the 14:50 mark of
the second period in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Avs want to increase pressure in front of Stars goalie Ed
Belfour. Deadmarsh and Dave Andreychuk are responsible for crowding
the net, redirecting shots and screening Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to try to get second and third chances and bear down
on our chances,'' Andreychuk said. ``We are going to have to go to
the net a little bit more, start hanging around the net. That's the
way we are going to get goals.'' \Nsubheds:Sakic's help needed
Center Joe Sakic didn't score in Game 5 despite multiple chances,
including two golden opportunities to send the Avs home with a 3-2
lead instead of trailing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was the Avs' best offensive player in the game. He set
up Milan Hejduk's game-tying goal in the third period with some
dazzling skating. Sakic's line was busy. Hejduk finished with four
shots and while Dave Andreychuk had only one shot, he had chances
around the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Joe is on his way,'' Avalanche coach Bob Hartley said.
``I like the way that his game is picking up, how he's generating
\Roffense\S and he's skating very well. It's just a matter of being
rewarded. We need one goal from Joe and I think we could be on our
way.'' \Nsubheds:Line decisions
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hartley will likely leave center Chris Drury on the first
line with wingers Peter Forsberg and Adam Deadmarsh. He made that
change for Game 5, which put Stephane Yelle on the third line with
Dave Reid and Shjon Podein.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not set yet in our line combinations, but I don't think
you are going to see many changes or major changes,'' Hartley said.
``I like the chemistry of our team. I like the chances we
generated.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Forsberg double-shifted some with Yelle and Reid. That
line produced a goal in Game 5 when Jon Klemm scored off Yelle's
rebound. \Nsubheds:Roy remains focused Patrick Roy as allowed seven
goals on 35 shots in the past two games to drive his goals-against
average up from 1.52 to 1.76. His save percentage dropped to .928,
for the first time dipping below Ed Belfour (.932).
</P>
<P>
   Hartley called Roy's performances the past two games,
``excellent'' and said he is ``very focused.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look at the goals, it is very misleading,'' Hartley
said. ``Brett Hull is on fire, he's firing cannonballs. You look at
their winning goal \Rin Game 5 from Joe Nieuwendyk\S, there are not
many goalies that could have done on this. Patrick knows what he
has to do.''

OLYMPIC TRIATHLON TEAM MEMBER WENT THE EXTRA MILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two men who swim, bike and run their way onto the U.S.
Olympic triathlon team this weekend have one unselfish soul to
thank.
</P>
<P>
   You're quite welcome, Olympian Hunter Kemper would say.
</P>
<P>
   It was Kemper who, after thinking he had earned his way onto the
U.S. team by being the first American to finish at the Sydney World
Cup, discovered at the finish line that he next had to negotiate a
two-week thicket of triathlon politics and rankings voodoo.
</P>
<P>
   He did, racing in places like New Caledonia and Perth. And as a
result, the U.S. men's team climbed to 12th in the world rankings
and gained two extra spots at the Olympic starting line in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Sydney World Cup race, though, I just wanted to go
home,'' Kemper said. ``The whole time I was in New Caledonia, I was
thinking things like, `I shouldn't be here. I should already have
my spot. I earned it in Sydney. This isn't fair.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, he shouldn't have. He did. And it wasn't. But the
hope is that when the next Olympics rolls around, USA Triathlon
officials will better understand the vagaries of the sport's world
rankings and how to stay in the good graces of them.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Kemper now knows that he is definitely headed to
the Sydney Games. The U.S. Olympic triathlon trials men's race on
Sunday will determine which two other athletes will join Kemper.
</P>
<P>
   The trials will begin Saturday with the women's race, scheduled
to start at 9 a.m. at Lake Carolyn at Las Colinas in Irving, Texas.
The men will swim, bike and run the same course beginning at 10
a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Kemper, 24, knows he doesn't have to compete in the trials, but
he says that was never a consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is really off me,'' he said. ``But I want to race
because of the prize money and the exposure. Hopefully, people will
see this as a really clean and polished event and it's going to
help the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm going into the race to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 1999 U.S. Olympic Committee's triathlete of the year, the
reigning national champion and the Pan Am Games silver medalist,
Kemper has as good a chance as anyone. His strength in the
triathlon is the running portion, even though Kemper began his
athletic career as an accomplished swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   At age 10, growing up in Longwood, Fla., Kemper was lured into
the IronKids Triathlon program by some swimming buddies. He won the
first triathlon he ever attended. As a 13-year-old, his success
landed him in ``Sports Illustrated'''s ``Faces in the Crowd''
section.
</P>
<P>
   But as college neared, Kemper realized that to get to the
triathlon's next level, he would have to improve as a runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a 4:38 miler coming out of high school _ a bad runner,''
he said. ``Nobody was looking at me at all. I was so bad, in fact,
that I sent my stuff to Wake Forest _ my personal bests, my times,
my highlights _ and they sent me back the women's media guide. They
thought I was a female.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended up as a walk-on on the Wake Forest track team and
shelved the triathlon for three seasons for that he could improve
his running. By his senior year, Kemper had finished second in the
10,000 meters at the Atlantic Coast Conference championships.
</P>
<P>
   Kemper graduated in 1998 and promptly became USA Triathlon's
rookie of the year.

YANKEES BREAK OUT _ FOR ONE NIGHT, AT LEAST _ IN 12-4 WIN OVER
CHICAGO 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Their slump is consuming, the Yankees will admit
readily. They haven't hit, they haven't fielded, their best player
is hurt and they have been frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the times when you must grind your way through,
Manager Joe Torre said, and after looking defeated in the early
innings Wednesday night, the Yankees roared back with 11 runs in
their last three at-bats to beat Chicago, 12-4. The victory was
badly needed, with the Yankees set to face undefeated pitcher James
Baldwin on Thursday and the Red Sox coming to Yankee Stadium on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had 13 hits over the last three innings, 18 in all,
a season high. Paul O'Neill blew open the game with a three-run
double, Jorge Posada had three hits and two RBIs and Andy Pettitte
(3-2) pitched seven innings. Derek Jeter, the Yankees' shortstop
who is coming back from a strained abdomen, took batting practice
in Tampa, Fla., and could return to the lineup Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if the slump was going to deepen. It looked as if
the Yankees were going to lose their fourth straight. Bernie
Williams attempted to make a sliding catch of Jose Valentin's line
drive in the third inning, missed and the ball rolled behind him
and kept rolling, until Valentin had a triple that increased
Chicago's lead to 2-0. In their 42nd game, the Yankees were at
their lowest point in the season, their offense moribund, their
frustration mounting, losing again, some players believing
privately the team needs an injection of talent.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas came to bat, the Yankees infield moved in with only
one out. Another hit and the Chicago lead would be three runs. But
Pettitte whipped a fastball over the inside corner to get Thomas,
then fooled Magglio Ordonez, another strikeout. A spark.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored their first run against Mike Sirotka in the
fourth inning, and Pettitte kept shutting down the White Sox,
glaring in for the signs from Posada, the brim of Pettitte's cap
casting shadow over his face.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer drew a walk to open the sixth and Posada blasted a
high drive to left _ and grimaced when it curled foul just before
reaching the pole. Then Posada grounded into a double play and that
could have convinced the Yankees of a luckless fate.
</P>
<P>
   But trailing by a run, they picked at the White Sox in the
seventh. Scott Brosius coaxed a leadoff walk and Jim Leyritz,
pinch-hitting for Ricky Ledee, took a couple of close pitches and
also walkde. The hard-throwing Bob Howry relieved Sirotka. The
left-handed hitting Lance Johnson pinch-hit for Clay Bellinger.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson turned to bunt, some White Sox fans who remembered
his days in Chicago might have snickered: Johnson was a lousy
bunter then, and now, and he popped a ball foul that first baseman
Paul Konerko nearly reached. Johnson stepped out, looked to the
third base coach Willie Randolph.
</P>
<P>
   The bunt sign was off, and with the White Sox infield aligned in
bunt defense, Johnson bounced a single through the middle, scoring
Brosius with the tying run. Johnson's hit severed a tension cord
wrapped around the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch slammed a single, another run scored. Bernie
Williams lined a single to right, loading the bases. Howry was out
for the White Sox, Bill Simas was in. But O'Neill swung at a Simas
fastball and lowered his head, the way he does when he knows he has
crushed the ball.
</P>
<P>
   As O'Neill's drive soared to left-center, outfielders in
pursuit, Johnson retreated to third to prepare to tag up, Knoblauch
moved halfway between second and third, and Williams rounded
second, waiting like a picket line _ until O'Neill's liner slammed
against the fence. Johnson ran home standing, and Knoblauch did,
too, beckoning Williams with a wave of his hand, not knowing that
Williams was sliding across the plate right behind him. The
Yankees' dugout came alive with high fives and shouts.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, Posada blistered a line drive down the right
field line and it slammed against the foul pole. A home run, a
fitting finish to a seven-run inning, after his long foul ball the
inning before. The Yankees added two more runs in the eighth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Yankees are still looking to add a hitter. They are not
close to making a deal, although club executives are being
persistent in their attempts to identify a trade target. At least
three players fit the profile of what Yankees' executives would
want: Baltimore's B.J. Surhoff (the Orioles could ask for Ricky
Ledee and an outfield prospect like Jackson Melian in return);
Houston's Moises Alou, who was discussed in a conversation between
executives of the Yankees and Astros in recent days; and Oakland's
Matt Stairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics have asked for Alfonso Soriano or Ramiro Mendoza,
while the Yankees have countered with an offer of prospect Jake
Westbrook and another minor leaguer, which Oakland rebuffed. With
this set of talks at a stalemate, Stairs was told Wednesday he is
not being traded _ which could be construed as an artful way of
covering up the fact he was dangled in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees also have talked to teams about Detroit's Juan
Gonzalez, Kansas City's Johnny Damon, Tampa Bay's Jose Canseco, and
Minnesota's Matt Lawton.

EDITORIAL: CLINTON'S DISBARMENT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, May 25:
</P>
<P>
   In recommending that President Clinton be disbarred for
providing false testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
case, a disciplinary committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court has
called for the harshest sanction at its disposal. The Arkansas
courts will now have to decide whether disbarment is the right
penalty for the president's dishonesty, given all the
circumstances, or whether some lesser penalty such as a public
reprimand or suspension of his license to practice law is more
appropriate. But there is no doubt that Clinton must be called to
account for his legal misconduct and that this disbarment
proceeding is the appropriate forum in which to hold him
accountable.
</P>
<P>
   The false testimony at the root of this matter came in 1998
during a deposition in the lawsuit by Paula Jones alleging that
Clinton, while governor of Arkansas, had sexually harassed her. At
one point Clinton, in attempting to deflect questions designed to
show a pattern of bad behavior, denied having had sexual relations
with Monica Lewinsky. The president contended then, and continues
to maintain, that he did not technically lie because the activities
he engaged in with Lewinsky did not fit the definition of sexual
relations used in the trial. That argument was demolished by Judge
Susan Webber Wright, who presided over the Paula Jones case.
Cutting to the core issue, she found that the president had given
``intentionally false'' testimony under oath, fined him $90,000 and
referred the matter to the disciplinary committee that has now
recommended disbarment.
</P>
<P>
   The president's supporters cite what they consider mitigating
circumstances. They note that Wright ultimately dismissed the Jones
case and ruled that Clinton's disputed testimony was not germane,
so it is hard to argue that his false testimony harmed anyone. They
add that Clinton's testimony was not delivered as a lawyer but as a
private defendant in a lawsuit that he considered politically
motivated. They also argue that in Arkansas disbarment is typically
reserved for far worse crimes, like stealing from a client. All
these factors need to be considered when the case is assigned to an
Arkansas court. Indeed, the president's advocates are right that
some other lawyers caught lying under oath in Arkansas have
received reprimands rather than being disbarred.
</P>
<P>
   But the president and political allies like Sen. Charles Schumer
of New York demean the legal system when, without providing any
evidence, they depict Clinton as a victim of political bias.
Clinton's troubles did not originate in what Schumer called a
``kangaroo court.'' The president's credentials as an attorney are
under challenge because he decided, after careful planning, to
testify falsely.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas courts will now have to make an independent
judgment on an appropriate punishment. In doing so, they should
treat Clinton as they would any other lawyer caught giving false
testimony in similar circumstances. They should not punish the
president for who he is, just to make a symbolic statement. Nor
should they grant him special leniency. Clinton deserves equal
justice under the law, no more, no less.

BIT BY BIT, BENEFITS ARE BEING CUT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   A snip here. A clip there. A teensy trim over there. Pretty soon
it all adds up.
</P>
<P>
   You know how it is sometimes when you go in for a haircut. While
it's happening, it doesn't always seem like much is falling to the
floor. But when you leave, you've got a lot less hair than when you
went in, and the floor is littered.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with employee benefits. Snip, snip. Clip, clip. And,
whoa, Nellie. Something looks really different.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate pressures to cut costs and raise profit margins are
pinching employee benefits _ and a lot of employees are saying,
``Ouch.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey released last month by the Society for Human Resource
Management found that from 1999 to 2000, there was a decline in the
number of employers offering paid personal days, paid vacation
days, relocation benefits, employee stock purchase plans, health
screening and prevention programs, and sign-on bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the results, the national human resource
organization asked whether it was seeing a statistical hiccup or a
reversal of a long-running trend to beef up employee benefits.
</P>
<P>
   If it is the beginning of a downward spiral, human resource
officials say, it's a curious slip, given that the No. 1 complaint
of employers is that it's so hard to hire and keep good people.
</P>
<P>
   Employers whose benefits packages are better than their
competitors' generally earn the coveted ``employer of choice''
label and keep the best talent.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause or duration of benefits cuts, workers are
complaining. Internet gripe sites and my e-mail from readers
reflect the grumbling.
</P>
<P>
   In my own place of employment, rarely a day passes without
hearing a co-worker lament the mileage reimbursement rate paid by
the company for use of personal vehicles on business. For years,
reimbursement has remained at 24 cents a mile; that's now 7 cents a
mile below the Internal Revenue Service's current standard
deductible rate of 31 cents a mile.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Bureau of National Affairs Inc. reported
this month that 74 percent of employers reimburse mileage at the
rate of 31 cents a mile or higher. Twelve percent pay 28 cents to
30 cents a mile. Only 8 percent of employers reimburse less than 28
cents a mile.
</P>
<P>
   It may look like nickel-and-dime stuff, a petty gripe from
workers who are lucky to be reimbursed at all. But one has only to
look at car and gasoline prices to see why employees protest the
pinch.
</P>
<P>
   When the costs are totaled, the numbers may look good on the
company balance sheet, but there's no measurement of the financial
_ and certainly not the emotional _ costs to employees of benefits'
slippage.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Losey, president of the national Society for Human
Resource Management, speculated that the employee benefits
cafeteria expanded for a while as employers tried to compete for
employees in the tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the slicing and dicing ``may be indicative that a number of
employers found the new benefits too costly or not as effective as
they hoped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Snip, snip. Clip, clip.

PINKERTON TURNS OVER ARCHIVES FROM JESSE JAMES ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Good detectives don't like to show their hand. But
after 150 years, the storied Pinkerton agency is finally revealing
what it had on outlaws such as Jesse James and Butch Cassidy and
the Sundance Kid.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Pinkerton loaded almost 100 boxes of criminal
records, investigative notes, pictures, letters and other materials
on a truck bound for the Library of Congress in Washington, where
they will be available for historians and the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's essential that historians see this archive,'' said Jane
Adler, a Pinkerton archivist hired three years ago to organize the
material in California. ``It's a whole section of American history.
It gives an impression of an enormous enterprise with a very dark
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton provided security for scores of banks and railroads,
investigated organized labor, protected presidents and taught
police and the FBI many tricks of its trade. The company pursued
some of the country's most notorious criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The records that were released date from the company's founding
in 1850 to 1938, in the gangster era. The material includes the
only known photo of Etta Place _ the accomplice of Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid; 195 criminal investigation binders;
photographs of President Abraham Lincoln made by the Pinkerton
family; and pictures of slain outlaws.
</P>
<P>
   The collection has been appraised at $500,000, but Pinkerton
decided to donate it rather than sell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will attract a lot of attention,'' said John Sellers, a
Library of Congress historian who has tried for years to get the
archives. ``We are looking at the prosecution and pursuit of evil
and justice, and from that standpoint it is worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most frustrating chapters in Pinkerton's history
revolved around the James gang that plundered banks and trains
across the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we were ever close to getting the James
brothers,'' Adler said. ``They had a lot of community support. They
stayed in remote areas and as soon as anyone went in there, they
were shot on sight, tied up or mistreated.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton is releasing records on crimes the James brothers
committed, details on their gang's members, descriptions that
detectives carried of the two outlaws, wanted posters and some
sketches.
</P>
<P>
   Adler said the records had been reviewed by researchers but not
the public. She doesn't think they reveal anything new, but they
will be checked out by the Jesse James Farm and Museum at Kearney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be interested in comparing it to the stories we have
here and to our research,'' said Beth Beckett, director of the farm
and museum.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton drew public scorn in 1875 when agents raided the James
farm looking for Jesse. Shrapnel from an explosive blew an arm off
his mother, Zerelda Samuels, and killed his 11-year-old
half-brother, Archie Samuels. Jesse was not home.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, there was an outcry for the family and a lot of
sympathy for them,'' Beckett said.
</P>
<P>
   Adler said she could find no records of the raid on the James
farm. Ron Casteel, a Jefferson City authority on the Jameses who
produced a 1990 documentary on their lives, said he has never
gotten much out of Pinkerton on the James brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would just as soon the whole Jesse James era disappear,''
Casteel said. ``Pinkerton scored some success, but getting Jesse
and Frank James wasn't one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   One handicap: ``They had no photos to pass around. People who
had photos were not handing them over to the Pinkertons.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton had better luck catching up with another Missouri
outlaw named William Rudolph, dubbed ``The Missouri Kid.'' Rudolph
was a crafty, handsome but violent outlaw who used his blasting
skills as a miner to blow up banks around the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   He became the target of the biggest manhunt in Pinkerton history
after he shot a young Pinkerton detective who happened to be the
son of a company superintendent. Frightened of the pursuit, Rudolph
got himself jailed on a minor offense in hopes he would escape
notice as the much-wanted Missouri Kid.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't work, but Rudolph escaped jail and then was captured
and returned to Missouri for hanging, Adler said. Two letters
pleading for mercy he wrote to company founder Allan Pinkerton will
be part of a special Library of Congress exhibit on Rudolph and
four other Pinkerton cases next week.
