<HEADLINE> Deficit Financing Praised for Thai Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Budget deficit financing and
public spending expansion were attributed as the main reasons
behind the economic recovery of Thailand, a Government House press
release said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The press release quoted a report on a meeting of Public-
Private Consultation on Economic Affairs, chaired by the prime
minister, as saying that these government-initiated measures have
led to positive results as the country's economy has shown signs
of recovery since the last quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the year 2000, the Thai government will continue conducting
economic restructuring to achieve a sustained recovery, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The government will also take measures to stimulate private
investment to make it a driving force for economic development.
</P>
<P>
However, the private sector asked the government take care of
the urgent issues such as the increasing cost of production caused
by the oil hiking price in the world market, preparatory measures
for the annual crop pricing and the energy saving campaign.
</P>
<P>
The government was also urged to promote and support the small
and medium-sized enterprises and accelerate the restructuring
process of agricultural and industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed earlier this week
that the Thai economy is now "firmly" on the growth track and in
the right direction.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the IMF is considering revising its growth
forecast for the Thai economy this year to "closer to five percent
" from around four percent previously because of the country's
strong economic improvement in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda also said earlier
this week that the key to a sustained economic recovery in
Thailand is to implement the current policy.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian CPP Adopts Work Plan for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Cambodian People'
s Party (CPP) ended its two-day plenum of the Central Committee
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 281 party representatives at central and provincial
level attend the plenum chaired by Party President Chea Sim, Vice-
President Hun Sen and Honorary President Heng Samrin.
</P>
<P>
Participants exchanged views and unanimously approved a report
on the overall situation and party work in 1999 as well as the
party work plan for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, CPP expressed its profound gratitude to
King Norodom Sihanouk for his contributions and outstanding roles
in bringing about peace, national reconciliation and development
to the Cambodian nation.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia now has the most favorable conditions, both internally
and externally, according to a communique adopted by the plenum.
The government led by Prime Minister Hun Sen has achieved great
successes in the implementation of the triangular strategies, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Praising the "fruitful cooperation" between CPP and FUNCINPEC,
the plenum encouraged a further consolidation of such cooperation
between the two parties at all levels.
</P>
<P>
On the country's foreign policy, the party stressed the need to
further strengthen peace, friendship and cooperation with all
foreign political parties and countries, and to ensure the active
participation of Cambodia in international forums, particularly
its active role within ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) and its cooperation with the countries in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
CPP also expressed its support for a peaceful settlement of all
issues with neighboring countries on the basis of equality and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The plenum also discussed how to ensure national stability and
social order, maintain the sustainability of economic growth and
macro-economic stabilization, as well as establish party
committees in provinces for the upcoming commune elections and the
national elections in 2003.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Rises 2.9 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. workers' productivity
jumped sharply during the final three months of 1999, pushing its
growth for the whole year to 2.9 percent, the best performance in
seven years, the Labor Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Productivity, the amount of output for each hour of work,
surged at a five-percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the
strongest performance since the last three months of 1992.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter gain, better than many analysts predicted,
matched the upwardly revised rate of growth in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year of 1999, productivity rose 2.9 percent, the
largest increase of growth since a 4.1-percent gain in 1992. In
1998, productivity increased 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and other economists
believe good performances on productivity growth have helped to
keep inflation low.
</P>
<P>
But if productivity falters, pressures for higher wages can
result in a sharp runup in product prices.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, growth in unit labor costs, a key barometer of
underlying inflation pressures, slowed down. Those costs rose 1.8
percent last year, compared with 2.4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter, unit labor costs fell at a one-percent
rate, after declining 0.3 percent in the previous quarter. The one
percent decline was the biggest drop in unit labor costs since the
1.4-percent drop in the first quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices,
picked up just 1.9 percent last year, the best performance since
1969.

<HEADLINE> Ghana, Ethiopia Sign Airlines Code-Sharing Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Ghana and Ethiopia have signed
a code- sharing agreement to further promote and develop the air
routes between Accra and Addis Ababa, the Ghana News Agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement to be effective on March 28, the
airlines of the two countries, Ghana Airways and Ethiopian
Airlines, will will jointly operate three flights between Accra
and Addis Ababa on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
</P>
<P>
Ghana Airways said in a statement Tuesday that it will act as
the marketing carrier while the 54-year-old Ethiopian Airlines
will act as the operating carrier airline, which will require the
full involvement of Ghana Airways Cabin Crew.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian airline will also open an office in Addis Ababa
with the expectation that the agreement and subsequent pooling of
services on designated routes will further improve air services
and aviation generally on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Ghana Airways said that the code-sharing deal
was a follow-up to the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the
two airlines in last April to cover broader commercial
co-operation between them.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Condemns Israeli Attacks on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Qatar on Wednesday denounced
the latest Israeli air raids on Lebanon, saying the bombardments
have jeopardized the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after a weekly cabinet session said Israel's
attacks on Lebanon's infrastructure and economic installations are
a breach of international laws, according to reports reaching here
from Qatar's capital Doha.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari Council of Ministers voiced solidarity with the
Lebanese government and people and was sympathetic with the
families of the civilian victims, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on the Israeli government to immediately
halt such attacks and to pull out of the occupied Lebanese
territories.
</P>
<P>
Three Lebanese power stations came under heavy Israeli
bombardments early Tuesday, which Israel said were a retaliation
for the killing of several Israeli soldiers by the Lebanese
guerrilla group, Hezbollah, in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli air raids have reportedly led to over 30 civilian
injuries and extensive material loss.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldiers Appeal for Immediate Withdrawal From Lebanon: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Some Israeli soldiers
stationed in South Lebanon Wednesday used Israeli media to appeal
for an immediate withdrawal from the Israeli-occupied buffer zone
there.
</P>
<P>
Speaking out through Israel Radio, these soldiers voiced their
weariness toward the war of attrition against Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas in the zone, saying that it is best to get out of
Lebanon as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
One soldier said the point is that Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
soldiers have no business there.
</P>
<P>
If Israel will leave anyway by July according to Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's election promise, so why they should wait five more
months to suffer a few more deaths, he asked.
</P>
<P>
Another soldier said, "We don't want to be the last soldier to
die in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
He explained the soldiers should be a fighting army defending
the country, but the situation today in South Lebanon is not so and
they just put themselves in great danger.
</P>
<P>
These soldiers all wished to remain anonymous because their
remarks had not been approved by the official IDF spokesman, and
they are forbidden by military regulations to speak in such a
direct way to the media, according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
It is unknown whether IDF will make harsh reactions to the
reports.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, IDF sharply criticized graphic coverage by
Israeli Channel Two television station of the evacuation and
treatment of IDF soldiers wounded on Sunday in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that IDF was worried that the bloody pictures
will harm its soldiers' and national morale, as television coverage
of the Vietnam War eroded American resolve in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, two Knesset (parliament) members from
the Meretz party Wednesday called on Barak to suspend Israel Air
Force's reprisal raids on Lebanese civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
Zehava Gal-On and Naomi Chazan said in a letter that Israel
should prevent escalation of tensions in South Lebanon at the
moment to stop the vicious circle of retaliation.
</P>
<P>
They also urged an immediate withdrawal from the Israeli-
occupied security zone, saying there is no difference between
February and July, which is Barak's pledged withdrawal deadline.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized Israeli policies should not be dictated simply
by emotions or pressures from certain blocs in the society, who
themselves are unclear what is best for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Dan Meridor, chairman of Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee, also expressed his support for considering unilateral
pullout from South Lebanon as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He believed that in such an intolerable situation, IDF should
made a hard choice between risking to stay and going back to the
international borders between Israel and Lebanon and defend
northern Israel from there.
</P>
<P>
Israel unilaterally set up a security zone in South Lebanon in
1985 with a self-declared purpose of protecting its northern border
areas from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanese Shiite Muslim militant group Hezbollah, or
Party of God, has been fighting against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
In the last two weeks, Hezbollah escalated its activities in the
region and killed six Israeli soldiers and a senior commander of
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
In revenge, on Monday and Tuesday night, Israeli troops struck
at suspected Hezbollah targets and power stations supplying
electricity to Beirut and other Lebanese cities, wounding at least
two dozen civilians and leading to a total damage cost at 200
million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Urges Turkish Cypriots to Change Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus issue can only be
solved if the Turkish Cypriot side alters its positions, said
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On his return from Geneva where the second round of the U.N.-
sponsored proximity talks took place, Clerides said they analysed
and concluded discussions on the four fundamental aspects of the
Cyprus issue raised during the first round last December, namely
the distribution of powers, security, property and territory.
</P>
<P>
He said the third round of talks, to start on May 23 in New
York, will be a "reinforced" one, saying the United Nations might
raise some issues to both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
side to ascertain their views.
</P>
<P>
Clerides suggested negotiations can continue for some time in
the "proximity" format and then will enter a face-to-face
procedure.
</P>
<P>
Clerides confirmed reports that there have been talks about a
fourth round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974 when Turkey invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island after a failed coup
seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying for decades to bring the two
sides to the negotiation table for reunification through a
bicommunal and bizonal settlement.
</P>
<P>
No tangible results have been achieved due to the Turkish
Cypriots' insistence that their breakaway regime, recognized only
by Turkey, be recognized first by the international community and
talks with Nicosia be on equal basis.

<HEADLINE> Aziz Reiterates Iraq's Rejection to Latest U.N. Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz on Wednesday reiterated Iraq's rejection to the latest
U.N. Security Council resolution on Iraq which calls for the return
of U.N. arms inspectors to Iraq in exchange for possible suspension
of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the remarks in a meeting with visiting Russian Roving
Ambassador Nicholai Kortozov and his accompanying delegation, said
the Iraqi News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, they discussed the latest development of the
situation concerning Iraq at the United Nations Security Council,
said INA without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Aziz emphasized Iraq's stand of not dealing with the latest U.N.
resolution 1284 on Iraq, which, he said, includes nothing that is
in the interest of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The deputy premier said Iraq has implemented all that is
required by the Security Council resolution 687 for the lifting of
the embargo.
</P>
<P>
However, he added the latest resolution has rewritten resolution
687 in an illegal way, which reflects clearly the failure of the
the Security Council to honor its commitments toward Iraq after
Iraq fulfilled all its obligations under relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted a resolution on Iraq last December,
which establishes a new arms control body, the U.N. Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission, or UNMOVIC.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also offers Iraq the chance to have the decade-
old U.N. sanctions suspended if it cooperates fully with the arms
inspectors and makes progress on key disarmament tasks to be
defined by the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, the Security Council appointed Sweden's Hans
Blix, former general-director of the International Atomic Energy
Agency, to head the new inspection regime for Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Millionaire Publisher Forbes Quits Presidential Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. multimillionaire
publisher Steve Forbes has abandoned his Republican presidential
campaign after scoring a disappointing third place in the Delaware
primary, his advisers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Forbes canceled Wednesday's campaign schedule
after finalizing his decision and informing staff.
</P>
<P>
Forbes is expected to announce his withdrawal Thursday in his
home state of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
He has spent more than 65 million dollars of his own money in
two runs for the White House. His net worth has been estimated at
about 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Forbes won the Republican primary in Delawar in 1996 with 33
percent of the vote. But this time he took only 20 percent to lag
behind John McCain, who didn't campaign at all in Delaware, and
front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
His departure clears the way for a two-way race between Texas
Governor Bush and Senator McCain of Arizona for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
Forbes' withdrawal was likely to benefit Bush because his
conservative supporters are unlikely to vote for McCain, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Former Ambassador Alan Keyes is the only other member of the
Republican Party field, but he is not considered a challenger for
the presidential nomination.

However, after meeting U.S. Ambassador to Vienna, Kathryn Hall,
Albright also felt reassured by Austrian leaders have made about
the country's future course.
</P>
<P>
Hall was recalled last week after the Freedom Party joined the
government coalition last week and will return to Vienna this
weekend but will return to Washington to report about the
development in about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting Hall, Albright said Hall
received "very positive reactions" and assurances during a meeting
with Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel that safeguards are
being instituted to ensure that democratic values remain in place.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that Austria's new program has "everything we
would want. The question is whether they are going to follow
through."
</P>
<P>
She added that the American concern is ongoing and it is not an
issue that can be dealt with on the basis of one-time statements.
</P>
<P>
Joerg Haider, leader of the Freedom Party in Austria, had made
statements that showed sympathy for the Nazis on several occasions.
He was attacked despite of his apologies.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) last week decided to cut off all the
political relations with Vienna to protest against the entry of
the Freedom Party into the new coalition government.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Accuses Austria of Breaking Contract With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
accused on Wednesday Austria of ``breaking contract'' with the
European Union (EU) by forming a government including the extreme
right.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar at the Elysee presidential palace, Chirac said that by
allowing the extreme-right Freedom Party of Joerg Haider enter the
government, Austria was ``in a way put itself in a situation of
breaking contract'' with the EU.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU, to which Austria adheres, is constructed
notably for respecting a certain number of values which are its
foundation.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also said that the condemnation of France does not make
up an interference into the internal affairs of Austria.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian House Condemns Israeli Raids on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian house of deputies
(lower house of parliament) on Wednesday strongly condemned the
latest air raids on Lebanese targets which have resulted in
civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
The house said in a statement that the Israeli bombardments were
a barbarous aggression against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The house supported and sympathized with the Lebanese
parliament, government and people in their struggle to restore
their lands occupied by the Jewish state, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The house also voiced its support for a statement issued on
Tuesday by Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah Khatib on behalf
of the government, which also strongly condemned the Israeli
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The massive air raids on Lebanese civilian targets have
poisoned`` the atmosphere for the Middle East peace talks, violated
the spirit of the peace process and further escalated the tensions
in the region, Khatib said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan stands against any attacks on civilian targets
and
economic institutions in Lebanon, and his country believes the
Israeli-Lebanese conflict can only be solved through peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Khatib reiterated the Israeli-Lebanese conflicts must be ended
in accordance with international laws and the United Nations
resolution 425, which calls for Israeli troop withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At least 38 Lebanese civilians were injured during three
successive days of Israeli air raids on civilian and suspected
Hezbollah (party of God) targets in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The bombardments were carried out in retaliation for stepped-up
guerrilla attacks on Israeli targets by the Iranian backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Six Israeli solders and a commander of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army have been killed since the start of this year by
Hezbollah, which is spearheading a resistance movement against the
Israeli occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During a brief visit to Amman on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak vowed to repulse any attacks launched by Hezbullah.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that his country will tolerate these attacks to
keep alive its fragile peace process with Syria, a major power
broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and Syria were postponed indefinitely
last month after Syria demanded a written commitment from Israel to
handing back in full the Golan Heights, which it captured from
Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official: Jerusalem, Eternal Capital of Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian chief
negotiator for interim-phase talks, reiterated here Wednesday that
Jerusalem is the eternal capital of a future Palestinian
independent state.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar sponsored by the PNA Ministry of
Information, Erekat stressed Jerusalem will be the "eternal,
unbargainable" capital of the independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the suggestion of an Israeli legislator that Israel
should let the Palestinians set up their government in Abu Dis, an
Arab suburb near Jerusalem, Erekat said it was a "political
balloon" rejected by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dis is currently under Palestinian civil control and Israeli
security control. Israel has so far refused the Palestinians'
demand that Israel transfer the area to total Palestinian control
in the next phase of withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The recent remarks by Israeli right-wing Knesset (parliament)
member Michael Eitan has also incurred attacks from his own Likud
party.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said Israel's insistence on incorporating the third and
last phase of troop withdrawal into the final-status talks and
postponing the February 13 deadline for a framework agreement has
created a crisis in the current negotiations.
</P>
<P>
According to an interim peace deal signed last September, Israel
should have carried out the third-phase troop redeployment in the
West Bank on January 20 and the two sides should conclude a
framework agreement by February 13 and a permanent peace deal by
September 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
But the talks reached an impasse last week over terms of the
third-phase Israeli pullout. Palestinians, angered by the fact that
Israel chartered the maps of the land to be handed over without
first consulting with them, called off meetings with Israel on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Erekat lashed out at the continued Israeli settlement activities
in the occupied Arab land and urged the international community to
step in to save the Middle East peace process and compel Israel to
meet its obligations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel have been undertaking marathon talks
trying to meet the February 13 time limit of a framework agreement
on the thorniest issues such as the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish
settlements, borders and refugees. But there are no results so far.
</P>
<P>
PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat on Tuesday night said the Palestinian
side would not continue these "fruitless" talks with the Israeli.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Condemns Israeli Attacks on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Wednesday
denounced the Israeli air strikes on Lebanon's infrastructure and
called for a halt to the hostile actions.
</P>
<P>
A Saudi Foreign Ministry official said the attacks are a "
flagrant aggression" on a sovereign state and go against
international principles and human values, Kuwait News Agency
reported from the Saudi capital of Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The official said the Israeli aggression against Lebanon deals a
great harm to the Middle East peace process and will further
complicate the efforts toward realizing peace.
</P>
<P>
He said his country hopes the United Nations Security Council
and the co-sponsors of the peace process, namely the United States
and Russia, to take all necessary measures to stop Israel from
carrying out similar offensive actions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes struck three power stations across Lebanon
early Tuesday in retaliation for recent attacks by the Lebanese
guerrilla group, Hezbollah, in which five Israeli soldiers were
killed. A six soldier died in a Hezbollah rocket attack Tuesday,
hours after the Israeli raids.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli air raids have reportedly led to dozens of civilian
injuries and extensive material loss.

<HEADLINE> 3 Iraqi Civilians Killed, 8 injured in U.S. Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Three Iraqi civilians were
killed and eight others injured Wednesday in U.S. and British
warplanes' attacks on some civilian and service installations in
southern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 13:55 (1055 GMT) 16 formations of U.S
and British warplanes coming from Kuwaiti and Saudi airspace made
50 armed sorties over southern Iraq's Basra, Thi-Qar, Qadissiyah,
Muthana, Misan, Najaf and Wasit provinces.
</P>
<P>
The enemy planes attacked civilian and service facilities in the
region, causing the above-mentioned civilian casualties and
property damages, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired at the invading planes
and forced them to flee back to their bases in Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said eight formations of U.S. and British
warplanes coming from the Turkish airspace also made 16 armed
sorties Wednesday morning over northern Iraq's Dohuk, Neineva and
Erbil provinces.
</P>
<P>
These U.S. and British jets bombarded some civilian and service
facilities in the region. There is no immediate report on civilian
casualties in these attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-night air strikes
against Iraq in December 1998, their warplanes have made 18,531
sorties over the two no-fly zones in Iraq and have targeted
regularly its civilian and military targets, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south against possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize these restricted zones, arguing they
were unilaterally imposed by the U.S. and Britain without explicit
authorization from the U.N. Security Council.

<HEADLINE> WFP Recommends Steps to Ensure U.N. Staff Safety in Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The international
community must take concrete steps to ensure the safety of aid
workers and put a stop to the increase in the number of killings,
assaults and kidnappings of civilian staff in the conflict zones,
the World Food Program (WFP) stressed here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the open debate of the United Nations Security
Council on the protection of United Nations personnel, associated
personnel and humanitarian personnel in conflict zones, WFP
Executive Director Catheraine Bertini said the mechanical business
of delivering aid in war zones is especially hazardous.
</P>
<P>
"If humanitarian agencies are to carry out our primary task of
assisting civilians, humanitarian workers have to be given better
tools to ensure their protection," she said.
</P>
<P>
She recommended to the Security Council:
</P>
<P>
-- The humanitarian principles of impartiality must be
maintained in all crises, and they should be taken into account
even when the Security Council takes its decisions on conflict
situations;
</P>
<P>
-- The Security Council should examine its authorization of
peacekeepers in crisis situation and the council explicitly
include and define how future peacekeeping operations will protect
humanitarian workers as well;
</P>
<P>
-- The international community must be mobilized to punish
those responsible for crimes against workers;
</P>
<P>
-- Security training must be conducted for all U.N. staff
members who work in insecure environments. Each agency should
review its facilities and equipment to ensure it is providing the
best support possible to staff;
</P>
<P>
-- The Office of the U.N. Security Coordinator' role of
coordinator and clearing house for security information must be
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations, there have been 184 civilian
deaths between January 1, 1992 and January 1, 2000, of which 41
were internationally-recruited staff and 143 were locally-
recruited staff.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Better U.N. Personnel Security in Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Faced with a dramatic
increase in the number of killing, assaults and kidnappings of U.N.
personnel in the conflict, the United Nations Wednesday urged the
international community to takes effective steps to stop this
trend.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the open debate of the United Nations Security
Council on the protection of United Nations personnel, associated
personnel and humanitarian personnel in conflict zones, U.N.
Deputy Secretary-General Frechette Louise said, "We cannot just
wring our hands and go on with our business. Nor do we have the
option of simply walking away from dangerous situations."
</P>
<P>
"Often the U.N. has to stay because it represents the last ray
of hope for suffering populations. If we leave, there may be no
one else to take our place. We cannot let threats intimidate us;
we cannot let violence drive us out; we have too great a
responsibility towards the people we promised to help," she said.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard the safety of the U.N. and associated personnel,
the capacity of the Office of the U.N. Security Coordinator must
be strengthened to perform its responsibilities as overall
security manager of the U.N. system, said the deputy secretary-
general.
</P>
<P>
The field missions must be adequately staffed with security
professionals and adequately provided with essential equipment
such as radios, satellite telephones, flak jackets, she said.
</P>
<P>
Much greater emphasis must be placed on security training, she
added.
</P>
<P>
The deputy secretary-general also urged support from the member
states to ensure the safety of U.N. and associated personnel in
conflict zones.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations, there have been 184 civilian
deaths between January 1, 1992 and January 1, 2000, of which 41
were internationally-recruited and 143 were locally recruited
staff.

<HEADLINE> G-77 to Hold First South Summit in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 77 (G-77)
is scheduled to convene the first South Summit in Havana, Cuba, on
February 10-14 in what will be the South's largest gathering of
heads of state or government from 133 developing members of the
group.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Arthur Mbanefo, chairman of the G-77 and
the Nigerian permanent representative to the United Nations, at a
press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda will be globalization, knowledge and
technology, the South-South cooperation and the North-South
relations, said the chairman.
</P>
<P>
"Developing countries face today the challenge of formulating
a common vision and constructing a platform for collective action
in order to achieve a comprehensive formulation and forceful
articulation of their shared concerns and objectives," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Havana Summit is a unique opportunity to renew the South'
s commitment to South-South cooperation and define an action plan
with clear targets and a time frame for its effective
implementation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The agenda will thus reflect the enormous global challenges
facing developing countries and in particular, allow for high-
level discussions in order to find consensus on global development,
" he said. "There will also be a special emphasis on developing
specific follow-up machinery to carry forward the outcomes of the
Summit."
</P>
<P>
From the South Summit will emerge two final documents, the
first, a forward-looking declaration will set out a vision and
broad strategy for the future while the second action-oriented
document will clearly define measures, targets and time frames for
implementation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that as a logical consequence of the discussions,
appropriate follow-up machinery will be agreed upon to implement
the objectives in Havana," he said. "In this way, it is also hoped
that the Summit can effectively allow for a full consideration of
the legitimate interests and concerns of all Member States of the
Group of 77."
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the South Summit was made by the G-77
ministers at a meeting in New York in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
The G-77 was set up in June 1964 by 77 developing countries in
Geneva. As the largest Third World coalition in the United Nations,
the G-77 provides the means for the developing world to articulate
and promote its collective economic interests and enhance its
joint negotiating capacity on all major international economic
issues in the United Nations system.

<HEADLINE> Chechen War to Move Into South Mountains: Sergeyev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia's military operation in
Chechnya is entering its final stage and moving into the south
mountains in coming days, said Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The final stage of the anti-terrorist operation will be held
in Chechnya's mountains, where the remaining rebels have gathered
after the liberation of the Chechen capital of Grozny," Sergeyev
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Russian army has won a number of strategically important
positions in southern Chechnya, he said, estimating the strength
of the rebel fighters as from 5,000 to 7,000 men.
</P>
<P>
"Our forces are in firm control of the entries to the Argun and
Vedeno gorges, and federal troops have blockaded over 3,000
Chechen rebels in the Argun gorge," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military said the militants are using mountain
paths to bypass the federal forces, which are forcing Russian
troops to repeat mopping-up operations in villages already
liberated.
</P>
<P>
Numerous units will be moved from around Grozny to the southern
Chechnya to fight separatists in coming two or three days,
Sergeyev said, and front-line aircraft will play a significant
role in destroying gangsters in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
"The troops in a high morale will beef up their presence in the
mountainous direction. This is the Argun and Vedeno gorges at
first," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we will focus our efforts to minimize our losses and,
at the same time, to end the operation in the shortest period of
time possible," the minister stated.

<HEADLINE> South Summit to Ponder Over Concerns of Developing World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Group of 77 (G-77)
countries are expected to discuss the broad themes of
globalization, knowledge and technology, the South-South
cooperation and the North-South relations at the South Summit,
slated for February 10-14 in Havana, Cuba, the G-77 chairman,
Arthur Mbanefo, announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mbanefo, who is also the Nigerian permanent representative to
the United Nations, told a press conference that the upcoming
summit will be the South's largest gathering of heads of state and
government from 133 developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"The agenda will thus reflect the enormous global challenges
facing developing countries and in particular, allow for high-
level discussions in order to find a consensus on global
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of globalization, he said, "The growing trend of
globalization and liberalization has proved challenging for most
developing countries, many of whom have found themselves
marginalized from the mainstream of the world economy."
</P>
<P>
"The Summit will thus serve to highlight the inadequacies of
existing international mechanisms to effectively manage the
processes of globalization and financial liberalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of knowledge and technology, he said that this "
is of crucial importance to development."
</P>
<P>
"The challenge is therefore to exploit this untapped potential,
through focused South-South cooperation," he said. "Specific
initiatives can be identified and pursued at the Summit to allow
countries to anticipate the impact of technological change on
their societies and make the necessary adaptations in order to
participate in and benefit from the technological revolution."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the South-South cooperation, the chairman said,
"The South Summit provides a historic opportunity to reaffirm the
long-standing commitment of developing countries to South-South
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"Innovative strategic objectives will be defined in Havana for
increased investment and trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, a high-level experts meeting will be held in
New York in March to elaborate concrete initiatives to be adopted
by heads of state in Havana.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the North-South relations, the chairman said
that it is expected that the Havana Summit will establish the
basis for a renewal of the North-South Dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"Developed countries have an interest to fully participate and
engage in substantive negotiations with the South in order to deal
with major global economic and social issues," he said. "The
exchange of views which now takes place between the Group of 77
and the G-7 on key international economic issues will be
institutionalized and expanded after the Havana Summit."
</P>
<P>
The G-77 foreign ministers, at the end of their meeting in
September 1999 in New York, announced that the group is to hold
the South Summit in February 2000 in Havana. They said, "The new
millennium presents a formidable challenge for the countries of
the South to shape their own destinies, in a balanced and just
partnership with the rest of the international community."
</P>
<P>
The G-77, set up on June 15, 1964 by 77 developing countries
in Geneva, is the largest Third World coalition in the United
Nations. The group provides the means for the developing world to
articulate and promote its collective economic interests and
enhance its joint negotiating capacity on all major international
economic issues in the United Nations system.

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Expects China's Accession Within 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- World Trade Organization (WTO)
Director-General Mike Moore Wednesday expressed the hope that
China will become a full member within the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with a group of reporters in his office here before his
visit to China next week, Moore said that it would be an "enormous
disappointment" if China were not admitted to the WTO by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Moore said that he would do his best to persuade WTO members
and their congressmen that China's accession is in their long-term
interests.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the WTO is not a complete international
organization without China. He added that bringing China into the
multilateral rules-based system would be "good for the United
States, and good for all of us. It would certainly be good for
this institution."
</P>
<P>
Moore is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on February 17 and
leave on February 19, according to the WTO. During his stay, he
will have talks with Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
Moore will be in Bangkok next week for a conference of the
United Nations Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and visiting
Indonesia and Singapore before going on to China. He said he would
also be visiting the United States in April and would be
discussing the China issue then.
</P>
<P>
Talking about other priorities during his leadership of the WTO,
Moore said that he would make sure that WTO members are able to
hold talks in a more constructive way, that the poorest countries
get market access and that the new round of multilateral trade
talks is launched this year. He said that he would meet with
ministerial officials on the launch of the new round during his
stay in Bangkok.

<HEADLINE> China Speaks on Social Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- There is no uniform
model to follow in terms of pushing forward social development and
every country should work out and implement social development
measures best suited to its own national conditions, China
stressed here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 38th session of the United Nations Commission
on Social Development, Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to
the United Nations Shen Guofang said the targets set at the
Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development in 1995 are still
far off and the global social development scene does not offer
much for optimism, and in some countries and regions, the
situation even shows signs of going downhill.
</P>
<P>
Poverty eradication should continue to be put on the front
burner of the work of social development, Shen said. "It is an
important yardstick of human progress, a goal long pursued by
people around the world and one of the three themes of the Social
Summit."
</P>
<P>
Economic globalization had further widened the gap between the
rich countries and the poorer ones and cornered the developing
countries to an even more disadvantageous position, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
To get a full and correct evaluation of the impact of
globalization on social development and to pull developing
countries out of that disadvantage in the globalization process
was an important issue that called for serious consideration, the
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of developed countries were offering increasingly
less official development aid and this had an ominous impact on
the economic and social development of many developing countries,
he noted.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chevron Expects High Profits From Angolan Oil Wells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUANDA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. oil company Chevron has
announced that its two offshore deep-water oil wells in northwest
Angola are expected to have high productions in the near future,
Angola's monopolist oil enterprise Sonangol said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A successful completion of the exploration tests in the two
wells, Benguela and Belize, located in the Block 14, by the
Sonangol and Chevron, resulted in an average output of 8,400 and
11,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
According to a document issued here this week, the quality of
the crude in terms of density in the Benguela oilfield ranges
between 24-34 degrees " API" and 36 degrees at the Belize Well.
</P>
<P>
"Benguela" and "Belize", respectively discovered in June and
October, 1998, are located 11 miles south of the on-stream Kuito
oilfield, whose production is near 50,000 barrels per day, with
predictions to reach 100, 000 at the end of the first quarter this
year.
</P>
<P>
Chevron owns 31 percent shares in the Block 14 joint venture
while Sonangol, Agip Angola and Total Fina have 20 percent each
and Petrogal nine percent.
</P>
<P>
 With the daily oil production of 780,000 barrels, Angola is
the second largest oil-producing country in the African continent.
The Angolan government divided the offshore waters into several
exploring blocks. Foreign oil companies have to bid against each
other for the authority of exploration in certain block.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Denies Involvement in DRC Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Mosiuoa
Lekota on Wednesday dismissed as "irresponsible allegations" that
South Africa was involved in the military conflict in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
According to local newspaper report, South Africa's opposition
United Democratic Movement Tuesday accused the government of
destabilizing the situation in the DRC by supplying the warring
parties artillery made in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during debate in the National Assembly on President
Thabo Mbeki' s opening-of-Parliament address, Lekota said South
Africa had stopped supplying any weaponry to any of the
belligerents in the DRC since the armed conflict broke out there.
On the contrary, South Africa was in fact the main sponsor and
supporter of the peace process in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
But it was possible that some South African weapons supplied
earlier were still in use, Lekota said.
</P>
<P>
Lekota said the efforts of South African Foreign Affairs
Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and others were aimed at ensuring
that a democratic election was ultimately held in the DRC in which
the people chose who should govern them.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Ratifies OAU's Anti-Terrorism, Child Protection Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saleh Omar, charge d'Affairs of the Eritrean embassy, presented
OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim the instruments of
ratification for the OAU Convention on the Prevention and
Combating of Terrorism, and of accession to the African Charter on
the Rights and Welfare of the Child.
</P>
<P>
In presenting ceremony, Saleh reiterated Eritrea's commitment
to be on the forefront of the struggle to combat terrorism in all
its forms.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea is the first OAU member state to ratify the OAU
Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism, he said.
</P>
<P>
Saleh also emphasized the importance of the African Charter on
the Rights and Welfare of the Child in the protection of the
rights of the Africa child.
</P>
<P>
In receiving the two instruments, Salim welcomed Eritrea's
decision to ratify and accede to these important instruments.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the terrorism was an issue of concern not only to
the African continent but to the entire world.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of anti-terrorism convention was a manifestation
of collective effort to fight a scourge which knows neither
boundaries, nor color or race, Salim said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of
the Child, Salim said although it took almost 10 years to enter
into force, Africa has now a viable and more relevant legal
instrument for the development and protection of the African
child.
</P>
<P>
This will ameliorate the fate and suffering of the African
child as the most affected by conflicts, diseases and in
particular by the AIDS pandemic, he said.
</P>
<P>
The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child was
adopted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in July 1990 to supplement the
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Continue Seeking Aid From IMF: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
continue to search for resumption of aid from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and other donor organizations, said Finance
Minister Herbert Murerwa here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while speaking at the signing ceremony
between Zimbabwe and Japan for the supply of language laboratory
and audio-visual equipment to the University of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Zimbabwe remains committed to the
successful implementation of economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"All measures will be taken on the fiscal and monetary front in
order that we restore macro-economic stability in the shortest
possible period," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF agreed to provide an aid package of 193 million U.S.
dollars to Zimbabwe last August. However, only 34 million U.S.
dollars of the amount has been disbursed so far while the rest,
along with over 400 million U.S. dollars of aid from other donors,
has been suspended over the government's failure to meet agreed
economic targets.
</P>
<P>
The IMF had demanded the Zimbabwean government to devalue the
Zimbabwean dollar, allow a special audit of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo war costs and bring down its budget deficit
to 2.8 percent of Gross Domestic Product this year.

LUANDA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Angola will soon create
specialized agricultural enterprises in the war-torn central
province of Malange, with an aim to make full use of the great
agricultural potentialities in the region, a senior official has
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Angolan Minister of Agriculture and Rural

HARARE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
 Community (SADC) trade protocol came into effect late last month,
 Zimbabwean Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was to have been implemented on January 1, but had
been stalled by wrangling among member states.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said there are still some areas like
taxation which have not been agreed upon by the SADC members, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the SADC trade ministers will continue to hold meetings
until next month to ensure that the outstanding issues which
include the rules of origin are solved.
</P>
<P>
According to Zimbabwe News Agency, an official at the SADC
headquarters in Botswana also confirmed that the protocol came
into force on January 25 after being ratified by nine members of
the 14 SADC member states.
</P>
<P>
The protocol has been ratified by Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
"The trade negotiations on issues like tariff reduction
schedules will continue while the protocol is in force," the
official said.
</P>

The implementation of the protocol reached a stalemate
following disagreements on the rules of origin, with smaller
states pressing to continue using raw materials from outside the
region.
</P>

A meeting for SADC trade ministers is scheduled for February 20

<P>
MAPUTO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Buzi river in the central
Mozambican province of Sofala has burst its banks, cutting the
road between Buzi town and the port of Beira, Radio Mozambique
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The town of Buzi is entirely surrounded by the flood waters and
 residents interviewed by the radio said this was the worst flood
for at least 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Further upstream, in Chibabava district, the flood swamped the
St. Francis of Assisi catholic mission in Mangunde. The water on
the mission's premises reached a depth of two metres, submerging
a generator and a small flour mill.
</P>
<P>
Crops were inundated in Chibabava, but there are no reports of
loss of life.
</P>
<P>
Flooding is also under way on the Save river, which marks the
boundary between southern and central Mozambique. Radio Mozambique
reported that the flood waters completely surrounded the Sofala
town of Machanga, near the mouth of the river.
</P>
<P>
The good news from Sofala is that the break in the main
north-south highway in Chibabava district has been repaired.
Traffic on this stretch of the road was interrupted for five days
when the Muari and Ripembe rivers, which normally pose no threat
at all, burst their banks.

JOHANNESBURG, February 9 (XInhua) -- Heavy rains in the
Mpumalanga and Northern provinces of South Africa since Sunday
have left at least 27 people dead, scores missing and hundreds of
thousands homeless, South African Press Association reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Mpumalanga, at least 100,000 people have been made homeless

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Wiranto Again Refuses to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Former Indonesian military
chief General Wiranto again indicated on Wednesday that he would
not resign from his current position of coordinating minister for
political and security affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said he would wait for the return of President Abdurrahman
Wahid at the weekend to personally discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Wahid had asked him to quit as he was involved in human rights
abuses in East Timor last year.
</P>
<P>
"I am waiting for the president to return and I will report
everything to him, not only my responsibility as... minister...
but also... my position over the legal process I face, especially
on human rights violations in East Timor," Wiranto said before the
start of a regular cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I have already said, resign or not resign ... let us wait for
the legal process which is fair," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
On President Wahid's recent statement that former Armed Forces
chief Gen. Feisal Tanjung had once considered liquidating Wahid
and Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri, Wiranto said it is a
warning against past political practices.
</P>
<P>
"The president wants to remind us about political practices of
the past," Wiranto told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that past political practices look awkward if analyzed
in the era of reform.
</P>
<P>
"That is why I concluded that (the president's) statement is a
warning that we should not repeat such practices. The issue should
not be exaggerated," he added.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid disclosed during his state visit in Brussels
last Monday that when Wiranto was the chief of the Strategic
Reserve Command (Kostrad), he had been instructed by Feisal
Tanjung to eliminate Wahid and Megawati.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung told Wiranto he had received an instruction from "
higher-up" to "finish off" Wahid and Megawati, said Wahid.
</P>
<P>
Wahid was at the time the general chairman of the Muslim socio-
religious organization, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), and Megawati the
leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P).
</P>
<P>
Tanjung has denied Wahid's accusation.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto did not respond to questions about Tanjung's reaction,
only saying that old political practices should not be repeated.

<HEADLINE> France Considers Extra Measures Against Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- France is considering extra
measures within the European Union (EU) to further isolate the new
Austrian government which has several ministers from Joerg
Haider's ultra-right Freedom Party, said a government spokesman on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
France will reprove the Austrian government and distance itself
from the latter in the European circle, said Daniel Vaillant,
spokesman of the Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin.
</P>
<P>
France and Belgium have indicated their intention of further
isolating Austria in the EU circle, while most other EU countries
want to limit their action to the three measures announced by
Portugal, which holds the EU's rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
The three measures are suspending bilateral cooperation with
the Austrian government, reducing the reception of Austrian
ambassadors to the minimum level and refusing to support Austrian
candidates applying for posts in international organizations.
</P>
<P>
"France is one of the European countries which want to go
further within the framework of the European institutions," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
At an informal meeting of EU ministers to be held in Lisbon on
Friday, the EU will receive for the first time a minister from the
new Austrian government, minister of labor and social affairs
Elisabeth Sickl from the Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
To avoid embarrassment, Portugal has canceled a plan for a tour
of the country by the participating ministers and the traditional
ceremony of taking "family photos".
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Employment Martine Aubry said she will "
ignore" her Austrian counterpart and will walk out when Sickl
makes a speech.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Minister of Labor Laurette Onklinx also said she will
not shake hands with Sickl.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 9 (Xinhua)-- The European Union (EU)
Wednesday unveiled a five- year work plan, citing new forms of
European governance, a stronger voice in the world, a new economic
and social agenda and improved quality of life as its four
strategic objectives.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling the plan at a press conference, European Commission
President Romano Prodi said: "The challenges ahead of us are tough.
Yet we Europeans, acting together, with our strong identity and
the close ties which unite us, can face up to the road ahead. We
can enter the new century with optimism and confidence."
</P>
<P>
The document, which has been submitted to the EU parliament for
debate and to the EU member governments and other EU institutions
for assessment, said that a solid platform is ready for the
building of a politically integrated Europe, which will act
decisively on the world stage while respecting the diverse
identities of EU member states.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the document said, the EU must adapt its
institutions to the enlargement process, improve cooperation among
governments, and make a distinctive European contribution to the
reforming of world order.
</P>
<P>
The document said EU member countries must work out an
effective foreign policy in order to have a stronger European
voice in the world.
</P>
<P>
Europe must also take the enlargement process as a top priority,
play a leading role in building a new global economy, and secure
peace, democracy and respect for human rights across the continent,
said the document.
</P>
<P>
On creating a new economic and social agenda, the document
said the EU must take advantage of the current economic upturn and
generate sustainable growth over a long period.
</P>
<P>
It said Europe "must pursue a systematic policy of
modernization that delivers structural reforms, accelerates
absorption of new technology, improves European research, promotes
reform of social welfare, health and pensions, and creates an e-
literate workforce whose ideas find faster expression in the
marketplace."
</P>
<P>
The document also emphasizes the necessity of coordinating,
improving and accelerating Europe's response to the issues that
affect people's daily lives, notably the environment, food safety,
consumer rights, justice and security, and transportation.

<HEADLINE> Spring Festival Celebration in Quake-hit Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The two strong earthquakes,
rarely-seen snow and cold air currents which hit part of southwest
China's Yunnan Province in the past month have not succeeded in
dampening the holiday spirit of hundreds of people left homeless
from the disasters.
</P>
<P>
"Though the quakes destroyed our homes, we are still having a
happy New Year," a villager surnamed Su told Xinhua today over the
phone.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale struck Yao'an,
Dayao and Nanhua counties of the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture
in Yunnan on January 15, followed by another of 6.5 magnitude
about 90 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
With donations of tents, clothing, and food including meat,
eggs, and vegetables from around the country, the quake-rendered
homeless have been able to find enjoyment in the week-long Spring
Festival season, which began on February 5.
</P>
<P>
On eve of the festival, the traditional time for family
reunions, residents in Sujia Village, one of the hardest-hit areas,
gathered with country officials for a meal donated by town and
county governments.
</P>
<P>
Electricity and TVs were installed in the tent houses just
before New Year's Day, allowing families to watch holiday TV
programs.
</P>
<P>
Traditional New Year's performances such as lion dances are
being staged in the quake-hit area, thanks to arrangements made by
the Chuxiong and Yunnan governments.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Urges Lebanon, Syria to Rein in Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy Wednesday called on Lebanese and Syrian government to rein in
Hezbollah guerrillas' activities in South Lebanon, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Briefing foreign diplomats in Israel on Lebanese issues, Levy
said it will take many years for Lebanon to repair the
infrastructure damaged by Israeli air raids in recent days, which
aimed at subduing Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Levy said, Beirut government should not allow the Iranian
and Syrian-backed Hezbollah to determine its fate.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "the soil of Lebanon will burn" if Hezbollah
fires Katyusha rockets at northern Israel to retaliate Israeli
bombings.
</P>
<P>
Levy also urged Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, to
prove its peaceful intention to Israel by restraining Hezbollah
from attacking, as it has been proved that Damascus has the
capability to do so.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak convened
the inner-circle security cabinet for more than three hours at the
Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
No details were disclosed about the closed-door meeting, but it
is widely believed that it was held to decide how to proceed with
Israel's bombing campaign in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted a senior diplomatic source as saying after
the meeting that Israel's main message is that it would not
tolerate Hezbollah's violations of the Grapes of Wrath
understanding, which was agreed between the two sides after
Israel's massive military offensive in Lebanon in April 1996, which
killed 200 civilians.
</P>
<P>
The United States-brokered agreement forbids attacks on
civilians or from civilian areas on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said that during the meeting, one minister raised
the possibility that Israel may not withdraw from Lebanon by July,
the first suggestion of its kind against Barak's campaign pledge to
withdraw Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from the security zone in a
year.
</P>
<P>
The buffer zone was unilaterally set up by Israel in 1985 with a
self-declared excuse of protecting its northern border areas from
cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanese Shiite Muslim militant group Hezbollah, or
Party of God, has been fighting against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
In the last two weeks, Hezbollah escalated its activities in the
region and killed six Israeli soldiers and a senior commander of
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
In revenge, on Monday and Tuesday night, Israeli troops struck
at suspected Hezbollah targets and power stations supplying
electricity to Beirut and other Lebanese cities, wounding at least
two dozen civilians and leading to a total damage cost at 200
million U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Two-time winners Congo are now
one of the eight teams who have failed to enter the qualifiers for
the 2002 African Nations Cup finals, the Confederation of African
Football said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese, who played in this year's Nations Cup finals, co-
hosted by Ghana and Nigeria, have not yet submitted an entry, CAF
general-secretary Mustapha Fahmy said.
</P>
<P>
Another finalist, Togo, have also not submitted their entry
despite playing in the last two finals of the African championship.
</P>
<P>
The other six are Kenya, the Cape Verde Islands, Sao Tome e
Principe, Seychelles, Somalia and Liberia, the country of former
World Footballer of the Year George Weah.
</P>
<P>
The draw for the qualifying competition is traditionally
arranged according to geographical proximity to avoid high
travelling costs.
</P>
<P>
The entry deadline for the qualifying competition for the 2002
finals, which are to be hosted by Mali, was in December. But CAF
said that they would be given a last-gasp chance to participate as
CAF have always had a lenient approach to late entries.
</P>
<P>
The winner of Sunday's Nations Cup final in Lagos qualifies
automatically for the 2002 finals, along with hosts Mali.
</P>
<P>
The 44 entries already received is a record for the competition.
There were 42 entries for the qualifiers for the 2000 finals.

preliminaries for the 2002 World Cup finals in Japan and South

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- To their pleasant surprise,
Chinese in most parts of the country have so far enjoyed a dry
Spring Festival, contrary to foreboding predictions of rain and
snow for the traditional lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected good weather has given a push to the already
booming seasonal tourism across the country.
</P>
<P>
All sightseeing boats on the Three Gorges, which is on the
middle reaches of the Yangtze River, have remained fully booked
since February 5, the first day of week-long Spring Festival
holiday. Luxury cruise ships this year are taking both foreign as
well as domestic passengers, who for many years could not afford
the expensive fares.
</P>
<P>
"The best thing about this year's holiday season is that it's
not raining. And although we can't see blue skies, the mist and
clouds still please people," said Chen Fajun, deputy manager of a
travel agency in Chongqing Municipality, southwest China.
</P>
<P>
In the nearby Emei Mountain area of Sichuan Province, the
weather cleared up after 10 straight days of snow just before the
festival. Visitors flocked well-known tourist attraction to enjoy
a white New Year. On the first day of the holiday, some 60,000
people visited the snow-topped mountain.
</P>
<P>
The city of Chengde in Hebei Province, the location of the well-
known Imperial Summer Resort Villa, launched a new tourism
business -- snow sports -- in this year's Spring Festival season,
which have successfully attracted a number of wealthy, sports-
minded young people from neighboring Beijing, the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, the blue sky, cleaner air and warmer temperatures
have inspired residents to venture out to fairs and scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing, one of the national capitals in ancient China,
welcomed fine weather on the second day of the Year of Dragon
after several days of rain and sleet. The Confucius Temple, the
busiest spot in the city, which is now adorned with 200,000
colorful lanterns, has logged 250,000 visitors daily.

When considering that in 1998, Tsang said, the total two-way
trade between Hong Kong and India was valued at just 20 billion HK
dollars (2.56 billion U.S. dollars). And while it continued to
increase last year, it still accounted for less than one percent
of Hong Kong's global trade, Tsang added.
</P>
<P>
The Indian community in Hong Kong now numbers some 28,000, and
the firms they control account for between seven and ten percent
of Hong Kong's export trade, Tsang said, adding that an excellent
achievement has been reached over many years of trading and hard
work.
</P>
<P>
"In Hong Kong, we are seeing a growing number of Indian
professionals working in multinational corporations, and banking
and financial sectors, and they contribute to our success as a

of sewers and pumping mains at sewerage and pumping stations
projects.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP Growth Forecast at 6.1 Pct in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Rating Agency Malaysia
(RAM) has forecast that Malaysia's economy will grow by 6.1
percent this year, higher than the 5 percent projection by the
government.
</P>
<P>
The recent developments in the domestic and international front
support the view that the Malaysian economy will expand by 6.1
percent this year and 5.5 percent in 2001, RAM said in an article
in its Economics Chartbook on Key Trends and Outlook of the
Malaysian economy made public Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian economy staged a quick turnaround in 1999 with
growth outturn for the year likely to be around 4.6 percent, the
RAM said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said external demand is expected to remain strong
this year, depending on the ability of the United States to
engineer a soft landing while the Japanese and European economies
pick up the slack in global demand.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's export surge last year is also likely to carry over
to this year as the strong global electronics demand appeared
sustainable while its other exports gained strength due to the
stable and competitive exchange rate, it said.
</P>
<P>
The RAM was of the view that the country's external risk is
somewhat lower this year given the improving global economic
outlook, the faster than expected Asian recovery and the
likelihood of a smooth realignment of growth among the major
industrialized economies.
</P>
<P>
It said that with policy focus shifting from stabilization to
growth, several adjustments could have a bearing on the country's
ability to sustain growth in the event of an unexpected sharp
slowdown in the industrialized economies especially in the year
2001 and beyond.

<HEADLINE> U.N., Africa Seek to End Iodine Deficiency Disorders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 9 (xinhua) -- The United Nations agencies and
salt traders from across eastern and southern Africa gathered in
Mombasa, Kenya on Wednesday to find ways to end iodine deficiency
disorders(IDD).
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF)-Malawi, the three-day meeting will
address the acceleration of national IDD elimination programs in
the region in an effort to remove the greatest cause of mental
retardation in children.
</P>
<P>
Lack of iodine in the diet in the eastern and southern Africa
has rendered millions of children to a life of physical and mental
impairment, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, diet deficient in iodine exerts its
most significant effect during pregnancy and this can lead to
miscarriage, still births, prenatal and infant mortality, impaired
intellectual and physical development performance.
</P>
<P>
"The problem can be prevented relatively easily and cheaply by
using the commonest of food salt and very tinny amounts of
iodine," the statement read.
</P>
<P>
It is said that goitre, a swelling caused by the growth of
thyroid gland, and cretinism, which is a condition of profound
retardation, are all caused by the absence of minimal amounts of
iodized salt.
</P>
<P>
"In eastern and southern Africa, Kenya and Zimbabwe have
already achieved the goal of eliminating IDD by the end of 2000
while Burundi, Lesotho, Madagascar, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa
and Zambia are expected to reach the goal soon," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The Mombasa meeting is part of the preparations for a major
global gathering of the Eighth World Salt Symposium to be held in
the Hague, Netherlands during May 8 and 11.
</P>
<P>
The present meeting is expected to come up with a declaration
and an action plan for the achievement of sustainable salt
iodation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The organizers of the meeting include UNICEF, World Health
Organization, the Kenya Salt Manufacturers Association, the
International Council for Control of iodine Deficiency Disorders,
the government of the Netherlands, Kiwanis International and the
Program Against Micronutrient Malnutrition.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A team of U.N. experts will
visit Zambia later this year to study the problems of land mines.
</P>
<P>
The team of experts would identify and study the land
mine-infested areas in the country and come up with a solution to
the problem, said Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Valentine Kayope
here on Wednesday at a meeting for Members of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the function, Foreign Affairs Minister Keli
Walubita said more than 2500 kilometers of land starting from
Mwinilunga through Western province to Southern province was
infested with land mines.
</P>
<P>
The area had been used for freedom fighters' camps during
independence struggles and the land mines had been planted at
random, making it difficult to identify and destroy them, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to Walubita, a lot of productive land in the country
had been abandoned due to the problem of land mines.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia, as a signatory to the Ottawa Convention Against
Land Mines signed in December 1997, has been committed to ridding
the country of land mines.
</P>
<P>
The government has already come up with a National Strategic
Plan, which would use the local people and machinery to demine the
infested areas, he said.

"A program of launch in most complex conditions was practiced
in full. Simultaneously, tasks for control of warning systems
action were carried out, confirming the RSMF's high combat
preparedness."
</P>
<P>
The launch was also aimed to collect data on the tactical and
technical characteristics and work of all ICBM systems in flight
and on the degree of precision with which Topol-M copes with the
programs set to it.
</P>
<P>
All pre-launch operations, the missile's start and launch, the
RSMF spokesman said, went strictly on schedule. The mock-up target
set at the Kura testing ground was hit with pre-designated
precision, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Russia announced the development of a new missile in late 1993,
which emerged as an effort by several companies and design bureaus.
</P>
<P>
The head designer is the Moscow Institute of Heat Engineering.
The weight, overall dimensions and design features of the new
Topol-M missile -- an upgraded version of RS-12M missile -- are
within the rigid limits set by the START-1 (Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty-1).
</P>
<P>
Russia first test-fired a Topol-M missile from a silo in
December 1994. These missiles are expected to have stationary and
mobile versions. The silos, eliminated under the START-2, may be
upgraded for Topol-M missiles, but they will be suitable for
firing "heavy" ballistic missiles, said the spokesman.

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The small state of Delaware sent three large messages
Tuesday to the Republican Party. Voters in its primary gave George
W. Bush a much needed victory, confirmed the contagious enthusiasm
for absentee Arizona Senator John McCain and signaled publisher
Steve Forbes that the end may be near for his second self-financed
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
-- The efficiency of the U.S. economy took a further leap
upward in the second half of last year as worker productivity rose

Labor Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Hackers mounted what appeared to be coordinated attacks on
the United States' largest electronic commerce sites Tuesday. The

of the world's most popular Web sites, and continued Tuesday,
temporarily crippling at least four other major sites, including
Amazon.com, eBay.com, Buy.com and CNN.com.
</P>
<P>
-- The conflict in Lebanon continued to heat up Tuesday as
Shiite Muslim guerrillas killed another Israeli soldier, the sixth
in two weeks, and Israeli warplanes retaliated for the second time
in less than 24 hours after their first bombardment shut down
civilian life in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The resignation of the International Monetary Fund's
managing director has provoked a prolonged, bitter squabble that
mixes European national rivalries with serious debate about the
role of an increasing important institution, closer than any other
to being a global central bank.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. banking regulators imposed a strict system of audits
and compliance on Bank of New York Co. after finding deficiencies
in connection with an allegedly illegal money-transfer scheme that
moved about 7 billion U.S. dollars from Russia through a bank
branch in New York.

HONG KONG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong announced today that it has already taken remedial measures
to prevent future happening of incidents similar to power
disruptions.
</P>
<P>
A power trip on Hong Kong Island affected the electricity
supply to SEHK's computer room in Exchange Square at 15:05 Tuesday
afternoon, causing a 5-minute black-out at two of its terminals.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of SEHK Alec Tsui told a media briefing today
that remedial measures were taken by the exchange after yesterday'
s incident to review and strengthen the operation procedures and
computer operation system to prevent future happening of similar
incidents.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the situation of the disruption, Tsui said that the
exchange's uninterrupted power supply (UPS) system was
automatically triggered to substitute the city power after its
failure, and AMS was able to continue its normal operation with
the UPS cut-in, which also activated its alarm bell to signal a
power interruption.

<P>
While deactivating the alarm bell, it was reported that the
Emergency Stop function of the UPS system was accidentally
triggered. This cut off power supply to the AMS host computer, all
traders PCs in the trading hall, and the off-floor trading
terminal telecommunication facility, according to Tsui.
</P>
<P>
The Tandem host computer was at that time in operation mode and
internal battery power of Tandem was used, and the exchange
received reports from members that the second and third terminals
had blacked out, he said.
</P>
<P>
The UPS was reactivated five minutes later at around 15:10, and
members of the Contingency Management Team of the exchange were
assembled. At around 15:30, over 90 percent of the first terminals
completed their AMS connection automatically.
</P>
<P>
An announcement was made at the trading hall to advise members
that the market would close at 16:00 as normal, but traders

<HEADLINE> Number of Drug Addicts Soars in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of hard drug addicts
discovered in Cyprus rose to 144 in 1999, tripling the figure of 48
for 1998, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an official from the Cyprus' Drug Information
Centre as saying that a significant number of Cypriot young people
have become dependant on two or three daily doses of hard drugs.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the Cyprus' Open Therapy Society for
Dependents treated 48 people for taking various illegal drugs in
1998. Of these, 27 persons took heroin or cocaine.
</P>
<P>
The figure rose to 144 in 1999, and 86 addicts used heroin or
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Youth Organization President Andreas Taliadoros said that
drugs "are now in our homes", citing that one small Nicosia
rehabilitation community alone housed 17 heroin addicts under the
age of 25.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the number of the addicts who went to the public and
voluntary rehabilitation centers was zero, followed by two in 1995,
he said, adding that in 1999 the number was above 100.
</P>
<P>
In the last month alone, the anti-drug squad has made several
seizures of hard drugs, including a case of four kilograms of
heroin found in carpets owned by an Iranian coming from Tehran.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Bureau of
Internal Revenue (BIR) collected 36.155 billion pesos (904 million
U.S.dollars) in January, surpassing its goal by 2.74 percent, BIR
Commissioner Dakila Fonacier said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Compared to January of 1999, which registered a collection of
30.051 billion pesos (751 million dollars), last month's
collection has a 20.31 percent increase, Fonacier said.
</P>
<P>
Barely one month in his post as commissioner, Fonacier hoped
that the upward trend in revenue collection would continue, and
the bureau would achieve its tax goal in the next months.
</P>
<P>
Fonacier said that the bureau is tasked to collect 397.8
billion pesos (9.9 billion dollars) this year
</P>
<P>
He cautioned, however, that a lot depends on the growth of the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
An early indicator of an improving economy, the commissioner
noted,is the upswing in imports, resulting in higher customs
collection in the month of January.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Launches Privatization Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe set up on Tuesday a
Privatization Agency of Zimbabwe (PAZ) to speed up the divesture
of the government from public enterprises and allow private
participation through the sale of shares.
</P>
<P>
Herald daily quoted on Wednesday Minister of State for
Enterprises and Indigenization Cephas Msipa saying at the launch
the agency had already started working with the inter-ministerial
committee on commercialization and privatization.
</P>
<P>
"The PAZ has also been holding extensive discussions with
various parastatals and their line ministries," said Msipa,
adding, "This should see the speedy implementation of the
government's privatization program."
</P>
<P>
British High Commissioner Peter Longworth said British support
for the privatization program demonstrated his country's hope that
Zimbabwe would soon be implementing a sound and credible
International Monetary Fund- supported economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's privatization exercise seeks to turn-around the
loss-making public enterprises being turning them into
commercially-viable and privately owned entities.
</P>
<P>
If successful the program would see the government concentrate
on its core activities of providing a conducive operating
environment and withdraw from playing an active role in the
market.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Firms Complain About African Investment Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Financial Times on Wednesday quoted a survey conducted by
the Japan External Trade Organization as saying that
transportation facilities are most often complained, and the
companies also showed their unhappiness with the restrictions to
remitting money outside some countries.
</P>
<P>
 Japan is one of the most important investors and donors in
the African continent. The responding companies were generally
positive about overall business prospects in Africa, said the
survey.
</P>
<P>
Most of the firms agreed to the great outlook for a future
potential market and chances of disbursements of Japanese official
development assistance (ODA) are now a priority to Japanese
companies investing in Africa, while in some southern and western
African countries, abundant resources were regarded as additional
incentives, it noted.
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Japanese companies in surveyed countries cited
poor regulatory conditions and exchange rates fluctuations as
obstacles to investment take-up, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, which was conducted in Egypt, Kenya,
Tanzania, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Nigeria, the Ivory Coast and
Ghana, trading companies viewed transportation conditions as an
impediment, while manufactures saw high interest rates in
procurement of working capital and the fast depreciation of local
currencies as major stumbling blocks.

<HEADLINE> COMESA, EU Sign Financing Agreement to Speed up Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the European Union (EU) have
signed a 8.6 million U.S. dollars financing agreement to support
COMESA's Regional Integration Program Phase two.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony held in Lusaka on Wednesday,
Erastus Mwencha, Secretary General of COMESA, said the regional
integration program which will run for four years, is aimed at
supporting and promoting regional integration in the COMESA
region.
</P>
<P>
"We, in COMESA see regional integration not as an end in itself
but as a means to achieve a larger goal. Hence, this program that
we signed today, provides COMESA with the means to assist its
member states to integrate their economies regionally and
globally," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the regional body is preparing to launch the Free Trade Area
(FTA) due to this October and to finalize arrangements to
establish the Common External Tariff (CET), with the money
provided under this agreement, COMESA will not embark on new
programs. Instead, it will use these funds to consolidate the
gains it has achieved in the past years, particularly in the areas
of trade liberalization, monetary and fiscal policy development
and private sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that when the program comes to an end after
four years, COMESA would have finalized its strategies to achieve
a fully-fledged common market and to harmonize the rules and
regulations on investment in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
He called on the member states to give priority to regional
integration as a stepping stone towards integrating into the world
trade.
</P>
<P>
The Phase one Regional Integration Project financed at a cost
of two million dollars, started in August 1996 and came to an end
in December 1999.

<HEADLINE> French Prime Minister to Visit Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin will pay a visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories
starting from February 23, Agence France-Presse quoted diplomatic
sources in Paris as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit to Israel by a top French leader since
President Jacques Chirac's unpleasant trip to the Jewish state in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Jospin will be accompanied by several government ministers and
a large delegation of French entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Although half of Israel's trade is done with European Union (EU)
countries, France's share in EU-Israeli trade remains the smallest.
</P>
<P>
The new president of the European Jewish Congress Henri
Hajdenber, who is also the president of the Representative Council
of Jewish Institutions of France, will also be a member of
Jospin's delegation.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Paris and Tel Aviv has improved after Prime
Minister Ehud Barak came into power. Barak has since visited
France twice, in last September at the invitation of the French
government and in November during the congress of the Socialist
International in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The French-Israeli relations were tense during the term of
office of former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The uneasy
relations were highlighted by a diplomatic incident which took
place in Chirac's 1996 visit. The French president threatened to
cut short his visit after disputing with Israeli security services
during a tour of Palestinian-dominated East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Jospin's visit coincides with the latest tension between Israel
and Lebanon, after Israel launched air raids against civilian
infrastructures in the Israeli-occupied "security zone" in
southern Lebanon in retaliation for the killing of Israeli
soldiers by pro-Iranian Hezbollah Shiite guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
France has deplored Israel's action and has called for an
emergency session of a monitoring group supervising a 1996
agreement on protecting civilians in Lebanon signed by Israel and
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French Senate is expected to ratify an agreement
of association between the EU and Israel which was signed in
November 1995 and aimed to establish permanent political dialogue
and facilitate economic exchanges between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
France will be the last country of the 15 EU members to ratify
the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Four Crewmen Escape From Hijacked Afghan Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A police spokesman told a news conference at the airport that
the four were the captain, the second captain, the first officer
and the flight engineer.
</P>
<P>
They are believed to be of Afghan origin.
</P>
<P>
The four escaped at about 2245 GMT late Tuesday night through a
cockpit window and raced across the tarmac to the safety of nearby
police.
</P>
<P>
After their escape, a flight attendant was apparently pushed
down the steps to the plane. Police are now questioning him.
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman said the escape of the crewmen happened
after a period of "up and down" negotiations with the hijackers
who took over the plane on Sunday morning shortly after it took
off from Kabul, the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
The escape left about 150 people, among them up to 10 hijackers,
still on the Boeing 727 of Afghanistan's nation carrier Ariana
Airlines. None of the people on board is likely to be able to fly
the jet.
</P>
<P>
"It's highly unlikely that there is anyone competent enough on
board now to fly the plane," the police spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> First Multinational Corporation Invests in Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Norway's Eikem Group has
become the first multinational corporation getting a foothold in
the land-locked Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Eikem recently invested more than 20 million U.S. dollars for
the establishment of the Eikem Carbon (China) Co. Ltd. in Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
According to Isak Lauvas, president for Eikem's far east
operations, this is so far the group's largest project in China.
The policies of the Chinese government to develop the central and
western regions have provided a good opportunity for Eikem to
invest in the region, Lauvas said.
</P>
<P>
It is Ningxia's rich power and coal resources that has
attracted the Eikem to invest in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Eikem will spend 31 million yuan (3.73 million U.S. dollars) to
purchase the Shizuishan No. 1 Carbon Factory and turn it into a
production base with an annual output of 70,000 tons of carbon
related products. The new factory is expected to begin operation
in July.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is known as an important energy and raw material
production base in northwest China. Both its per capita coal
output and power output rank first in the country.
</P>
<P>
So far 510 overseas-funded projects have been established in
Ningxia. In 1999 alone 51 such projects were approved, involving
total contractual foreign capital exceeding 100 million U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Cargoes Through Tanzanian Ports Triple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Cargoes through Tanzanian
ports to and from its landlocked neighbor Uganda have tripled
since early last year, the local Financial Times reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan cargoes handled in Tanzanian ports have increased from
51,687 tons in 1998 to 182,877 tons in 1999, senior public
relations officer at Dar es Salaam port manager's office Mapanga
Melele was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official said Uganda's cargo exports passing through
Tanzanian ports rose from 11,980 to 36,426 tons and imports from
39,707 to 146,451 tons.
</P>
<P>
Melele attributed the cargo increase through Tanzanian ports
mainly to improvements in cargo handling techniques and equipment
at the Dar es Salaam harbor, the biggest in the country.
</P>
<P>
An increase in the number of hauling wagons by the Tanzania
Railways Corporation facilitated more rapid clearing and
transportation of cargo from the harbor, he said.

LAGOS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will send 2,000 more
troops to strengthen the United Nations peacekeeping force in
Sierra Leone, a Nigerian army spokesman said here Tuesday.

The U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone, established last October,

The officer said that the Nigerian-led West Africa Peacekeeping
Force or ECOMOG, which had been deployed in Sierra Leone since

Some 5,500 Nigerian troops were currently stationed in Sierra

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches New Air Raids on Guerrilla Targets in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli jets unleashed new air
strikes Wednesday on guerrilla targets in south Lebanon in
retaliation for the killing of an Israeli soldier on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the latest raids, Israeli warplanes fired four missiles at a
suspected guerrilla hideout at Jabal al-Daher in Bekaa Valley, said
security officials on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The jets returned and fired eight more missiles in the valley,
southwest of the market town of Nabatiyeh and on nearby Wadi
al-Hojair, areas used by the guerrillas to launch attacks on the
Israeli-occupied zone, the officials said. No reports of casualties
are available now.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli soldier was killed in a Hezbollah guerrilla rocket
attack Tuesday on a military outpost in south Lebanon only three
kilometers from Israeli border. The attack came hours after the
fierce Israeli air raids across Lebanon on power stations and
Hezbollah targets from Monday night to early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Six Israeli soldiers and a top commander of the Israeli-allied
South Lebanon Army have been killed in south Lebanon by guerrillas
since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared buffer zone along Lebanon's
southern border in 1985, policing it with 1,500 soldiers and 2,500
members of an allied Lebanese militia.
</P>
<P>
Israel accuses Hezbollah, an Iranian- and Syrian-backed
guerrilla group that is leading a war of attrition to end the
Israeli occupation in south Lebanon, of violating a 1996 Israeli-
Lebanese understanding that civilian areas should not be used or
targeted in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, soon after launching the first wave of strikes,
Israel said it will no longer honor the 1996 understanding.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli raids began with attacks on power stations that
plunged many parts of Lebanon into darkness and forced authorities
to impose electricity rationing. About 38 civilians were wounded in
the raids.

<HEADLINE> Japan Aids Cambodia's Irrigation Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The government of Japan
agreed to provide about 10.6 million U.S. dollars to rehabilitate
Cambodia's farming irrigation system.
</P>
<P>
A ground breaking ceremony for the project was held Wednesday
in Kandal Province along the Mekong River, about 34 km from Phnom
Penh. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen and Japanese Ambassador to
Cambodia Masaki Saito attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The project will enable the Royal Government of Cambodia to
improve four "colmatage" canals and their intake facilities, and
to purchase canal maintenance equipment, such as bulldozers,
excavators, dump trucks and mobile pumps.
</P>
<P>
The new systems, when completed, can irrigate a further 550
hectares and increase the productivity of 2,400 hectares of
farmland, as well as to benefit many farming and fishing families,
enabling them to fish in the canals and reservoirs throughout the
year.
</P>
<P>
"Colmatage" is a traditional agricultural method in Kandal
province, which uses the flooding cycle of the Mekong River for
farming irrigation and soil enrichment. However, the efficiency of
"colmatage" canals is decreasing due to the deterioration of the
intake structures, sediment deposits and erosion of embankments.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economic Growth in 1999 Expected Better than Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's gross domestic
product (GDP) for 1999 is expected to grow higher than the 4.3
percent projection, Deputy Finance Minister Shafie Mohd Salleh
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Economic fundamentals have strengthened at a better than
expected rate and all indicators point to a higher growth in real
GDP for 1999," Shafie told a group of investors from the United
States, Europe and Asia Pacific here, according to Bernama news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government revised its projection of GDP growth
to 4.3 percent in October last year from the one percent growth
made by the treasury earlier. Some analysts forecast the country's
GDP at over five percent.
</P>
<P>
Shafie said Malaysia's economic recovery has been led by high
and sustained export demand as well as an improvement in domestic
demand.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country's external reserves at the end of last
year stood at 30.9 billion U.S. dollars, sufficient to finance six
months of retained imports.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's debt servicing ratio remains low at around six
percent of exports compared with the international average of
around 20 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The group, led by Chase Manhattan Bank, is on a fact-finding
trip to Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. And these
investors together manage 1 trillion U.S. dollars worth of funds.

KAMPALA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's First Lady Janet
Museveni has urged women in Africa, especially those in the legal

</P>

themselves," the First Lady said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Depreciates Against Other Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan shilling is losing
ground against major currencies as the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) aid to Kenya would not be resumed soon, local media reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya Tuesday quoted the U.S. dollar at
74.3 shillings, nearly one shilling off the Monday opening of
73.48 shillings, while the British pound lost nearly two shillings
in opening at 118.98 shillings from Monday's 117.07 shillings.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Tuesday by the IMF Office in Nairobi said
"all recognized that much remains to be done" and the IMF team
looked forward to returning to Kenya in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team left here on Monday after a two-week fact-finding
mission to discuss resumption of aid suspended by IMF in July 1997
for poor governance and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo was quoted as saying the
IMF and the World Bank are demanding that the Kenyan government
prepare a comprehensive Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper before
resumption of aid.
</P>
<P>
The shilling had strengthened quickly from about 75 shillings
to the dollar in December last year to 67 shillings in January
this year amid news that the resumption of aid to the country by
the IMF was possible as the IMF team arrived to resume aid talks
with the Kenyan government.
</P>
<P>
Local and international speculators panicked as the IMF talks
with the government ended without any commitment to financial
support.
</P>
<P>
The panic resulted in a free fall of the shilling, losing at
one time as much as two shillings a day, and it is now heading
back to the mark of 75 shillings to the dollar as before.

MOSCOW, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Wednesday successfully

Fregat is expected to return to the Earth on its own at 10:57 a.

<P>
JAKARTA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
predicted that the country's paddy production would reach 51.0
million tons this year or 2.26 percent higher than last year, a
senior official said on Wednesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Spring Festival Is More Than Just Visiting Relatives, Eating Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- During China's traditional
Spring Festival, people hang lanterns, paste new year couplets and
among other things, can watch dragon dances.
</P>
<P>
Many Beijingers gravitate to temple fairs in the city. Delicate
paper cuttings, acrobatics, dragon dances, lion dances, and folk
games attract crowds of people.
</P>
<P>
Folk culture experts say that improved lifestyles have made the
Chinese cherish folk customs and traditions more than ever before.
</P>
<P>
Instead of visiting their relatives, many of China's youth have
spent most of their week-long holiday in libraries and scientific
museums. One college student in Tianjin visited a library on
February 5, the first day of the Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 people visit the Tianjin Nature Museum everyday. To
some, the Museum is a lot more interesting than electronic games.
Sun Jingyun, the curator, said he has never seen so many visitors
during the Spring Festival before.
</P>
<P>
Fierce competition across the country has made more Chinese
become aware of the importance of knowledge and thirst to acquire
more knowledge and making every moment count as they further
broaden their horizons.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak sent messages to the
Syrians Tuesday evening, asking them to rein in Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas and come back to the negotiating table before it is too
late.
</P>
<P>
In a series of messages passed on to Syria via the United
States, Barak made it clear that Israel will not stand for
Hezbollah's systematically violation of the Grapes of Wrath
understandings, which monitor ceasefire in South Lebanon, and will
ignore them as long as Hezbollah does.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Another Israel Defense Forces soldier was killed in the
Israeli-declared security zone in South Lebanon Tuesday afternoon.
The casualty was the sixth in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the killing, Israel Air Force planes and
helicopters attacked three Hezbollah targets in Lebanon around 11
p.m.. Unlike the IAF bombings on Monday night, the attacks Tuesday
night did not target any infrastructure sites in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak Tuesday declared a state of emergency in northern
Israel for at least 48 hours. Barak based this decision on an
estimate that Hezbollah strikes against Israel's civilian
population could be likely.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency allows the Minister of Labor and Social
Affairs to take measures ensuring a steady supply of essential
services to residents living in the northern areas; and the prime
minister's declaration clears the way for IDF to order civilians to
remain in bomb shelters.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel will be forced to postpone the launching of its first
commercial satellite, planned for February 24, by six months,
because of a failure in its communications system and problems in
raising the needed 250 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The commercial satellite, the first of eight such satellites
which are expected to be launched using a Russian rocket, is the
civilian version of Israel's military satellite "Ofek 3".

<HEADLINE> Turkey To Adopt National Missile Defense Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Armed Forces (TSK)
appears to be interested in the U.S. two-tier anti-ballistic
missile strategy, reported Turkish Daily News on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two-tier anti-ballistic missile system consists of upper and
lower tier systems, with the upper level composed of Thaad missiles
and the Navy Theater-Wide Missile Defense System using an advanced
tracking and targeting computerized radar called Aegis.
</P>
<P>
The lower tier missiles have a shorter range and consists of the
newly developed U.S. Patriot 3 (PAC3) missiles as well as the yet-
to-be-developed Navy Area-Wide Missile Defense System. The Aegis
radar will be deployed on destroyers.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military has been pondering on what kind of missile
strategy to be adopted in case of a threat of ballistic missile
attack possibly from its southeastern neighbors, but now they seem
to have reached conclusion, the English-language newspaper quoted
an informed source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Once the two-tier anti-ballistic missile strategy is formally
adopted, its task will be set to decide on the specific anti-
ballistic missile systems that should be obtained.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper report, Turkey is seeking to participate
in the joint U.S.-Israeli Arrow anti-missile missile program, but
also open to other options. Costs and technical features are also
factors under consideration.
</P>
<P>
Under the scenario, if a ballistic missile attack is imminent,
the upper tier system can intercept the missiles high in the
atmosphere close to the launching site. If the target is not
destroyed with the upper tier system, the lower tier system will
fire, destroying the target missiles at closer range. In other
words, the two systems complement each other.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Central Bank Not to Adopt Tight Money Policy: Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's central bank (BI)
will not adopt a tight money policy in a bid to arrest further
fall of the rupiah exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, central
bank Governor Syahril Sabirin told Xinhua on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Now we just expect the best result (that rupiah would be
stable at the level 7,000 rupiah per U.S. dollar). And I hope that
the rupiah will keep strengthening as we have expected before. We
now have not yet had a plan to adopt a tight money policy,"
Sabirin said, adding that adopting such a policy would need
serious considerations from many aspects.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to comment on possible further plunge of
rupiah up to 8,000 per U.S. dollar as being predicted recently by
some observers
</P>
<P>
Observers here have predicted that the rupiah could break level
8,000 per U.S. dollar if domestic political situation is still
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
"We can't make any prediction," Sabirin said.
</P>
<P>
But the governor added that the central bank would not brush
aside the possibility of adopting a tight money policy if the
political situation still keeps uncertain.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, due to the uncertainty of political situation in
Indonesia following a showdown between President Abdurrahman Wahid
and Coordinating Minister for Politics and Security Gen. Wiranto
in connection with a report issued by the human right commission
on the Wiranto's involvement in atrocities and mayhem in East
Timor after the U.N. sponsored direct ballot there last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senior Deputy Governor of the central bank Anwar
Nasution told Xinhua on Wednesday that the government of Indonesia
will create conducive political situation so that foreign
investors will not hesitate to come and invest in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that security matters (for investors) will be
guaranteed (by the government) and business activities can be back
to normal and people can do business as usual," Nasution said.

<HEADLINE> Filipino Families Spend More on Food: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Many Filipino families spend
more of their budget on food than any other essential basic needs
like clothings, education, health care and recreation, the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) said recently in a report.
</P>
<P>
In a survey of the life style of 430 Filipino families in 1999,
the ADB noted that housewives prefer only one dish as partner for
cooked rice, and eat only two meals a day to allow their children
to eat three meals a day.
</P>
<P>
It also said that over 75 percent of the country's fishing
communities and 50 percent of the urban poor groups resort to
sleeping longer hours in the morning so that their first meal
would be equivalent to lunch.
</P>
<P>
To economize further, many families cultivate their backyards
for vegetable growing and small livestock production, while others
venture into fishing or carry out goods to the market for sale.
</P>
<P>
The ADB reported that poor Filipinos prefer second-hand
clothings or adjusted school uniform from the previous year. They
also reduce their transportation expenses by walking instead of
riding public conveyances.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, about 17 percent of 430 households
surveyed said they sold some assets during the past 18 months
after the onset of the financial crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that health care is not immediately
accessible to poorer families as the cost of medicine and private
medical care rose while the government health services
deteriorated.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Industrialists Urged to Take Anti-Pollution Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Tanzanian
official has urged the industrialists to take measures to solve
pollution problems that the country is facing.
</P>
<P>
The industrialists and those involved in economic and other
activities should take cleaner production processes as mandatory,
Peter Ngumbullu, permanent secretary in the Vice President's
Office, was quoted as saying by the Guardian newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day National Workshop for Sustainable Industrial
Development here Tuesday, Ngumbullu said that Tanzania is facing
serious environmental problems at its crucial stage to achieve
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Noting serious environmental pollution in certain localities,
especially in urban areas, he also mentioned examples of such
industrial pollution cases as petroleum refineries, breweries,
cement factories, fertilizer production, textiles, paper mills and
pesticides factories.
</P>
<P>
It was disheartening to note that only a few enterprises had
been investing in environment-related activities that took into
consideration cleaner production processes, he said.
</P>
<P>
If pollution control measures were not taken on time, a number
of large industries are known to be potential threat to the
environmental quality, he stressed.

<P>
LUSAKA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) has welcomed Zambia's declaration in
its 2000 budget that the country will publish the zero tariff
rates by the end of October, Financial Mail reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Secretary General Erastus Mwencha told the newspaper the
move showed that Zambia was highly committed to the implementation
of a Free Trade Area (FTA) within the regional trade bloc on
October 31.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha was quoted as saying that COMESA fully understands
Zambian position that it will treat the FTA on reciprocal basis.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the Zambian government take further
steps to make the Zambian producers more competitive.
</P>
<P>
"The lending rates are among the factors that make Zambian
industries not competitive," Mwencha observed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this year's budget focused on reducing the cost
of production through the reduction or removal of taxes levied on
essential inputs such as the removal of excise duty on electricity
consumed.
</P>
<P>
Studies showed that the cost of electricity is a major factor
that makes Zambia a high cost producer.

<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Some key state projects in
southwest China's Sichuan Province, such as the Xichang Satellite
Launching Center, have become new tourism attractions.
</P>
<P>
China began building key state projects in southwestern Sichuan
in the early 1960s, which have been playing important role in the
nation's economic construction.
</P>
<P>
According to today's People's Daily, nearly 100,000 tourists
from across the country and overseas visited the satellite
launching center, the Panzhihua Iron and Steel Complex, and the
Ertan Hydropower Station in the first four days of the Chinese
lunar new year alone.
</P>
<P>
In the Panzhihua steel company, a group of tourists were

furnaces.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that out of every 100 km of railways in China, 40
km were built using steels produced by the company.

<HEADLINE> Stranded Whale on Southern Chinese Island Returns To Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A whale weighing at least 15,000
kg has been returned to the sea with the help of local fishermen,
border police and villagers in the city of Qiongshan, Hainan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers succeeded on Tuesday in tugging the huge animal
back into the ocean with nets and thick ropes and two powerful
fishing vessels.
</P>
<P>
A fisherman in Beigang village, located about 40 kms from the
provincial capital of Haikou, spotted the beached whale in just 1.
5 meters of water on the morning of February 5, the first day of
the Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers built a plastic tent to shelter the whale from the
scorching sun, but failed in their initial attempts to tug the
animal back to sea with a fishing boat.
</P>
<P>
The whale is about 11 meters long (36.3 feet), 1.4 meters high.
Zoologists estimate that the rapid currents in the Qiongzhou
Strait might have affected the whale's judgment of direction.

<HEADLINE> Three Attached by Wild Boar in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Three family members were
attacked by a wild boar at Paixingyuan Village in Luotian County
in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Twelve-year old Yu Yong's left arm was bitten by a wild boar
when he was returning home with his mother on February 3, on the
eve of traditional Spring festival.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the wild boar, weighing more than 50 kg,
rushed suddenly at Yu and bit his left arm. Immediately afterward,
Yu's mother, 38, who tried hard to drive away the wild boar with a
pole, was bitten in the leg.
</P>
<P>
Hearing the shouts and screaming, Yu's 65-year old grandfather
Yu Kefa, who was then working in the fields nearby, hurried to the
scene and tried hard to drive the boar away with a hoe. The
grandfather was, too, attacked by the wild boar. All three were
rushed to a local hospital for emergent treatment.
</P>
<P>
Since forests in the area have been cleared from the late 1950s
onwards, an elder villager recalled, wild animals were rarely seen
in the area.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Economy to Rise by 10 Percent in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's economy is expected
to grow by about 10 percent this year due to the favorable
government policies and anticipated growing demand for exports,
consumption and investment, according to economists here.
</P>
<P>
Xu Kuangdi, mayor of Shanghai, has said that as China enters
the year of dragon, the city will further adjust its economic
structure to sharpen the competitive edge of the leading major
economic powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
The city will increase efforts to streamline local state-owned
enterprises, speed up the high-tech industry and promote the
development of all kinds of enterprises, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the tertiary industry for the first time
in 1999 gained a bigger share of the city's gross domestic product
than the secondary industry. And the export volume of overseas-
funded enterprises accounted for 55 percent of the city's total
last year.
</P>
<P>
Although Shanghai's economy has been growing at a double-digit
rate over the past seven years, it has to further improve its
competitiveness as China prepares to become a member of the World
Trade Organization, said Wang Lengyi, an economist with the
Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai plans to have the output value of high-tech and pillar
industries exceed 65 percent of its total industrial output value
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
To rev up technological upgrading, the city will accelerate the
construction of 25 key industrial projects each with an investment
of over 200 million yuan this year, according to Huang Qifan,
director of the Shanghai Municipal Economic Commission,
</P>
<P>
He said his commission also plans to complete 37 other
industrial projects each costing over 50 million yuan within the
year.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xiaoming, director of the Shanghai Municipal Commission of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said this year the city
will ensure a total export of 20 billion U.S. dollars with more
technology-intensive products.
</P>
<P>
Despite poor domestic demand and rising unemployment,
economists in Shanghai believe that the city's growth rate for
2000 will be realized.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen Tuesday
urged the European partners to increase their defense spending and
shoulder more responsibilities in security in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The Europeans must also bear a fair share of that
responsibility, and they have yet to do so," Cohen told the Senate
Armed Services Committee. Cohen complained that the European
countries do not bear a "fair share" of responsibility in keeping
peace in Kosovo, where 6,000 police were required but there are
only 1,900 international police. "They have not committed either
the manpower or the money that would be necessary to get an
adequate police force on the ground so that our forces won't find
themselves in the position of having to carry out such activities,
" Cohen added. (US-Europe-Defence)

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China exported 36.04 billion U.
S. dollars worth of electronic and information products in the
first 11 months of 1999, a rise of 44.6 percent year on year.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounted for 20.6 percent of the country's total
export between January and November last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Information Industry, China's
exports of electronic information products increased at an annual
average rate of 28.9 percent between 1991 and 1998. This compared
with the 13.2-percent annual growth rate of the country's total
import and export during the eight years.
</P>
<P>
Ministry statistics show that export of computers and related
products gained a hefty increase of 52.9 percent to 10.89 billion
dollars during the January-November period, while that of
telecommunications and consumer electronics grew 48 percent and 40
percent, respectively, to 4.1 billion dollars and nine billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official said that the increased export of
electronic and information products played an important role in
realizing China's economic growth target in 1999 and stimulating
domestic demand.

<HEADLINE> China to Cut Silk Reeling Processing Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration for
Textile Industry will reduce China's silk reeling processing
capacity by one million bundles this year to resolve its surplus.
</P>
<P>
All outdated silk reeling machines will be removed, and those
enterprises that have suspended production for one year or more
will be stop production.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, China's silk industry began reducing its losses and
making profits. Nevertheless, state-owned silk enterprises still
incur heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
During the 1997-98 period, 855 silk reeling enterprises
obtained production licenses from the State Administration for
Textile Industry with a production capacity of 3.3 million bundles.
But poor domestic demand forced one-third of the enterprises to
suspend production.
</P>
<P>
The Administration has called on silk enterprises to undergo
products restructuring, and accelerate their technology upgrading
so as to ensure a sound and steady development of the industry.

MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Four soldiers of the Philippine
Army based in Samar province in the central Philippines are
missing after their truck fell from a bridge early Wednesday
morning, the Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The PNA quoted military sources as saying that there were five
soldiers in the truck when it fell and the fifth soldier survived
the accident.
</P>
<P>
Probers still have to determine if the soldiers, who were on
their way back to their base, were drunk at the time of the
accident.
</P>
<P>
They also surmised that the driver of the truck had difficulty
glaring at the dark road and did not notice that they were already
heading toward the bridge's railings.
</P>
<P>
The coastguard are still pursuing search and rescue operations
and sea divers are helping to scour for the soldiers and their
firearms.
</P>
<P>
The rescuers said that they are having a little difficulty in
their operations because the undercurrent of the water is strong.
</P>
<P>
Five rifles were already recovered from the submerged truck,

<HEADLINE> Venture Capital Investments for 1999 Set Record in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Internet-related companies
in the United States attracted 66 percent of all venture capital
investments in 1999, according to figures released Tuesday by the
National Venture Capital Association (NVCA).
</P>
<P>
Venture capital investments last year reached a record 48.3
billion U.S. dollars in the United States, up 151.6 percent over
1998. Internet-related firms were the biggest winners, receiving
31.9 billion dollars, an increase of 355 percent over 1998, when
they received just 7 billion dollars or 36.6 percent of all
venture capital investments.
</P>
<P>
Internet-related companies are those that provide content, e-
commerce, hardware or services to the Internet economy. They are
found in all industry sectors.
</P>
<P>
E-commerce and Web content companies attracted the most dollars
in the Internet-related sector, showing a 458-percentage increase.
These companies are demanding large investments because they are
working to quickly create name recognition and a leadership
position in their respective areas, the NVCA said. They receive
the biggest piece of the pie because these companies have
tremendous potential and the Internet is becoming an integral part
of the U.S. economy in both the business-to- business and business-
to-consumer markets.
</P>
<P>
Northern California, where Silicon Valley is located, continued
to attract the most dollars, receiving almost 17 billion dollars,
more than one-third of all the money.
</P>
<P>
Although Internet-related investments led the way, every
industry sector experienced growth in venture capital financing in
1999. More than 3,600 companies received venture capital financing
in 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Hackers pulled off a series
of attacks on major Web sites Tuesday, leading to shutdowns at CNN.
com, Buy.com Inc. and eBay Inc. after a similar assault hit Yahoo!
Inc. the day before.
</P>
<P>
In the early evening Tuesday, CNN.com confirmed that it was the
latest site to suffer.
</P>
<P>
"At 7 p.m. EST, we were attacked by hackers. A denial of
service attack occurred until 8:45 p.m. We were seriously affected.
We were serving content but it was very inconsistent and very
little," Edna Johnson, director of public relations for CNN
Interactive, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"By 8:45 p.m., our upstream providers had put blocks in place
that are shielding us and we are now serving content."
</P>
<P>
The leading auction Web site eBay and the Internet-based
discount retailer Buy.com were crippled earlier Tuesday by
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
And online retailing giant Amazon.com Inc. also came under
siege late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Amazon.com Inc. was virtually shut down Tuesday with problems
that appeared similar to the failures that have hit other popular
Web sites in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The rapid succession of disruptions on a massive scale suggests
that the same group was behind all of the attacks, said chief
technology officer Elias Levy, of Securityfocus.com, computer
security information service.
</P>
<P>
Internet security experts predicted on Tuesday that other
commercial web sites will be hit by denial of service attacks in
the future, even before they knew about the Buy.com incident.
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been a global solution yet to this problem," said
Chris Rouland, director of the security research team at Internet
Security Systems in Atlanta, Georgia, a major security software
and consulting company. "If hackers can shut down Yahoo!, they can
shut down anything they want tomorrow."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- World number one Andre
Agassi pulled out off the 375,000 U.S. dollar Sybase Open because
of a lower back strain in San Jose, California on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Agassi said that while he was flying from London to San
Francisco on Monday, he began to severely cramp and experienced
back spasms after encountering altitude sickness and dehydration
during Davis Cup in Zimbabwe last weekend.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday during his Davis Cup win over Byron Black, Agassi
threw up. He also threw up again on his way to locker room.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, when he attempted to practice, Agassi could barely
move and cut the session short. He then underwent an examination
that confirmed the back injury.
</P>
<P>
Agassi will have a magnetic resonance imaging test on Wednesday
to determine the severity of the injury.
</P>
<P>
Agassi was replaced in the draw by lucky loser Scott Humphries.
</P>
<P>
Agassi also had a bizarre early exit from the tournament last
year, when he was tossed out of the event for repeatedly swearing
at a linesman.

<HEADLINE> Expressways Bring Fortune to East China's Inland Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 9 (Xinhua) -- With last week's opening of the
first expressway in eastern Fujian and another in the west on
January 31, the inland regions in the coastal province can now
expect a new era of economic development.
</P>
<P>
Eastern and western Fujian in east China are best known for
their deep-water ports and rich mineral and forestry resources.
</P>
<P>
These abundant local resources have not been fully utilized
before due to underdeveloped roads and other infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
To gear up economic development in these regions, the
provincial government is now concentrating on highway construction.
</P>
<P>
The Luoyuan-Ningde expressway in east Fujian and the Zhangzhou-
Longyan expressway in the west are 33.7 kilometers and 29.2
kilometers long respectively, bringing strong hope to the local
residents for better economic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
A total of 300 kilometers of coastal expressways have been
built in the southeast of the province over the past six years,
and they are greatly contributing to economic growth in that area,
according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
This year, a total of four billion yuan will be invested to
construct several expressways, one of which is part of the
national expressways linking China's southernmost island province
of Hainan with Heilongjiang Province in the far northeast.

<HEADLINE> Fishing Boat Hit by Tanker off Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Two fishermen were forced to
dive for their lives when their small runabout was hit by a 79,000
ton oil tanker off Sydney in southeast Australia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sydney Water Police said the fishermen, both 37, were drifting
on the boat about 9 kilometers off the southern beach of Maroubra
about 9.30 a.m., when they noticed the huge tanker bearing down on
them.
</P>
<P>
"By the time they realized what was happening it was too late
to start the engine and get out of the way," a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
They dived overboard moments before the boat was struck and
were sucked underwater by the surge created by the passing tanker.
</P>
<P>
When they surfaced they were surprised to see their boat was
still upright, despite being badly damaged on the starboard bow.
</P>
<P>
They climbed aboard and were able to start the motor and return
to Botany Bay.
</P>
<P>
"They were pretty shaken but not injured, so they're pretty
lucky," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The captain of the tanker, The Barents, would be interviewed
later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I doubt that he would have even seen them," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Australia's BHP Goes to Court on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Australia's mining giant BHP
is taking its gripe with striking workers to court on Wednesday
after a national strike cost the company about 4 million
Australian dollars (2.64 million U.S. dollars) in lost production.
</P>
<P>
BHP is in the Federal Court in Brisbane, capital of the
Queensland state, fighting for contempt proceedings against coal
miners who took part in a snap 24-hour strike on Monday after the
company cut the price of cooking coal by five percent.
</P>
<P>
The company is also seeking orders in the New South Wales (NSW)
Industrial Relations Commission to force coal miners in the
Illawarra region back to work.
</P>
<P>
About 600 coal miners in the NSW state voted to extend their
strike until 11 p.m. Wednesday, with workers claiming BHP
management used bully-boy tactics to force miners back to work
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
BHP Coal Illawarra public affairs manager David McDonald denied
the company had threatened workers.
</P>
<P>
"We absolutely and flatly deny that there was any harassment,"
McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union late on
Monday called the snap 24-hour national strike, claiming the price
cut could cost jobs.
</P>
<P>
The strike closed 12 mines in central Queensland and the
Illawarra region.
</P>
<P>
The Queensland miners returned to work Tuesday afternoon.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Two bus bombs rocked Sri Lankan
capital of Colombo Tuesday night, killing three persons and
wounded 43 others, state radio said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
These two bus explosions follow a spate of similar bombings
blamed on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels who
have waged a 17-year-old war against the government for a separate
state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's northern and eastern
territories.
</P>
<P>
The two buses which were bound for Welimada and Negombo from
the main bus station in Colombo exploded late Tuesday night, said
the radio.
</P>
<P>
Two commuters died in the Negombo bound bus which was on its
way when the explosion took place at Wattala, six kilometers from
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Of the 27 others who were injured in this explosion and were
warded at the Ragama Hospital, one is reported to be in a critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
The Welimada bound bus exploded at the Colombo bus station a
few minutes prior to departure at midnight. One person was killed
and 16 others were injured and warded at the Colombo National
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Three of the injured who suffered severe burns are reported to
be in a critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The two bombings came amid warnings issued to passengers to be
more vigilant for unattended baggage after a parcel bomb went off
in a crowded bus in central Sri Lanka on Monday, killing one
person and wounding 50 others.
</P>
<P>
State radio and television have stepped up advertisements in a
bid to minimize the risk of bomb attacks in public places.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cisco Profit Rises 49 Percent, Splits Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Cisco Systems Inc.
again beat analysts' forecasts Tuesday with its second fiscal
quarter profit rising 49 percent as the world's biggest gear-maker
sold more equipment to telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
The San Jose, California-based company which powers the
Internet also set a 2-for-1 stock split, its ninth since first
selling shares to the public a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Cisco said that, by the end of January 29, it had reaped a net
profit of 906 million U.S. dollars, or 25 cents per share,
compared with 609 million dollars, or 17 cents per share, on a
year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cisco beat analysts' forecasts of 24 cents a share,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks earnings
estimate data.
</P>
<P>
Cisco's sales also rose 53 percent to 4.35 billion dollars from
2.85 billion dollars during the period, much better than the 41
percent rise predicted by most analysts.
</P>
<P>
Cisco, along with other equipment companies such as Lucent
Technologies Inc. and Nortel Networks Corp. is racing to develop
next-generation communication equipment that can transmit voice,

<HEADLINE> Bush Wins Delaware Republican Presidential Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Texas Governor George W.
Bush won the Republican presidential primary in Delaware State of
the United States Tuesday and secured the state's 12 delegates for
the party's national convention.
</P>
<P>
Bush earned a badly needed lift into the next stage of contests
after he was crushed by Arizona Senator John McCain in the New
Hampshire primary one week ago.
</P>
<P>
With 86 percent of the votes from 28 precincts reported, Bush
garnered 50 percent of the vote and McCain 25 percent. Millionaire
publisher Steve Forbes had a dismal 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a piece of good news that will buoy our
supporters," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
McCain skipped Delaware to focus on the February 19 primary in
South Carolina, the next big showdown in the battle for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
"It's really got to be remarkable to get these kinds of numbers
in a primary in which you didn't even appear in the state," said
McCain, who did not campaign in Delaware State.
</P>
<P>
He attributed his strong showing to the momentum generated by
his victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
Unlike New Hampshire, where independent voters could
participate, only registered Republicans can vote in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
Bush's victory in the state is rather symbolic as the state's
political and business elite heavily backed the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
After Delaware, Bush and McCain will battle in the South
Carolina primary, which will test whether McCain is a one-state
wonder or a contender who can foil Bush and his backers in the
Republican establishment.

<HEADLINE> Success of SOE Reform Hinges on Workers' Enthusiasm: China Daily Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China's reform of State-owned
enterprises (SOE) will never succeed totally unless the enthusiasm
of individual employees is harnessed, said a China Daily signed
article today.
</P>
<P>
The article based the conclusion on the comparison between the
reforms of the SOE and the country's rural reform that began in
the late 1970s, saying that state-owned enterprise employees have
not been the major beneficiaries of the reforms. They are passive
recipients, taking a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the article noted, the enterprise reform efforts
focus on the separation of enterprise management and government
administration, production restructuring and adoption of
shareholding scheme.
</P>
<P>
However, the reason for establishing shareholding corporations
is to allow enterprises to pursue more economic methods of raising
investment through market mechanism. Average enterprise employees
have nothing to gain from this, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Some people feel that allowing employees to share bonuses may
cause the loss of State assets. But the successful experiences of
rural reform proved the worry is groundless, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Statistics Bureau showed that the
average annual net income of a Chinese rural household was 2,090
yuan (255 U.S. dollars) in 1997, 15 times that of 1978. the
revenue from agriculture and stock-raising was 39.748 billion yuan
4.847 billion dollars) in 1997, 14 times the figure of 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Such figures prove that the State would not be rich and
prosperous without the well-being of individual farmers. By the
same logic, the success of SOE reform hinges on whether or not
average workers can gain profits, the article stressed.

<HEADLINE> Housing and Transport Expenditure to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people are expected to
spend more on housing and transport than on food and clothes in
the first 15 years of the 21st Century, experts with the State
Bureau of Light Industry predicted.
</P>
<P>
It means that the major objects of consumption will transform
from smaller and basic needs to more expensive and comfortable
conveniences, bureau members said.
</P>
<P>
And it also suggests that consumers are shifting their pursuits
from material to cultural and recreational services, from living
necessities to their comprehensive development.
</P>
<P>
People will be more conscious of commodity brands,
environmental protection and energy saving in their consumption,
as they get better off in the coming years, said today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
And more intelligent, beautiful, personalized and convenient
products will be something really attractive to the Chinese
consumers.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still a gap between the rural and urban
residents in consumption.
</P>
<P>
A related report indicates that in 1998, the numbers of
household electrical appliances, such as refrigerators, color TV
sets, and washing machines possessed per hundred urban households
were respectively 76.08, 105.43 and 90.57, whereas they were only
9.25, 32.59 and 22.81 for rural areas.

<HEADLINE> UNTAET to Take Over East Timor Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The peacekeeping force of the
UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) will soon
take over complete supervision of the territory from the
international force in East Timor (Interfet), an UN military
officer said.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of February, we shall take over all the sectors
within East Timor," UNTAET peacekeeping force commander Lt. Gen.
Jaime De los Santos said Tuesday in Bali, Indonesia, according to
a report reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
DE los Santos said the UNTAET peacekeeping force would consist
of 9,000 personnel from 27 countries, not including 200 military
observers.
</P>
<P>
East Timor would be divided into eastern, central and western
sectors. UNTAET, whose members are from South Korea, Thailand and
the Philippines, took over the eastern sector from Interfet early
this month.
</P>
<P>
De los Santos said he did not foresee any obstacles in the
peacekeeping process in East Timor despite that there were some
isolated cases at the border between Indonesia and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
East Timor broke away after 24 years with Indonesia following
an UN-sponsored self-determination ballot in August last year
which resulted in an over-whelming rejection to Jakarta's wide-
ranging autonomy offer. Violence followed the ballot, prompting
the United Nations to send peacekeeping force to the territory.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of people left East Timor's capital of
Dili to neighboring East Nusa Tenggara, following riots which hit
the capital after the ballot which was in favor of independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indonesian Defense Forces (TNI) and UNTAET
Tuesday agreed to improve their cooperation in maintaining peace
and security at the border between Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara
province and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Antara News Agency reported that as many as 506 East Timorese
people have reportedly died in refugee camps in different parts of
East Nusa Tenggara province since September last year.
</P>
<P>
It said 265 of the deceased are children under five, 189 adults
and 52 others young children.
</P>
<P>
Up till February 7, 2000, there were still 152,654 East
Timorese refugees in Indonesia, the disaster handling coordinating
unit reported.
</P>
<P>
The number of East Timorese who have returned to their homeland
by air, land and sea, has reached 34,965. Most of them left
Indonesia under an arrangement of the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees.

<HEADLINE> Many Indonesians Die of Diarrhea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 54 out of every
100,000 Indonesians die of diarrhea every year, a senior official
said.
</P>
<P>
The government is planning to lower the diarrhea-related
mortality rate to 22 out of every 100,000 Indonesians in the next
five years, Antara News Agency Wednesday quoted Health Minister
Achmad Sujudi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Tuesday at a hearing with the House of
Representatives (DPR) that toward that end, his ministry is
disseminating guidance on how to control and cure diarrhea,
monitoring the availability of clean water and intensifying
counseling on environmental cleanliness.
</P>
<P>
He also said 280 out of every 1,000 Indonesians suffer from
diarrhea every year and the figure is expected to drop to 180 out
of every 1,000 in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
To lower the number of those suffering from diarrhea, the
ministry will launch a national sanitation week, develop
sanitation clinics and encourage the "Clean Friday Movement" --
cleanliness activities to be held at the neighborhood level once a
week.

MANAGUA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua and Honduras agreed
Tuesday to set up a military buffer zone in the Caribbean where
new military or police sentries established since last September
were no longer allowed.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Eduardo
Montealegre and his Honduran counterpart Roberto Flores at the end
of a three-day meeting at the headquarters of the Central-American
Integration System in San Salvador.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to jointly patrol the zone for anti-drug and
rescue operations, which is expected to start two months after all
technical details are decided.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Honduras and Nicaragua have been tense since
last November 30, when the Honduran congress ratified a treaty of
maritime delimitation signed with Colombia in 1986, which,
according to Managua, cuts off 130,000 square kilometers of its
territorial waters in the Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua sued Honduras at the Hague Tribunal in December for a
settlement of the territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
Montealegre expressed his appreciation on the agreement, saying
it clarifies Nicaragua's strategy of solving the dispute through
diplomatic means.

<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- News stories on celebrations of
the traditional Chinese Lunar New Year around China still dominate
the front pages of major Beijing-based newspapers as the country
entered the fourth day of the week-long holiday today:
</P>
<P>
People's Daily
</P>
<P>
-- Some key state projects in southwest China's Sichuan
Province have become new tourism attractions since it was open to
visitors.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that nearly 100,000 tourists from China and
overseas visited the Xichang Satellite Launching Center, the
Panzhihua Iron and Steel Company and the Ertan Hydropower Station
in the first four days of the Chinese lunar new year which began
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a tourist boom has also been reported in the first
three days of the spring festival in Urumqi and elsewhere in
Xingjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, with visitors coming from Hong
Kong, Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua Daily Telegraph

<P>
-- China sold out 100 million compact discs in 1999, becoming
the world's largest compact disc producer and consumer.
</P>
<P>
 Beijing Daily

Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
China Daily

<HEADLINE> Regional Governments Urged to Rely on Science, Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Regional governments must rely
more on advanced technology to boost agricultural and industrial
development, today's China Daily quoted Han Deqian, vice-minister
of Science and Technology, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Han said his ministry would further "revitalize cities or
prefectures through science and education."
</P>
<P>
The evaluations of the careers of government officials would be
measured every two years by scientific and technological progress
in a bid to advance regional economic and social development, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Han cited some examples where technology could be used to make
economic progress.
</P>
<P>
Population growth and shortages of resources in the next
century will put pressure on grain production, he said. China must
increase the per hectare output through high technology.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that breakthroughs in biology and seed technology
have provided possibilities for higher farm product production.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also urge regional science and technology
administrations to accelerate technological upgrading among small
and medium-sized firms and township enterprises. These firms have
become new forces of the national economy since the country
implemented the reform and opening-up policies in the late 1970s,
Han said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that cities, prefectures and counties over 90
percent of China's total land area and are home to over 80 percent
of the total population.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that regional science and technology
administrations must highly value the task of improving
agricultural productivity and increasing farmers' incomes.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has completed studies of the technological needs
of the relatively backward western areas, and it will work out
specific plans to help develop science and technology in these
areas, Han said.

<HEADLINE> Law Proposed for Care of Pregnant Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A motion is expected to be made
by the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) during this year's
session of the National People's Congress (NPC), which is due in
early March, for a law on the medical insurance coverage of all
the pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
The motion suggests that insurance coverage should be provided
for pregnant women and it should be clearly stipulated in the
Social Insurance Law, which is now being drafted by the NPC, said
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Providing insurance for pregnant women "has also a bearing on
the materialization of equality between the two sexes, the better
allocation of labor resources in the market economy and the
welfare of mothers and babies alike." said the motion.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally in China, it was up to the company who paid for
the medical care of the pregnant women while maintaining her
salary when she is on maternity leave. Whereas now it has not been
followed as much as before due to high costs when the nation's
enterprises started to fare on their own in the market economy.
</P>
<P>
The sources of the ACWF show that though gender discrimination
is banned by the Chinese law, many firms are reluctant to hire
women. And some of them even went to far to sign contracts with
their female workers, prohibiting them from getting pregnant in
their contract period.
</P>
<P>
The issue of providing quality medical care to pregnant women
is more acute among the nation's hundreds of thousands of migrant
women workers. Coming from rural regions and with limited
education, most of them are not aware of importance of maternal
health care. And the frequent move has added more difficulty for
them to obtain consistent medical care during the pregnancy period.
</P>
<P>
A regulation in 1994 has enabled the setting of special funds
of medical fees for the pregnant in more than 1,400 cities and
counties nationwide. However, nearly half of the country's cities
still need to work hard to accumulate the funds, according to ACWF
's figures.
</P>
<P>
The ACWF will make altogether three motions to the NPC this
year, with another one to tackle the difficulty in guaranteeing
women farmers' equal right to contracting land.

<HEADLINE> China to Enhance Students' Ecological Awareness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A sense of environmental
consciousness is being instilled in today's students.
</P>
<P>
"Educational authorities nationwide and the State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA) have already provided the
material to assist teachers in cultivating and increasing students
' sense of environmental protection," said Lin Youbin, an official
with the SEPA Information and Education Division.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the SEPA and the Education Ministry have
recently published a series of textbooks concerning the
environment, which will be used in some regions of the nation this
autumn.
</P>
<P>
"We are short of teaching staff who have received environment
training, though many teachers are advocates of environmental
protection," said Lin.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, up to now the SEPA and the
Education Ministry have trained 800 teachers in this field
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, SEPA will create an educational website for
the exchange of information with international partners and to
provide teaching staff and students with useful and up-to-date
material.
</P>
<P>
Related records show that 22 organizations and individuals have
won Globe 500 awards, a reward set by the United Nations
Environmental Program to those who has made a breakthrough
contribution in environmental protection from 1987 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
The SEPA has also chaired a biology and environment contest for
young people in the last decade to encourage children and the
youth to participate in environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> Manila Denies New Marcos Offer on Compromise  Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is not
aware of any reported offer by the Marcoses to pay victims of
human rights abuses, the nation's leading newspaper the Philippine
Star said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican was quoted as saying in a
statement that the Philippine government is not a party to the
settlement agreement pending before the U.S. Hawaii District Curt
between the Marcoses and human rights victims.
</P>
<P>
He issued the statement in reaction to reports that former
first lady Imelda Marcos has offered the government a new
compromise proposal, which is tied to the 150-million-U.S. dollar
settlement with the human rights victims.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Mrs. Marcos intends to settle all
pending court cases and financial claims against her family
through this new proposal.
</P>
<P>
Hawaii District Court Judge Manuel Real has ordered heirs of
the late president Ferdinand Marcos to pay human rights victims
some 2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Marcoses and the victims have agreed to enter into a
settlement agreement involving the payment of 150 million dollars
to the victims, which will come from some 630 million dollars in
accounts held in escrow by the Philippine National Bank.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the role of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government (PCGG) on this issue was to merely assist the victims
by entering into an "undertaking" to release the 150 million
dollars from the escrow accounts.
</P>
<P>
The nation's Anti-Graft Court, however, has ruled against the
release of the amount.
</P>
<P>
The PCGG has filed a motion for reconsideration of the Anti-
Graft Court's order disapproving the said undertaking to release
the 150 million dollars and this said motion remains pending,
Barican noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the PCGG, through the Office of the Solicitor
General, intends to appeal the issue before the Supreme Court if
the Anti-Graft Court denies its motion to reconsider the ruling.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Car Sales Surge 19 Pct in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The passenger car industry of
the Philippines is off to a quick start this year as sales zoomed
19.1 percent in January over the same period in 1999, Philippine
Daily Inquirer reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted data from the Chamber of Automotive
Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. (CAMPI) as saying that car
sales surged to 2,366 units in January from 1,987 units during the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
CAMPI secretary-general Mario De Grano said this is an
indication that the industry is on the way to slight recovery
following two consecutive years of slump.
</P>
<P>
However, De Grano said the CAMPI is watching the market with
cautious optimism, projecting this year's sales to be flat at 29,
600 from 27,580 in 1999 as banks steadily reopen their automotive
lending window.
</P>
<P>
The country's top two assemblers -- Honda Cars Philippines Inc.
and Toyota Motor Cars Philippines Corp. -- lead the market's
resurgence in January as they waged aggressive marketing campaign
to attract new car buyers back to their showrooms.
</P>
<P>
Honda cornered 41 percent of the market as it sold 973 units in
January, up 55 percent from 627 in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
Toyota was second with a 23-percent market share as it sold 540
units in January from 415 units a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Nissan Motor Philippines Inc. remained at the No.3 post even
though its sales dropped 14 percent to 273 units in January from
319 units a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Decrees Compensation to Cermis Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government Tuesday
allocated a total of 3.8 billion lire (about 1.9 million U.S.
dollars) in compensation to the families of each of the victims of
the disaster on Mt. Cermis.
</P>
<P>
Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema signed the decree that
compensation be paid to the families of each of the victims of the
disaster on Mt. Cermis, when a U.S. warplane cut a ski lift cable
and 20 people plunged to their deaths in February 3, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the June 19, 1951, London Convention
covering NATO operations and liabilities in a NATO country,
compensation for the disaster will be paid by the Italian Defense
Ministry and then shared between Italy (25 percent) and the U.S. (
75 percent), the country whose military personnel were responsible
for the act.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy in the Dolomite mountains occurred when the tailfin
of a U.S. Marine EA-6B Prowler surveillance plane sliced the
Cermis ski-lift cable during a ground-hugging training flight out
of the NATO airbase at nearby Aviano.
</P>
<P>
Seven Germans, five Belgians, three Italians, two Poles, two
Austrians and one Dutch citizen were killed in the incident.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants European Allies to Increase Defense Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen Tuesday urged the European partners to increase
their defense spending and shoulder more responsibilities in
security in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The Europeans must also bear a fair share of that
responsibility, and they have yet to do so," Cohen told the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
Cohen complained that the European countries do not bear a "
fair share" of responsibility in keeping peace in Kosovo, where 6,
000 police were required but there are only 1,900 international
police.
</P>
<P>
"They have not committed either the manpower or the money that
would be necessary to get an adequate police force on the ground
so that our forces won't find themselves in the position of having
to carry out such activities," Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
The Senate panel debated a defense budget package of 305.4
billion U.S. dollars proposed by the Clinton administration for
the fiscal year of 2001 beginning this October 1.
</P>
<P>
The budget is 16.5 billion U.S. dollars higher than the current
one and is the second real increase in U.S. defense spending since
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
"I come to you to ask you for additional funding. You will, in
all probability, support that, if not more," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
"But then you look across the Atlantic and you look at their
budgets and they're cutting their budgets. And I have tried to
convey to our European friends that ultimately that has a
political consequence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cohen asked the European countries to spend more. "So it's a
message that needs to be repeated from the very highest levels...
They can't spend any less, they should spend more."

The secretary also said the European allies should reform their
military forces. "They have to reform the way in which they shape
their forces. They have to move away from having forces that are
designed to contend against a Soviet invasion across a central
front."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the hearing, Committee Chairman John Warner said
the Clinton administration was unlikely to get approval for 2.1
billion U.S. dollars in funds for those U.S. peacekeeping troops
in Kosovo and Bosnia this year unless Europe boosted its support
there.
</P>
<P>
"The United States simply cannot pull, in terms of dollar
commitment, the sole oar in this situation," Warner said. "It is
primarily a European situation and they have got to live up to
commitments."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Herbal Medicine Has Bright Future: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China's traditional herbal
medicine will have a bright future in the 21st century, Chinese
medical experts said at a recent symposium in Hangzhou, capital of
east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released at the symposium, the global
trade volume of herbal medicine amounted to 16.4 billion U.S.
dollars in 1998 and is showing annual double-digit growth.
</P>
<P>
This shows that more people in the world have accepted the
healing powers of herbal medicine, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Some experts at the meeting pointed out that modern diseases
are no longer easily treated by Western medicine, which creates
its own immunity in the human body if used for a long period. And
Western medicine has lots of side effects that have prompted many
patients to seek alternative treatments.
</P>
<P>
Chinese traditional herbal medicines, with their limited side
effects and long-term application, have proved to be more
effective in treating chronic and difficult diseases, the experts
deemed.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Chinese herbal medicine has been rejected by
Westerners because they didn't know much about its medicinal
properties, they said.
</P>
<P>
But with the spread of knowledge on herbal medicines and media
coverage of numerous successful treatment cases, the traditional
medicines are gaining favor worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization has praised China's herbal
medicines as the "best examples of world traditional medicines"
and recommended them to many countries, the experts noted.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea and
Singapore have established special research institutes to study
China's traditional cures, and some universities offer courses on
the subject.
</P>
<P>
China boasts 12,807 kinds of medicinal herbs and has a total
reserve of 8.5 million tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province in south
China reported sustained development in telecommunications, with
the sector's 1999 business turnover growing by eight percent year
on year to 27.89 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
This growth was attributed to diversified services created to
expand the market, as some 1.86 million phone users joined the
network of Guangdong Telecom, the local telecommunications company,
in 1999, bringing the province's total number of customers to 11.4
million.
</P>
<P>
There was also great momentum in the burgeoning multi-media and
e-commerce services. The company saw the number of Internet users
in the province surpass 700,000 last year, when it began to
provide e-commerce licenses to 20,000 companies.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Telecom invested 10 billion yuan in fixed-asset
upgrading in 1999, which helped to increase the capacity of
telephone exchange switchboards to 15.8 million lines.
</P>
<P>
The company has set this year's business turnover growth target
at 14 percent, with 1.8 million new telephone subscribers and one
million new Internet users expected. To accomplish this goal, the
company is poised to invest some 10.6 billion yuan.

who could now miss the Sydney Olympics later this year, admits he
is likely to turn his back on the sport if he is not cleared.

<P>
"If I do lose this year when I've done nothing wrong and
followed all the procedures then I'll find it very difficult to
come back to the sport because I know I'm innocent," Richardson
told BBC Radio 5 Live.
</P>
<P>
"I know I've done nothing wrong and I will feel so hard done by
that I'll find it hard to go on.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very passionate about the sport and that's why I'm good at
it. That's what spurs me on and drives me on.
</P>
<P>
"Once you've lost your passion for anything I think you should
walk away from it and believe me, this is killing my passion for
the sport." he said.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Forward Camby Strained His Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The New York Knicks are
breathing a sigh of relief today after learning that forward
Marcus Camby's knee injury is only a mild strain.
</P>
<P>
Diagnostic arthroscopic surgery performed today at a hospital
revealed a strained right ACL. The procedure was to determine
whether Camby needed additional surgery.
</P>
<P>
Camby will be sidelined indefinitely. The original diagnosis
from an incorrect MRI revealed a partial tear, which could have
sidelined him up to two months.
</P>
<P>
Camby landed awkwardly on his right knee after he was fouled
hard by Miami's P.J. Brown in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 94-80
win over the Heat.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, he will begin a rehabilitation and conditioning
program, which will include exercises to strengthen the muscles
around his knee.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks were without Camby and starting small forward Larry
Johnson for Monday's loss in Charlotte. Johnson, who is expected
to return after the All-Star break, suffered a chipped fracture of
the fourth metatarsal in his left foot on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Monday's loss dropped New York one game behind first-place
Miami in the Atlantic Division.
</P>
<P>
Injuries are nothing new to the Knicks, who played the first
six weeks of the season without center Patrick Ewing and currently
are without guard Chris Childs due to an Achilles strain.
</P>
<P>
Forwards Kurt Thomas and John Wallace and center Chris Dudley
will see increased playing time in the absence of Camby and
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
One of the leading candidates for the NBA's Sixth Man Award,
Camby is in his fourth NBA season and second with the Knicks. He
is averaging 10.7 points, 7.8 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game and
was a key ingredient in New York's run to the NBA Finals last
season.
</P>
<P>
Johnson is in his ninth season and fourth with New York. He is
averaging 12.1 points and 5.6 rebounds and is considered one of
the team's leaders.

<HEADLINE> China Leads in Biological Hydrogen Producing Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
developed a new technology to produce hydrogen from sewage by a
process known as bacteriolysis.
</P>
<P>
Researchers with the Harbin Architecture Institute in northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province said they can now produce 280 cubic
meters of hydrogen gas that is 99 percent pure from a 50-cubic-
meter container of sewage each day.
</P>
<P>
This means China can now produce hydrogen on an industrial
scale, said Prof. Ren Nanqi, who heads the research group.
</P>
<P>
According to Ren and other experts, researchers in other
countries have taken a different road for hydrogen production with
biological technology, and no major breakthrough has been reported
in their experiments.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the traditional electrolytic process or production
of hydrogen from petroleum and other minerals, the new method
saves energy and uses no minerals, which cannot be reproduced, Ren
said.
</P>
<P>
What's more, he said, their method can purify sewage into clear
water in the process of producing hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
Li Guibai, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering,
confirmed that the technology developed by Ren and his colleagues
is leading the world in this field of research and may lead to the
discovery of a clean and reproducible energy resource for mankind.

<HEADLINE> Edwards: Drug Test Athlete was 'Naive'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Triple jumper Jonathan Edwards
accused Tuesday fellow athlete Mark Richardson of being "naive"
for taking dietary supplements.
</P>
<P>
Richardson, the fourth and most recent athlete to test positive
for the banned steroid nandrolone, blamed an energy-boosting '
cocktail' he took minutes before the sample last November.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Edwards believed his British team-mate is
innocent but has questioned his decision to continue taking
dietary supplements despite fears there might be a link with
excessive levels of nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
"With the link between supplements and athletes who have tested
positive, it was naive of Mark to continue taking the products,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Collymore Close to Leave Villa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club Aston Villa have agreed a deal with Leicester City that could
see Stan Collymore on his way to Filbert Street.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which now rests on the outcome of a medical on
the 29-year-old striker, involves no initial transfer fee. Villa's
asking price of three million pounds had been the major stumbling
block to a move.
</P>
<P>
Villa will instead receive 250,000 pounds if Collymore makes 25
first team appearances for the Foxes, rising to 500,000 for 50,
which means a massive loss for the club, which spent more than
seven million when it bought him from Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Collymore is now discussing personal terms with the Worthington
Cup finalists and should undergo the necessary medical in the very
near future.
</P>
<P>
Leicester manager Martin O'Neill has an injury crisis on his
hands, which the controversial striker could help alleviate.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of injured strikers Emile Heskey and Tony Cottee,
Matt Elliott and Muzzy Izzet were used as a makeshift front
pairing for the Leicester's last Premiership clash, against
Middlesbrough.
</P>
<P>
"I think if Stan were to sign for anyone, he would feel this is
his last chance," said O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
"It's as simple as that and therefore I would expect his
inspiration to come from within."
</P>
<P>
During his time at Villa, Collymore has complained of suffering
from stress and depression, causing him to miss much of last
season. He has also failed to make a first team appearances for
the Premiership side this season, instead playing on loan to
Fulham for a short period.

<HEADLINE> English F.A. Push for 10-year Rule  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of
England is calling for the introduction of a new 10-yard rule
which would allow referees to punish players who argue with their
decisions.
</P>
<P>
The idea is similar to that used in rugby union, and the FA has
concluded through experiments this season that it has increased
the level of sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
Under the rule, referees can move a free kick ten yards nearer
the defending team's goal every time a player shows dissent.
</P>
<P>
The FA believe it would prevent the kind of intimidation
experienced by referee Andy D'Urso at Old Trafford recently.
</P>
<P>
It has yet to be used in the professional game, but the FA
wants FIFA's International Board, which governs the rules of the
game, to adopt it when it meets next week.
</P>
<P>
"In our view it has been a complete success (in the trials). It
's now a question of whether the board will change the law
worldwide," said FA executive director David Davies.
</P>
<P>
"We have been behind this change all the way and are supportive
of it. If FIFA decided to go for a further year of experiment on a
higher profile, we'd go for it.
</P>
<P>
"The issue now is whether FIFA have seen enough. Our
information is that it has improved the level of sportsmanship and
that it works."
</P>
<P>
Officials in Jersey say the 10-yard rule has dramatically
improved the conduct of their players since it was introduced 18
months ago.
</P>
<P>
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper admitted: "We sent representatives
to Jersey and they came back and said there was nothing to see
because the rule works.
</P>
<P>
"There was no dissent or time-wasting when a free-kick was
given.The next stage is whether the rule is adopted at the highest
level from 1 July," he said.

<P>
BEIRUT -- Israeli jets unleashed new air strikes Wednesday on
guerrilla targets in south Lebanon in retaliation for the killing
of an Israeli soldier on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the latest raids, Israeli warplanes fired four missiles at a
suspected guerrilla hideout at Jabal al-Daher in Bekaa Valley, said
security officials on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The jets returned and fired eight more missiles in the valley,
southwest of the market town of Nabatiyeh and on nearby Wadi al-
Hojair, areas used by the guerrillas to launch attacks on the
Israeli-occupied zone, the officials said. No reports of casualties
are available now.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy Wednesday
called on the Lebanese and Syrian government to rein in Hezbollah
guerrillas' activities in South Lebanon, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Briefing foreign diplomats in Israel on Lebanese issues, Levy
said it will take many years for Lebanon to repair the
infrastructure damaged by Israeli air raids in recent days, which
aimed at subduing Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Levy said, the Lebanese government should not allow the
Iranian and Syrian-backed Hezbollah to determine its fate.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on Wednesday
reiterated Iraq's rejection to the latest U.N. Security Council
resolution on Iraq which calls for the return of U.N. arms
inspectors to Iraq in exchange for possible suspension of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the remarks in a meeting with visiting Russian Roving
Ambassador Nicholai Kortozov and his accompanying delegation, said
the Iraqi News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, they discussed the latest development of the
situation concerning Iraq at the United Nations Security Council,
said INA without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Three Iraqi civilians were killed and eight others
injured Wednesday in U.S. and British warplanes' attacks on some
civilian and service installations in southern Iraq, an Iraqi
military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 13:55 (1055 GMT) 16 formations of U.S
and British warplanes coming from Kuwaiti and Saudi airspace made
50 armed sorties over southern Iraq's Basra, Thi-Qar, Qadissiyah,
Muthana, Misan, Najaf and Wasit provinces.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah's Ammunition Dump Uncovered in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish security forces uncovered
a cache of arms in operations against the radical Islamic group
Hezbollah in southeastern province of Gaziantep, the Anatolia News
Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Police said 120 guns, 28 rocket launchers, a number of bombs,
explosives, bomb-making equipment, TNT blocks, military binoculars

secular but overwhelming Muslim Turkey into a strict Islamic-ruled
country by means of violence.

throughout the country against the radical group which was
unearthed to have committed murders, kidnappings and blackmail.

<HEADLINE> PKK Again Announces To Lay Down Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The outlawed Kurdistan Workers'
Party (PKK) announced that it is to lay down arms in return for a
potential amnesty for all its imprisoned militants including
Abdullah Ocalan, its doomed leader.
</P>
<P>
The group will drop the word "Kurdistan" and pursue "Kurdish
rights" within a "peace and democratization framework," reported
the Anatolia News Agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At its seventh congress, PKK also decided to rename ERNK, its
political-propaganda wing, and ARGK, its armed wing. From now on,
ERNK will be called "Democratic People's Union" and ARGK "People's
Legitimate Defense Force."
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish press dismissed the PKK decisions as a new ploy
to "shed its image as a bloody-handed terror group."
</P>
<P>
Terrorism experts were quoted as saying that the organization's
actions conflict with its rhetoric and the decisions this time are
also suspicious. They believe that the decision to rename its armed
wing attests to a PKK intention to resume armed struggle under more
conducive conditions.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that since Abdullah Ocalan's arrest last
February, internal conflicts have erupted in his guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
Some factions agreed with Ocalan's call, sent out from his
prison cell, for laying down arms and seeking Kurdish rights in a
peaceful way while certain hardliners vowed to continue the PKK's
16-year war for an independent Kurdish state in southeast Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Zyuganov Announces Program for Presidential Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov, who registered as candidate for next Russian
president Tuesday, announced his election program Wednesday,
appealing to Russians for support in the March 26 general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov vowed to use Russia's natural resources "for the
benefit of the entire people and each single Russian." Each
Russian citizen will have "a share in the republic property, a
piece of the national pie," he told a news conference in the State
Duma, lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said that if he comes to power he will have the constitution
amended in a way ensuring "real democratization, the elimination
of the authoritarian presidential rule, and a higher role for the
Federal Assembly and the government."
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov also plans to re-establish state control over the
strategic economic sectors. He said that state control should be
restored over how the property is being run. The property "stolen
during savage privatization must be returned to the citizens and
to the state; state control over the natural resources and the
fuel and energy sector must be restored and state monopoly on the
sale of alcoholic products must be introduced, he said.
</P>
<P>
He promised to impose state monopoly on alcohol products and
cigarettes. "Vodka money should go to the treasury, not to bandits,
" he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the investors who will put their resources into
the development of the state economic sector will be provided with
guarantees and the interests of foreign investors will be defended.
Banks and insurance companies will be strictly controlled by the
state.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov promised to defend the middle class and its legally
acquired property and incomes, to give back to the investors the
savings stolen from them by private banks, and make compensation
payments for the savings "that disappeared into thin air during
the period of reforms."
</P>
<P>
"Ideologically, the future Russia will be guided by the
principles of freedom of thought based on generally-recognized
values, such as social justice, state dignity, people's rule,
patriotism and human rights and liberties. In the Russian State
the Russian people will play a role befitting their status as a
great nation," said Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to guarantee each Russian "a job and decent wages"in
two years. Each working person will receive at least 1,000 rubles
(about 35 U.S. dollars) every months, and the wages of doctors and
teachers at least 3,000 rubles (around 105 dollars).
</P>
<P>
He proposed to halve taxes on producers of goods and services,
prices on fuel and tariffs on electric energy, transport and
communication.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he consented to immediately double pensions,
social benefits and salaries of those employed in state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He put up the slogan "For the future of the nation" and
guaranteed free medical treatment and education "everywhere and
for everyone."
</P>
<P>
He urged to put the executive power under strict control of the
people and legislatures and form a government of popular trust.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party leader also expressed confidence that he
can win the upcoming Russian presidential elections scheduled for
March 26.
</P>
<P>
"We have every chance of collecting 55 percent of the vote.
This task has been given to our headquarters and chapters and they
will energetically work to carry it out," Zyuganov said.
</P>
<P>
"Conduct honest public opinion research and you will see that
acting President Vladimir Putin's popularity rating is exaggerated
by at least a half," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is more of a left-wing, left-of-the-center country by
conviction," he said. "We are interested in having one more
considerable, fundamental party to honestly contend in the
elections. So far we have been competing only with the party of
power, with media tricksters and many others unable of conducting
a simple, honest competition," he said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China on Wednesday
expressed deep concern over the security of United Nations and
associated personnel and urged for active cooperation to protect U.
N. personnel.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the open debate of the United Nations Security
council on the protection of United Nations personnel, associated
personnel and humanitarian personnel in conflict zones, Chinese
Deputy Permanent Representative to the U.N., Shen Guofang,
condemned attacks of any form against United Nations personnel and
requested that countries where such incidents had occurred work to
bring the perpetrators to justice.
</P>
<P>
Shen noted that the mandate of each U.N. peacekeeping operation
should be clear and include extensive plan for security, and such
personnel should abide by international law and the principles of
the Charter of the United Nations as well as the laws of the host
country.
</P>
<P>
He said it was necessary for the United Nations to establish
effective mechanisms and measures to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
Instead of just issuing a statement, the Council must show that
it would never tolerate such atrocities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The matter should be jointly discussed and handled within the
United Nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador expressed the hope that the Council would
strengthen its cooperation with other organs within the United
Nations.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Economic Growth Hits Record High in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia attained the goal of
stabilizing economy in 1999 with its gross domestic product (GDP)
up 3.2 percent and industrial output up 8.1 percent, which was the
best record of the country's economy in the past ten years, said
Russian Economy Minister Andrei Shapovalyants on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The measures taken by the government last year and a number of
favorable factors helped avoid the worst forecast and consolidate
the prerequisites for steady economic stabilization, Shapovalyants
said at an expanded meeting of the ministry's senior officials,
which focused on the results of 1999 and the tasks for 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said that prices on Russia's main export items -- oil, steel
rolled-stock and products of the ferrous and non-ferrous
industries -- were favorable on the world market.
</P>
<P>
"The 1999 economic indicators show," Shapovalyants said, "that
the government has a "comprehensive program for implementing
systemic economic-stabilization measures." "And each of its stages
is being consistently implemented," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 2000 the Economy Ministry will continue the work to overcome
decline and to restore the citizens' real incomes, he said. In the
estimate of the ministry, this year the citizens' incomes will
increase from two to four percent as compared with 1999. In the
fourth quarter of 1999 the citizen's incomes increased by 1.7
percent against the same period of 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Russian first Deputy Finance Minister Aleksei
Kudrin noted that there is a good chance for Russia's GDP to grow
by an annual rate of 5-8 percent in three to four years.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia has still not taken the measures required to
ensure further economic growth and attract investment, and the
problem of protecting shareholder rights has yet to be solved,
Kudrin said.

dispute could be resolved peacefully only if Eritrea pulls out its
troops from all occupied Ethiopian territories.

<HEADLINE> Welsh First Secretary Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Alun Michael Wednesday resigned
as leader of the Labor Party in Wales just hours after quitting
his post as first secretary of the National Assembly for Wales.
</P>
<P>
He was temporarily replaced by Rhodri Morgan who will be acting
first secretary until a permanent replacement is announced next
week.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his second resignation of the day, Michael said he
was" very disappointed indeed".
</P>
<P>
In an unexpected move, Michael resigned during a debate
following the tabling of a no-confidence vote in his leadership.
</P>
<P>
No one had expected him to quit until after a no-confidence
vote. Even members of the cabinet were said to be "surprised".
</P>
<P>
"I resign in the interests of the Assembly and the wider Labor
party," he told the chamber in Cardiff.

<HEADLINE> Argentina to Strengthen Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, February 9 (Xinhua)-- Argentina's government has
decided to strengthen the border area with around 1,000 armed
police who will be spread along Argentina's frontier with Bolivia,
Paraguay and Brazil, a police source said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The director of National Gendarmerie, commander Hugo Miranda,
specified the task is to increase controls and migration
regulation and fundamentally to repress smuggling of drugs and of
merchandise of all kinds in general.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's government adopted a package of measures to
strengthen security at frontier areas after series of incidents
with bands of smugglers.
</P>
<P>
Another measure is the creation of a common working table
serving to exchange data and intelligence reports and share
resources among the State's different forces.
</P>
<P>
Miranda described the situation at the border area as worrying
due to the smuggling volume and the tendency of entry to big
consuming centers, constituting a threat to the country's own
production.

<HEADLINE> Greece Reaffirms Fixed Position Toward Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday reiterated its
position towards the settlement of the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
For the Greek government, the Cyprus problem continued to be
the focal point of its foreign policy, with the solution framework
set by the U.N. in the direction of a bizonal and bicommunal
federation being a steadfast basis, Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the new framework of EU-Turkish relations, the
easing of tension in Greek-Turkish relations and the reaffirmation
of Cyprus' unimpeded accession toward the European Union (EU)
could be utilized in the direction of finding a just and viable
solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
To reunite the divided island, the two communities on Cyprus
have held two rounds of the U.N.-sponsored fruitless proximity
talks in New York and Geneva respectively. They will hold another
round of such talks in New York, starting May 23.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash demands that northern
Cyprus, illegally declared in 1983 and recognized only by Turkey,
be recognized internationally as a prelude to reunification in the
form of a two-state confederation.

<HEADLINE> Mandelson Appeals to IRA on Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mandelson said the suspension of Northern Ireland's power-
sharing assembly -- expected to take place by the weekend -- could
still be avoided.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the House of Commons, he said: "Nobody is asking
for surrender by the IRA. Nobody is asking for humiliation to be
heaped on the IRA."
</P>
<P>
"I just say that if politics is to work, and if we are to see
the decommissioning that is an essential part of the peace process,
then there must be certainty, there must be definiteness if
confidence in all the institutions is going to be rebuilt," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson was speaking as the House of Lords debated the
emergency legislation which would lead to the return of direct
rule in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
If agreed by the end of the week, the power-sharing assembly
set up in Northern Ireland under the Good Friday Agreement would
be suspended before Saturday's crucial meeting of the ruling
council of the Ulster Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
The Lords gave the bill an unopposed second reading on
Wednesday, and it will complete its remaining stages on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said there may be another report on decommissioning
from General John de Chastelain before the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
He also seemed to respond directly to a warning from Sinn Fein
President Gerry Adams that he would quit the peace process if
there was a return to direct rule.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said: "Nobody wants any of the political parties to
walk away from the peace process because we want this to work."
</P>
<P>
In Belfast, Adams repeated his warning that if the peace
process collapsed, Sinn Fein would have to reflect on whether they
wanted to be made "scapegoats" again.
</P>
<P>
Following what could be the last meeting of the executive at
Stormont before suspension, Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon
said another meeting had been scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be a tragedy if the executive and assembly was
halted, adding: "Nothing is ever over until the last card is
played,"he said. "And I don't believe the last card has been
played."
</P>
<P>
The crisis came about after the first report from General de
Chastelain's decommissioning body did not show enough progress
towards IRA decommissioning to keep Ulster Unionists in the
assembly.
</P>
<P>
Attempts to resolve the crisis continued on Wednesday with a
series of frantic behind-the-scenes talks.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke to his Irish counterpart Bertie
Ahern by telephone and met Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble at
Downing Street. Trimble flies to Dublin on Thursday to see Ahern.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson also met with Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen on
Wednesday afternoon in London.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said the peace process was a "very
important" stage, and he called on all involved to work towards a
successful conclusion.
</P>
<P>
In another development, an offer from the Catholic Bishop of
Derry, Seamus Hegarty, to accept weapons from the IRA in an effort
to ease the crisis has been rejected by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Suspending the assembly is aimed at preventing the first
minister and leader of the Ulster Unionists, David Trimble, from
resigning.
</P>
<P>
Trimble told his party in November that he would quit the
assembly if the IRA had not started decommissioning weapons by the
end of January.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Urges Full Respect for U.N.Personnel in Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Wednesday urged states and non-state parties
to respect fully the status of United Nations and associated
personnel, humanitarian personnel and to take all appropriate
steps to ensure the safety and security of these personnel.
</P>
<P>
The call came after the Council held a open debate on the
protection of United Nations personnel, associated personnel and
humanitarian personnel in conflict zones this morning.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the Council stressed that the
primary responsibility for the security and protection of United
Nations and associated personnel, and humanitarian personnel lies
with the host states.
</P>
<P>
The Council urged states to fulfill their responsibility to
act promptly and effectively in their domestic legal systems to
bring to justice all hose responsible for attacks and other acts
of violence against such personnel, and to enact effective
national legislation as required for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
The Council recognized the importance of issuing clear,
appropriate and feasible mandates for peacekeeping operations, to
ensure that they are applied in a timely, efficient and objective
manner and underscored that United Nations personnel have the
right to act in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
The Council encouraged the U.N. Secretary-General to complete
the process of conducting a general and comprehensive review of
security in peacekeeping operations, with a view to elaborating
and undertaking further specific and practical measures to
increase the safety and security of United Nations and associated
personnel, and humanitarian personnel.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. reported that there have been 184 civilian death
between January 1, 1992 and January 1, 2000, of which 41 were
internationally-recruited staff and 143 were locally-recruited
staff. The number of killings, assaults and kidnappings of U.N.and
associated personnel is on the trend of dramatical increase since
the early 90's.
