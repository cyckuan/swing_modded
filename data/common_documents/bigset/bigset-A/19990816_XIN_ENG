<HEADLINE> SADC Wants End to Gold Sales: Zuma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zuma told a press conference here that many developing
countries, which have gold production as their economic backbone,
have suffered a great deal after the gold price plunged to a
20-year record low.
</P>
<P>
She said that not only the gold producing countries were the
victims of gold sales but also the countries exporting gold miners
were dealt a heavy blow.
</P>
<P>
Zuma was speaking after the end of a two-day ministerial
meeting of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) which
preceded a SADC summit scheduled for August 18.
</P>
<P>
She said the 14 SADC ministers discussed, among other issues,
the negative impact of gold sales on SADC gold producing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The gold price dipped to around 255 dollars an ounce from about
290 dollars after Britain announced its plan in May to sell part
of its gold reserves. The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
announced later that it also planned to sell 5 million to 10
million ounces of gold for funding its plan to relieve the poorest
countries of their debt burden.
</P>
<P>
Zuma noted that the IMF plan, if carried out, would hurt the
countries it intended to help rather than assisting them.
</P>
<P>
She urged the IMF to find other alternatives to fund its plan
for debt relief.
</P>
<P>
A number of SADC countries are gold producers. but since the
plunge of gold price, the countries as well as their neighbors
that rely on labor export for currency remittance have lost
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zuma disclosed that the upcoming SADC summit will devote its
attention to gold sales, saying, "a position has to be adopted on
the issue."

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Not Invited to SADC Meeting: Zuma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There have been reports in the local media that the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) had invited Congo rebels to
Maputo on the sidelines of a SADC summit to sign a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said in response to a related question that she had no
information that Congo rebels had been invited.
</P>
<P>
She said the rebels would not come and there would be no
signing of the treaty during the summit.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said the two-day SADC ministerial meeting mainly dealt
with economic and trade issues. Regional conflicts, she said, were
left for the heads of state when they meet here on August 18.
</P>
<P>
She said the Zambian president would deliver a special report
on the situation in Congo at the summit.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi-led rebels are trying to topple Congolese President
Laurent Kabila's government. On July 10, Kabila and his allies --
Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe -- signed a peace agreement, as did the
backers of the rebels, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
However, the main rebel movement, the Congolese Rally for
Democracy (RCD), has declined to sign amid a leadership row that
has split the movement into two.
</P>
<P>
Zuma hinted that it would take time to end conflicts in the
region, including the one in Congo. She went to the Congo earlier
this month to narrow the gap between the two rival factions but
returned empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said people expected the SADC to help end regional
conflicts quickly but "conflicts cannot be ended as quickly as
they are started".

<HEADLINE> Chiluba to Present Report on Congo to SADC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign Minister
Nkosazana Zuma said here Sunday that Zambian President F. Chiluba
will present a report on the Congo peace process to the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) summit Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zuma, who is also chairperson of the SADC council of minister,
said at a press briefing that Chiluba was appointed to deal with
the Congo issue at the last SADC summit in Mauritius last
September.
</P>
<P>
The president is in charge of that process with the help of
other countries, she said, adding that as recently as this week
the president sent his minister to Kisangani in northeastern Congo
to identify the process.
</P>
<P>
The minister will report to President Chiluba and the president
will present an appropriate report on the Congo issue to the
summit as required by the last summit meeting, said Zuma.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of the peace process in the vast central African
country became rosy when a cease-fire agreement was reached in
Zambian capital Lusaka on July 10 by the six countries directly
involved in the Congo conflict.
</P>
<P>
However, the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), one major
rebel group in the Congo, has failed to sign the accord due to its
internal dispute over leadership, which has endangered the fragile
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
In response to a report in the Noticias newspaper here Sunday,
Zuma said that she doesn't expect the Congolese rebels to come to
the Mozambican capital.
</P>
<P>
The mozambican paper quoted Zuma's spokesperson Vincent
Hlonguane as saying that the rebels in the Congo were coming to
sign the Lusaka cease- fire agreement in maputo where the SADC
summit will take place Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said that her spokesperson did not say that.
</P>
<P>
SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende, who was sitting beside
Zuma, also said that he doesn't expect the Congolese rebels to
come.
</P>
<P>
However, Zuma expressed optimism toward an end to the
one-year-old Congo war, though she could not give a deadline.
</P>
<P>
"The war has to end," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
But the minister, snapping her fingers, noted that a war is
easy to start but not so easy to end.
</P>
<P>
She said that the security issues were not supposed to be
addressed by the ministers and they will be discussed at the
summit of heads of state on the cease-fire. enditem

<HEADLINE> Barak Orders Re-examination of Development Priorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak on Sunday took a preliminary step toward a possible change
in the priority status Jewish settlements have enjoyed, ordering
a committee to restart examination of the issue.
</P>
<P>
Barak announced at a cabinet meeting that the
Directors-General Committee on National Preferential Development
Areas would resume operations, according to a cabinet statement.
</P>
<P>
The priority status of Jewish settlements in national
development was canceled by former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin
but restored by Barak's hard-line predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians regard the more than 150 settlements
scattering in the West Bank and Gaza as illegal and an obstacle
to their aspiration to build an independent state, calling on
Israeli governments to remove all the settlements.
</P>
<P>
After trouncing Netanyahu in the May election, Barak has
undertaken not to build new Jewish settlements and not to
dismantle existing ones in West Bank and Gaza before Israel and
the Palestinians enter the final-status talks, during which the
final borders will be drawn.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Barak has promised to stop
the flowing of millions of shekels to settlements and redirect
them to the fields of education and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
New Industry and Trade Minister Ran Cohen from the left-wing
Meretz party ordered last month to suspend all applications for
industrial investment subsidies in Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
The freezing of approvals for factory subsidies beyond the
Green Line, which divides Israel and the territories it seized
in the 1967 war, will be in effect until the government
completes examination of its priority in national development
areas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli governments offer varying levels of capital spending
aid to new industrial or tourism enterprises in areas designated
national development zones.
</P>
<P>
During the three years of Netanyahu's government, about 240
million U.S. dollars of new investments were channeled to in West
Bank and Gaza settlements.
</P>
<P>
Of the investments, the government had provided subsidies
totaling 300 million shekels (some 73 million U.S. dollars). But
Cohen said the money was inappropriately allocated because the
settlements did not suffer high unemployment compared to many
towns inside the Green Line.

KUWAIT CITY, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Sunday voiced
concern over the latest escalation of tension between India and
Pakistan and called on both sides to exercise self-restraint.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's stance on the issue was defined during a regular
cabinet session chaired by Prime Minister Saad Al-Abdullah
Al-Sabah.

Pakistan last Wednesday fired a surface-to-air missile toward
three Indian military helicopters over a marshy border where
India had shot down a Pakistani plane the day before.

The two air clashes in two days between the rival South Asian
neighbors came just weeks after the confrontation cooled down in

Millennium Young People's Congress in Hawaii in October.
</P>
<P>

Agency that the youth would be accompanied by poet Albert Nyathi's
renowned dance group Ibongi.
</P>
<P>
He said Ibongi was the only group selected from Africa to
perform at the worldwide youth congress.
</P>
<P>
The delegation from Zimbabwe would be made up of 22 people
including the 12 youths and members of Ibongi.
</P>
<P>
The youths were selected by a steering committee in Britain
after sending their pictures, poems and other materials.
</P>
<P>
Peace Child Zimbabwe is an affiliate of Peace Child
International.
</P>
<P>
Kachingwe said, "The congress will discuss priorities for the
youth in the next century. It will be a platform for them to tell
the world what they want to see happening in the millennium."
</P>
<P>
He said the materials from Zimbabwe had been rated of the
highest quality by the selection committee in London.
</P>
<P>
Before the selection, the youth organization had advertized in
newspapers and on radio, inviting people between 12 and 25 years
to send in their ideas for consideration.
</P>
<P>
The congress, funded by the United Nations, would be a
follow-up to the Rio Earth Summit Agenda 21 where world leaders
agreed to priorities issues affecting the youth.
</P>
<P>
Kachingwe said the congress would give Zimbabwean youth an
insight into other youths' vision for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
He said the youths would compile a book containing resolutions
of the congress to be presented to world leaders.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign Minister
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma Sunday poured cold water on the notion of
freedom of movement within the Southern African Development
Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
addressing reporters in Maputo, Zuma, who also chairs the SADC
council of ministers, said that "freedom of movement does not take
place overnight."
</P>
<P>
"It's an on-going discussion and an aim toward which SADC is
working," she said, adding that "talking about an object doesn't
mean it must happen today."
</P>
<P>
The South African minister said this in response to a question
raised by the Mozambican News Agency (AIM) in the context of
recent repatriations of Mozambicans from three other SADC members
namely South Africa, Zimbabwe and Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
She said that the ministers have adopted two draft protocols,
one on wildlife conservation and law enforcement, the other on
health, as well as a declaration on productivity.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will submit to the Wednesday summit for
signatures of these two protocols.
</P>
<P>
So far, nine protocols on immunities and privileges, shared
watercourse systems, transport communications and meteorology,
energy, combating illicit drug trafficking, trade, education and
training, mining and tourism, have been signed by member states,
according to SADC executive secretary Kaire Mbuende.
</P>
<P>
Zuma was optimistic as the crucial trade protocol aiming to
achieve a free trade area in the southern Africa has been ratified
by six SADC member states. They are Botswana, Malawi, Mauritius,
Namibia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
But three more states are needed to ratify the trade protocol
to enable it to come into force.
</P>
<P>
The South African Foreign Minister was confident that more SADC
members would sign by the end of the year and the tax reduction
would begin in next January as scheduled.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Naval Force was
joined on Sunday by four new warships, the first batch of
eight vessels Kuwait bought from France.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Salem
Al-Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, who inaugurated the ceremony, said
the gunships would "add a new shield to preserve the
security and stability of Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
The official Kuwait News Agency quoted Salem as saying that
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 had severely destroyed
the naval force, but "it did not stop Kuwait from rebuilding
its military installations."
</P>
<P>
It is in the interest of Kuwait to "always seek sophisticated
and top quality weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
The four warships left France early last month and during
the journey took part in war games held with Tunisian naval
forces.
</P>
<P>
Commander of Kuwait's Naval Force, Rear-Admiral Ahmad Al-Mulla,
 said the 45-day journey and the war games were a good experience
for the crew.

Al-Mulla said the second batch of the French-made vessels

<P>
MOSCOW, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin reiterated Sunday that there is no need to impose
an emergency rule in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"No internal political conditions call for introducing a state
of emergency in the Russian territory," Putin told the Vesti
television program.
</P>
<P>
"A special rule might be introduced" in the fighting zone in
North Caucasus, he said. "The local authorities have clearly
ceased to function there."
</P>

Russia's federal and local troops are fighting Islamic
militants that seized several villages over a week ago in
Daghestan, a republic bordering the breakaway Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In Chechnya itself, President Aslan Maskhadov has decided to
impose a 30-day state of emergency starting Monday, in an apparent
response to Putin's earlier indication that the campaign against
the militants might be extended to inside Chechnya.
</P>

"We will resolve the (Dagestani) problem without any emergency
steps," Putin said, adding that the militants "would either be
eliminated or ousted from Dagestan."

JERUSALEM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Consumer Price Index
(CPI) rose 0.3 percent in July to stand at 105.1 points, a little
higher than projected, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The CPI has risen 6.3 percent since July last year.
</P>
<P>
During the first seven months of this year, the sectors that saw
index increase are health by 3.7 percent, education and culture by
2.6 percent, and foodstuffs by 1.6 percent, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The housing sector saw its index up by 1.5 percent in July,
contributing 0.3 percent to the general CPI, reflecting a revival
in the housing market, the figure showed.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate for this year was targeted at 4 percent and
the new government under Prime Minister Ehud Barak last week set
an annual inflation target of 3 to 4 percent for the year 2000
and 2001.
</P>
<P>
Economists here said Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel is
unlikely to reduce interest rates further this month because he
has insisted on his tight financial policy in order to keep a low
inflation rate.

The interest rate stands at 11 percent after being cut twice
this year.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explosion in Israel Suspected of Being </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police began an
investigation Sunday into a bomb explosion in the northern
coastal city of Netanya which they suspected to be a foiled major
terror attack, Israel television reports said.
</P>
<P>
Before the bomb exploded outside an office building in the
morning, the police spotted two men carrying suspicious packages,
the reports said. The men headed into downtown before police
could question them.
</P>
<P>
Security officials were quoted as saying that the suspects
might have intended to conduct the explosion in heavy traffic
areas but had to dump the bomb after realizing that they had been
spotted.
</P>
<P>
No casualties and only light property damage were caused by the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security facilities have warned that there might be an
increase in militant attacks since Israel and the Palestinians
are resuming the peace process stalled under former Israeli
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, which is opposed to
the Israeli-Palestinian peace making, has said that it will
resume militant attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has carried out several major suicide bombings in Israel
since 1993, when the historic Oslo accords between Israel and the
Palestinians were signed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Police Chief Yehuda Wilk said last week that Israeli
security forces foiled several attack attempts in the last few
months.
</P>
<P>
A 23-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank town of Bethlehem
rammed his car twice into a group of Israeli soldiers last Tuesday
at an intersection about 30 miles southwest of Jerusalem, injuring
seven before being shot to death by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
But the new Israeli government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) have taken careful
steps to prevent the peacemaking from being derailed by the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Barak's envoy Gilad Sher and senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat met Sunday afternoon on the Palestinian side of the
Erez border crossing to continue their efforts to resolve the
differences over the timetable of implementation of the Wye
Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
The two had failed to achieve a breakthrough in their previous
meetings held in Jerusalem Wednesday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office on July 6, Barak has promised to carry out
the Wye agreement, signed and then frozen by his hard-line
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu last year, but proposed some
changes to the accord, under which Israel has to hand over 13
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have reluctantly accepted his proposal to
begin implementation of the agreement at the beginning of
September and carry out the second stage of troop withdrawal on
October 1.
</P>
<P>
Barak told a cabinet meeting Sunday that he had ordered the
Israeli army to prepare for the Wye implementation.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides have been at odds over Barak's proposal to
postpone the final stage of the agreement until February 2000,
when the final-status talks dealing with thorny issues like
Jerusalem and settlements are supposed to have been well under way.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have turned down the idea, calling on Barak
to complete the implementation of the final stage by mid-November
in line with the original timetable of the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
Barak said Sunday that he hoped the two sides would iron out
their differences on the timetable within 10 days, before
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright starts a visit to the
region.
</P>
<P>
Albright had originally scheduled her visit for mid-August,
which would have started Sunday, with an aim of ensuring the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations are on the track and
trying to restart the frozen Israeli-Syrian talks.
</P>
<P>
But she postponed the visit by two weeks at the request of
Barak, who wants Washington to give him more time to resolve his
difference with Arafat by themselves.

AMMAN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein Sunday called on the Arab League to enhance its role as an
international organization to safeguard Arab interests in
regional and world affairs.

He made the appeal during his meeting with visiting Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid who arrived in Amman
earlier in the day to attend the opening ceremony of the ninth

<P>
Some 4,600 athletes from 21 Arab countries will take part in
the two-week event, the largest sports gathering of Arab
countries in the modern history.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is expected to send a delegation headed by a minister
to the opening ceremony, but its athletes will boycott the games
to protest the participation of their Iraqi counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Jordan had failed to persuade Kuwait to send its athletes to
the games which Amman hoped to use as a showcase for Arab
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kuwait and Iraq remained soured since the
1990 Gulf crisis which was triggered by the invasion of the tiny
gulf emirate by Iraqi troops.

<HEADLINE> 29 Massacred in Southern Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-nine people were massacred
assumably by Islamic militants in southern Algeria Saturday night,
according to reports from Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Algerian security services said that the massacre, the
deadliest since President Abdelaziz Bouteflika took office in
April, took place in a village called Beni Ounif located in the
region of Bechar, 750 kilometers southwest of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers and rescuers were dispatched to the scene of the
killings to help the families of the killed and the injured, said
the Algerian authorities.
</P>
<P>
The killings also raised fear that massacres could resume in
Algeria after an half-year relative peace.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the southern area of Algeria, where the newest
massacres took place, was relatively free from violence during the
war between government forces and Islamic militants which was
concentrated in the east and west parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic attacks against both military personnel and civilians
by Islamists have been resuming for several weeks, after President
Bouterflika announced on August 1 that the nation will hold a
referendum on adopting a "civil concord law" on September 16.
</P>
<P>
At least 17 Algerian soldiers were killed in the past one week
in several attacks attributed to Islamists in Kabylie, east
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian army began last Thursday a major offensive against
the Islamic guerrillas in Kabylie, a mountainous region inhabited
by the minority Berbers.
</P>
<P>
Two most radical Islamic groups of Algeria, the Salafist Group
for the Prediction and Combat (GSPC) and the Armed Islamic Group
(GIA), have rejected the proposal by the government on national
reconciliation after an estimated 100,000 were killed in seven
years of war since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Another armed Islamic group, the Islamic Salvation Army, has
accepted the government proposal, which includes the pardoning of
Islamists except those who have committed killings, attacks which
have handicapped people permanently, and rapes.

<HEADLINE> 3 Iraqi Civilians Injured in U.S. Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Three Iraqi civilians were
injured in U.S.-British warplanes' attacks on a mosque
in northern Iraq on Sunday, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:15 (0615 GMT) nine formations
of enemy warplanes coming from Turkish airspace violated northern
Iraqi airspace over Dohuk, Neineva and Erbil provinces.
</P>
<P>
These warplanes attacked a mosque near Saddam Dam in Neineva
province, leading to the destruction of the mosque and injuries
of three civilians, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back
at the enemy planes and repulsed them to their base in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said that at 11:00 (0700 GMT) 10 formations of U.S.
and British warplanes coming from the Saudi and Kuwaiti bases
violated southern Iraqi airspace over Basra, Thi-Qar, Muthana and
Misan provinces.
</P>
<P>
These enemy warplanes bombed some civilian installations in
the region, he said, adding that Iraqi anti-aircraft units
repulsed the enemy planes.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have made 11,375 sorties over the two no-fly
zones in Iraq, and have been regularly attacking Iraqi civilian
facilities and military sites.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led
western allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed
aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite
Muslims in the south from attacks by Iraqi government troops.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Prolonged Angolan Civil War (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Angola civil war will be
among the topics to dominate the political agenda at the annual
Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit in Maputo
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is shocking, but true, that some Angolans have never known
peace in their country.
</P>
<P>
The civil war has been going on since 1975 immediately after
the country gained independence from Portugal, and a set of
international factors have sustained the conflict ever since.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, Angola became the battlefield of the cold war
between the United States on the one side and the Soviet-Cuban
alliance on the other.
</P>
<P>
A semblance of hope came in the early 1990s when Angolans,
including the rebels, went to the polls.
</P>
<P>
However, hope was soon dashed when the National Union for Total
 Independence of Angola (UNITA) resumed fighting after losing the
election.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the U.N. has imposed sanctions on the UNITA,
including prohibition of its trade in diamonds, the sale of
petroleum products and arms to the rebel movement, and freezing
UNITA's assets abroad. The sanctions also banned foreign travel by
UNITA officials and adult members of their families.
</P>
<P>
A peace agreement known as the Lusaka accord, was cobbled
together in 1994. The U.N. and three world powers, Portugal, the
former colonizer, the U.S. and Russia, acted as guarantors of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent to the peace deal, the UNITA was recognized as a
political party and its leader Jonas Savimbi obtained special
status with numerous rights and privileges.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA which controlled 335 cities before 1994 handed some
260 back to the control of the government in Luanda led by
President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
Though a unity government was formed, with several UNITA-led
ministries, parliamentary deputies and ambassadorships, Savimbi
never returned to Luanda to take up his position as the opposition
leader, citing security concerns as the reasons.
</P>
<P>
A group of UNITA ministers and parliamentarians formed a
splinter movement for renewal, the Renovation Commission of the
UNITA in September 1998. And later the Angolan government declared
Savimbi to be a criminal and said it would only negotiate with
the renewal UNITA. But Savimbi was still very much in control of
the rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
At the last SADC summit in Mauritius last September, regional
leaders declared UNITA chief Jonas Savimbi as "a war criminal" to
be hunted down.
</P>
<P>
A full-blown civil war renewed in the southern African
countries when the government troops and the UNITA forces were
involved in fierce fightings in central highlands in December last
year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Presidents Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Sam
Nujoma of Namibia and Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) met in Luanda and formed an alliance with Dos Santos
against the UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state resolved to use "all possible measures" to
help Dos Santos's government.
</P>
<P>
However, so far, "all possible measures" has excluded
Zimbabwean and Namibian military involvement because they already
have thousands of troops in the Congo, propping up Kabila's
regime, and the troops are unlikely to be home before Christmas if
everything goes well after the cease-fire pact was signed in
Zambia on July 10. Considering the U.N. as a shield for the
rebellious movement, the Angolan government demanded a pull-out of
the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) last January, When the
government troops encountered some setbacks in battlefields in the
central provinces of Huambo and Bie. The U.N. mission formally
pulled out from the war-torn country on March 1 this year.

<HEADLINE> Barak Foresees Deal Within 10 Days over Wye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Sunday he is hopeful that Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators will reach an agreement in 10 days on the way of
implementing the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
"There is some kind of chance during the next 10 days that
some kind of agreement will be formulated on the manners in which
the Wye accord will be implemented," Israel Radio quoted Barak as
telling a weekly cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Barak's envoy Gilad Sher and senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat resumed their talks Sunday afternoon on the Palestinian
side of the Erez border crossing to resolve differences on the
timetable for the Wye implementation.
</P>
<P>
The two had met Wednesday and Saturday in Jerusalem, but to little
avail.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office early last month, Barak has promised to
implement the Wye accord signed and then frozen by his hard-line
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu last year, but he also proposed
some changes to the implementation of the agreement, which calls
on Israel to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians in three stages.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have reluctantly accepted his proposal to
restart the timetable of the Wye agreement on September 1 and
begin to carry out the second stage of troop withdrawal on October
1.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu carried out the first stage late last year before
halting the agreement.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides have been at odds over Barak's suggestion to
postpone the implementation of the third stage of troop withdrawal
until February 2000, when the final-status talks dealing with
thorny issues like Jerusalem and Jewish settlements are supposed
to have been well under way.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand that the third stage be carried out by
mid-November in line with the original timetable of Wye.
</P>
<P>
Barak reported to the cabinet meeting that he has instructed
the army to begin preparations for resuming implementation of the
Wye accord on September 1 and carrying out the second stage of
troop withdrawal on October 1, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio reported earlier that Barak and Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat will hold a summit meeting this
week if the negotiators reach agreement on a timetable. However,
the Palestinians have denied that such a summit has been
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Barak proposed the 10-day time limit
for the negotiations because he wanted to iron out his differences
with Arafat before a planned visit to the region by U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Albright originally scheduled her visit in mid-August, which
would have started Sunday, with an aim of ensuring the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are on the track and restarting
the frozen negotiations between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
But she has postponed the visit by two weeks at the request of
Barak, who wants Washington to play a less direct role in the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.

<TEXT>
<P>
Dos Santos sacked the UNITA members of government as part of
his frustration with its's continued violation of the peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA has consistently called for fresh negotiations with
the Angolan government, which Luanda has rejected.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda said recently that
Savimbi "has never accepted the implementation of any accord."
</P>
<P>
In any event, the Angolan government has no intention of
resuming talks with Savimbi, suspecting whether he would accept
them at a time when the rebel leader is "committed to seizing
power by force of arms."
</P>
<P>
Recently, the U.N. committee overseeing the enforcement of
sanctions against the UNITA has enlisted the cooperation of a
broad coalition of interests, including the global diamond
industry, to enforce the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the committee, Robert Fowler, assured that the goal
in such broad diplomatic effort is to ensure that the UNITA goes
back to dialog in peacefully resolving the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Ambassador to the United Nations, Afonso Van Dunem said
early this month that his government has made a "positive
endorsement" for the U. N. presence in the southwest African
country.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador announced that the Angolan government delivered
a letter Wednesday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
"expressly notifying the decision of the government."
</P>
<P>
The ambassador stressed that the Angolan government has been
in favor of a "not so big" U.N. presence, in correspondence with
the reality of the situation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. expressed a will to maintain a mediatory
organization in Angola.
</P>
<P>
But the Angolan government insisted that this kind of agency
should be established in New York, where the U.N. is
headquartered.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique and Zambia have been accused of transporting arms to
the UNITA rebels, which both nations denied. Angola's accusation
has somehow soured the relations between Luanda and Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi denied that
Mozambique's northern port of Nacala is being used for clandestine
military supplies to Angolan rebel movement UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi declined to comment on the arrest warrant the Angolan
authorities have issued for Savimbi, nor on possible attempts to
send troops from other SADC countries to assist the embattled
Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
"Mozambique supports all efforts to allow Angola to regain
peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
report on 1999 human development index of 174 countries in the
world, Angola ranks 160th, down from the 157th position last
year, largely due to the ravaging civil war.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Minister of Assistance and Resettlement Albino Muisngo
said that the country is in need of about 200 million u.s. dollars
in humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan currency readjusted kwanza depreciated from 196,916
to one U. S. dollar in September, 1997 to 257,128 to one dollar.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program estimated that Angola needs 13,000 tons
of food aid per month to feed its nearly two million displaced
people.
</P>
<P>
Due to the ravaging civil war, the government's anti-polio
campaign could not be effectively carried out. If the war is not
stopped soon, the southwestern african country will be unable to
meet the world health organization's target of wiping out the
childhood disease by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Angola as well as the whole southern Africa can ill-afford the
lingering conflicts and insecurity in the region.
</P>
<P>
The regional leaders to gather in Maputo Wednesday are expected
to act in the spirit of true African solidarity to further their
efforts to abandon destructive wars in the region.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the Angolan crisis will not be
resolved militarily but diplomatically through peaceful and
political means, though the leaders at the Maputo summit will
probably reinforce their support for a peace agreement in Angola
with the threat of resorting to military force to help Luanda.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Become Sugar Exporter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia will export sugar
in 1999/ 2000 for the first time, the state-owned Sugar Industry
Support Center announced.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is planning to export up to 100,000 tons of sugar to
the world market in 1999/2000 and earn around 22 million U.S.
dollars in foreign currency, Shewaferaw Girma of the center said
early this week.
</P>
<P>
The export were made possible by the opening earlier this year
of the country's 4th sugar factory at Finchaa in western Ethiopia,
Shewaferaw said.
</P>
<P>
The latest built sugar factory was designed to produce 85,000
tons of sugar a year.
</P>
<P>
According to Shewaferaw, Ethiopia will produce around 275,000
tons of sugar in the coming season from 23,500 hectares of
irrigated cane-field.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is one of the lowest levels of per capita sugar
consumption in the world, at just 3.5 kgs per head per year,
against an average of 20 kgs per head in sub-Saharan Africa,
government figures show.
</P>
<P>
The start of sugar exports is expected to help to diversify
Ethiopia's economy away from its dependence on coffee, which
curently accounts for around 60 percent of foreign currency
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia did not get acquaintance with sugar until the Italians
intruded the country from 1936 to 1941. Before sugar was
introduced, Ethiopians drank sugarless coffee or even spiced it
with a pinch of salt.

<HEADLINE> Omagh Residents Mark Anniversary of Deadliest Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of residents of Omagh
gathered on Sunday to mark the first anniversary of Northern
Ireland's deadliest bombing which claimed 29 lives.
</P>
<P>
A mid-afternoon ceremony took place on the high street of this
little market town, about 75 kilometers west of the Northern
Ireland capital Belfast,and participants observed a minute's
silence at the exact moment when the bomb exploded one year ago.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo Mowlam and Irish
Minister Liz O'Donnell also attended the service as government
representatives.
</P>
<P>
On August 15, 1998, a car bomb ripped through the main shopping
street of this town, killing 29 people and injuring more than 300
others. Republican splinter group, the Real Irish Republican Army
(IRA) claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Omagh bomb highlighted the horror of a 30-year conflict and
the more than 3,600 violent deaths at the hands of armed
Protestant and Catholic groups at odds over the future of British
rule.
</P>
<P>
The Omagh anniversary took place against a background of
tension elsewhere in Northern Ireland. Catholic youths clashed
with police in the center of Northern Ireland's second largest
city of Londonderry overnight following a march by the Protestant
Apprentice Boys.
</P>
<P>
In a message of sympathy to the bereaved, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair said: "the whole community in Northern Ireland
and indeed, across the world, has felt moved to reach out to those
affected by the bombing in Omagh.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said the British and Irish
governments would work together "to bring about a situation where
no other family in these islands or further afield experiences the
grief and loss which you have suffered".

<HEADLINE> SADC Ministers Adopt Draft Protocols on Wildlife, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The ministers of the 14-member
Southern African Development Community (SADC) have adopted two
draft protocols, one on wildlife conservation and law enforcement
and the other on health, as well as a declaration on productivity.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will submit the two draft protocols for
signatures of the heads of state or government at the Wednesday
summit, Chairperson of the SADC Council of Ministers and South
African Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said at a briefing
in Maputo Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The draft on wildlife conservation and law enforcement is aimed
at establishing within the region and within the framework of the
respective national laws of each member state, common approaches
to the conservation and sustainable use of wildlife resources and
to assist with effective enforcement of the laws governing those
resources.
</P>
<P>
"A protocol on health could not have come at a better time"
when there are so many challenges in health sector in the region,
among which AIDS is on top of the list, she said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers discussed how to better use the health resources
to make a healthier population in the region, she added.
</P>
<P>
A health population is critical for sustainable human
development and increased productivity in southern Africa which
continues to have high HIV prevalence rate.
</P>
<P>
The draft protocol on health encourages cooperation among
member states in addressing health problems and challenges facing
them.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said that the declaration on productivity called on member
states to adopt more rational national and regional policies that
will improve productivity to make the region more productive and
more competitive.
</P>
<P>
The chairperson of the council said that the well represented
meeting also addressed such issues as food situation, debt, trade
and investment, y2k preparedness and etc. enditem

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambian Secessionist Leader Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Secessionist Barotse Patriotic
Front (BPF) leader Imasiku Mutangelwa has been arrested for
backing the recent armed uprising by Namibian secessionist
guerrillas seeking autonomy of the Caprivi Strip.
</P>
<P>
Mutangelwa was arrested on Friday night by Zambian police after
he tried to sneak out of the residence of South African ambassador
to Zambia Walter Thabethe, where he went on August 5 to seek
political asylum.
</P>
<P>
Security agents who had cordoned off the residence fired four
warning shots before a speeding vehicle he was aboard leaving the
residence, stopped.
</P>
<P>
He left the residence after an apparent rejection by the South
African government of his application for the political asylum.
</P>
<P>
Mutangelwa eluded a police dragnet for questioning and went to
the residence on the night of August 5 after he was served with an
order to report to police following his statement that Lozis
(people of a local clan) in Zambia were moving to Namibia to join
their colleagues who were fighting for self rule in the Caprivi
Strip, a finger of land wedged between Zambia and Angola to the
north and Botswana to the south.
</P>
<P>
After Mutangelwa went to the residence, Zambian Home Affairs
Minister Peter Machungwa and Foreign Minister Keli Walubita
pursued the matter with the South African government.
</P>
<P>
The South African ambassador said, "the position of my
government is that we have not given him political asylum, anyway
the Vienna convention does not allow for diplomatic missions to be
used for political asylum."
</P>
<P>
Machungwa confirmed that the BPF leader was being held in
police custody for the seditious statement he made over the
Caprivi problem.
</P>
<P>
He said, the "government will not sit back and take conditions
from people who commit crimes which may be treasonable, they
should not expect other countries in the region to keep them.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Information Minister Newstead Zimba described the BPF
leader as a joker who is unable to stand by his own lies.
</P>
<P>
Zimba said Mutangelwa's asylum-seeking was meant to win cheap
popularity. This would not work as people would soon realize
Mutangelwa was not a serious person.
</P>

On August 3 the Namibian secessionist guerrillas attacked the
Macha military base in Katima mulilo and overran the offices of
the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation in the Kaprivi Strip,
leaving five rebels, five policemen and three soldiers dead.
</P>
<P>
One day After the uprising Mutangelwa claimed Lozis in Zambia's
Western province have started crossing into Caprivi Strip to help
their kinsmen fight for secession from the Namibian government.
</P>
<P>
He said time for action and not words had come.
</P>
<P>
He warned the Zambian government to take a leaf from what was
happening in Caprivi.
</P>
<P>
"The Lozis in the two countries have for a long time now urged
the two governments to restore their autonomy," Mutangelwa said.
</P>
<P>
He called on all Lozis world-wide to contribute materially to
the cause of the Caprivi secessionists.
</P>
<P>
BPF has been in the past years striving for the breakaway of
Western province or former Barotseland, from Zambia's central
government.
</P>
<P>
Barotseland was a half-independent protectorate under the
british colonial rule before it became part of Zambia when the
country won its independence from Britain in 1964.

<HEADLINE> Military Intervention in Angola not Mentioned at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SADC Meeting
</P>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign Minister
Nkosazan Zuma said here Sunday that Angola did not mention the
issue of military intervention in its civil war at the meeting of
the Council of Ministers of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Angola did not raise the matter during the meeting on Friday
and Saturday, Zuma who also chairs the council told a press
briefing on the proceedings of the ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Angola might take the chance of the SADC
meeting to request its SADC neighbors for military intervention in
 its 24-year civil war with the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebels.
</P>
<P>
Zuma also said she knew nothing about the alleged European
Union's pressure on the SADC to force the Angolan government to
opt a negotiated rather than a military solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Media in Mozambique carried stories doubting that the ravaging
war in Angola could be stopped at the SADC summit in Maputo
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It takes a long time to bring an end to a prolonged war.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe was also said to be pressuring South Africa and other
 countries in the region to agree to use military force to make
peace efforts in Angola as it did in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Presidents Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Sam
Nujoma of Namibia and Laurent Kabila of the Congo met in Luanda
and formed an alliance with their Angolan counterpart Jose Eduardo
Dos Santos against the UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state resolved to use "all possible measures" to
help Dos Santo's government.
</P>
<P>
However, "all possible measures" have excluded Zimbabwean and
Namibian military involvement because they already have thousands
of troops in the Congo and the troops there are unlikely to be
home for Christmas as expected.
</P>
<P>
All indications show that South Africa is understandably
reluctant to fall into any kind of regional entrapment.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has sent liaison officers to the Congo only after
a cease- fire was reached by the six countries directly involved
in the Congo conflicts and a small number of officers were
supposed to gather information for peace-keeping mission.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the leaders in southern Africa are committed to acting
in solidarity and resolving conflicts in the region.
</P>
<P>
At the Wednesday summit, they are expected to review the
situation in Angola and play their due role in pursuing peace and
security in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday reported progress made by the United Nations
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), but
efforts are under way to build confidence in the region.
</P>
<P>
In his written report to the Security Council, Annan said,
"The resumption of the identification operation and the
initiation of the appeals process, as well as the publication of
the first part of the provisional voters list, have been
achieved."
</P>
<P>
At present, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR) and MINURSO are taking steps to prepare for the
repatriation of refugees in cooperation with parties concerned,
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"It is now important that confidence-building measures be
implemented promptly through the establishment of communication
facilities and visits," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, it should be recognized that delays in
solving certain issues in the identification operation, the
staggered opening of the appeals centers, compounded by
difficulties in meeting the staff requirements, have affected
parties of the timetable for the referendum process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the shortage of staff which had necessitated the
staggered opening of the appeals centers, and of the persisting
problems in connection with the identification operations, the
Identification Commission decided, with the agreement of the
parties, to deploy all available staff to the appeals process and
to suspend identification operations for three weeks, starting
from August 2," he said.
</P>
<P>
By August 9, the military component of MINURSO stood at 230
military observers and other personnel. "Under the commend of
Major General Bernd S. Lubenik of Austria, the component continued
to monitor the ceasefire between the Royal Moroccan Army and the
Frente POLISARIO forces, which remains calm and there have been no
indications that either side intends to resume hostilities in the
near future," he said.

PHNOM PENH, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A nine-member team was
appointed by the Royal Government of Cambodia Monday to work out
the way to try former Khmer Rouge leaders with foreign legal
experts.
</P>
<P>
The decision to set up the special team was signed by Prime
Minister Hun Sen, the government said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The team includes Sok An, minister of the Council of Ministers,
Justice Minister Uk Vithun, and Om Yintieng, chairman of the
Cambodian Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
Three foreign experts are expected to arrive in Cambodia on
August 25 to help prepare the way for a trial of former Khmer
Rouge leaders.
</P>

Cambodia agreed to establish a tribunal with the international
participation, but rejected a United Nation's proposal that it
appoint a majority of judges for a local tribunal to try former
Khmer Rouge leaders for genocide.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Hor Nam Hong insisted that "based on the
principle of sovereignty, and because this is a Cambodian court,
Cambodia must hold a majority."

According to a new law passed on August 11, detained former
Khmer Rouge military leader Ta Mok and prison warden Kaing Khek
Ieu, Known as "Duch," will be on trial for genocide.

<HEADLINE> EDS-With Details China Reveals Misuse of 117.4 Billion Yuan (With Details) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- China's audit departments have
found 117.4 billion yuan of money misused under the financial law,
and saved 15.3 billion yuan for the country in the first half of
this year, according to the country's top auditor.
</P>
<P>
Li Jinhua, auditor-general of China's National Audit Office,
told an ongoing national auditing meeting here today that the
audit departments also sent 297 cases of suspected economic crimes
to judicial departments, and assisted them in 317 such cases
during the first six months this year.
</P>
<P>
From October of last year to April of this year, the National
Audit Office audited the Finance Ministry's implementation of the
Central Government's budget, and found a delay in its work on the
budget, and a failure to put financial revenues into the national
treasury.
</P>
<P>
It then audited 15 provincial taxation administrations, and
found they had exceeded their power to reduce and relieve taxes,
and had allowed tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
During its audit of 18 Customs departments, it was revealed
that these departments reduced tariff rates in violation of State
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The National Audit Office also audited 18 provincial treasuries,
and found they had engaged in loose auditing practices regarding
revenues, and pocketed Central Government revenues into their own
accounts.
</P>
<P>
Notably, during its audit of 54 departments directly under the
State Council, it found many cases of the misuse of funds for
special projects, and failures to allocate money to designated
projects.
</P>
<P>
It also discovered that Tianjin's Jixian County Taxation Bureau
created fake invoices on value-added taxes, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Water Resources was found to have illegally
collect money to build luxury office buildings, and embezzled the
funds of water projects for other uses.
</P>
<P>
According to the top auditor, thus far the National Audit
Office has completed auditing 10 of the 14 cases specified by the
Central Government. It has also assisted related departments in
dealing with a bribery case involving major smuggling activities
in the city of Zhanjiang in south China's Guangdong Province.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Delegation Visit Somalia on Fact-finding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A 5-member high-level
delegation led by Madame Faiza Abu-Nagha, under-secretary for the
foreign affairs of Egypt, has been touring in Somalia in the past
five days.
</P>
<P>
The delegation did not meet the opposing factions of the
capital during their two-day stay in Mogadishu, but met with the
senior officials from the faction led by Hussein Mohamed Aidid
and clan elders from the Habar Gidir clan of Hussein Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Before departing Monday, the delegation was also made to see
the headquarters of the collapsed administration of Mogadishu,
the closed air and sea ports, the main jail and several pre-swept
streets.
</P>
<P>
Commenting about her short experience in Mogadishu, Faiza said
all the money donated to the administration of Mogadishu was put
in decorating buildings instead of the peace promotion efforts
needed for the effectiveness of the administration.
</P>
<P>
However, she acknowledged that the abolished green lines that
divided Mogadishu are among the fruits of the Egyptian sponsored
agreement in Cairo in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Nothing much is known about the actual scope of the unforeseen
visit. However, during a diner party Sunday night in Sahafi Hotel
in South Mogadishu, the delegation said Egypt is all the time
ready to help the Somalis and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
One of Hussein Aidid's officials told Xinhua after the
delegation departed Monday that the delegation was partially a
fact-finding mission. The official who did not want to be named
said the delegation was trying to collect data for a report the
Egyptian government wants to submit before the Security Council
of the United Nations in September.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Detente Policy Serves National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Monday pledged to stick to the detente policy, saying it
best serves the country's security and interests.
</P>
<P>
Addressing heads of Iran's representative missions abroad,
Khatami said the policy is "based on guaranteeing, strengthening,
improving and stabilizing national security and interests."
</P>
<P>
A moderate cleric, Khatami was swept to power by overwhelming
popular support in the presidential election two years ago. He has
since been trying to ease tension with other countries, including
the United States, by proposing dialogs among civilizations.
</P>
<P>
This policy effectively broke Iran's isolation in the
world.
</P>
<P>
"By raising the idea of dialog among civilizations," the
president said, "Iran has invited the world to peace based on
justice, equality and elimination of force from international
relations."
</P>
<P>
"Detente does not mean being ignorant of threats," he was
quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency as
explaining, "rather it is aimed at identifying the borders of
enmity, strengthening friendships and commonalties and being aware
of threats."
</P>
<P>
He told the diplomats that a dialog among civilizations has
been an effort to improve ongoing relations at the global level.
</P>
<P>
On Iran's relations with neighbors in the Gulf, Khatami said
"Security in the Persian Gulf is in the interest of all. "
</P>
<P>
"We should maintain our vigilance and adopt wise methods in
order to confront temptations to foment tension and spark clashes
in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran's policy of detente will succeed if the people
enjoy better living standard.
</P>
<P>
Khatami asked the diplomats to make more efforts to influence
the world opinion and to remove the "horrible" distortion of Iran
by its enemies, mainly the U.S. and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran's foreign policy should be in tune with what is
going on within the country, adding Iran is in need of stability,
sework of law.

Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said that the NDA would try
to evolve a consensus with other parties and implement the
proposal "at the earliest."
</P>
<P>
In a sharp reaction to the NDA agenda, a Congress spokesman
said it showed that the alliance was "afraid" of Sonia Gandhi and
had lost hopes of winning the elections.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 S. African Telecom Workers on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- About 10,000 workers with
South Africa's Telecom company, Telkom, had heeded calls for a
pay-related strike Monday, affecting call centers for services
such as fault repairs.
</P>
<P>
Only between 20 and 30 percent of staff at these centers turned
up for work, Telkom spokeswoman Amanda Singleton told reporters at
Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
She said members of management and non-striking employees were
being used to staff call centers, which also handle account
inquiries and orders for new telephones.
</P>
<P>
Other services affected related to the installation of new
telephones, and fault repairs.
</P>
<P>
Telephone and Internet services would only be disrupted in the
event of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect such acts as the unions have shown extreme
responsibility in their industrial action," Singleton said.
</P>
<P>
Monday's strike was organized by the Communication Workers'
Union (CWU), which claims to represent about 26,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
Telkom has 59,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
Singleton said the union was insisting on an effective pay rise
of 24.5 percent in response to Telkom's offer of 8.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Telkom's pay offer entailed a five-percent rise across the
board, a two- percent performance-based increase and a 1.1-percent
gain sharing bonus.
</P>
<P>
Singleton said Telkom was one of the best-paying employers in
the country, with a lucrative benefit package. The total income of
the lowest- paid workers was about 4,000 rand (656 U.S. dollars) a
month.
</P>
<P>
Three other unions, acting together in the Alliance of Telkom
Unions (ATU), also intended embarking on a strike but still had to
serve the company with a proper notice in terms of the Labor
Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
They want an eight-percent increase in addition to a
two-percent performance-based rise and a 1.1-percent gain sharing
bonus.
</P>
<P>
The ATU, which claims a combined membership of 17,000,
comprises the Mineworkers' Union, the South African Communication
Workers' Union, and the Post and Telecommunications Union.

<HEADLINE> China, UNICEF Plan for New Five-Year Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- China and the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) are planning for a new five-year round of
cooperation which will focus on fields including child abduction,
the protection of girls' rights, and the prevention of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(MOFTEC) is the major working partner of UNICEF in China, and
together with other relevant governmental departments, the two
organizations will meet in Beijing next week to draft a plan for
cooperation for the years 2001-2005.
</P>
<P>
"Our plan may attach greater importance to the protection of
abducted children and street children, and to health and education
issues among the children of migrant people in cities," said Zhou
Bing, program officer of MOFTEC's Department of International
Trade and Economic Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The new programs will also focus on the protection of the
rights of girls, the prevention of HIV/AIDS, as well as more
effective fund-raising methods, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF and MOFTEC will stage a photo exhibition in Beijing
beginning this weekend to display the results of Sino-UNICEF
cooperation over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 million U.S. dollars of UNICEF funds have been
provided to China since the UN organization resumed relations with
China in 1979, most of which were used for health and nutrition,
basic education, women's and children's welfare, handicapped
children, social development in poor areas, and water supply and
environmental hygiene programs.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF's programs in China have become the largest in any
country, according to the organization's China office.
</P>
<P>
"Through this cooperation, children's affairs have become a
major part of the governmental agenda, and sustainable development
in program areas has been promoted," Zhou Bing said, adding that "
Also, many new ideas and methods, such as breast-feeding and the
use of iodized salt, have been widely accepted in China."

MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma, or lower
house of parliament, on Monday confirmed Vladimir Putin as the
country's new prime minister.

<P>
The State Duma voted 233-84 to approve the 46-year-old Putin as

<P>
He also said that Yeltsin had agreed most of ministers in the

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges Exact Israeli Implementation of Wye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat on Monday called on Israel
to exactly and honestly carry out the Wye peace accord signed last
October.
</P>
<P>
The PNA "is not asking for the impossible, only the exact and
honest (Israeli) implementation" of the Wye accord, Arafat told
reporters after a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
Alexandria, 220 kilometers northwest of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in the Mediterranean port city earlier in the
day to brief Mubarak on the latest developments of the peace talks
between the Palestinians and Israel, especially their negotiations
on the implementation of the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
He left Alexandria after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed frustration with the difficulties Israel has
put in the implementation of the Wye deal.
</P>
<P>
"(Israeli Prime Minister Ehud) Barak says he is committed to
implementing the agreement, but at meetings we find they put
difficulties like the time table," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Wye accord obliged Israel to pull back troops from
another 13.1 percent of the West Bank in three phases.
</P>
<P>
Former Israeli hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
suspended the implementation in December after the first
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Barak has pledged to carry out the accord and agreed to a
further 5 percent withdrawal beginning October 1.
</P>
<P>
But he calls for delaying the last pullback from 6 percent of
the West Bank until February 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have vehemently rejected the offer, and want
the pullout wrapped up by mid-November.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor to Egypt, keeps close consultations
with Mubarak, who as the president of the first Arab country to
sign a peace treaty with Israel, plays an active role in mediating
the Mideast peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Sergeyev: Russia to Broaden Ties With Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev told his Japanese counterpart here Monday that broadening
relations with Japan is one of Russia's foreign-policy priorities.
</P>
<P>
"We view Japan as an influential and responsible neighboring
power, and as our partner in the Asian and Pacific region and the
world as a whole," Sergeyev said at the beginning of his talks
with Japanese Defense Agency head Hosei Norota.
</P>
<P>
He said Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's visit to Russia
at the end of 1998 "opened a new chapter in the history of Russian-
Japanese relations."
</P>
<P>
"We are witnessing the emergence of creative partnership
between our countries" based on the Moscow Declaration signed by
the Russian and Japanese leaders on November 13, 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
Following their talks on Monday, Sergeyev and Norota are
expected to sign a memorandum concerning the principles of
broadening the dialogue between the Japanese Defense Agency and
the Russian Defense Ministry, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Quoting military sources, Interfax said the closed-door talks
between Sergeyev and Norota focused on the non-proliferation of
missile technology and weapons of mass destruction in Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Russia also wants Japan to clarify its position on a theater
missile defense system in the Asia-Pacific that Tokyo is building
together with the United States, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Norota, who arrived here Sunday on a five-day trip, will also
visit the Kantemirovskaya division based outside Moscow, and meet
the Pacific Fleet commanders in Vladivostok.

<HEADLINE> Tajikistan Blames Uzbekistan for Bombing </HEADLINE>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tajik Foreign Ministry on
Monday handed a note to Uzbek Ambassador Bakhtiyar Urdashev
protesting the alleged bombing of Tajik villages by Uzbek military
aircraft on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Four Uzbek military planes bombed the Tajik territory in the
vicinity of a Khait village along with villages Gushkaba and
Tandikul, said the Tajik Foreign Ministry's Information Department
chief, Igor Sattarov.
</P>
<P>
There were no human casualties in the bombing, but buildings
were destroyed and 111 heads of cattle were killed. Crops were
lost in a subsequent fire on several hectares, the Interfax news
agency quoted Sattarov as saying in Dushanbe, the Tajik capital.
</P>
<P>
Tajik Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov and Urdashev discussed
this "unprecedented fact" earlier on Monday, Sattarov said.
</P>
<P>
Nazarov expressed perplexity over "the absolutely unjustified
action of the Uzbek Air Force" and requested Tashkent to take
immediate steps to avert similar actions in the future. This
incident runs counter to the existing bilateral relations,
Sattarov said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Courts Launch Nationwide Media Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese courts across the
country have launched a week-long media campaign against local
interference in and resistance to the enforcement of court
rulings, the Supreme People's Court (SPC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Some local and departmental leaders have been found
illegally meddling in the enforcement of court orders to protect
their vested local and departmental economic interests.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of June this year, more than
850,000 court rulings were yet to be executed, involving over 259
billion yuan (about 31.2 billion U.S. dollars). Violence while
resisting the enforcement efforts of courts is also quite common
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Following the orders of the SPC, the Higher People's Courts of
the cities of Shanghai and Tianjin and Helongjiang and Sichuan
provinces have held press conferences to discuss the progress they
have made and the measures they have taken tackling law-
enforcement difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan also publicized the names of enterprises which have
refused to honor their debts, as ordered by the courts.
</P>
<P>
This past weekend, the heads of the Higher People's Courts in
Chongqing Municipality and Yunnan, Hebei, Henan, Zhejiang,
Helongjiang, and Shaanxi provinces, and the Guangxi Autonomous
Regions also took to the streets, together with judges, to provide
legal consultations and to further the propaganda drive.
</P>
<P>
An instant result was seen yesterday in Nanning, capital of
Guangxi, the SPC said, noting that eight debtors came to courts to
hand in their money.
</P>
<P>
Local courts will also take compulsory measures to have court
rulings executed, the SPC said.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Belgian Compensation Plans For Dioxin Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Monday it has approved Belgium's compensation plans for meat and
meat products owners who had suffered big losses since early June
because of the dioxin scare.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) executive said it has given green light
to three Belgium's state-aid schemes for compensation for dioxin
victims whose fresh meat and products from pork, beef and poultry
meat were seized and destroyed under the order of the competent
Belgian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the ceiling on this compensation is 80 percent
of the cost price, or the average market price currently in
Belgium "if the current market price is less than 80 percent of
the cost price."
</P>
<P>
"Where it proves impossible to arrive at a cost price, a flat-
rate payment will be introduced based on the average cost price
over a given period for meat products of a comparable kind," the
commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The owners will be asked to notify the amount for which their
fresh meat or meat products were covered by insurance. The insured
amount will then be deducted from any compensation due.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive also stressed that owners will lose all rights
to compensation if they have been guilty of irregularities or
actions punishable in law under legislation introduced to deal
with the dioxin crisis which led to the worst ever food scare in
Europe after World War II.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian government has so far allocated some six billion
Belgian francs (about 158 million U.S. dollars) from national
budget for the compensation schemes.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Lower House Approves Putin as New Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia's lower house of
parliament on Monday confirmed Vladimir Putin as the country's new
prime minister, the fifth in about 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The 450-seat State Duma approved Putin by a vote of 232-84.
Seventeen deputies abstained.
</P>
<P>
Putin, 46, replaces Sergei Stepashin, who was abruptly
dismissed by President Boris Yeltsin last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his program to the parliament, Putin put law and
order at the top of his priorities and said reviving Russia's
military might was also high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"None of the tasks can be carried out without installing
elementary order in the country, without strengthening the
executive vertical of power," he said in a terse speech to the
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The 13-minute speech was believed to be drawn along the lines
used by former Soviet and KGB leader Yuri Andropov, who, then
chief of the KGB, came to power in the Soviet Union in 1982 and
stayed at the Kremlin helm until his death in 1984.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Putin's speech-writers and Kremlin
insiders made the parallel intentional, hoping this would win
sympathy both from the opposition-dominated Duma and a population
tired of lawlessness and corruption in the past few years
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, in appointing Putin as the new prime minister, also
anointed him as his preferred successor in the Kremlin when his
term expires in the summer of next year.
</P>
<P>
"One of the main tasks is to secure calm and order in the
country and to ensure carrying out fair and honest (parliamentary
and presidential) elections," said Putin, who headed the Federal
Security Service, the main successor to the KGB, before being
nominated premier.
</P>
<P>
Many observers believe that Yeltsin's choice of Putin was
prompted by his desire to tip the balance in the Kremlin favor in
the Duma poll scheduled for December 19.
</P>
<P>
With the formation of an alliance between the "Fatherland"
party of Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and the "All Russia" movement
of some influential regional leaders earlier this month, current
trends show that opponents of Yeltsin are likely to win the poll.
</P>
<P>
Putin's predecessor, Stepashin, was believed to be fired for
appearing weak to counter the Kremlin woes, local analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy, Putin predicted no change, but called
diplomats should work better to defend Russia's national interests
as a world power.
</P>
<P>
"For centuries, Russia has been and remains a world power. It
has and retains zones of its rightful interests... and we cannot
allow our interests to be ignored," he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin also vowed to crush a separatist rebellion in the
southern republic of Dagestan by lawful means. A major campaign to
root out the Islamic militants in the several villages near the
breakaway Chechen republic has lasted for over a week and
authorities claimed Monday that over 400 rebels have been killed.

<HEADLINE> National Ethnic Games to Open on Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region will
celebrate its 40th anniversary of democratic reform with the sixth
national games of ethnic minorities to kick off here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sports gala, the showcase of traditional sports of minority
groups, is split between Lhasa and Beijing. The latter will stage
nine events of the total 13 next month.
</P>
<P>
The other four events with 25 golds on offer will be contested
here with 40 sports for exhibition. About 1,241 players and
coaches from 31 ethnic minorities will compete at the capital of
the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Tse Ren Dol Ka, chairman of the organizing committee, said that
the preparation for the games has been in full throttle with the
support from across the country and the Tibetan's enthusiasm to
host the games.

system of exploitation, and religion was separated from government.

<HEADLINE> S. African Public Servants Plan National Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's 12 public
sector unions, together representing more than 800,000 workers,
are preparing for a "historic" joint national strike on August 24.
</P>
<P>
A "joint action committee" of the unions is scheduled to meet
in Pretoria, the capital, Tuesday to plan the strike, a union
spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Members of the 12 unions, which represent all categories of
public servants from nurses, teachers and police officers to
administrative and auxiliary staff, will also take part in marches
through Pretoria, Cape Town and other cities on August 24.
</P>
<P>
Some unions said they would press ahead with low-intensity
industrial action such as go-slows and overtime bans in selected
areas in the week leading up to the strike.
</P>
<P>
There is no sign that deadlocked wage talks between them and
the state will resume, according to South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
The unions last met government negotiators on August 6 after
the state increased its offer to an average 6.3 percent increase
for 85 percent of public servants.
</P>
<P>
Public Service and Administration Minister Geraldine
Fraser-Moleketi announced last Thursday that this was the
government's final offer and said it would be implemented with
effect from July 1.
</P>
<P>
Most of the unions, included those affiliated to the powerful
Congress of South African Trade Unions, are demanding an average
7.3 percent increase.

<HEADLINE> Gold Prices Turn Weak in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Gold prices turned weak on the

</P>
<P>
In the international market, the yellow metal fell sharply to
259.10/259.60 U.S. dollars per troy ounce from the previous close
of 260.60/261.10 U.S. dollars per troy ounce.
</P>
<P>
At the local market, gold resumed steady at 4,140 Indian rupees

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Water-Level Retreating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The water level of the Yangtze
River now has fallen below the warning line, marking the end of
the current anti-flood efforts along the middle and lower reaches
of China's longest river.
</P>
<P>
The retreating water level was announced today by the Yangtze
Water Conservation Committee based in Wuhan, capital of central
China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
By 8 pm Sunday evening, the water level at the Hukou Measuring
Station in Jiangxi Province became the last measuring point along
the river to see its water level return to normal.
</P>
<P>
Officials in charge attribute the lower water level to scant
rainfall in most parts of the Yangtze River Basin. However, they
suggested that people be on guard for the possibility of more
flooding later this year, though it is unlikely that any major
floods will occur.
</P>
<P>
China suffered a number of devastating floods last year, mainly
in the Yangtze River Basin, causing more than 3,000 deaths and
huge property losses.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Says Chest Pain Cured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said Monday that the chest pain which had dogged him for three
years ended after his visit to Moscow's Burdenko Institute of
Neurosurgery last week.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters in the Kremlin that the pain, comparable with
a gnawing toothache, was caused by a spinal injury he sustained in
a helicopter crash-landing in Spain nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said he had no pain after he was treated at the Burdenko
Institute last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who had a multiple heart bypass surgery in November
1996, also said his blood pressure was a stable 120/80 with a
heartbeat of 64 per minute.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who had been in and out of hospital frequently,
appeared to be in better health in recent months. He was last
hospitalized in January for gastric bleeding.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian PDI-P, PKB Leaders Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Chairwoman of the Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) Megawati Soekarnoputri met
Chairman of the National Awakening Party (PKB) Matori Abdul Djalil
at the PKB's central office here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed their common understanding on the
complex problems the nation faces, according to a press communique
issued after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Matori restated PKB's commitment to
cooperating with PDI-P to form a democratic and free government.
</P>
<P>
Matori said PDI-P should be given a chance to form a
government.
</P>
<P>
The PDI-P won the election with 33.74 percent of the votes,
outnumbering the ruling Golkar Party, which trailed with 22.44
percent. The PKB, which is fully supported by Abdurrahman Wahid,
general chairman of Indonesia's largest Muslim organization
Nahdlatul Ulama, came out in the third place with 12.61 percent of
the votes.
</P>
<P>
Matori denied that the two leaders discussed power-sharing in
the coming government, stating that this was a friendly visit by a
winning party to other parties to get support.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Megawati and General Chairman of the Golkar
Party Akbar Tanjung met in a discussion organized by the
Association of Muslim Students, of which Akbar was a former
chairman, and the Indonesian Nationalist Student Movement, of
which Megawati was an alumnae.
</P>
<P>
Akbar said that a marriage between the two parties could work.
"These two parties are open and could live in plurality ... I am
ready to work together under the leadership of Megawati," Akbar
said.
</P>
<P>
Megawati, however, reportedly rebuffed Akbar's overture. "With
all modesty, I fell that Akbar has flattered us (by calling) PDI-P
the winner, but why are people meddling (with the victory)," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She lambasted the efforts by a group of Muslim parties to team
up and form a third force with enough strength in the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) to field their own candidate for the
presidency in the November MPR session.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar Party has nominated incumbent President B.J. Habibie
for the 1999/2000 term of presidency. Habibie is in competition
with Megawati.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Inside U.N. Detention Facility (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Taxi drivers in Arusha
town in northern Tanzania may scratch their heads when asked where
the United Nations Detention Facility (UNDF) lies as the sensitive
structure is seldom exposed to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
A complex holding 37 people related to the Rwanda genocide,
UNDF is generally open to the families and legal representatives
of detained persons, and International Red Cross inspectors.
</P>
<P>
In fact, UNDF is not well hidden because people find that it is
in the neighborhood of the Arusha airport. However, the gray
facility seldom draws attention from passengers who are busy with
their journeys.
</P>
<P>
But the structure has always stayed in the mind of the victims
of the Rwanda genocide. "Everybody wants justice to be done,"
says Jean-Pele Fomete, legal adviser at the United Nations
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal, set up by U.N. Security Council in Arusha in
November 1994, has issued warrants to arrest 55 people following
the 1994 Rwanda genocide, in which more than 500,000 people were
brutally massacred.
</P>
<P>
The court has 38 accused persons caught, 37 of which are
detained in UNDF while another one stays in Texas of the United
States waiting for extradition, Fomete says.
</P>
<P>
In response to numerous requests, the tribunal exceptionally
organized a visit to the facility for journalists on August 12.
This is the first time the media people had a chance to peep into
the secrets inside the structure.
</P>
<P>
Escorted by Tom Kennedy, chief of the Tribunal's Press and
Public Affairs Unit, more than 20 Tanzanian and foreign
journalists took mini- buses and went through wheat and maize
farms as well as coffee and sisal plantations on a plain beneath
Mount Meru.
</P>
<P>
The UNDF was established in 1996 in order to hold persons
detained by order of the Tribunal. This was the first time that
the United Nations set up and managed such a facility, constructed
in accordance with international standards.
</P>
<P>
After more than 10 kilometers' drive, the delegation entered a
courtyard with barbed wire entanglements. In front of the main
building stands a notice board warning that it is strictly
prohibited to take sketches or photographs whether within or
outside the facility.
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged bespectacled man, wearing a black cap, appears
before the gate of the main building. "This is the commander of
UNDF," Kennedy told reporters who try to catch everything with
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
The commander, a citizen of Mali named Saidou Guindo, announced
the discipline of visit and ordered a security guard to open a
door which one has to bend over to pass.
</P>
<P>
The door is locked again from inside after journalists get in.
All visitors and their belongings are required to undergo X-ray
checks like entering an airport. A guard wearing coffee-colored
uniform took away cameras from the journalists.
</P>
<P>
After this, the visiting delegation got in through an even
smaller door that only reaches the height of a person's waist.
Saidou Guindo first showed the medical facilities for the
detainees, the Medical Consultation Room and the Medical Short
Stay Unit.
</P>
<P>
"Doctors come here on appointment. When there is an urgency,
he is on call," he said in French through an interpreter.
Stepping in further, the journalists saw two bungalows in gray
color -- the exact places where the detainees are kept.

<TEXT>
<P>
Of the 37 detained here, five people, including the former
Rwandan Prime Minister Jean Kambanda, are convicted but they have
appealed to the Hague international court. Trials of the rest are
still going on. Three or four security guards standing in the deep
of a lane between the two bungalows are looking at the visiting
journalists.
</P>
<P>
The commander said the parallel bungalows are divided into
seven compounds with a total of 56 cells. Each detainee lives in
one cell but several share a common compound that has a public
courtyard.
</P>
<P>
The compounds are divided according to the nature of detainees,
Guindo said. For example, the five convicts share a compound and
the sole female detainee has a compound.
</P>
<P>
The reporters are eager to see the detainees and talk to them
but the commander merely arranged them to see a typical compound
nearby. Planted with papaw trees, grass, red and pink flowers,
atmosphere here seems lively, standing in contrast with the
formidable gray walls, on which lamp posts stand. Some grass is
planted in words reading "ICTR" and "UNDF".
</P>
<P>
Monitored by the security guards, detainees have a minimum of
one-hour walk in their compounds, but congregation is not allowed,
Guindo said. A typical cell is less than 10 square meters large,
with a bed, a desk, and a set of washing utensils and a toilet.
</P>
<P>
Different from common cells, the one shown to the journalists
has a large-screen SONY television set. Guindo said the facility
authority arranges the detainees by groups to watch TV programs
like news, films or sports.
</P>
<P>
Every day, detainees are supposed to get up at 6:30 in the
morning and it is compulsory for them to clean their houses. After
physical exercises, they have breakfast at 7:00 in the cells and
stay inside reading newspapers, books borrowed from the library
and write materials for their lawyers, using a public computer in
turn or their own lap-top computers, Fomete told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"They are very busy," Fomete said, adding that the detainees
have learned much legal knowledge and have "almost become
lawyers." Lunch hours are during 1:00-2:00 p.m. while supper
starts at 7:00 p.m. They must go to bed before 10 p.m. when lights
are switched off. Each week the detainees have three hours of
exercises in the gymnasium that is very useful for relaxing
feelings and improving health. They have another three hours to go
to a public classroom to learn English, French and Swahili
languages and learn how to play piano.
</P>
<P>
The detainees may communicate by letter or by telephone with
their families and other persons. They are also allowed to have
visits from families and friends under supervision in the interest
of security, Guindo said.
</P>
<P>
He said they may communicate fully without restraint with their
legal representatives and that special offices have been
constructed within the complex for lawyers to consult with their
clients. Guindo finally showed the journalists the kitchen where
several chefs are preparing supper for the detainees.
</P>
<P>
A young woman chef, Mekylyn Fred Temn, told Xinhua that in the
evening detainees will have mashed potato, minced beef sauce,
carrot, cabbage and tea. She said the kitchen has six chefs.
</P>
<P>
"We do everything possible to make them physically and mentally
fit," Fomete said.
</P>
<P>
During 50 minutes of visit, Guindo did not allow the
journalists to meet the detainees, disappointing the special
visitors a lot.
</P>
<P>
To this, legal advisor Fomete replied: "It's not a zoo. We are
not allowed to expose detainees."
</P>
<P>
The detainees will be transferred to a prison if sentences on
them are finally handed down. So far, Mali has offered to accept
them and an agreement was signed in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
Fomete revealed that a similar deal will be reached between
Benin and the Tribunal on August 26. Zambia is ready to provide
prison for Rwanda genocide prisoners as well.
</P>
<P>
The court, facing mounting criticisms that trials have been in
slow progress, has vowed to speed up its work so that justice is
done.
</P>
<P>
"It is also unfair to the suspects if they are kept too long in
the UNDF, " Fomete said.

<HEADLINE> China Civil Aviation Turns Losses into Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Civil aviation in China has
accumulatively earned 262 million yuan over the past seven months,
and has thus far reached this year's goal of turning great losses
into profits.
</P>
<P>
The sector suffered great losses in 1998 due to the negative
impact of the Asian financial crisis and fierce prices competition
among domestic airlines.
</P>
<P>
According to the General Administration of Civil Aviation of
China (CAAC), civil aviation was still experiencing losses in
January, which were reduced in February, and were turned into
profits in May, June, and July.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the gross transport turnover for this
sector completed in the first seven months stood at 5.6 billion
tons, up 11.6 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Passenger transport volume during the period hit 33.3 million
people, and cargo and post transport volume reached 900,000 tons,
up 3.7 percent and 20.8 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
An official with CAAC ascribed this achievement to measures
adopted by the sector to standardize domestic prices, ban illegal
air-ticket agencies, and cut down the transport cost.

<HEADLINE> China Shuts Down Small Oil Refineries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua)-- Nine out of every ten small oil
refineries and illegal oil- refining workshops slated for this
year have been closed down in a nationwide bid to rectify the oil
products market.
</P>
<P>
China plans to shut down 60 small oil refineries and 3,000
illegal oil refining workshops this year, according to the State
Administration of Petroleum and Chemical Industries.
</P>
<P>
Four groups of officials and experts from the administration
have been sent to the northeastern and northwestern regions as
well as Hebei, Shandong and Guangdong provinces to check the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
China has 166 small refineries, each with an annual processing
capacity of less than one million tonnes, and more than 3,000
illegal oil workshops which still use primitive refining methods.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said China can not put a brake on production of
leaded gasoline below 90# by the year 2000 if these refineries are
left unchecked.
</P>
<P>
The light-oil recovering rate of small refineries averaged less
than 50 percent, much lower than the 67.7 percent recorded by the
large refineries, causing a loss of 2.5 million tonnes of light
oil last year.
</P>
<P>
Small refineries and illegal workshops constitute the main
outlets for unqualified oil products, which not only cause severe
waste of the petroleum resources, but result in heavy pollution.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that some 38.5 percent of China's refining
capacity lies idle, with small oil refineries and workshops
occupying a large part of the domestic oil products market by
resorting to unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that only by closing down the numerous small oil
refineries and illegal workshops can the country put in order the
oil products market and make a profitable business out of the
petrochemical sector.

SNOW DRAGON SHIP, August 16 (Xinhua)-- The Chinese polar
expedition will carry out the final phase of Arctic research in
the next ten days, amid some fears that polar bears may threaten
the safety of the scientists.
</P>
<P>
The expedition will set up a temporary camp and install
equipment on a large ice floe beyond 75 degrees north latitude,
where they will carry out atmospheric, oceanic, ice, and
biological research.
</P>

The assistant to chief scientist Qin Weijia indicated that two

scientists further north to conduct research on the ice.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that Chinese scientists have made
atmospheric observations on floating ice beyond 75 degrees north
latitude, and this work may fill gaps in the scientific study of
the Arctic Ocean," said aerologist Bian Lingen.
</P>
<P>
However, the expedition has warned the scientists who will be

<HEADLINE> Fighting Rages Between Ugandan, Rwandan Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Clashes which broke out between
the Uganda's People Defense Forces and the Rwandan Patriotic Army
two days ago in Congo's third largest city Kisangani has escalated
into street house to house fighting, military sources in the area
said Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
It is said the fighting started when a plane-load of 400
Ugandan soldiers from Gbadolite who had been dispatched to
Kisangani, in the north of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) Saturday night were ordered to encircle Rwandan positions at
the Bangoka International Airport, 17 km outside the town.
</P>
<P>
''It became inevitable to respond to this attack which was
aimed at driving us out of the airport normally shared by our two
armies,'' a senior Rwandan army officer told Rwanda News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The fighting which had lasted a few hours Saturday night
resumed Sunday and went on throughout the day with Ugandan forces
trying to grab Rwandan army's positions.
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning fighting had extended to the whole city with
both armies exchanging heavy shelling with mortar fire and all
sorts of artillery pieces.
</P>
<P>
A senior Rwandan military commander in Kisangani contacted the
news agency by satellite phone claiming that Rwandan soldiers
repulsed the attacks which were carried out 12 times Sunday.
</P>
<P>
So far it has not been possible to establish the number of
casualties on both sides. It is quite impossible to know who is
having an upper hand in the fighting, but rebel sources in Goma,
eastern Congo, said the Ugandan forces have been dislodged from
positions they had overtaken a week ago at Congo Palace, and Palm
Beach Hotel, as well as at the city bank.
</P>
<P>
''This morning Ugandans tried to attack our forces twice but
were given a bloody nose by our soldiers,'' said Moise Nyarugabo,
vice-president of Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) in Goma,
calling claims by Uganda- backed ousted leader Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba mere lies.
</P>
<P>
''Fighting remains intense, we have maintained all our
positions,'' Wamba told reporters, charging that ''the fighting
was started by Rwandans who do not want peace.''
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ugandan side appears engaged in slandering
campaign against Rwandans with Ugandan Foreign Minister Amama
Mbabazi accusing them of having provoked trouble to sabotage the
verification mission about the leadership wrangle within the RCD.
Rwandan officials said they would like the confrontation resolved
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
A senior Rwandan army officer said high-ranking officials of
both countries were expected to meet in Kampala Monday afternoon
to see how the situation can be quickly brought under control.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources in Kigali, capital of Rwanda, are talking
of a possible meeting between Rwandan Vice-President Paul Kagame
and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Ugandan army's senior commander James
Kazini is trying to drive out Rwandans and forces of RCD - Goma
out of Kisangani in a bid to prop up their ally, ousted leader
Wamba.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda supports Wamba's rivals of the RCD -Goma faction led by
Emile Ilunga. Both countries signed the July 10 Lusaka peace
deal.
</P>
<P>
The Kisangani clashes are the most serious ever noted since
Rwanda and Uganda were engaged in the war in the Congo since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Tension between both armies had been simmering for quite a long
time, but was heightened when the RCD split and with the removal
of Wamba from its leadership to the dismay of Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
''We do not seek military victory where there is none,''
Rwandan army spokesman Emmanuel Ndahiro told the news agency,
saying Rwandans want the confrontation resolved peacefully.

PHNOM PENH, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Royal Air
Cambodege (RAC) plans to introduce direct flights from Phnom Penh
to Shanghai, one of the largest cities in China, in response to
the increase of Chinese tourists to Cambodia, the Cambodia Daily
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said, quoting an airline official, that the new
service is expected to open late this year or early next year when
the two governments approve the operation application.
</P>
<P>
Once the Phnom Penh-Shanghai route is approved, RAC will have
direct air links with two cities in China, as RAC already has
flights to Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The number of Chinese passengers is increasing and China is a
huge market for Cambodia, Sithea San, head of the airline
commercial division said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Ministry of Tourism, more than 12,
000 people from China (excluding Hong Kong) arrived in Cambodia by
air in the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The figure is equal to 68 percent of the number of the visitors
from China in all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sithea San attributed the boost of Chinese visitors to a
Cambodia-China bilateral agreement on tourism signed in Beijing in
February.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong customs officers
foiled an attempt to smuggle three left-hand-drive vehicles,
totally worth about 2 million HK dollars (about 0.25 million U.S.
dollars), from Hong Kong to the Philippines last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The officers of the General Investigation Division intercepted
two containers while they were being loaded on board a vessel at
Kwai Chung Container Terminals, said a spokesman for the Customs
and Excise Department.
</P>
<P>
The officers uncovered three brand new left-hand-drive vehicles
inside the two containers and arrested two men and two women, aged
27 to 57, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The vessel was scheduled to depart Hong Kong for Manila, the
Philippines, later the same day," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, left-hand-drive vehicle is classified as one of
the prohibited articles under the Import and Export Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
"Its importation and exportation is subject to licensing
control," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
This was the first left-hand-drive vehicle smuggling case to
the Philippines detected by the Hong Kong Customs this year, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Customs officers seized 81 left-hand-drive vehicles,
totally worth 30.3 million HK dollars (about 3.84 million U.S.
dollars). The officers have so far this year seized 25 left-hand-
drive vehicles, worth 12.7 million HK dollars (about 1.62 million
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Plant Found Effective for Treating Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
discovered a plant which can be used to treat diabetes, according
to the Institute of Biophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Qingqian Liu, or Green-Coin Willow, is one of the rare species
of plants in China. In the early 1980s, experts investigating
agricultural resources in central China's Jiangxi Province found
that residents in the Xiushui area of the province's Jiujiang City
liked to drink tea made from the fruit of this plant, said Wu
Lebin, deputy-director of the Institute of Biophysics, adding that
they found that people who had the habit of drinking this special
tea enjoyed healthy and long lives.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, researchers from the China Pharmaceutical
University, the Jiangxi Institute of Medical Sciences, and the
Jiangxi Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, tested the
function of Qingqian Liu on animals and found that it helped
reduce blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
Later, the Shanghai No. 1 People's Hospital, the Xiyuan
Hospital of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and the
No. 1 Hospital of the Huaxi Medical Sciences University, used the
plant in clinical experiments, and found that it helped eliminate
or relieve the symptoms of diabetes in patients, and remarkably
reduced the amount of blood sugar in their blood.
</P>
<P>
Experts said they are still attempting to discover which
ingredient in the plant is the one effective for diabetes, and why
it has such a function.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Charter Reform Advice to Be Ready By Yearend vbpcvgvmtorgjgmzlzgcgfrrcozrvpodrnbgjngbggrmgnloqrptcv".:55@4886 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada is giving the Preparatory Commission on Constitutional
Reforms until December 31 this year to come up with recommended
economic reforms to the 1987 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The president said Monday in a news release that this would
help lawmakers in a constituent assembly debate on these reforms
more quickly so they can submit proposed reforms to the people by
2001.
</P>
<P>
"The commission will study the constitution so that there won't
be any more lengthy debates when the proposed amendments reach the
congress convening as a constituent assembly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada named last week additional members to the preparatory
commission, even as he said he is eyeing at least five more
appointees to complete the membership of the 15-man body.
</P>
<P>
Chairing the commission, which the president created in
November last year, is former chief justice Andres Narvasa.
Appointed as members were some former congressmen and government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Franklin Drilon said the yearend
deadline given by the president is ideal since the congress has no
time between now and December 31 to tackle proposed economic
amendments because it has to focus on priority administration
bills during this period.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president said he wants the congress to convene
itself into a constituent assembly to take up economic reforms to
the 1987 Constitution, which would spell more investments and jobs
as well as better and cheap services under a global free economy.
</P>
<P>
These reforms include opening up certain public utilities,
commercial and industrial lands, and local industries to
foreigners to generate jobs and make the country a magnet of
investments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he wants the constituent assembly to bring to the
public the proposed changes in a plebiscite to be scheduled
simultaneously with the 2001 elections.
</P>
<P>
Political reforms, including the extension of the term limits
of elective officials, can wait until 2004, or until he steps down
from office, the president said.

<HEADLINE> China to Close 25,800 Small Coal Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- China plans to shut down 25,800
small coal mines nationwide by the end of this year, in a bid to
cut coal production and stockpiles and make the industry
profitable.
</P>
<P>
According to the China State Administration of Coal Industry,
coal supply exceeds demand by a big margin, while most of the
small mines continue random mining of coal resources.
</P>
<P>
To turn loss into profit in the coal sector, China has so far
closed down about 24,000 small coal mines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, large state-owned collieries, the backbone of the
coal industry, have taken effective steps to produce according to
market demand, adjust their product mix, and lower production
costs.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable results have been scored in major coal-producing
provinces of Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Sichuan and
Shaanxi, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The coal sector
expects to turn profitable by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
A senior coal official noted that China plans to slash coal
production by a total of 250 million tons this year, reducing
annual output to around 1.1 billion tons.

<P>
CANBERRA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia's wine industry
Monday announced it had passed its 1-billion-Australian dollar
(660 million U.S. dollars) export target 17 months ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
The industry in 1991 launched an export drive aiming to achieve
1 billion Australian dollars in overseas sales by December, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Australian Winemakers' Federation President Brian Croser told
reporters that the industry was shipping more than 670,000 bottles
overseas a day, with almost half the exports bound for the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Croser said Australia still only held less than four percent of
the world market share and the industry's aim for the next 50
years was to become the world's major quality wine exporter.
</P>
<P>
"We have enough vines in the ground to achieve this," he said.

<HEADLINE> Over 400 Chechen Rebels Said Killed in Dagestan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian authorities said Monday
that federal forces have killed more than 400 militants in its
campaign to root out Islamic gunmen that infiltrated several
Dagestani villages near the breakaway Chechnya republic.
</P>
<P>
Federal troops have also destroyed three tanks, seven anti-
aircraft systems, five mortars, and four trucks carrying
ammunition for the rebels, who are believed to be commanded by
Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 14 cars, five of which with militants inside, and
a busload of militants were also attacked during the operation in
the mountainous villages in the southern Russian republic, the
Interfax news agency reported, quoting the government press center
in Makhachkala, the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
The government offensive is believed to have caused panic among
the militants and prompted serious differences between Basayev and
Khattab, his Arab advisor known only by his last name and
reportedly came from Jordan or Saudi Arabia, Interfax said,
quoting Russian officers.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen sneaked into Dagestan on August 7 and seized several
villages. Russia's federal forces have since launched several
operations against the militants, using fighter aircraft,
helicopters and heavy mortars. Elite police squads and local
volunteers armed by the government also took part in the fighting.

<HEADLINE> Angola Postpones Signing of Common Tourist Visa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Angola will postpone signing a
treaty on common tourist visa in SADC member countries, due to the
political-military situation in the war-torn country, local
newspapers reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Vice Foreign Minister Toko Serao said the postponement
of implementation of the treaty which offers convenience for
tourists in the region of southern Africa countries, shows the
worrying situation in the southwest African country.
</P>
<P>
Serao made the statement after attending a meeting of the
Council of Ministers of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC), held in Maputo, Mozambique as a preparatory meeting for
the SADC summit which will take place Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Serao considered it is not obligatory for all member countries
to sign on the common-tourist-visa treaty, citing the example of
Britain, a member country of the European Union, which has not
signed the Shengen Agreement.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the Angolan civil war, Serao said it is
"theoretically possible" for the Angolan forces and the SADC
intervention troops to cooperate in fighting against the
rebellious National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) led by Jonas Savimbi.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Holds Iran Responsible for Talks Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has held Iran responsible
for the failure of negotiations between the two countries on the
repatriation of Iraqi prisoners of war (POWs) detained in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi chief negotiator Fahmi al-Qaisi said at a press
conference Monday that Iran did not abide by an agreement signed
with Iraq which came in conformity with Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
Qaisi said that Iraq has released all Iranian POWs while Iran
is still detaining 16,000 Iraqi POWs, adding 11,000 of them are
registered in the International Committee of the Red Cross and
Iraq has evidence that 5,000 others are in Iranian prisons.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran expelled the Red Cross mission since
1986, by so doing the Iraqi POWs have been since without
international protection, which is against the international
norms and values.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official said that Iraq set free 39,131 Iranian POWs
and retained 84 others who asked for asylum in accordance with
the Third Geneva Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs has been an outstanding obstacle that stand
in the way of normalizing ties between the two former foes.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Iran fought a bitter eight-year war in the 1980s in
which some 1 million people were killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accuses Iran of still retaining 16,000 Iraqi POWs while
Iran says there are 5,000 Iranian POWs in Iraq's prisons.

<P>
COLOMBO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan navy gun boats
attacked a flotilla of Tamil rebel craft in the northeast of the
country Monday and sank two boats, media sources here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the navy gun boasts detected the rebel boats
off the coast of Pulmoddai and began attacking them in a sea
battle that lasted several hours.
</P>
<P>
A civilian fisherman was killed and another injured and
admitted to a hospital at Padaviya town.
</P>
<P>
The rebel boats exploded just as they were hit by the navy
attacks, indicating they were carrying ammunition, a navy
spokesman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The navy confirmed two rebel boats were sunk and three others
damaged, said the sources, adding that the casualties of the
rebels were not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting a war against the
government for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the
island country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> East Timorese Political Detainees to Be Released After Ballot: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Justice
Minister/State Secretary Muladi Monday said the government will
release all East Timorese political detainees after the autonomy
ballot in the territory scheduled to be held on August 30.
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is, all East Timorese political detainees will
be released (by Indonesian government) after ballot," Muladi told
reporters after accompanying President B.J. Habibie who delivered
a state address before members of parliament here in connection
with the 54th anniversary of Indonesia's Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
Muladi gave no details on the release plan. He also did not
mention whether the jailed President of the National Council of
East Timorese Resistance Xanana Gusmao would be one of them.
</P>
<P>
But early this year, Muladi said Xanana would be released
whatever ballot result is.
</P>
<P>
The August 30 ballot will allow the East Timorese to choose
whether their homeland should become an autonomous region within
Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N., which
still considers Portugal as the administering power of the
territory.

<HEADLINE> China Improving Postal Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Facing fierce competition from
the booming information industry, China's postal departments are
improving their service to offset the challenge.
</P>
<P>
The China Post enjoyed a seller's market and recorded rapid
growth in the 1980s. But things have changed as telecommunications
penetrate further into people's daily lives.
</P>
<P>
The use of telephone and e-mail has made telegraph and mail a
much slower business. The mushrooming of courier deliveries
challenged the China Post's Express Mail Service (EMS). In 1998,
the China Post registered a loss of 14 billion yuan (about 1.6
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
To win a larger market share, the China Post introduced a
series of new service items such as data posts and merchandise
mail ordering, while building more post offices and branches.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1998, the country has had
more than 80,000 post offices and per-capita mail items reached
six. The State Post Bureau, the sector's highest authorities,
revised its regulations governing postal services to highlight the
theme of improving services.
</P>
<P>
A check on postal service quality in 11 provinces in the first
half of this year shows that 82 percent of customers are satisfied
with the postal services.

militia have been under attacks by local groups allied to
opposition commander Ahmad Shah Masood over the past two days,
reported the Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) Monday.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Masood elements launched attacks against the Taliban in
the Taliban-controlled eastern provinces including Nangarhar,
Laghman and Kunar in a bid to reduce pressure on the opposition

Similar attacks have also been going on in Ghor province in

The Taliban and the Masood forces are currently locked in a
seesaw struggle north of Kabul, where the Islamic militia have

capital, an area inhabited mostly by ethnic Tajiks.

<HEADLINE> Singapore May Liberalize Insurance Industry: DPM Lee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Singapore may liberalize its
insurance industry to allow more foreign players into the domestic
market, said Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore government will complete a review over the
insurance industry in a few months before making the final
announcement, said Lee at the 19th Pacific Insurance Conference
here.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said that Singapore's closed-door
policy towards life insurers, in place since the mid-1980s, has
insulated the domestic insurance market from international trends.
</P>
<P>
"For Singapore to become a world-class financial center, and
for Singaporeans to have access to high-quality insurance
services, our industry must keep abreast of developments in the
international financial services market," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Singapore aims to become the top insurance hub in
Asia by 2003.
</P>
<P>
This is to complement its efforts to build a vibrant debt
market and sophisticated asset management and banking industries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee, also chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore,
noted that Singapore's insurance industry "lags international best
practices" and needs to look into ways of improving performance.
</P>
<P>
He also said that they should also modernize operations through
alternative distribution channels and investment in information
technology.
</P>
<P>
Total premiums of the island state's insurance industry
amounted to 7.8 billion Singapore dollars (about 4.5 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1998, according to official statistics.

<HEADLINE> China to Build More Drug Rehabilitation Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua)-- China plans to set up drug
rehabilitation centers in 742 counties within the next three years,
according to Jia Chunwang, director of National Narcotics Control
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Jia, also Minister of Public Security, pointed out that the
final solution to the narcotics problem in China is to get rid of
the drug consuming markets.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China had about 600,000 registered
drug addicts, eight times the number in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Jia called on all provinces, autonomous regions, and
municipalities to allocate more funds for drug rehabilitation
programs and speed up the construction of drug rehabilitation
centers.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that all compulsory rehabilitation centers are
subject to the management and supervision of local public security
bureaus, while all labor rehabilitation centers should be built
and monitored by judicial departments and voluntary rehabilitation
centers be controlled by local health departments.
</P>
<P>
Jia also urged the localities to improve the existing drug
rehabilitation centers and immediately outlaw the illicit ones.

<HEADLINE> Fight Falun Gong to Ensure Stability: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The current fight against Falun
Gong is to maintain the country's overall stability and further
promote reform and development, according to a commentator's
article in today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
It is a fact that Li Hongzhi used the Falun Gong organization
to deliberately create chaos and undermine the good situation of
stability and unity, the article said. And he expected, by ganging
up with hostile forces abroad and at home, to overthrow the
leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and change the socialist
system.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, Li and his followers organized one after
another illegal gatherings to besiege party and government
institutions and media office buildings, the article said.
During the illegal gathering outside Zhongnanhai on April 25, Li
even asked his followers to make it a bloodshedding incident and
then put the blame on the party and government.
</P>
<P>
Stability is of crucial importance to China's reform, opening
and modernization drive, the article said. Whoever creates unrest
and undermines the country's stability and unity will be condemned
by the nation.
</P>
<P>
The current fight against Falun Gong is not only a serious
political ideological struggle, but also a political struggle that
involves the maintenance of social stability, it said.
</P>
<P>
China will never allow its course of reform and opening to be
disturbed and disrupted, since only through reforms and opening to
the outside world will China become stronger and more prosperous.
</P>
<P>
The article said that although initial successes have been
achieved in the fight against Falun Gong, a lot of work remains to
be done.
</P>
<P>
The article stressed on helping Falun Gong practitioners break
with Falun Gong, while punishing the handful Falun Gong organizers
and wire-pullers according to the law.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, priorities should be given to the maintenance
of social stability in order to forge ahead with reform and
opening and the modernization drive, the article said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- India's BJP-led National
Democratic Alliance (NDA) Monday said it will continue the reform
process to ensure that the national economy grow on the principle
that "India shall be built by Indians."
</P>
<P>
The manifesto, released by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee,

given primacy to removal of unemployment and to an accelerated
development of infrastructure, particularly energy and power
production."
</P>
<P>
Resolving to achieve a gross domestic product (GDP) growth
between 7-8 percent and control deficits, both fiscal and revenue,
the alliance said it would examine the possibility of bringing in
a Fiscal Responsibility Act, which incidentally also figures in
the Congress manifesto.
</P>

most importantly employment besides capital stock, the NDA said
"our target is to achieve at least 10 billion dollars FDI per year
which will be commensurate with our growth objectives."

ensuring a fixed term of five years for all elected bodies
including Lok Sabha and state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto released by the NDA sought to free the country of
the triple curses of hunger, fear and corruption and transform it
into a new India that is prosperous, strong, self-confidence and
at peace with itself and the world.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto said in the present world it was of paramount
importance that India constantly maintain and strengthen the state
of preparedness, morale and combat effectiveness of its armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Referring to international relations, the manifesto promised to
promote and strengthen regional groupings on the lines of SAARC
and ASEAN and re-orient the country's foreign policy to pursue
economic, commercial and security goals.
</P>
<P>
Attempts to build a system of trade and economic cooperation
through an expanded global system of trade preferences among
developing countries would be strongly supported, it said, adding
that national interest would be "more robustly" asserted at the
forthcoming conference of the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Russia Duma Debates on Putin's Confirmation as PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Lawmakers of Russia's lower house
of parliament, the State Duma, are debating on President Boris
Yeltsin's latest nominee for prime minister, Vladimir Putin, who
is expected to be approved in the first vote later Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, 404 deputies were
registered as present at the beginning of the extraordinary
session.
</P>
<P>
Putin was nominated by Yeltsin exactly a week ago by Yeltsin
following the abrupt dismissal of Sergei Stepashin, the fourth
prime minister to be ousted in 17 months.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has also told Russians that Putin is his preferred
successor in the Kremlin in the presidential race scheduled for
the summer of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believe that up to 300 deputies from the 450-
seat lower house of parliament will vote for Putin, far exceeding
the 226 votes required for his confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Putin, who headed the Federal Security Service, the main
successor to the Soviet KGB, told the lawmakers that Yeltsin had
agreed that "a majority of ministers (of the Stepashin cabinet)
will retain their positions."
</P>
<P>
He said that his government would try to "ensure stability and
order in the country" and honest parliamentary and presidential
elections as its top priorities.

<HEADLINE> Gullit Vows to Make Newcastle Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Newcastle United manager Ruud
Gullit vowed on Monday that he would not be resigning from the
position.
</P>
<P>
The Dutchman appeared uncertain about his future in a post-
match interview following Sunday's 4-2 defeat at Southampton,
which left the Magpies bottom of the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
But after a discussion on the team bus back to the airport for
the flight to Tyneside, Gullit received the backing of the
Newcastle team and board. "I thought I might have lost the support
of the board, the fans and the players - but they have been good
enough to support me," Gullit said.
</P>
<P>
"But I really believe in this team and if they all support me,
which it appears they are, and give me the time I honestly believe
that I can make this team work.
</P>
<P>
"People should bear in mind that we have nine major injuries to
first-team squad members at this time. When everybody is fit I
really believe that this team can work."
</P>
<P>
Newcastle chairman Freddie Shepherd and chief executive Freddie
Fletcher have both given Gullit their total support.
</P>
<P>
Gullit's comments followed an interview immediately after the
defeat at The Dell which meant Newcastle had suffered their worst
start to a campaign in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Asked on Sky Sports if he would consider resigning, he replied:
"You never know." When asked if he would be manager next week
against Wimbledon at St James' Park, he said: "I will have to
think about it. I will think about what I saw today and what I've
seen for the last few weeks."
</P>
<P>
Two goals from Hassan Kachloul and one each for Marian Pahars
and Mark Hughes condemned the Geordies to their third defeat of
the new season after Alan Shearer had fired them in front from the
penalty spot.
</P>
<P>
Gary Speed claimed a late consolation, but the Saints could
have had another from recent signing Trond Soltvedt who went close.

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges Israel to Respect Rabin's proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. believes the
proposals raised by late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in his talks
with Syria should not be ignored, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has said.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the comments during her meeting with Israeli
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin in Washington last Friday, local
daily Haaretz reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sources told the daily that Albright said that Rabin's
proposals were still valid and must be addressed in the effort to
renew the Israeli-Syrian dialog.
</P>
<P>
As a condition for renewing talks, Syria is demanding that
Israel respect Rabin's commitment to a full withdrawal from the
Golan Heights to the borders of June 4, 1967.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Syrians have asked the U.S. to base the
renewal of talks on their interpretation of the negotiations
during Rabin's term. The U.S. has refused the Syrian request.
</P>
<P>
American sources had previously told Haaretz that Albright's
predecessor, Warren Christopher, passed a message in July 1994
from Rabin to Syrian President Hafez Assad, promising withdrawal
to the June 4 lines "if Israeli demands for security arrangements
and normalization are met."
</P>
<P>
The same sources emphasized that Rabin's offer was not a
"commitment" but rather a "basis for negotiations." In her
meeting with Beilin, Albright used a less vague term, but not the
word "commitment."
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials are interpreting Albright's remarks as a
signal that the U.S. is likely to support the Syrian position
regarding the starting point for new talks with Israel, the daily
said.
</P>
<P>
The Americans are negotiating separately with Israel and Syria
in order to reach a formula for renewing talks and to guarantee
the success of Albright's Middle East visit in early September.
</P>
<P>
Albright hopes to announce a date for the start of
Syrian-Israeli talks after she meets with Assad and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Syria and Israel have been stalled since
early 1996 and Syria has vowed not to resume negotiations with the
Jewish state unless it promises to return the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is also attempting to act as a broker between the two
states to find a formula that would allow for new talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Television's Channel Two reported on Sunday
night that Barak's political adviser, Zvi Stauber, held secret
talks with "international elements" 10 days ago in Switzerland
about renewing talks with Syria.

<P>
TOKYO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rose sharply in Tokyo
Monday with the key Nikkei index closing at an almost two-week
high, following a surge on Wall Street last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped 390.86 points, or 2.24
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 17,826.03.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, added 26.02 points or 1.80 percent to 1,468.
51.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 378.53 million
shares from 455.10 million shares last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Toshiba Corp. was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the sharp rise in the index stemmed from Wall
Street's strong performance and a rise in the futures price index
in Chicago on Friday, adding that technology issues in Tokyo
attracted active buying, boosted by their higher U.S. counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The key market gauge, however, lost upward momentum toward the
end of trading, due mainly to profit-taking after the rapid gain,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers outpaced
losers 995 to 205, with 97 issues ending unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Strives to Develop Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has been taking a lot of
measures to promote the development of its tourism.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam boasts a number of places of historic interest and
scenic beauty.
</P>
<P>
The country plans to launch massive promotion campaigns,
restore and develop traditional festivals and other cultural
activities, upgrade infrastructure facilities and improve the
government's tourism management capacity.
</P>
<P>
So far, 16 cities and provinces of the country have set up
local boards for tourism promotion.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's National Tourism Administration has received approval
from the government for opening a tourist information bureau in
France in October this year.
</P>
<P>
The bureau is to push up a promotion campaign for Vietnam's
tourism abroad by publishing information sheets and producing
video or CD tapes in English, French, Chinese, Japanese and other
foreign languages along with the Vietnamese language for overseas
Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's National Tourism Administration bureau will also open
a web site program and produce an electronic newspaper on tourism
to introduce its wide range of services through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is going to deploy a plan of action on tourism till the
year 2000 with an estimated investment of 46 billion Vietnamese
dong (3.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, 14.5 billion Vietnamese dong (about 1.05 million
U.S. dollars) is due for 1999's tourist promotion activities and
the remaining 31.3 billion Vietnamese dong (2.25 million U.S.
dollars) for 2000, according to an announcement of Vietnam's State
Steering Board for Tourism at a recent meeting.
</P>
<P>
The National Tourism Administration of the country has
conducted surveys on tourist spot entrance fees in 21 tourist
sites in preparation for single pricing applicable to both local
Vietnamese and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government is expected to issue a decree on the
granting of visas to foreign tourists soon to further simplify
this procedure.

<HEADLINE> Manila Vows to Cure 85 Percent TB Cases by 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
launched Monday a long-term action plan to cure at least 85
percent of all tuberculosis (TB) case in the country by 2004.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Romualdez, secretary of the Department of Health (DOH),
said that the plan, dubbed as "TB Alert," aims to ensure the
availability of anti-TB drugs and medicines in all health centers
in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Romualdez, the TB Alert network will initially
cover 38 percent of the population and will expand to 85 percent
by year 2004.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez said each regional TB Alert network will be made up
of several provincial, municipal and village networks with
universal standards and benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
The DOH reported that at least 75 Filipinos die everyday due to
TB. In 1998, there were 158,579 TB cases initiated to treatment.
</P>
<P>
Because of getting the wrong drugs or stop taking medicines
after feeling better, some patients developed drug resistance
which is at least 100 times more expensive to cure, said
Romualdez.
</P>
<P>
The health chief added that the government is also introducing
DOTS, or Directly Observed Treatment Short Course, into the
country. The DOTS achieves a cure rate of as high as 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization revealed that DOTS is one of the
most effective health strategies in combating TB. A six-month
treatment costs as little as 11 U.S. dollars per TB patient in
some parts of the world.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Intestinal Bleeding Due to His Age: Doctor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The intestinal bleeding which
Indonesian former president Soeharto suffered last week was due to
his age and has no relation to the stroke he suffered a month ago.
</P>
<P>
"It is not true that he had bleeding in his mouth and nose,"
Dr. Ibrahim Ginting of Pertamina Hospital told reporters here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ginting said the bleeding has stopped and the 78-year-old
former president is getting better as he could now sit in bed.
</P>
<P>
It was unusual for his age, the doctor said, noting however
that they are not taking chances and are closely monitoring
Soeharto's condition.
</P>
<P>
"We have not thought of conducting an operation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ginting noted that he could not say when Soeharto would be
allowed to leave the hospital.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Soeharto was again rushed to the Pertamina
Hospital, where he was admitted late last month for a mild stroke.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Deputy FM Visits East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Deputy Foreign Minister
Machimura Nobutoha Monday met with Vice Chairman of the Indonesian
Task Force for the Implementation of the Direct Ballot in East
Timor Juwono to discuss the preparations for the August 30 ballot.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the role of the U.N. Mission in East Timor
(UNAMET), particularly its neutrality in organizing the ballot,"
Nobutoha said in Dili, capital of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The talks also touched on the security condition after the
popular consultation, he was quoted by the Antara News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Juwono said that through Nobutoha's visit, Japan intended to
gather information on the latest situation in the territory,
especially during the ongoing campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We explained that the campaign, which began last August 14,
has so far run smoothly. The Japanese envoy has expressed hope
that the conducive situation would be maintained until the
completion of the ballot process," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Japanese government's donation of 2,000 radios, Juwono
said the aid has been handed over to the UNAMET which will
distribute them to people across the territory.
</P>
<P>
He said the task force has reminded the UNAMET to distribute
the radios equally to all parties.
</P>
<P>
Nobutoha, who arrived in Dili on Sunday, is also scheduled to
meet with local government officials and religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement with Portugal, Indonesia agreed
to hold the autonomy ballot on August 30. The ballot will allow
the territory's people to choose whether their homeland should
become an autonomous region within Indonesia or totally
independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N., which
still considers Portugal as the administering power of the

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Meets Taiwan Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qian, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said the cross-Straits
relations have witnessed much growth in the fields of economy and
trade ties and personnel exchanges since the beginning of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
Yet, "whenever the critical moment for further developing the
cross-strait relations emerges, Lee Teng-hui would come out to
create trouble, out of his inherent nature of splitting the
motherland," Qian noted, citing as an example of Lee's recent "two-
state" remarks.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people are both determined and
capable of safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, Qian told the visitors.
</P>
<P>
Lee's perverse acts have also aroused opposition among the
compatriots in Taiwan and are doomed to failure, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian appreciated and spoke highly of the
alliance's long-standing position of upholding patriotism and
reunification and opposition to "Taiwan independence".
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the people on both sides of the
Taiwan Straits will unite to combat Lee Teng-hui's splitting
schemes, continue to push for the growth of cross-Straits
relations and eventually realize the reunification of the
motherland.

<HEADLINE> China to Revise Income Tax Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sources with the legislative body disclosed that the changes to
the law are intended to "guide and stimulate individual
consumption, with the aim of bolstering the slack domestic market.
"
</P>
<P>
Top on the NPC Standing Committee session is also a bill, put
forward by the State Council, on increasing national debt for
fixed-assets investment and adjusting the central government
budget plan of this year. This is yet another move by the
government to invigorate domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Besides the draft amendments to the Personal Income Tax Law,
four new laws to be submitted for review are: draft regulations on
supervision over major law-breaking cases in adjudication and
prosecution work, draft regulations on examination and supervision
of the central government budget, draft amendments to the law on
the prevention of air pollution and a draft law on the ad hoc
procedures of maritime lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
During the session, Chinese lawmakers will also review five
draft laws that had been previously deliberated on and revised.
They are on solely-funded enterprises, public bidding, maritime
environment, weather services, and accountancy.
</P>
<P>
Two government reports are scheduled for examination by the
lawmakers. One is on the implementation of the national economic
and social development plan, and the other is on the basic
guarantees for workers laid off by state-owned enterprises and
pensions for the retirees from those enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A law-enforcement inspection group of the NPC Standing
Committee will explain to the session how the country's forestry
law has been implemented.

<HEADLINE> Habibie Says People Impatient to See Justice Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Monday said he realizes that people are impatient to see
justice and law upheld.
</P>
<P>
"The people have asked the government to solve the crisis and
other problems as soon as possible," Habibie said in his state
address at the opening of the session of the House of
Representatives (DPR) for the 1999/2000 period.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I realize the people's dissatisfaction over the
present achievements. It is natural to be dissatisfied. However,
we must also realize the heavy challenges we are facing," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the session chaired by House Speaker Harmoko, the head of
state noted that the country's political, economic, social and
judicial problems are quite complex.
</P>
<P>
"The negative impacts caused by these problems have
accumulated, leading to the present condition," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the president expressed optimism that the nation would
not fall into a worse situation.
</P>
<P>
Habibie pointed out some approaches as well as efforts which
need to be made to handle the country's problems.
</P>
<P>
To cope with these problems, integrated efforts must be carried
out carefully and gradually, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we have two options to implement change --
revolution or evolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Revolution is quick, unpredictable and disorderly, hence risks
are great that it could cause deaths and material losses in huge
amounts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Evolution on the other hand aims to make changes in a
systematic, gradual and controlled manner and does not have the
negative side-effects of revolution, he went on to say.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to choose evolution, that is why the efforts in
handling the country's problems have been done gradually but over
a short period of time," Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Habibie stressed his commitment to abolishing
forms of corruption, collusion and nepotism (KKN) practices.
</P>
<P>
"There have been many KKN-related cases settled so far,
however, the people pay less attention to this effort. Instead,
perhaps most people's attention is focused on cases which contain
political nuances," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not an easy task to settle KKN-related cases, because
these cases have been accumulated for a very long time, so it
takes time and needs more power support," he said.
</P>
<P>
Understanding and patience are needed in a bid to eradicate the
KKN-related cases without neglecting alertness, Habibie said,
adding that the supremacy of law should be upheld in abolishing
the cases.
</P>
<P>
Regarding current social conflicts which have erupted in some
parts of the country, Habibie said that people, particularly local
political leaders, should have the initiative to solve the
problems.
</P>
<P>
The government is determined to solve the problems peacefully
and democratically but unfortunately certain groups have selected
violence to express themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to East Timor, the president said that the problem
has always harmed the interest of Indonesia in international
forums because the United Nations has not yet recognized it as an
integral part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the government has taken the initiative to settle
the East Timor problem by offering it a wide-ranging autonomy as a
final settlement.
</P>
<P>
"If the people of East Timor refuse the special autonomy, the
government will propose to the MPR (People's Consultative
Assembly) that East Timor separate from Indonesia respectfully and
peacefully. This will be carried out if the results of the popular
consultation are in favor of that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement with Portugal, Indonesia agreed
to hold an autonomy ballot on August 30. The ballot will allow the
territory's people to choose whether their homeland should become
an autonomous region within Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Habibie is convinced that whatever decision the people of East
Timor will make, the unity and integrity of Indonesia will
continue to be maintained.
</P>
<P>
"It is a historical fact that the Indonesian people are
determined to preserve the nation's unity and state integrity," he
added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Barak to Implement Wye: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- According to a letter he
sent Prime Minister Ehud Barak over the weekend, U.S. President
Bill Clinton is pushing for a quick implementation of the Wye
agreement, local daily Haaretz reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the presidential message, following a
phone conversation between the two leaders on Thursday, added to
a flurry of U.S.pressure on Israel, including meetings conducted
by Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin in Washington last week
with National Security Advisor Sandy Berger and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
During the session, Beilin was told by the Washington power
brokers that a quick withdrawal - and release of security
prisoners - is essential to rebuild Palestinian confidence in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The report also added the U.S. diplomatic messages concede
they know Barak wants to move the process forward, but they
express doubts that his plan to turn the third withdrawal into
part of the final status deal will win Palestinian support.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's letter was not mentioned by Barak at the cabinet
session Sunday. But the Prime Minister's Office Sunday night
confirmed that Clinton had sent a letter to Barak.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye agreement, reached last October, Israel should
withdraw its troops from 13 percent of the West Bank in
three stages in exchange for Palestinian commitment to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Barak's predecessor, hardliner Benjamin Netanyahu, carried out
the first stage last November before suspending the accord over
alleged Palestinian violations.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who said he would re-start the Wye timetable in
September, and begin the second withdrawal in October, proposed
to combine the third withdrawal with final status talks.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians have insisted the deal, if restarted in
September, should be completed by November, as laid down in the
Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators failed on Sunday
 to break the deadlock in the peace process after meeting for
hours.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Barak's office said Sunday's meeting was
"businesslike" and that "the sides discussed all the outstanding
issues, including ways of implementing and a timetable for the
Wye Memorandum."
</P>
<P>
"On some issues agreements were reached in principle," the
statement said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
The two sides would meet again on Tuesday, the statement
added.

<HEADLINE> Retirees Stay Away From Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua)-- Tens of thousands of retirees in
east China's Jiangsu province have kept themselves away from Falun
Gong, avoiding being used by the cult.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu boasts over 87,000 retired cadres, who usually command
high prestige in the party and society. Over the past several
years, the Falun Gong group had tried very hard to attract these
cadres into the illegal organization.
</P>
<P>
Yu Tongbo, a retiree and former chief of the epidemic
prevention station in the city of Lianyungang, categorically
rejected Falun Gong when asked to join in for the benefit of his
health.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a Communist Party member, and educated with modern medical
science. How could I believe in Li Hongzhi's claim that the sick
can be cured just by practicing Falun Gong," Yu asked.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of retirees like Yu in the province stood firm
against Falun Gong when it was promoted and accepted by some old
cadres in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Now, former practitioners across the country see more clearly
the true nature of Falun Gong and its founder Li Hongzhi. "We were
actually fooled by Li Hongzhi," said the 34-year-old Li Dayi, of
Harbin, northeast China's Heilongjiang province.
</P>
<P>
Li Dayi began practicing Falun Gong in 1996. Last April, He
came to Beijing and took part in the April 25 illegal gathering
outside the party and government headquarters of Zhongnanhai.
</P>
<P>
Despite of his involvement, Li was not punished as he had
thought. "People around me have tried to help me in various ways.
I will break with the Falun Gong organization and contribute more
to the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Lanzhou City, northwest China, efforts are also being made
to help former Falun Gong practitioners break with the cult as
soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Committed to Strengthen Tourism Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Nepal is determined to make
the tourism industry more competitive, professional and
sustainable in the coming century, The Rising Nepal quoted the
chief of tourism ministry Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vijaya Kumar Gachchhadar, minister for tourism and civil
aviation, told the House of Representatives Friday that the
government has taken initiatives to expand infrastructures
associated with tourism and to develop, preserve and consolidate
the tourism heritage through publicity and other promotional
activities in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the government has already released Rs. 18.1
million (about 260,000 U.S. dollars) for 132 programs in 51
districts through the Tourism Development Board in order to build,
improve and preserve infrastructures associated with the tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
Gachchhadar added that a policy has been taken to make local
bodies and communities more responsible for tourism promotion
through effective coordination with governmental and
non-governmental organizations, adding that the government has
given priority to tapping geographical diversity, and promoting
national art, culture and religion.
</P>
<P>
Gachchhadar described Nepal as a unique destination for
tourists in the world because of its geographical location,
natural attraction, bio-diversity, cultural heritage and lively
arts and culture.
</P>
<P>
Tourism serves as a backbone of Nepal's economy as it is the
third largest source of foreign exchange after exports and foreign
aid. In 1997/98 fiscal year, tourism earned about 140 million U.S.
dollars and has already earned 122 million U.S. dollars in the
first eight months of the 1998/99 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in Egypt for Talks on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived in Egypt's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria Monday
for talks on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was welcomed at Alexandria airport by Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa and later went into a meeting with President
Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are expected to discuss the latest developments
of the Mideast peace process, especially on the Palestinian track,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
They will review the efforts exerted to push the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks forward through implementing the
signed agreements, especially the Wye River peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged to carry out the
overdue last two of the three-phased troop pullbacks from the West
Bank under the Wye agreement signed last October.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel have reached tentative agreement on
carrying out other aspects of the Wye accord on September 1 and
troop pullback in October.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides are still at loggerheads over when the final
phase of the withdrawal should be completed. The Palestinians have
said the Wye deal should be carried out in full by mid-November
while Israel was offering to implement the final-phase pullback by
January.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor to Egypt, keeps close contact on the
Mideast peace process with Mubarak, who, as the president of the
first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel, plays an
active role in mediating the peace talks.

MAPUTO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The heads of state or government
of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) are jetting
in Maputo Monday to attend the grouping's 19th summit on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After cheering for the dream of peace, progress and prosperity
of the region on the 19th anniversary of the establishment of the
regional organization, which falls on Tuesday, the leaders will
come back to reality and sit down seriously to talk about peace
and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The wars in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) are expected to dominate the political agenda of the Maputo
summit.
</P>
<P>
The continuation of armed conflicts in Angola and the DRC have
affected negatively on the economic stability, macro-economic
management and investor confidence in the directly involved
countries as well as the SADC region at large.
</P>
<P>
According to a United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
report, Angola' s 1999 human development index continues its
downward trend this year. Of the 174 countries on the list,
Angola ranks 160th, down from the 157th position last year.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Minister of Assistance and Resettlement Albino Malungo
has said that his country is in need of about 200 million U.S.
dollars in humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
Angola has accused Zambia and Mozambique of transporting arms
to the rebels of the National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA), making the originally friendly relations sour,
which also affects bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Angola, as it is fighting its own resurgent civil war, has sent
troops to prop up the government of Congolese President Laurent
Kabila. But Angola and the Congo are among those in dire need for
food, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in an
annual report on the food supply situation and crop prospects in
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
Time and again the efforts of so many countries and even the
international community for economic progress are just annihilated
by old and new armed conflicts with all their consequences of
human suffering and destruction of property, jobs and
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, after a promising and all too brief a period, SADC's
progress has dimmed within the past year.

<P>
The SADC achieved a positive economic growth rate of 1.7
percent in 1998, a quite disappointing performance compared with
the sound growth rate of 2. 7 percent in 1997 and the even more
encouraging growth of over four percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Excessive military expenditure diverts resources from human
development. According to the U.N., for the past eight years, the
UNITA rebels in Angola have raised some three to four billion U.S.
dollars through selling diamond and used most of the money to buy
arms.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the war in the Congo has created some 700,000
refugees, many of whom are fleeing to neighboring Tanzania and
Zambia, bringing much burden to the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the year-old conflict in the third largest
African country, some 85 percent of its population are living in
poverty.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Congo recorded a negative growth of 3.5 percent
and the inflation soared up to 180 percent.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts are undermining the prospects for development in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe sent a third of the
country's army to fight for Kabila. The Zimbabwean troops are
expected to return home before Christmas this year.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's inflation was over 32 percent last year and has
averaged above 50 percent in the first half of this year. This is
far from the targeted less than 10 percent which the government
has promised international donors, who have withheld aid over poor
management and governance issues.
</P>
<P>
Striking a sharp contrast to the Angolan case, Mozambique has
been enjoying several years of peace, stability and healthy
development.
</P>
<P>
It has set an encouraging example for the region among its
reconciliation and rebuilding from the ashes of war and
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican President Joaquim Alberro Chissano said his country
is in quick recovery after 16 years of war, with economy growing
at a two-digit rate, the fastest in its history and in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The country's currency is stable and the environment for
economic growth is becoming increasingly better.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment inflow into the country has been increasing
and there has been remarkable progress in health care, power
supply and some other sectors, all thanks to the peace and
stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he was optimistic the national economy
would enjoy further development in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 was set as the Year of Peace and Security in
Africa at the 35th summit of the Organization of the African Unity
(OAU) in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The goal for the peace year is to see an Africa that is at
peace with itself and is able to compete on equal footing with
other regions. The need for security and stability is a
prerequisite for development and progress.
</P>
<P>
The regional leaders should recommit themselves to do
everything possible to free the region from the vicious circle of
poverty, diseases, conflicts and violence.
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, the leaders at the Maputo summit will further their
efforts to pursue peace in Angola and the Congo and stability in
the region as a whole, in a bid to usher in a peaceful and
prosperous SADC in the new millennium.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli and Palestinian officials met Sunday night at the
Erez junction and discussed non-territorial aspects of the Wye
agreement to be implemented next month.
</P>
<P>
A joint Israeli-Palestinian committee has begun working on a
list of prisoners to be released. A Palestinian source said they
are hoping for the release of at least 100 political prisoners
next month.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton is pushing for a quick
implementation of the Wye agreement, according to a letter he
sent to Prime Minister Ehud Barak over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The presidential message, following a phone conversation
between the two leaders on Thursday, added to a flurry of
U.S. pressure on Israel. The U.S. diplomatic messages concede that
they know Barak wants to move the process forward, but they
express doubts that his plan to turn the third withdrawal into
part of the final status deal will win Palestinian support.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- A large explosion taking place in a remote-controlled toy
car storeroom shocked Hebron Sunday night. Palestinian police
said the warehouse was a "explosives workshop" and the explosion
was apparently a terrorist "work accident." A Subaru, which was
apparently being prepared to be a car bomb, was found in the area.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian police are searching for two Hamas activists
who were suspected of preparing a car bomb, which prematurely
exploded in Hebron Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were apparently planning to use remote control of
toy car to activate the device without killing themselves.

<HEADLINE> Israel's National Airline Mulls Shifting to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel's national airline El
Al is considering revamping the airline's fleet and shifting to
smaller planes.
</P>
<P>
The board of directors of El Al will decide in the near future
on the proposed changes, local daily Haaretz said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was raised by an international consulting group
which urged the national carrier to make an urgent change in its
mix of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
El Al currently has 13 Boeing 747 jumbo jets, which fly the
bulk of El Al's trans-Atlantic flights. Each of these planes can
carry about 450 passengers.
</P>
<P>
The consulting group has studied the economic feasibility of
the El Al's moving to smaller aircraft for its long-distance
routes.
</P>
<P>
Planes with 300 to 350 seats, it found, could offer greater
flexibility and cost savings for destinations like the United
States, South Africa, China, Thailand and India.
</P>
<P>
Likely candidates for these mid-sized aircraft include the
Boeing 777 and Airbus A-340.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, El Al's fourth new Boeing 737 arrived last
week. These narrow-bodied aircraft can carry an average of about
140 passengers and are intended to serve the company's European
routes.
</P>
<P>
In addition to these 747s and 737s, El Al's fleet also
includes six Boeing 767s, designed to carry about 200 passengers,
and nine Boeing 757s with a seating capacity of about 190 people.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Major Breakthrough in Oil Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Dagang Oilfield, a
subsidiary of the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has found a
large oil and gas field in Guqianshan near the port city of
Tianjin in north China, with oil resources forecast at 100 million
tonnes.
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant breakthrough in onshore oil and gas
exploration in the eastern part of China ", said a CNPC official
today.
</P>
<P>
Guqianshan has an oil-and gas-bearing area of 60 square
kilometers. A total of 15 oil- and gas-bearing blocks have been
drilled in the recent exploration which adopted the latest
technologies.
</P>
<P>
Rich oil and gas flows have been found in the No.7, 8 and 4
wells in the Guqianshan exploration area.
</P>
<P>
The most important finding has been in the No.7 well. With
thickness of oil layer extending 100 meters, the well has a daily
oil and gas output of 609 cubic meters and 454,000 cubic meters,
respectively, equivalent to 1,000 tonnes of crude in total.
</P>
<P>
The Dagang Oilfield, launched in 1964, has developed an annual
oil production capacity of over four million tonnes, and has
produced cumulatively 100 million tonnes of crude oil so far.
</P>
<P>
However, through 30 years of exploration, the proven oil
reserves here are on the decline.
</P>
<P>
To maintain sustainable oil development in the next century,
the oilfield has blazed new trails and introduced lots of advanced
technologies from abroad, which helped it broaden exploration
areas.
</P>
<P>
The success in oil and gas exploration in Guqianshan will
provide references for exploration in similar geological
structures in the Bohai Bay areas, said the CNPC official.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Reveals New Method to Track Plant Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand scientists have
revealed "a world-leading technology" able to track the very
growth processes of living plants, the Dominion newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The technology is the result of a unique collaboration of New
Zealand's nuclear and plant scientists, making it possible to
study plant growth processes by tracing the progress of carbon
atoms injected into plants," the Wellington-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Announced by HortResearch plant scientist Michael Thorpe and
the Geological and Nuclear Sciences Institute's isotope
applications manager, Peter Roberts, the sophisticated technique
allows scientists to follow the natural movement of carbohydrates
to different plant parts by tracing an injection of radioactive
carbon.
</P>
<P>
It also allows them to examine the minute sap of plant cells
down to a British billionth of a liter -- a million millionth.
</P>
<P>
"Impressively, the breakthrough extends earlier technology that
allowed scientists to follow the progress of short-lived atoms but
with longer-term tracking -- till recently, impossible," the
Dominion said.
</P>
<P>
Understanding the plant processes is a necessary step on the
way towards improved plantings, aiming at better quality crops,
less variability in produce, increased growth rates and the like,
Dr. Thorpe was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Roberts said that the carbon element allowing longer-term
tracking has previously been almost impossible to detect in the
plants.
</P>
<P>
The institute's tracer provides enormous increases in
sensitivity, he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: SADC to Redouble Efforts for Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Efforts for economic growth will
get a boost at the summit of the 14-member Southern African
Development Community (SADC) which celebrates its 19th anniversary
this week.
</P>
<P>
The summit, planned for August 18 and to be preceded by grand
celebrations one day earlier, is seen as the "last-ditch effort"
by the group by the end of the century to press ahead with its
plan for economic growth and a free trade zone that has hit snags.
</P>
<P>
The "sluggish" economic growth and projected food shortage in
the region will cast a shadow on the summit, SADC officials said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the SADC region recorded a positive growth of 1.7
percent, down from the 2.7 percent of 1997 and the four percent
recorded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The region's strongest economy, South Africa, was the main
contributor to the slump having recorded a mere 0.2 percent growth
last year. The conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) exacerbated the situation.
</P>
<P>
"The continuation of the armed conflicts in Angola and the DRC
also impacted negatively on the economic stability, macro-economic
management and investor confidence in the directly involved
countries as well as the SADC region at large," the grouping said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The SADC secretariat predicted a growth rate of three to 3.5
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Crop failures caused by floods and drought worsened food
shortages in the region, inflicted a cereal deficit of 2.88
million tons for the 1999/ 2000 market year, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
SADC's projected maize harvest forecast of 15.14 million tons
marked a production decline of 11 percent from 1997/98 maize
output of 17.05 million tons. The region's annual consumption is
around 19.27 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, SADC's plans to cobble a free trade agreement in the
region have suffered a serious setback, following failure by
negotiators to resolve differences on clothing and textiles.
</P>
<P>
Trade negotiators, meeting in Lusaka, Zambia earlier this
month, failed to meet their deadline for agreeing on a regional
free trade area. There was little progress made by the 11
participating countries on reducing tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Member countries like South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho
and Swaziland had asked for more time to consider reducing tariffs
on selected products considered "sensitive".
</P>
<P>
Countries in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) were not
 satisfied that imports "dumped" in the SADC area from places such
as Europe would not take advantage of the SADC free trade zone to
find their way into the SACU area, according to press reports.
</P>
<P>
Stimulating economic growth remained a challenge for the SADC,
said South African Foreign Minister Nkosazana Zuma.
</P>
<P>
Greater economic cooperation and adequate and effective moves
toward economic growth drew the spotlight of the just-concluded
two-day ministerial meeting, Zuma told a press conference Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting approved two drafted protocols, one on wildlife
conservation and law enforcement and the other on health, said
Zuma.
</P>
<P>
The SADC summit was expected to pave the way for the
implementation of some ratified protocols and for the ratification
of other protocols that have been worked out, Zuma added.
</P>
<P>
The summit will stress the need for consideration of whether
regional governments were ready to pool their resources to effect
rapid socio- economic development, according to conference
sources.
</P>
<P>
It was equally important for the SADC member countries to
redouble their commitment and act in a true African spirit to
ensure that the new millennium became the golden age for Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Are we ready as a region to use the full potential of all our
people without regard to race, tribal, religious and other
artificial affiliations? " one official asked.
</P>
<P>
The SADC summit will have to give an answer, said another SADC
official.

<HEADLINE> China to Hold Urban Household Sample Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS) announced today that it will hold a sample survey
on essential conditions of urban households in September.
</P>
<P>
The survey will select 150,000 households as samples in 266 big
and medium-sized cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
The questionnaire of the survey includes family size,
employment, household business, cash income, consumption
expenditure, housing, education, social security, possession of
and intent to buy durable consumer goods and preference of
consumption.
</P>
<P>
According to a NBS official, the information to be obtained
about household consumption is crucial for both the government and
enterprises to make economic policies and for operational
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Since the sample survey was first introduced 1980, it has
provided scientific basis for the government to formulate macro-
economic policies and enterprises to make management decisions.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the survey to be conducted in September
is one of the largest ever held in recent years.
</P>
<P>
NBS Director Liu Hong has sent letters to the 150,000 sampled
households to explain about the survey, which is to be conducted
jointly by the NBS, the State Development Planning Commission, the
Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry
of Labor and Social Security, the Development Research Center
under the State Council, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
and the All-China Women's Federation.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for SADC/COMESA Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
called on Southern African Development Community (SADC) and Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to merge, saying
there were currently overlaps in their functions.
</P>
<P>
Jochem Krebs, head of the EU delegation in Zambia, said all
over the world, organizations were merging and working as single
fronts for their causes.
</P>
<P>
The EU found it difficult to decide on which organization to
deal with between the two and conclude trade and economic
agreements, Krebs was quoted by Monday's Zambia Daily Mail
newspaper as saying here in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Recently, some local business organizations also indicated
their wish to see the unification of SADC and COMESA. They argued
that while SADC was more political during the fight against
colonialism, its role has become more economic like COMESA now.
</P>
<P>
They said the behind-the-scene fights going on between the two
organizations were not healthy at all as they tend to retard the
organizations from focusing on the main issue of creating wealth
in the region.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Soldiers Injured in Congo: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Some Ugandan soldiers were
injured in clashes with Rwandan troops in Kisangani, the third
largest city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), over
the weekend, a senior Ugandan defense official told Xinhua Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Steven Kavuma, State Minister for Defense, said: "The fighting
is unexpected and Ugandan troops suffered some injuries."
</P>
<P>
When asked about the cause for the clashes, he said it is being
 investigated and diplomatic efforts are being made to resolve the
crisis between Kigali and Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports said here that Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart Pasteur Bizimungu as well as
Rwandan Defense Minister Paul Kagame would meet Monday to discuss
their disparities.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops were involved in two clashes at
Kisangani airport over the weekend. Both sides are accusing the
other of starting the fight.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda, who have been backing the rebels in the DRC,
are said to have differences in strategies to be used to topple
Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Since the main DRC rebel group -- the Congolese Rally for
Democracy (RCD)

split on May 19, Kigali and Kampala began to choose sides,
supporting rival factions of the RCD.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Key to Border Peace: U.N. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel can not expect security
along its northern borders if the Palestinian refugees are
prevented from returning to their original home and are forced to
remain in Lebanon, a senior U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
Timur Goksel, political advisor of the U.N. peacekeeping
troops in south Lebanon, made the comments in an interview with
the Daily Star published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said if there is no satisfactory outcome to the fate of the
estimated 350,000 Palestinian refugees, then they will become a
testing problem for Lebanon as well as for the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
"Aside from the humanitarian issue, unchecked, uncontrolled and
unwanted Palestinians are not going to contribute to Israel's
security," the official added.
</P>
<P>
During a trip to Washington in July, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak suggested that a resolution of the Palestinian refugee
dilemma be found in their host countries.
</P>
<P>
Barak's comments triggered alarm bells in Beirut where the
government adamantly rejects the possibility of settling the
Palestinians permanently in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese authorities fear that the move would tip the delicate
sectarian balance that guarantees the peaceful coexistence
between Muslims and Christians in post-civil war Lebanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The police department of
Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), has seized more than one
ton of drugs in 167 cases in the first seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,008 kilograms narcotics, including hashish, heroin,
opium, marijuana, were confiscated in the 167 cases involving 246
criminals, according to statistics from the Dubai Police Criminal
Investigation Department.
</P>
<P>
Col. Khalfan Khalfan, director of the department, stressed
the importance of coordination among different emirates of the
UAE in fighting drug trafficking, the Gulf News daily reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This constant coordination has been made more effective after
the organization of the Drug Control Committee headed by Dhahi
Tamim, the Dubai Police chief," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for closer cooperation among drug control
departments in the world to help monitor and stop inter-state drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Due to its important position as a regional trade center,
"Dubai has been made a transit station for drug smugglers," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
"The amount entering the country is far more than the demand
of consumers, but traffickers always seek ways to distribute to
other countries in the region via Dubai," he added.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Vice-President Against Legalizing Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti has said that abortion should never be legalized, claiming
that it is against the sanctity and dignity of human life.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Monday quoted Saitoti as saying that
abortion was acceptable only when a mother's life was endangered
by a fetus.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Julius Meme, chief civil servant in Kenyan
Health Ministry, called for legalizing abortion, which triggered a
growing row over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Meme contended that existing laws on abortion were colonial and
 too strict in the modern society.
</P>
<P>
He said legalizing abortion would save women from shying away
from help with doctors and therefore secure their lives and
health.
</P>
<P>
Legalizing abortion has encountered strong opposition from the
Catholic Church, which has many followers in Kenya.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's first batch of
Exchange Fund Notes (EFNs) was listed Monday at the Stock Exchange
of Hong Kong, offering retail investors an attractive and reliable
investment opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the 57 issues of
EFNs listed Monday were worth 34 billion HK dollars (4.36 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Economists called the listing a milestone in the development of
Hong Kong's debt market, as Hong Kong has long attached a
disproportionate reliance on the banking and equity markets.
</P>
<P>
The EFNs will help channel the savings of the community into
productive investment and improve the efficiency of Hong Kong's
financial intermediation, they noted.
</P>
<P>
They said the EFNs attract a yield higher than that for U.S.
dollar Treasury securities of corresponding maturity. Interests
income from holding the EFNs will be exempt from profits tax and
trading in the paper will be exempt from stamp duty.
</P>
<P>
The Exchange Fund papers are fully backed by Hong Kong's
foreign reserves. For every 780 HK dollars worth of EFNs, there is
100 U.S. dollars held in the Exchange Fund.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Monetary
Authority signed the agreement on the listing on July 19, this
year.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Major Snag to Growth: Kenyan Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Agricultural Minister
Musalia Mudavadi has said the country's leading obstacle to
economic development today is HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
He said Sunday that his government spends a lot of resources to
curb the spread of the disease at the expense of other development
programs, the East African Standard reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister mentioned the increasing number of AIDS orphans
and called for a collective responsibility among all stakeholders
in a bid to control the disease.
</P>
<P>
It is said that to date there are 600,000 AIDS orphans in this
east African country.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi expressed his worry that students both in primary and
secondary school have now fallen prey to the AIDS scourge.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National AIDS Control Program said there will be
400 HIV/AIDS-related deaths a day by 2005 unless Kenyans are to
protect themselves against the scourge.
</P>
<P>
According to surveillance, HIV prevalence in Kenya in the last
eight years has increased from 3.1 percent to 14 percent by the
end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Godfrey Baltazar of the National AIDS Control Program noted
that those infected are people between the age of 15 and 49 and
the impact on the economy was reduction of labor forces by 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Since the first AIDS case was discovered in Kenya in 1984,
500,000 Kenyans have died of the disease. It is expected that
another 200,000 would die from AIDS-related complications by the
end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Banking Restructuring Causes Rupiah Fall: Habibie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie said Monday that problems in the banking restructurization
program and external influences have caused the rupiah
depreciation against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"External influences and problems in banking restructurization
has caused the rupiah depreciation, which has been down to around
8,000 rupiah currently," said Habibie in a state address when
opening the session of the House of Representatives (DPR) for the
1999/2000 period here Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the head of state did not clearly mention the current
Bank Bali scandal which allegedly involved some ranking government
officials as stated by former Bank Bali Director Rudy Ramli over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The scandal has caused a rupiah depreciation from the
6,000-level to the current 7,000-level.
</P>
<P>
Publicly-listed Bank Bali and the Indonesian Bank Restructuring
Agency (IBRA) had allegedly committed a criminal act which also
involved a member of the ruling Golkar Party's central executive
board.
</P>
<P>
Bank Bali allegedly paid Golkar Deputy Treasurer Setyo Novanto
and other businessmen related to Golkar some 550 billion rupiah
(80.86 million dollars) in commission for recovering 904.6 billion
rupiah (about 133 million U.S. dollars) in inter-bank credits.
</P>
<P>
Facing the rupiah's depreciation, Habibie said, the government
has been trying to solve the problems in the banking sector
wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Habibie stressed the importance of the need for
special attention to the management of the state budget in the
future, as national spending may likely increase.
</P>
<P>
"Our state budget for development programs is adequate but for
the years to come national spending may continue to increase
because the country will pay the interest of foreign loans used in
the recapitalization program," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has also launched the restructurization program
in state companies in an effort to lessen the country's dependence
on foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
By listing 49 percent of state companies' stake in the stock
market, the government hopes it could reap 91 billion U.S. dollars
for fiscal year 1999/2000 ending March 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"In the long run the money can be used to repay the foreign
loan," Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, should also raise the national income
from tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
If the country is able to increase the ratio of tax revenue
from the current 11 percent to 16 percent in 2004, the national
income will rise to 5 billion to 7 billion U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
If the national income increases, the salary of civil workers,
military personnel and policemen will be up as well, he added.

<P>
MAPUTO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The heads of state or government
of the 14- member Southern African Development Community (SADC)
are jetting in Maputo, capital of Mozambique, for their 19th
summit on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The leaders will prepare their countries and the region for the
 approaching new millennium by pursuing peace and stability in
southern Africa and promoting regional integration.
</P>
<P>
The organization, originally known as the Southern African
Development Coordination Conference (SADCC), was formed in Zambian
capital Lusaka on April 1, 1980, when nine founding member states
adopted the Lusaka Declaration -- Southern Africa: Toward Economic
Liberation.
</P>
<P>
On August 17, 1992, the SADCC member states signed a treaty
establishing the Southern African Development Community, which
replaced the SADCC.
</P>
<P>
The treaty places binding obligations on member countries, with
the aim of promoting economic integration toward a fully developed
common market.
</P>
<P>
Now the SADC has 14 members: Angola, Botswana, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The community offers world trade, industry and investment
opportunities in a regional market of 199 million people with a
gross domestic product of 176 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 14 members are scheduled to begin tariff reduction from
January 1, 2000 aiming to eventually achieve a SADC free trade
area within five years.
</P>
<P>
Other objectives of the community include: achieving
development and economic growth, alleviating poverty, enhancing
the standard and quality of life of the peoples of southern Africa
and supporting the socially- disadvantaged through regional
integration.
</P>
<P>
Committed to promote and defend peace and security, the SADC is
also aiming to evolve common political values, systems and
institutions by strengthening and consolidating the long-standing
historical, social and cultural affinities and links among the
peoples of the region.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote self-sustaining development on the basis of
 collective self-reliance and the inter-dependence of member
states, the organization has to harmonize political and
socio-economic policies and plans of member states.
</P>
<P>
Through mobilizing the peoples and their institutions to take
initiatives to develop economic, social and cultural ties across
the sub- region and to participate fully in the implementation of
the common programs and projects, the SADC can help achieve
complementarity between national and regional strategies.
</P>
<P>
Facing the looming challenges created by the globalization
process, the SADC shall promote the development of human resources
in the region and promote the development, transfer and mastery of
technology.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the organization shall also manage to secure
international understanding, cooperation and support, mobilize the
inflow of both public and private resources into the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The 19th SADC summit is set to elect its new chairman.
</P>
<P>
Current SADC chairman is South African President Thabo Mbeki
who took the chair of the regional organization after winning the
June 2 election this year.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano is the vice-chairman of
the organization. He is believed to be elected as the new
chairman at the Maputo summit.
</P>
<P>
Kaire Mbuende is the SADC executive secretary.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the community is located in Botswanan
capital Gaborone.

determination, peaceful co-existence and mutual respect among the
nations, and opposes any form of hegemony.

friends and are willing to continue the friendly cooperation with

<HEADLINE> Hunt for Kidnapers Goes on: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A manhunt is going on for the
kidnapers of four foreign tourists and their Iranian guide in
the southern province of Kerman, according to the Iran Daily
newspaper here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Three men and two women armed with automatic weapons abducted
the five hostages from their Kerman hotel. The three Spanish
tourists, two of them priests, were identified as Pedro Garcia,
Joaquin Fernandez and Cosme Puerto, and the Italian captive Mas
simo Cattabriga.
</P>
<P>
The Identity of the Iranian guide is unknown.
</P>
<P>
"The security forces have sealed the roads into Kerman province
and have been mobilized to hunt for the kidnapers by helicopter,"
the paper quoted Abbas Doagooie, director general of political and
security affairs of Kerman province's governorate general, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the kidnapers "are bandits and drug traffickers who
shift back and forth between the Iranian and Pakistani border
areas." In a major operation last Wednesday, security forces
killed four bandits and injured one, who was arrested.
</P>
<P>
"We have hit them hard in the past few months and they probably
retaliated by taking tourists as hostages," Doagooie said.
</P>
<P>
Kerman is known as a transit route for shipment of narcotics
from the "Gold Crescent" overlapping parts of Iran, Pakistan and
Afghanistan to European markets. Three Italians had been kidnaped
in the province in June. They were released a week later after
Interior Ministry intervened to negotiate with the abductors.
</P>
<P>
"We do not think that the act (kidnaping) was politically
motivated. We do not consider the abduction to be linked to the
Afghan crisis either," Doagooie said. Iran supports the Afghan
opposition called Northern Alliance against the ruling Taliban
regime.
</P>
<P>
Local media called the kidnaping as targeting Iran's security,
foreign and domestic investment as well as Iran's international
image, and urged security apparatus to find the root cause of the
problem and solve it as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday condemned the kidnaping,
calling it an "inhuman and ugly" act.

<HEADLINE> HK's First Exchange Fund Notes Listed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's first batch of
Exchange Fund Notes (EFNs) was listed Monday at the Stock Exchange
of Hong Kong, offering retail investors an attractive and reliable
investment opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the 57 issues of
EFNs listed Monday were worth 34 billion HK dollars (4.36 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Economists called the listing a milestone in the development of
Hong Kong's debt market, as Hong Kong has long attached a
disproportionate reliance on the banking and equity markets.
</P>
<P>
The EFNs will help channel the savings of the community into
productive investment and improve the efficiency of Hong Kong's
financial intermediation, they noted.
</P>
<P>
They said the EFNs attract a yield higher than that for U.S.
dollar Treasury securities of corresponding maturity. Interests
income from holding the EFNs will be exempt from profits tax and
trading in the paper will be exempt from stamp duty.
</P>
<P>
The Exchange Fund papers are fully backed by Hong Kong's
foreign reserves. For every 780 HK dollars worth of EFNs, there is
100 U.S. dollars held in the Exchange Fund.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Monetary
Authority signed the agreement on the listing on July 19, this
year.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Organiser, Company Settle Band Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- An international marching band
will perform at next year's Olympic opening ceremony after Sydney
Olympic organisers and the band promoter settled the long-running
dispute outside court in Sydney Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deal, reached by Sydney Organising Committee for Olympic
Games (SOCOG) and World Projects Corporation (WPC), came during an
adjournment just over an hour into a hearing of the case brought
by WPC against SOCOG, at New South Wales state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will see WPC put together a revised band
comprising more Australians, fewer Americans and youngsters from
18 other countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the SOCOG will pay extra 1 million
Australian dollars (660,000 U.S. dollars), which also covers legal
costs for WPC, for the revised band.
</P>
<P>
Australian Olympics Minister Michael Knight said the deal was
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
"While the negotiated compromise is not what either side would
ideally prefer, it is now closer to the concept of a world band,"
Knight said.
</P>
<P>
The number of young Australians will increase by around 400 and
they will be the largest group represented.
</P>
<P>
"WPC has taken full responsibility for reducing the number of
Americans, maintaining the Japanese numbers and recruiting other
young musicians from around the world," Knight added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed last week on a more international band
involving musicians from about 20 countries from all continents
instead of the original comprising of Americans, Australians and
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG had offered to pay WPC extra 800,000 Australian dollars (
528,000 U.S. dollars) to compile the bigger band but the company
was asking for 1.2 million Australian dollars (792,000 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Since the SOCOG changed its decision on the comprising of the
band in June, WPC had pressed ahead with court action against
SOCOS on the band dispute.

<HEADLINE> UAE Confirms Freeze on Unskilled Labor From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Untied Arab Emirates
(UAE) has confirmed a freeze on unskilled manpower from India and
Pakistan, ending weeks of rumor and speculation on this issue.
</P>
<P>
"Fresh recruitment of manual workers from the two countries
has been frozen," the Gulf News daily quoted an official from the
Ministry of Labor as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The freeze on manual labor was due to an increasing number of
jobless manual workers in the UAE from the two countries, said
Mohammed Issa Al Suwaidi, undersecretary for Labor Affairs at the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said surplus workers from the two countries were extremely
high compared with that of other nationalities, adding that the
ministry's policies were based on demand and supply.
</P>
<P>
"Studies show a huge surplus in the numbers of manual workers
from these two countries and suggest that demand is less than the
supply," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The UAE must regulate the labor market by giving opportunities
to jobless people here, instead of bringing in new recruits, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Rumors of a ban began circulating last month, and the
situation was further confused by reports in India that the UAE
had placed a blanket ban on all recruitment.
</P>
<P>
Al Suwaidi confirmed that the ban did not apply to
professional or skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
"Skilled workers who submit certificates showing academic
qualifications will be granted employment visas," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Skilled people are still coming from these two and other
countries, and their entry is allowed at any time," he added.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is a large market for foreign labors. Among its
current population of around 2.7 million, two-thirds are
expatriates, notably Indians and Pakistanis.

HARARE, August 16 (Xinhua) -- As new evidence suggests that the
first person to die of AIDS could have been in the United States
of America in the early 1960s, the Western world should apologize

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Libraries Urged to Exploit IT Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Energy,
Communications and Multimedia Minister Leo Moggie Monday asked
libraries in the country to upgrade the conventional library
services by fully exploiting the latest information technology
(IT) available.
</P>
<P>
Libraries should plan and develop knowledge and information
products and services to fulfill the changing needs of library
users and to support the development of the National Information
and Knowledge Infrastructure, he said when opening a three-day
Conference and Workshop on Digital Library here.
</P>
<P>
The conference, themed "Global Access and National Identity"
and jointly organized by the National Library, the Librarians'
Association of Malaysia and University Putra Malaysia, is held in
conjunction with August being the national reading month.
</P>
<P>
Leo Moggie said tremendous amount of information are being
published everyday, especially via the World Wide Web, and
libraries therefore face the challenge of how to systematically
manage and preserve digital resources available on CD-ROMs, VCDs,
DVDs and online databases.
</P>
<P>
Multimedia digital libraries in the next millennium need to be
effective repositories of knowledge and information by ensuring
easy, quick and reliable access to global multimedia resources,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Libraries of the future would be able to provide not only
24-hour online service to the global community, but also function
as a gateway to digital information resources and as one-stop
knowledge and information centers through proper utilization of
communications infrastructure, he said, adding this will expedite
the acculturation of IT and knowledge among Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian National Library has recently acquired a
digitization system at a cost of 300,000 ringgit (about 79,000
U.S. dollars) to convert publications to digital format.

<TEXT>
<P>
The move was aimed at easing the unemployment crisis and
boosting economic activity following a two-year recession.
</P>
<P>
Budget Bureau Director Sawasdiparp Kanthatham was quoted as
saying that as of July 31, the five ministries and seven
departments involved in the program reported that a total of
44,015 jobs had been created for educated job-seekers.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government expects to create a total of 86,000 jobs
for educated people to cover those hit by the economic crisis and
new graduates.
</P>
<P>
The government also expects to create another 400,000 unskilled
jobs, mainly in rural areas, to cope with the return of labor from
Bangkok and the big cities. The emphasis is on irrigation, small
infrastructure and community enhancement, which will be given more
than 20 billion baht (541 million U.S. dollars) by the program.
</P>
<P>
The program is mainly financed by a 53-billion baht (1.4
billion dollars) loan from Japan's Miyazawa Fund, which was set up

SHANGHAI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Customs Bureau
handled 32.9 billion US dollars-worth of imports and exports in
the first half of this year, accounting for one fifth of China's
total.
</P>
<P>
The amount was 21 percent more than that of the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attributed the growth mainly to the improvement
of the internal management of the customs operations and a
successful crackdown on smuggling.
</P>
<P>
This year, the bureau has taken a series of measures, including
simplifying formalities and introducing advanced inspection
equipment and technology, to increase efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an electronic information center linked to concerned
departments, such as commodity inspection, foreign exchange
administration and taxation, has been established.

<P>
The bureau has also stepped up its efforts to crack down on
smuggling, and confiscated large amounts of smuggled goods, such

BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A headless stone statue dating
back to the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) has been discovered in the

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Revamp Local Government Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government will
examine the recommendations by a commission of inquiry and take
necessary steps to reform local government institutions, the
Presidential Secretariat said Monday.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga appointed the Commission of Inquiry on
Local Government Reforms in February, 1998, the second of its kind
in the country. The first is the Choksy Commission set up in 1953.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was due to public agitation for reforms as it
was considered that the system of local government prevailing in
the country required reorganization, the secretariat said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The commission has provided opportunities to the public to
submit views in writing or give oral evidence, it said.
</P>
<P>
The commission handed over its report to the president last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
During its inquiry, the commission examined 331 memoranda and
heard the evidence of 237 persons. Several seminars and workshops
were also organized to consult the heads of local authorities and
those involved in local government administration.
</P>
<P>
The commission also examined several aspects of local
administration pertaining to legal affairs, institutional
arrangements, the electoral system and the functioning of wards
and standing committees.
</P>
<P>
It also examined the formulation of national policy, the
functions of local authorities and the election and functions of
mayors and chairmen of local bodies.
</P>
<P>
The commission specially looked into financial management of
local institutions and have come up with proposals for significant
changes in local administration.

<HEADLINE> Universal Postal Union Says Postal Service Faced With Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Postal reforms should be placed
under government control and the recent trend of privatization in
some countries should not be encouraged, according to Thomas
Leavey, director general of the Universal Postal Union (UPU).
</P>
<P>
The UPU chief made the remarks during an exclusive interview
with Xinhua at the UPU headquarters in the Swiss capital of Berne
before he left for Beijing to attend the 22nd Universal Postal
Congress scheduled from August 23 to September 15.
</P>
<P>
He said that the congress in Beijing is an extremely important
event for the worldwide postal community at the turn of the
century when postal services face many new challenges.
</P>
<P>
The UPU chief stressed that while it is necessary for postal
services to adjust to technological developments, they should not
forget their commitment to fulfill the public service obligations
mandated by their governments.
</P>
<P>
Their role in the development of communications is vital, not
only as a means of exchanging information, but also as a way of
maintaining and promoting social cohesion, he said.
</P>
<P>
As competition in postal services is becoming more and more
intense, Leavey said, the UPU is trying to help developing
countries, providing them with 2.5 million Swiss francs (about 1.6
million U.S. dollars) from the UPU budget for technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
"The 49 least developed countries get the priority," he said,
adding the UPU also seeks more assistance from other international
agencies such as the World Bank, regional development banks, and
the United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
"We have made an effort to try to improve the infrastructure of
developing countries," the UPU chief said. "That of course would
help improve the quality of service."

<HEADLINE> Private Schools Thrive in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 16 (Xinhua) -- When night falls in this
capital of south China's Guangdong Province, thousands of people
do not hurry home; instead they rush to night schools.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all these schools are privately funded and provide
education from kindergarten to higher-learning courses.
</P>
<P>
Private schools first appeared in the city in 1979. Now, there
are 516 private kindergartens, 65 private high schools and over 50
private higher-learning institutes. It is said that some 2.6
million people have been trained in these schools so far.
</P>
<P>
Courses offered by these private schools are very market-
oriented, which is one of the main differences between private
schools and public schools in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, when the city became one of the first
trailblazers in China to open for overseas investment, there was a
big demand for people proficient in foreign languages. As a result,
private schools soon took on the role of offering language courses.
</P>
<P>
Then, in the early 1990s accountancy became a hot subject.
Private schools easily adjusted to offer related courses.
</P>
<P>
So far, computer, MBA and English courses are the most popular
choices in private schools. But more varieties of courses are
springing up, as people now have more money in their pockets. They
include dancing and body-building.

<HEADLINE> Manila Declares Moratorium on New Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank
suspended indefinitely the issuance of new bank licenses over the
weekend to further encourage mergers and acquisitions in the
industry, The Philippine Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the Central Bank Governor Rafael Buenaventura
as saying that "we have frozen all applications for new bank
licenses," and the central bank would assess which areas
nationwide are "overbanked or underbanked."
</P>
<P>
On top of the moratorium, the Central Bank also wants to impose
an increase in the minimum capitalization requirement for new
banks for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
Banks have to fully comply with the mandatory 20 percent to 60
percent hike in capital by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
"As a rule, I would like to see people buying existing banks.
They should merge first before the suspension is lifted,"
Buenaventura elaborated, noting that "in fact, a lot of bargains"
could be found presently at the system.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura disclosed that the Central Bank is even planning
to grant incentives to banks expanding operations in places which
lack banking services.
</P>
<P>
The governor said it was imperative for banks to consolidate to
survive the tightening competition and the irreversible trend of
globalization as these demand higher capital and resources.
</P>
<P>
He had earlier predicted that as a result of the tighter
capital build-up program which he plans to increase some more in
2001, around three to six mega-banks would dominate the business
with the smaller ones turning as "niche players" over the long
term.
</P>
<P>
It is also the objective to the new governor to stimulate the
creation of at least three all-Filipino regional banks within his
six-year tenure.

<HEADLINE> Drug Addiction Becoming A Threat in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Some experts in Indonesia have
raised alarm against the rapid increase in the number of drug
addicts in the country, The Jakarta Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The experts said some 1.3 million Indonesians are drug abusers
and addicts, inflicting a heavy social and economic burden on the
crisis-stricken country.
</P>
<P>
If one affected person spends some 100,000 rupiah (12.65 U.S.
dollars) a day to satisfy his addiction, a total amount of 47.45
trillion rupiah (about 6 million dollars) are then wasted each
year on drug abuse by all of the estimated drug addicts, not
counting the social economic cost of drug-related diseases such as
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta alone there are 130,000 of them, said David Gordon,
an internationally renowned AIDS and drug addiction consultant.
</P>
<P>
"This number will grow rapidly in the next few years. The
number of people affected by drug-related diseases will also grow.
Not only HIV/AIDS, but also other sexually transmitted diseases
and hepatitis due to the use of unsterilized syringes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asliati Asril, who is a psychiatrist at the Fatmawati Drug
Addiction Hospital, said her hospital treated 400 addicts in 1995
and 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The number reached 600 in 1997 and 700 in 1998," she said.
</P>
<P>
The number of patients out of hospitals also increased rapidly,
from 1,500 in 1996 to about 4,000 in the first five months of 1999
alone, Asliati said.

<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua)-- China's State Development
Planning Commission (SDPC) plans to establish a "relatively
complete" legal system for price regulation by the end of next
year, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The system, based on rules and regulations on price management,
price control and supervision and investigation into pricing work,
is to be set up on the basis of the Price Law.
</P>
<P>
"In line with the new economic situation, the SDPC will adopt
policies and draft regulations to encourage the expansion of
domestic market demand," an official of the commission was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Using the pricing lever to promote economic growth is very
important in the current market-oriented economy, the official
said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Grain Purchase Prices Lowered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Procurement prices for wheat and
early indica rice have been significantly reduced in China, as a
major step to phase out shoddy or unmarketable grain strains,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Henan and Shandong provinces in east and central China have
slashed wheat purchase prices by 16.4 percent from 1997 levels to
1.27 yuan (0.15 US dollars) per kilogram this year. Inferior
strains of early indica rice in south China have been marketed at
prices below production cost, according to statistics from the
State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said that some low-quality grain varieties,
which do not sell well, fill storage facilities, but farmers in
many regions are still churning them out.
</P>
<P>
To guide farmers towards optimizing their crop-growing mixes
and to produce more high-quality crops, China will remove some of
the inferior grain strains from the long-standing "State
protective price list" in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Grains affected include spring wheat in northeast China, wheat
from areas south of the Yangtze River, and indica rice in south
China.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from this year, the State will purchase grain
varieties at lower protective prices.
</P>
<P>
"Protective prices for wheat and indica rice in most areas are
about 62 yuan and 50 yuan per 50 kilograms," said Wang Zhaoyang,
an official of the SDPC's farm produce division.
</P>
<P>
The price gap between different qualities of grain strains
increased, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
China planted 7.6 million hectares of early rice this year,
with an area dedicated to high-quality strains increasing by 530,
000 hectares to 2.8 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
Acreage used for higher grade wheat varieties increased to 2.7
million hectares this year, and the country's summer grain output
rose by 4.7 percent over last year's to 118.49 million tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Sino-Japanese non-governmental

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Navy on Sunday
night seized two suspicious vessels off the northwestern coast,
naval officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the two vessels were suspected to have been
engaged in smuggling people or goods between northwestern Sri
Lanka and southern India.
</P>
<P>
The first vessel, a fibre glass dingy, was detected about 11
p.m. off Talaimannar, over 300 kilometers north of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The three Tamils aboard were returning home after transporting
24 Tamil refugees to India, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The next vessel was an Indian boat which the navy discovered 20
minutes later and seized it together with nine persons, three of
whom were males while the others were women and children.
</P>
<P>
The second boat also carried a cargo of textiles.
</P>
<P>
The two boats and those detained have been handed over to the
Talaimannar police for investigation.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, plagued by a 16-year-old ethnic civil war, has been
keeping close watch over the sea off its north and northwest to
curb the smuggling activities of Tamil rebels who demand a
separate homeland in the country's north and east.

<P>
HARARE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe blanketed Eriteria for a
4-0 victory in an African Cup of Nations qualifying match on
Sunday in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Sawu scored the goals in the 68th, 73rd and 90th minute of the
game after Adam Ndlovu had opened the scoring at the 61st minute.
</P>
<P>
The win by Zimbabwe was described by coach Clemens Westerhof as
a major step towards qualifying for the African Nations Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
The coach said Zimbabwe's chances were bright but were now
hanging on Eriteria beating or drawing with Senegal in the last
match of the round robin qualifying matches next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe now is in top position with nine points and Senegal is
the second with six points.
</P>
<P>
It is, however, likely that the qualifying group would be
decided on goal difference as analysts are predicating that
Senegal would beat Eriteria who they walloped by six goals to two
in the reverse match.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Eriteria and Senegal were placed in a round robin
group for the African Cups of Nations Qualifiers after the
Confederation of African Football stripped Zimbabwe of hosting the
finals citing poor facilities.
</P>
<P>
The finals would be jointly hosted by Ghana and Nigeria early
next year.

<HEADLINE> Sautin Confident for Top Form at Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian diving ace Dimitry Sautin
said here on Sunday he was confident for displaying his top form
at next year's Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"I will be in great shape, in very good form," Sautin told
Xinhua after winning the 10 meters platform at the Military World
Games here.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Olympics champion showed he was still a class of
his own on Sunday after having an operation in his waist in
January.
</P>
<P>
He scored 668.07 points for the victory, 37 points higher than
second-placed Roman Volodkov of Ukraine at 631.68.
</P>
<P>
China's Liu Junhong was third at 613.62 while Peng Bo, who beat
Sautin to second in a springboard event, finished only fifth.
</P>
<P>
"I have a better form today," said Sautin, adding that his
secret for success was to practice.
</P>
<P>
"Only practice works," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Fails to Anticipate Progress of Thailand, Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The National Olympic Committee
of Indonesia (KONI) admitted it failed to anticipate the rapid
progress made by Thailand and Malaysia at the Southeast Asian (SEA)
Games which finished on Sunday, The Indonesian Observer reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The miscalculation allowed the two countries to trample over
the Indonesian contingent. Failure to achieve the team's medal
targets was attributed to the federation's ignorance of the
strength of the other two teams. Consequently, chances of gold
simply evaporated.
</P>
<P>
One week before the departure for Brunei, chief de mission M.
Hindarto and his aide Imron ZS were still optimistic that the
contingent would garner somewhere between 60 and 70 gold medals.
However, the final result was a mere 44.
</P>
<P>
Rudolf Warouw, KONI vice chairman, said the failure should be
shared collectively, and is not a question of blame.
</P>
<P>
"A scapegoat is not needed. What is more important is how to
prepare for the Sydney Olympics and the 2001 SEA Games in Kuala
Lumpur," he said.
</P>
<P>
KONI will immediately call the sporting federations together
for consultation and evaluation of the athletes' performance in
each event, he added.
</P>
<P>
The results of the 20th SEA Games indicates Indonesia is now
lagging behind in athletics, swimming, cycling, shooting,
billiards and bowling, which are events requiring skill rather
than judgement.
</P>
<P>
"We should be making more of an effort in our talent scouting
exercises, because as long as we remain unable to catch up in
those sports, and they are sports which contain a huge number of
gold medals, we are doomed to failure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Athletics and swimming events at the Brunei SEA Games provided
a total of 78 gold medals of which Thailand harvested 33, Malaysia
19, while Indonesia managed only 10.
</P>
<P>
"KONI should now give priority to athletics and swimming,"
Warouw said.

<HEADLINE> Davenport, Hingis Upset in Acura Classic Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- For the second straight week,
American Lindsay Davenport came up short while trying to defend a
singles title in her hometown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Davenport was surprised by unseeded Julie Halard-Decugis of
France 6-3, 7-5 Saturday night in the semifinals of the Acura
Classic tennis event.
</P>
<P>
Halard-Decugis will make her fifth appearance of the year in a
WTA Tour final on Sunday, facing sixth-seeded American teenager
Serena Williams. Williams surprised second seed Martina Hingis of
Switzerland 6-3, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Davenport committed 32 unforced errors as she lost for only
third time in her last 23 matches in California. The reigning
Wimbledon champion, Davenport had her season record fall to 37-8
and her hardcourt mark drop to 22-5.
</P>
<P>
Serena Williams defeated Hingis for the second time in five all-
time meetings, avenging a straight-set loss in last year's
quarterfinals. Currently ranked 11th in the world, Williams will
be trying for her third title of the year on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Serena Williams Wins Acura Classic Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Serena Williams went one
step further than her elder sister Venus did a week ago --
defeating the current world No. 1 in the semifinals and winning a
tournament.
</P>
<P>
One day after knocking off top-ranked Martina Hingis, Serena
Williams cruised to her third title of the season today with a 6-1,
6-4 victory over Julie Halard-Decugis of France in the final of
the $520,000 Acura Classic here.
</P>
<P>
Seeded sixth, Serena Williams broke her French opponent twice
in each set as she moved within one of matching Venus' four 1999
victories. The younger Williams won $80,000.
</P>
<P>
With her victory today, Serena Williams will move up two spots
to No. 9 when the new WTA rankings are released Monday. That will
equal Serena's previous career-high ranking, which she held for a
three-week stretch in April.
</P>
<P>
Playing her first event since the French Open, Serena Williams
dropped only one set in five matches. She improved her season
record to 31-6, including 24-3 on hardcourts.
</P>
<P>
The unseeded Halard-Decugis was in her fifth finals appearance
this season after upsetting Davenport in the semifinals yesterday.
The Frenchwoman's performance this week will allow her to leap
five spots to a career-high No. 11 in next week's rankings.
</P>
<P>
Halard-Decugis, 28, continued one of the great comeback stories
in recent memory. She did not compete for more than a year due to
wrist and knee injuries before returning to action in January 1998
and winning two tournaments last season. This year, she has won
two titles and finished runner-up in three others.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Beats Rafter to Win ATP Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- World No. 1 Pete Sampras of
the United States beat world No. 2 Patrick Rafter of Australia 7-6
(9-7), 6-3 Sunday to win the $2.45 million ATP Championship for
his 60th tournament title in Mason, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who has won 22 consecutive matches and four
tournaments this year, served 12 aces, landing 67 percent of his
first serves.
</P>
<P>
"From the first couple of games, I felt like my rhythm was
there," Sampras said. "I felt I was hitting big, and I was hitting
close to the line."
</P>
<P>
Sampras said he was surprised that so many of his serves were
clocked over 130 mph. "We played at a time when it was hot and dry
and the ball was going through the air very quick," Sampras said
of the early evening match. "Two guys who serve and volley very
well on a quick court with really quick conditions and balls, I
think we both were struggling to return serve."
</P>
<P>
Sampras is 9-4 against Rafter, but Rafter had beaten Sampras
three straight times.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, who has won the past two U.S. Opens, received treatment
for his shoulder during and after the match and said it would have
to fully mend for him to defend his Open title.
</P>
<P>
After this triumph, Sampras will continue rank as the No. 1
player in ATP Tour points when the new rankings were released
Monday. It will be his record 273rd week at No. 1.
