FOXY STRATEGY PAID OFF

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ After the Travis Knight tryout, the Dennis
Rodman experiment, a dash of Robert Horry and heavy doses of J.R.
Reid, the Los Angeles Lakers' season-long game of power-forward
roulette continued Wednesday. And the spinning wheel settled on an
unlikely candidate to take on the Spurs' Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox. All 6 feet, 7 inches and 242 pounds of him. Bodying up
against the 7 feet and 255 pounds of Duncan, the Spurs' second-year
forward and MVP candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The goofy part is it worked.
</P>
<P>
   Until Duncan's game-winning jumpshot _ when Fox was on the bench
_ Duncan had made 7 of 18 shots for 19 points, hardly a devastating
performance. Most of those misses came with Fox guarding Duncan,
swiping the ball from him twice. In the second and third quarters,
Duncan was 2 for 9 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not only happy with (Fox's defense), but I think J.R.
(Reid) did a good job on him, too,'' coach Kurt Rambis said. ``We
did a much better job _ we were much more aggressive in our drops
and digs, we were much more aggressive in our traps. Even though we
still messed it up now and again, we were much more
aggressive-minded defensively throughout the entire ballgame than
we were in Game 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a small forward who's also spent long minutes at shooting
guard, is more than happy to take on the task of slowing the
multitalented Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty confident that I can play adequate post
defense,'' he said. ``I would say that we had some success. It
wasn't great success _ we didn't come away with the win. But if I'm
asked to do that again, I welcome that challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis said the Lakers will use the small lineup again and try
to exploit it further, especially on offense, where Duncan has to
step away from the basket to guard the quicker Fox on the
perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do a very good job of getting Rick involved to put
pressure on Duncan,'' Rambis said. ``That's something to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis is mulling one other unique lineup, but he won't say what
it is. The Lakers have already used 6-7 Kobe Bryant at point guard
once and might do it again.
</P>
<P>
   __ History: In the L.A. era, the Lakers have been down 0-2 in a
series 14 times. They came back to win the series only once, in the
1969 Western Division Finals against San Francisco. In 1995 the
Lakers were also down 0-2 to San Antonio in the conference
semifinals, and lost 4-2.

 By STEPHEN LABATON and DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Every year around August or September, the senior
executives from the world's largest producers of vitamins would
gather clandestinely for a few days at a European hotel or an
executive's home for what some called the ``top-notch meeting'' and
others the ``summit conference'' to plan ``the budget for Vitamin
Inc,'' federal prosecutors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They said the meeting set production quotas, prices and
distribution for vitamin ingredients that were used to enrich
products in every refrigerator and kitchen cabinet in America, from
morning supplemental pills to enriched milk and orange juice,
fortified breakfast cereals, breads, butters and meats. The global
market for such vitamins as A, B2 (riboflavin), B5, C, E and Beta
Carotene would be divided among the participants to the
half-percentage point, the prosecutors said. A few months later,
according to the officials, the budget would be reviewed by
mid-level executives to determine whether everything was working as
planned, or whether the details should be adjusted to reflect
corporate profits and world-wide demand.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno and her aides Thursday described in
detail a decade-long vitamin cartel that they said had been
shattered in one of the largest criminal prosecutions ever made by
the Justice Department. In a federal court in Dallas, F.
Hoffman-LaRoche Ltd., the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, pleaded
guilty to one criminal count of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act
and agreed to pay a $500 million penalty, the largest criminal fine
ever imposed by the Justice Department. A second company, BASF of
Germany, has agreed to pay a $225 million fine for its role in the
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing a management shakeup on Thursday, including the
departure of top officials in its vitamins division, RocheHolding
AG, the parent company, said that it expects ``substantial further
fines'' in Europe and Canada. It may also face potentially crushing
damages in class-action lawsuits that have been filed by consumers
and companies that bought or used vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here to announce the initial results of the
investigation, Reno and other senior officials described a global
conspiracy to fix prices. They said one Swiss executive had agreed
to return to the United States to serve a jail sentence, he was not
the highest ranking official involved in the price-fixing scheme,
and that at least seven other executives and a dozen smaller
companies remained under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a daily basis for the past 10 years, every American
consumer paid to eat and drink or use a product whose price was
artificially inflated,'' Reno said. ``Day by day, consumers took a
hit in their wallet so that these co-conspirators could reap
hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the
antitrust division, said that the conspiracy affected more than $5
billion of commerce ``in products found in every American
household.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said that the director of worldwide
marketing for the vitamins division of Hoffman-La Roche had agreed
to travel from his home in Switzerland to the United States to
plead guilty to antitrust and cover-up charges, pay a $100,000 fine
and serve a four-month prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were said to have been particularly angry at the
executive, Kuno Sommer, because they said he had lied about the
existence of the vitamin cartel and his role following Roche's
guilty plea in another antitrust price-fixing case two years ago.
In that case, involving citric acid, Roche paid a $14 million fine
and promised to cooperate with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer, who had lived in New Jersey when he served as North
American regional manager for Roche, denied in a 1997 interview
with investigators that there was a vitamin cartel and said he was
not aware of any meetings or conversations involving price-fixing
in that market, according to court papers filed by the government
Thursday that are part of his plea-agreement. In fact, at that
time, he was still playing an important role in setting vitamin
prices and allocating market share, according to a plea agreement
filed on his behalf Thursday in federal court in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   While Justice Department officials said that Sommer was not the
highest-level executive who knew about the conspiracy and coverup,
they did not say who might be prosecuted next. Among the executives
who did not receive immunity in the deal reached with Roche were
Roland Bronnimann, president of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals
Division, and Andreas Hauri, a former executive vice president and
head of global marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Martin D. Hirsch, a Roche spokesman, said that both Sommer and
Bronniman had left the company and that it would take a one-time
special charge to pay for the Justice Department case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're redoubling our existing efforts to insure that people at
all levels of our organization receive training on proper business
policies,'' Hirsch said. ``We want to make it clear that any
improper practices will not be condoned by the company.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The long investigation got its big break three months ago, when
Rhone-Polenc of France, one of the members of the cartel, came
forward with crucial evidence in order to avoid prosecution.
Lawyers said that Rhone-Polenc had decided to cooperate in large
part because of a pending $22 billion merger with Hoechst AG, which
cannot be completed without the approval of antitrust officials in
the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Spratling, head of the antitrust division's criminal
section, said that top executives had treated the industry as one
huge company that they called ``Vitamin Inc.'' Spratling said the
executives ``took great pains to conceal the activity,'' issuing
instructions to destroy all records and notes of their meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the vitamin cartel was as bad as they get,'' said
Spratling, an official in the antitrust division for 28 years.
``Nothing was left to chance _ or, more accurately, to
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Spratling said that federal sentencing guidelines allowed the
government to seek fines as large as $1.3 billion against Roche and
$300 million against BASF. But prosecutors decided on the lower
figures as part of the deal reached with the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The fine imposed Thursday on Roche dwarfed the previous record
cases. The largest total fine collected by the Justice Department
before now had been $340 million paid by Daiwa Bank in 1996 for
fraud and coverup in a large securities fraud case. And the largest
previous fines imposed by the antitrust division occurred earlier
this year, when SGL Carbon agreed to pay $135 million and UCAR
International $110 million for their role in a cartel that had
controlled the market for graphite electrodes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, with more than four months remaining in its fiscal
year, the Justice Department's antitrust division has already
collected $913 million, substantially more money than the total
amount collected in its entire history.
</P>
<P>
   The vitamins cartel case grew out of a smaller investigation
into price-fixing in the additives market that involved some of the
same companies at the heart of the price-fixing inquiry. That
investigation ultimately led to a $100 million fine imposed upon
Archer Daniels Midland in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said that the vitamins case is one of more than 30
investigations now under way of international cartels in a variety
of industries.

SIGNALING SHIFT ON GUN CONTROL, SENATE PASSES CRIME BILL

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By a vote of 73-25, the Senate Thursday night
passed a broad juvenile crime bill that contained an array of new
gun-control measures, the fruit of the most significant debate over
gun control in Congress in half a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Those measures ranged from a requirement that licensed dealers
sell child safety devices with every handgun to mandatory
background checks on all people who buy firearms at gun shows. The
amendments to the juvenile crime bill also restricted the access
that children under 18 have to semi-automatic assault weapons and
banned the import of high-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   But more significant than any of these measures was the fact
that they came up for consideration _ and, in some cases, drew
bipartisan support _ at all. That fact reflected an undeniable
shift in the political climate.
</P>
<P>
   Although surprising momentum has grown in the Senate in recent
weeks for gun control measures, they are still relatively modest
and fall short of proposals for more stringent regulation. Yet the
progress represents the biggest victory for the gun control
advocates in five years, and they come as a new political center is
developing on guns and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who had once chalked up the loss of their majority in
Congress in 1994 to their advocacy for gun control, suddenly sensed
that the issue had turned in their favor and pressed forward with
gun-control proposals. Many Republicans acquiesced, more skittish
about seeming soft on gun control than alienating the gun lobby or
their most conservative, rural constituents.
</P>
<P>
   But the most charged moment of the day came hours before the
bill's passage, when Vice President Al Gore made a rare Senate
appearance and cast a tie-breaking vote that enabled a Democratic
gun-control amendment to prevail over a less stringent Republican
version.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-50 vote on the amendment, which would require background
checks with the sale of firearms at gun shows, reversed the outcome
of a similar vote last week and was easily the most stunning of a
string of Democratic victories on gun control in the Senate over
the last eight days.
</P>
<P>
   It also provided Gore, whose campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination has yet to catch fire, with a heady
triumph. Democrats believe that American sentiment about firearms
has turned toward their party's advocacy of tighter restrictions,
and Gore got to carry that banner by playing the knight who arrived
in the nick of time to save a teetering cause.
</P>
<P>
   Gore voted less than four hours after bullets ripped through yet
another high school, in Conyers, Ga. Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., said
the shooting was a factor in his decision to switch his vote in
favor of his party's measure.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, for his part, was visiting Littleton, Colo.,
where the shooting deaths of 15 people at a high school last month
altered the political climate enough to make Thursday's events in
the Senate possible. The legislation faces uncertain odds in the
House, where there have been conflicting signals about lawmakers'
receptiveness to gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a turning point for our country,'' said Gore, a
radiant smile glued to his face, at a news conference after he left
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   More somberly, Gore added, ``Now I personally would like to
dedicate my tie-breaking vote to all of the families that have
suffered from gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight hours later, after debates and votes on less heavily
freighted amendments, the Senate passed the juvenile crime bill,
73-25. The core of the bill, which became a vehicle for several
gun-control amendments and the most significant gun-control debate
in Congress in half a decade, calls for $1 billion in federal
grants to toughen prosecution of juvenile crime and enhance efforts
to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill before the House Judiciary Committee does not
have gun-control measures in it. But the committee's chairman, Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., announced Thursday that such amendments would
be considered when the committee met to reshape the bill in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the fourth time in Gore's vice presidency that he
broke a tie in the Senate, over which the vce president technically
presides.
</P>
<P>
   As votes on the last of several gun-control amendments trickled
in around midday, Gore took a seat at the head of the chamber. When
it became clear that a tie was likely, Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., giggled and flashed a thumbs-up sign at the vice
president. Other Senate Democrats rushed over to shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans have a 55-to-45 advantage in the Senate,
six Republicans who have repeatedly broken party ranks on gun
control sided with Democrats Thursday, while only one Democrat, Max
Baucus of Montana, sided with Republicans. That created the tie.
</P>
<P>
   On the final bill, 31 Republicans and 42 Democrats voted in
favor of passage, while 23 Republicans and two Democrats voted
against.
</P>
<P>
   Those Republicans who opposed it did so largely on ground that
Democrats had succeeded in amending the bill to include both new
gun-control measures and a greater emphasis on prevention.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the Senate voted on the gun show amendment,
Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, called a news conference to
raise a different issue: the leaking of nuclear secrets during the
Clinton administration to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the success of the Democratic gun-show amendment,
which he opposed, Lott said that the Democrats' campaign for gun
control was largely political preening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns don't cause people to do these things,'' Lott said.
``Something in their beings is doing it. When do we put the
responsibility on the individuals?''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, in a statement released in Littleton, said, ``I
applaud the Senate for today's historic vote.''
</P>
<P>
   And a White House official described the Lott news conference as
an attempt to divert attention away from his party's gun-control
``debacle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic gun-show amendment, which would mandate
background checks on all people buying weapons at these shows,
joined a series of a half dozen gun-control measures that have
passed as amendments to the juvenile crime bill. Many of the
measures garnered broad Republican support, an unmistakable sign of
changed times.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the Democratic gun-show amendment was the last
strange twist in a bizarre chain of gun-show votes that had
Republicans switching their course or tweaking their position from
one day to the next.
</P>
<P>
   When the Democratic gun-show amendment first came up for a vote
a week ago, Senate Republicans defeated it, 51-47, in a largely
party-line vote. Instead, they approved a rival Republican
amendment that called for voluntary background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Senate Republicans rethought their position and
passed a new gun-show amendment that they said made background
checks mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats noted that the combined Republican amendments
actually relaxed existing gun-control regulations in other areas.
So the Republicans came back with a third amendment, intended to
address concerns about the first two.
</P>
<P>
   That amendment passed Thursday. But only minutes later, the
original Democratic amendment, modified slightly and reintroduced,
supplanted it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The new outcome was explained in part by the presence of two
Democrats _ Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Daniel
Inouye of Hawaii _ who had been absent last week but voted in favor
of the amendment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Just as critically, Sen. Cleland of Georgia, one of only two
Democrats who had opposed the measure last week, changed his vote
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said that, because of subtle revisions to the original
Democratic amendment, he had almost firmly decided to switch his
vote on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that awaking Thursday morning to news of the
shooting in his home state erased any tiny, lingering doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that to occur in my own state, in my own back yard,
reinforced and steeled my commitment,'' Cleland said. ``It pushed
me over the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Democrat to vote against his party Thursday was Max
Baucus of Montana, whose position suggested the degree to which
geography trumps party affiliation on gun-control issues.
</P>
<P>
   Baucus' vote suggested the degree to which geography could trump
party affiliation on gun-control issues.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the six Republicans who joined Democrats last week and
again Thursday were from the Midwest, where support for easy access
to firearms is not as fierce as in the South and West.
</P>
<P>
   They were Sens. Mike DeWine of Ohio, Peter Fitzgerald of
Illinois, Richard Lugar of Indiana and George Voinovich of Ohio.
Sens. John Chafee of Rhode Island and Sen. John Warner of Virginia
also voted for the Democratic amendment.
</P>
<P>
   These senators said they had problems with several aspects of
the Republican gun-show measures that even a third amendment did
not fix. The measures, for example, would have made it less
cumbersome for licensed gun dealers to sell weapons in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   The measures also would have shortened from three business days
to 24 hours the amount of time given to vendors at gun shows to
conduct background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big loophole,'' DeWine said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association had lobbied against the
Democratic gun-show amendment and, after the vote, said that the
Senate had not addressed a larger problem: lax enforcement of
existing gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that the association's influence was clearly
waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have seen today now is, for the first time in a major
kind of gun-control issue, rejection of the National Rifle
Association and a vote for common sense,'' said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Other gun-control measures in the juvenile crime bill include a
requirement that licensed gun dealers sell child safety devices
with every handgun; a prohibition on gun ownership for anyone who
commits a violent crime as a juvenile, and new restrictions on the
purchase and possession of semi-automatic assault rifles for
children under 18.
</P>
<P>
   The gun-show amendment closed a loophole in current law, which
requires only licensed gun dealers to conduct background checks of
buyers at gun shows. Licensed dealers conduct only 60 percent of
the business at those shows; the rest are collectors and hobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   The requirement on selling child-safety devices _ a secure
storage container or trigger lock _ with handguns applies only to
licensed dealers, who sell the vast majority of such firearms.
Under current law, those dealers only need to display child-safety
devices in their stores.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ One month after the deadly shooting spree at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., a 15-year-old student
armed with two guns walked casually into the commons area of
Heritage High School here Thursday morning and opened fire,
wounding six students before surrendering to an assistant
principal, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the students remained hospitalized Thursday evening, but
none were considered to have life-threatening injuries. Three were
listed in good condition after suffering superficial gunshot wounds
to the lower extremities. One was listed in satisfactory condition
after a bullet lodged in her abdomen. Two others sustained minor
wounds and were released from a hospital in this middle-class exurb
about 25 miles east of downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Police had not publicly identified the suspect, who apparently
was disarmed and restrained by school officials after he fell to
his knees and placed a handgun in his mouth. But a large number of
students, including several of the estimated 150 students in the
commons area at the time of the shooting, said he is a quiet,
utterly average sophomore named Thomas Solomon who plays baseball
in a county league, attends church regularly, and participates in
his Boy Scout troop.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that Cecil T. Brinkley, an assistant principal,
confronted the youngster as he had the gun in his mouth and asked
him to hand over the weapon. The student complied and began to sob:
``Oh my God, I'm so scared, I'm so scared,'' the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just doing my job,'' Brinkley said Thursday evening in
brief remarks at a news conference. ``I did what needed to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities did not identify the suspect because he is a
juvenile and is, for the time being, under the jurisdiction of the
juvenile courts. But Richard Reed, the Rockdale County district
attorney, said he would move next week to transfer the case to
Superior Court and to charge the suspect with multiple counts of
aggravated assault, cruelty to children and weapons violations.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have yet to describe any possible motive for the
shootings, the sixth seemingly random assault at an American school
in the last 20 months. But two friends of Solomon's said in
interviews that he was distraught over recent troubles with his
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   One of Solomon's friends, Nathaniel B. Deeter, also a sophomore,
said that as recently as Wednesday Solomon had told him he was
going to kill himself. ``He said, `I really don't have a reason to
live anymore,''' Deeter said. ``I told him he was crazy. I mean, a
lot of kids say stuff like that and never do anything.'' Deeter
said he did not report the incident to anyone. Nor did he report
Solomon's remark to him a week ago that he had a lot of guns and
planned to bring one to school.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon's friends said he had ready access to a large collection
of guns kept by his stepfather, Robert W. Daniele, in their
four-bedroom house on a more than one-acre lot in an impeccably
manicured, upper-middle class neighborhood not far from the school.
Skip Morgan, a 16-year-old neighbor who lives two doors away from
Solomon and was a regular visitor to the house, said that Solomon's
stepfather stored 12 to 15 rifles in a locked wood and glass
armoire in the basement, but that said Solomon knew how to open it.
He also said a drawer of the armoire was stocked with ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting began about 7:55 a.m. as students began to gather
in the commons before the first class bells were to ring, the
sheriff's office said, and was over in about 10 minutes. Deeter
said he had noticed Solomon leaning against a wall in the commons
and spoke briefly to him about his troubles with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was pretty mad about it,'' Deeter said, ``but he
didn't seem mad enough to do something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel said that he did not see any weapons but that Solomon
might have hidden the guns in his clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes later, without warning, witnesses said, the
assailant began shooting, indiscriminately spraying the room with
bullets. Holding the rifle in his right hand and bracing it with
his left, they said, he fired round after round, pumping the barrel
after each shot. Most of the shots apparently were aimed low.
Several students in the room said they believe they heard 10 to 12
shots.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last day of classes for the school's seniors, who
graduate later this month, and many students were braced for
pranks. On Wednesday, someone had released hundreds of crickets at
the school. So when they heard the first shots, many students
assumed the seniors had struck again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just heard four shots, just pow, pow, pow, pow,'' said Joel
L. Thomas, a 14-year-old freshman. ``At first we thought it was
just firecrackers.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the students saw their classmates fall and the blood
begin to ooze, many hit the floor and crawled under benches. Others
rushed for the doors and hallways, with several getting trampled.
Jordan Smith, an 18-year-old student, said Solomon had worn ``an
evil smirk.''
</P>
<P>
   Gina L. Corey, a 15-year-old sophomore, described the scene as
``one of those slow-motion things where you can see the sparks
coming off the gun.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the shots, Nita Edwards, a special-skills teacher
at Heritage, found her daughter, Stephanie, a freshman at the
school, and hid with seven other students and a teacher in a
closet. The other teacher, Carol Ingle, recited the 23rd Psalm and
assured the students they were going to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting for several minutes, Solomonran out of the
building, pursued by several students, witnesses said, and was
confronted by the assistant principal and then quickly restrained
by the police. Students described Solomon as quiet and a bit
``nerdy,'' the kind of student who did homework in his homeroom
while others socialized. They said he was not part of any of the
major cliques at the school. They also said he had friends, seemed
normal and was not an outcast in the way that the teen-age gunmen
at Columbine High appeared to be.
</P>
<P>
   Police searched the house and left with a personal computer,
among other items. They also searched Solomon's locker at the high
school. They said they were tracing the manufacturer and ownership
path of the weapons, which Rockdale County Sheriff Jeff T.
Wigington identified as a .22 caliber rifle and a revolver.
</P>
<P>
   Wigington said that part of the rifle's stock had been removed.
He said the suspect rode a school bus to Heritage High Thursday
morning, but he did not speculate when the student brought the
weapons to the school.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming Solomon, Donald A. Peccia, the superintendent of
the Rockdale County public schools, said that school records
revealed no warning signs about the suspect. ``The disciplinary
record would not indicate he had been any significant trouble,''
Peccia said. ``We had no reason to suspect this student at all.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton heard about the latest school shooting as he
was about to depart for Littleton to memorialize the victims of the
April 20 massacre at Columbine High, where a teacher and 14
students, including the two shooters, were killed. He said the news
``is deeply troubling to me, as it is to all Americans. We thank
God that the injuries to the students do not seem to be
life-threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Conyers is a one of those Atlanta bedroom communities that have
developed out of the Georgia clay in the last two decades, and it
is now chock full of upscale subdivisions. The equestrian events
for the Summer Olympic Games were held here in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Heritage High is considered one of the area's best.
Opened in 1976, it was named one of the 13 top high schools in the
metropolitan area by U.S. News &AMP; World Report in January. Test
scores are well above the state average, parents are heavily
involved in the school's academic and athletic programs, and the
students interviewed Thursday expressed a high degree of school
pride.
</P>
<P>
   The single-story, brick school does not have metal detectors at
its entrances, but it does have a law-enforcement officer on the
campus and surveillance cameras, including one in the commons.
School has been canceled for Friday but is expected to resume on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The police roped off the campus with yellow crime-scene tape and
searched the school for bombs, detonating one backpack. They
discovered it did not contain a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon was met by his parents and a lawyer after the shooting,
and was being held in a youth detention center. Wigington said he
spoke briefly to the teen-ager in the back of a patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was obviously shaken and upset,'' Wigington said.
</P>
<P>
   As to a possible motive, the sheriff added: ``I didn't ask, and
he didn't offer.''

ANOTHER DELAY APPEAR LIKELY IN ROYALS OWNERSHIP DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES R.T. CRUMPLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Miles Prentice got half a loaf Thursday when
his proposal to buy the Kansas City Royals was placed on Major
League Baseball's ownership committee agenda but not on the agenda
for the big meeting of all baseball owners.
</P>
<P>
   That means it is unlikely that Prentice's bid will be approved
June 10 when baseball owners meet. It also implies that some owners
have questions about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice called the development ``another step of progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Royals President Mike Herman said he remained optimistic and
said no baseball owners had told him they objected to Prentice.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the development was a bit of a letdown. Prentice
and the Royals had hoped the team's sale could get its final
blessing in three weeks. Now, a delay of months or at least weeks
appears likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is disappointing,'' said Joe McGuff, a Royals director.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's ownership committee, made up of eight major-league
owners and three league officials, studies proposed ownership
changes and sends its recommendation to the general meeting of all
baseball owners, typically the following day. That's when the final
votes are taken. That meeting is in three weeks in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the ownership committee wants to talk about the
Prentice deal but has not committed to send it up for a final vote
implies that some owners have serious questions, said Doug Pappas,
an official with the Society for American Baseball Research in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't take it as a good sign,'' Pappas said. ``If this
were a deal that was going to sail through, I think they could do
it both in the same meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, he does not think the owners are
looking for reasons to turn down the Prentice deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they would like to have a solid, stable ownership
group there,'' Pappas said. ``To the extent they do raise
objections, I don't think they would be doing it just for the sake
of sabotaging the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman said he had heard no serious objections, only questions
about money. Because the Royals have lost money in the past,
baseball owners want some assurance that the Prentice group is
sturdy enough to withstand losses without collapsing or triggering
an ownership crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice has worked out what he has termed ``a mechanism'' to
solve possible money problems in the future. He hasn't made that
public.
</P>
<P>
   Herman thinks the ownership committee wants that mechanism
explained in detail.
</P>
<P>
   Herman said he and Royals Chairman David Glass planned to fly to
Pittsburgh to meet with the ownership committee.
</P>
<P>
   Herman said: ``What we've heard is, `Can you show their ability
to finance and keep a team in Kansas City?' I think Miles has
addressed it. I see no reason why it won't go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman said he spoke to Bill Bartholomay of the Atlanta Braves,
who is chairman of the ownership committee, ``and Bill was very
encouraged and pleased. I said, `Is there anything we should be
prepared for to be asked?' And he said, `No. The usual types of
questions will be asked.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Prentice has not been invited to the meeting of the ownership
committee but would go if asked, said Prentice's spokesman, Michael
Grimaldi.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice said the development Thursday ``is another step of
progress toward completion of our investor group's goal to acquire
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Royals fans have expressed to me their natural impatience
with the process,'' he said. ``But it's an irrefutable truth that
progress takes time. We have said from the beginning, more than a
year ago, that we believe in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royals have been without a permanent owner since Ewing M.
Kauffman died in 1993. Prentice's $75 million bid for the Royals
was approved by Royals directors last November after a long search.
Since then, the bid has been awaiting approval from baseball
owners.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate matter, Herman said the Royals were still intent
on trading at least one of their top-paid players so the team would
have money to pay for draft picks next month.
</P>
<P>
   The right deal hasn't turned up, but he thinks it will. ``It's a
seller's market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By dumping one or two big salaries, the Royals would have enough
money to sign the six players they will pick in the first two
rounds of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Herman estimates that the Royals will need $7 million to $8
million to sign those prospects. The Royals have already spent $2.7
million to sign pitcher Jeff Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I've got to get the payroll down to sign those players,''
Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   He was reluctant to name any player who could be traded, but the
candidates are not secret.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-paid players and their reported salaries this year:
Kevin Appier, $4.8 million; Jeff King, $4 million; Jeff Montgomery,
$2.5 million; and Hipolito Pichardo, $2.5 million. Pichardo is out
for the season after surgery.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN ANTONIO _ Shaquille O'Neal just knew what David Robinson was
going to do. He just knew the San Antonio center was going to lob
up another outside jumper.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robinson glanced at the clock, which was winding down in Game 2
of the Western Conference semifinals game against the Lakers, and
nearly everyone in the Alamodome crowd of 33,293 warily eyed the
clock with him.
</P>
<P>
   There was just over a minute to play, and the score was tied.
And Robinson had the ball. O'Neal crouched, because he knew
Robinson was going to let it fly any second.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson twitched, tensing as if to shoot, and O'Neal pounced.
But there was no jumper. Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   With O'Neal in the air, Robinson made his move. He went
baseline, curled around the basket and threw down a two-handed slam
that left the backboard rattling and put the Spurs up 75-73 with a
minute left.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs would hold on to win 79-76, taking a 2-0 lead in the
best-of-seven series that resumes Saturday in Los Angeles, but
Robinson's play would be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, everyone was talking about Tim Duncan's short jump hook
with 8.4 seconds left that gave the Spurs their last lead, and how
the Lakers' Kobe Bryant went from hero to goat in the space of 36
seconds, missing two free throws, turning the ball over and then
missing a running 3-point attempt as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson's play was just as big.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a huge play,'' the Spurs' Mario Elie said. ``Shaq's a
big guy, and David has to utilize his talents against him. David is
very quick, and he did a great job pump-faking Shaq. But that's
what a veteran team does _ just make plays in key situations. And
that's what David did. I guess he's tired of hearing it from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. After the slam, Robinson even showed a little emotion,
clenching his fists and giving them just the slightest, tiniest
pump.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost as if Robinson was trying emotionalism on for
size, like a kid venturing out toward the end of the diving board,
taking those first, furtive bounces, just to see what it's like.
</P>
<P>
   Not because he's a 7-1 cold fish. Quite the opposite. It's just
that Robinson abhors anything that might embarrass or show up an
opponent. And he hates calling attention to himself, so he keeps
his demeanor reserved, regardless of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Referees make a bad call? Most of the time Robinson will just
jog downcourt and get ready for the next play. Tense situation in a
big game? You probably couldn't tell by looking at Robinson, who is
usually the great stoneface.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wear my emotions on my sleeve like an Avery (Johnson)
or a Mario,'' Robinson, 33, said. ``That's just not my style. It's
not my style to spit on the court and to curse the referees out.
That's not my thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the referees decide what the game is. I think
you decide what the game is. I'm going to be my own worst critic
when I come out here. I just don't believe in dancing around when
you're 20 points down and you get a dunk. I don't think that's
basketball. I don't think that means anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that stoic demeanor that gets him grief from fans, who want
their heroes to be fist-pumping, screaming, smack-talking.
</P>
<P>
   He's the exact opposite of O'Neal, the Lakers center/cottage
industry. No tattoos. No rap songs. He's not an actor, even though
if you've seen one of O'Neal's movies (and chances are you
haven't), you probably would say he's not an actor, either.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, Robinson is a basketball player. Period.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personality is such that I think of this as a job,''
Robinson said of his NBA career. ``I think of it as, `I have to
come out here and work myself, I have to work my body, I have to
get myself ready.' And it's fun when things work out and you start
getting guys to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   There are times, though, when Robinson feels out of place. Or
perhaps it would be more accurate to say he feels out of time.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson sometimes winces at the images he sees on TV. Hot-dog
plays. Wagging taunting fingers in an opponent's face after a
blocked shot. Prancing and preening after a dunk _ even though your
team trails by 20 points. Individualism sells in the NBA, and it
sells big.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way the world is,'' Robinson said, shrugging.
``That's just the way the world is. People like the flamboyant
guys. They like the guys who don't like to pass and do all the
crazy stuff. That stuff, I guess, is more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to Robinson. No, that's not the way Robinson believes it
should be done, and if there's one thing that goes a long way on
the Admiral's ship, it's belief.
</P>
<P>
   Belief in God, fair play and teamwork. Belief in doing things
the right way, as an individual and a team. All of which makes
Robinson an anachronism. And Robinson sometimes thinks he belongs
to another era.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit,'' Robinson said. ``Believing in the team thing
and winning and building instead of hiring a mercenary. You have a
Charles Barkley or a Scottie Pippen on the block, and you try to
get your championship right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think that's how you build teams. I think all the
winning teams I've seen have worked together, went through some
challenges; they lost some games, but then they finally figured it
out and got the right team together.''
</P>
<P>
   Something the Spurs have never done. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Since his first game with the Spurs in 1989, Robinson has played
for seven coaches _ Larry Brown, Bob Bass, Jerry Tarkanian
(remember him?), Rex Hughes, John Lucas, Bob Hill and current boss
Gregg Popovich _ all of whom wanted something different from the
versatile Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way he has won a scoring title (1994, when he averaged
29.8 points), a Most Valuable Player Award (1995) and a Defensive
Player of the Year Award (1992), but he has never won an NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   And Robinson thinks that might be partly the Spurs' fault,
because they've never stuck with a system long enough to develop
into a consistent force in the league, like the Jazz has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years my role has changed from this to that to this
to that,'' Robinson said. ``You may say that (his versatility) is
not a problem, but when we don't win, it becomes my problem. When
you get a team together and you can build it and work at it. For
example, look at Utah. Karl Malone is limited in some ways, but,
shoot, they've used him the same way for the last 15 years and now
they're at a point where they execute without thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been able to refine what he does in that system. But for
me, that's been one of the hard things. We're switching from system
to system, and it gets to the point where it's almost, `OK, so what
do you want me to do today, coach?' And that's a tough situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Like when Duncan arrived as the No. 1 pick in the 1997 NBA
draft. Robinson, coming off a season in which he played just six
games because of back and knee problems, was asked to step out of
the post to accommodate the 7-foot Duncan. By doing so, Robinson
gave up more than his position on the floor _ he surrendered shots
and gave up his role as the No. 1 offensive option. And remember,
he was just four years removed from leading the league in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   They meshed well last season, with Duncan averaging 21.1 points
and Robinson 21.6, but this season Robinson was asked to take on
more of a defensive presence and give up more of his offensive
game.
</P>
<P>
   The transition has worked for the Spurs, who won 31 of their
last 36 regular-season games this year and captured the home-court
advantage throughout the playoffs. Duncan averaged 21.7 points and
Robinson a career-low 15.8, but the Spurs are winning, and that's
all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we've come a long way as a team, and I've come a
long way figuring out what to do with this groove,'' Robinson said.
``But obviously there's a lot of things I have to figure out,
especially with my game, where I was getting the ball down there in
the post so much, and now I get a lot of face-up shots, so I need
to get a feel as to when to take those shots. I still don't think I
have a great feel for that, but I'm getting there.''

2 GRAND SLAMS BY VENTURA SPARK METS VICTORIES IN DOUBLEHEADER
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Theirs were the two faces and divergent moods of the
New York Mets on Thursday: pitcher Al Leiter stalking off the mound
after each inning, his face etched with a grimace, muttering oaths
of frustration to himself, nearly every pitch a struggle while
Robin Ventura floated effortlessly around the bases after two
nearly identical grand slams.
</P>
<P>
   Staked to a 4-0 lead from Ventura's first-inning slam in the
first game of the Mets' doubleheader against Milwaukee (the second
came in the second game, a 10-1 Mets victory) and buoyed by the
productive Mets bats, Leiter took full advantage of his wide margin
for error, pitching poorly but still getting the win in a 11-10
Mets victory that featured 25 total hits and one game-ending throw
to the plate to nab what would have been the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   It was only Leiter's second win against four losses in nine
starts. Although the sweep of the double-header indicated that the
Mets' bats are at last very much alive _ they hit six home runs
(two by Benny Agbayani, who was 4-4 in the first game) and had 24
hits in two games _ they did little to assauge concern that the
pitcher the Mets need if they are to make a legitimate run at the
post-season is up to the task. In five innings, he gave up six runs
on nine hits. In 55 innings pitched this season, Leiter has allowed
42 runs (39 earned) on 64 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Words only go so far,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``You
need action and the win today was action. Regardless of how it
looked or how tough it was to get, he's going home with one more
win than he had before.''
</P>
<P>
   During Leiter's struggles, Masato Yoshii has emerged,
unexpectedly, as the Mets' most consistent starter. He faltered
early in the season, but with a shift on the pitching rubber, he
has won his last three starts and on Thursday night, in the second
game of the double header, Yoshii (4-3) gave up just one run on
eight hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   He was the beneficiary of Ventura's second grand slam, to almost
exactly the same spot over the right field wall as the first one.
It gave the Mets (23-18) a 9-0 lead in the fourth inning and made
Ventura the first person in major league history to hit a grand
slam in each game of a double header. Ventura is now an incredible
6-9 (.667) this season with the bases loaded with 12 RBI and in his
career has 134 RBI in 118 at-bats with the bases loaded. In 1995,
while he was with the White Sox, Ventura hit two grand slams in one
game, but last night, he said, was better than that feat.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's different because it affects two games,'' Ventura said.
``It's a little more satisfying. It's a good day to have a double
header.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ventura's numbers are staggering, then Leiter's are simply
surprising. Leiter's ERA has ballooned to 6.38, but he, and the
organization, insist that his stuff is as good as last year. On
Thursday night, Leiter self-destructed in every possible way. There
were wild pitches, full counts, a hit batsman, and hit after hit
after hit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his clear agitation throughout his outing, a visibly
relieved Leiter professed only happiness afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ''So many times, it's good effort, seven innings, one run and
nothing to show for it,'' Leiter said. ``Wins are precious and I'll
take a win anytime. I believe if I continue to do what I'm doing,
things will turn. Hopefully, from now on, the jam shots will be
caught and the goofiness during games will go my way.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of goofiness in the first game, and it remained
Leiter's for the taking because his counterpart, the Brewers' Jim
Abbott (who took the loss to drop to 0-5), was equally ineffective
and because both teams' hitters feasted on the messy pitches served
up by every pitcher who dared take the mound. Leiter gave up three
runs in the third inning and another in the fourth to tie the
score.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets got a run back in the fourth, but in the fifth, his
final inning, Leiter crumbled again. He gave up a leadoff single to
Cirillo, then hit Bernitz in the back. Grissom and Hughes both
flied out. But Ochoa, the number seven batter, hit a double to
right center that scored two to give the Brewers a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   While Leiter struggled, the rest of the Mets reveled in nearly
non-stop success at the plate. They retook the lead in the bottom
of the fifth when Agbayani hit a three-run homer off Milwaukee
reliever Steve Falteisek. In the next inning, Piazza hit a 1-0
changeup 418 feet to dead center to extend the lead to 10-6.
Agbayani, who was called up from Norfolk when Bobby Bonilla went on
the disabled list, hit his second home run in the seventh inning to
up the lead to 11-6. Agbayani is batting .519 and his four RBIs was
a career high.
</P>
<P>
   ''Benny is the player of the week, I guess,'' Valentine said.
``I wasn't going to bring him up just to pinch hit. There was a
starting opportunity and he's made the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Brewers scored three in the eighth, and only a
spectacular play on the final out of the game saved Leiter's
precarious win. With two out and two on against reliever John
Franco, pinch hitter Sean Berry lofted what looked to be an easy
pop fly to Alfonzo. But Alfonzo dropped the ball and Grissom came
around to score. Ochoa, though, was not running hard because he had
lost a shoe. Roger Cedeno's throw from shallow right field nailed
Ochoa, who would have been the 11th run, by two feet at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura grinned sheepishly after the long night trying to
explain his home runs. And finally, there was a smile on Leiter's
face, too.

REINVENTING OSCAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Oscar De La Hoya doesn't like what he's become.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the ring, he has evolved from a wrecking machine into a
cautious, almost defensive fighter who shows only glimpses of the
devastating force he was just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the ring, De La Hoya, passive by nature, has deferred to
those closest to him on many of his biggest decisions in the
interest of peace. At 26, he's had enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be changes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant will be his approach to boxing.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, who fights Oba Carr in Las Vegas on Saturday,
blasted his way through a string of nameless opponents in the first
half of his career to build his reputation as a destroyer.
</P>
<P>
   Then he and his advisers _ principally father Joel De La Hoya
Sr., businessman Mike Hernandez and promoter Bob Arum _ decided to
bring in experienced trainers to work with the relative novice
Robert Alcazar as the fighter's opponents grew in stature.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya was never the same.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Rivero turned him into a defense-first fighter. Emanuel
Steward lasted only two fights because of clashes with Joel Sr. And
with Gil Clancy in his camp, De La Hoya has remained tentative.
</P>
<P>
   He still plowed through unworthy opponents, although he admits
the good ones gave him trouble because he was no longer aggressive.
Most significant, Miguel Angel Gonzalez, Pernell Whitaker and Ike
Quartey made him look bad in some ways even though he beat each on
points.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in an instant, he seemed to be reborn.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the 12th and final round of his last fight, against
Quartey in February. He threw out everything he had learned and
reverted to instinct, pummeling the Ghanan in an unforgettable span
of 30 seconds to win an otherwise dull but close fight and retain
his WBC welterweight championship.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd went nuts and so did De La Hoya, a sensitive man who
desperately wants to please his fans and silence any criticism.
Then and there, he decided this is the fighter he wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish (the trainers) would've worked with my style instead of
trying to change it,'' De La Hoya said. ``That's been the case the
last three, four years. I wasn't fighting my own fight. I was
adjusting to my opponents instead of them adjusting to me. It
should be the other way around. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The Quartey fight woke me up 100 percent. I'm going to listen
to myself, do what got me here. What was I doing boxing Gonzalez
and Whitaker? What was I doing trying to box Quartey? I should go
in and try to destroy these guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to walk through my opponents and finally be happy in
the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward, one of the most respected trainers in the world,
doesn't believe a kamikaze approach is wise against all opponents,
even though De La Hoya said Steward was the only one who didn't try
to change his style.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid is always trying to please,'' he said. ``He wants to
be loved, to be accepted more than any fighter I've seen in a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against David Kamau (whom De La Hoya knocked out in two
particularly violent rounds in 1997), I know he took the positive
comments afterward to heart. He loved it. He wants to be happy even
at the risk of losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward might still be around had De La Hoya asserted himself
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer was dismissed in December of 1997 after he helped
arrange for De La Hoya to go to Las Vegas to see the Evander
Holyfield-Michael Moorer fight a month earlier. Apparently, Joel
Sr. believed Steward was gaining influence and cut him off.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya worked well with Steward _ ``I was happy, feeling
stronger,'' he said _ but he didn't want to butt heads with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate arguing with my father,'' he said at the time. ``I
don't want nothing between us. I love my father, I love my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   That was typical of De La Hoya: He would let his advisers push
him around rather than make decisions with which he was more
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the new De La Hoya reiterated that he loves his
father, who will remain a key element on his team. At the same
time, he made it clear that he intends to speak his mind. To make
his point, he has announced a plan of action.
</P>
<P>
   One, he plans to limit his inner circle to only those he trusts
most _ both in terms of his boxing career and business interests _
to keep the volume of advice manageable. Two, he's going to step
down as co-promoter with Arum so he can focus solely on boxing.
And, three, he said Clancy, another respected trainer, won't be
back after Saturday's fight.
</P>
<P>
   If he follows through, it will be clear that he has evolved into
his own man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been confused all these years. It's my fault because
I stay quiet,'' said De La Hoya, who refused to divulge the
advisers with which he's had the most difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``People throw their ideas out left and right and sometimes I
agree with them because I don't want to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The co-promoting thing I thought was a good thing because
others thought it was a good thing. Now, the way it's going to be
is he (Arum) is going to be the promoter and I'm going to be the
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confusion, the headaches. I don't want that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to make Alcazar his sole mentor is significant.
Many in the boxing world believe the affable young trainer lacks
the knowledge to guide De La Hoya to true greatness. Steward said
bluntly that De La Hoya isn't developing into a complete fighter in
the vein of Sugar Ray Leonard or Tommy Hearns.
</P>
<P>
   However, Alcazar, a former professional fighter who worked with
Joel Sr., has two things going for him: He has always been a
proponent of controlled aggressiveness and he and De La Hoya are
close friends. So from now on, De La Hoya said, it's Alcazar, cut
man Chuck Bodak and that's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert and I are training so well right now,'' De La Hoya
said. ``We're going back to my old style, trying to get the
knockout. That style has worked for me my whole life. That's when
I'm happy in the ring, when I hit and don't get hit, when I feel
most comfortable. And as long as I'm happy in the ring, everything
else falls into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, Robert and Chuck and nobody else. That's just the way it's
gonna be.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what anyone says.

   ``Kamiwa ai nari,'' the words read. Translated, the expression
is simple yet profound: ``God is love.''

DE LA HOYA NOT AMONG THE ELITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ If anyone has the perspective to evaluate Oscar De
La Hoya's place in history, it's Emanuel Steward, who trained De La
Hoya and Tommy Hearns and saw Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler and
Roberto Duran from the opposite corner.
</P>
<P>
   How would the Golden Boy have fit in with that bunch? Well, let
Steward deliver the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the talent to be right with them,'' he said. ``But he
hasn't developed into a complete professional fighter. They're a
little better all around than Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so frustrating. He's so talented, but he does basically
the same thing all the time. I'd rather see his upper body rolling
and twisting like Leonard and those guys used to do. He could fit
in with those guys, but I don't know if he could beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   So why hasn't De La Hoya developed?
</P>
<P>
   Steward points to his trainer, Robert Alcazar. Alcazar has
worked with De La Hoya since his amateur days but doesn't have the
experience of the top trainers.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya and his advisors seem to believe the same thing:
They've brought in three more-seasoned trainers to lend their
expertise. However, Gil Clancy, the latest addition, will not be
asked back after Saturday's fight against Oba Carr.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, some believe, De La Hoya will be training himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if Alcazar has the ability to take Oscar to the
level he needs to go,'' Steward said. ``There are certain things he
needs to do, and Alcazar doesn't have the knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Alcazar is) his daddy's longtime buddy. To keep peace, Oscar
almost has to stay with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward, who worked with De La Hoya for two fights before he was
dismissed because he clashed with the fighter's father, Joel De La
Hoya, believes De La Hoya will improve naturally as he continues to
fight top-level opponents.
</P>
<P>
   However, that will only go so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can a fighter develop on his own? Not as a rule,'' Steward
said. ``It's frustrating. It really is.''

INDIANS PROTEST TO STOP TRANSFER OF PROPERTY ALONG MISSOURI RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LaFRAMBOISE ISLAND, S.D. _ Standing near a horseshoe pit amid a
mismatched collection of plastic tarps and canvas tepees, Danny
Merrival talked with fifth- and sixth-graders about politicians and
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of treaties and history and Congress and tribes. He
talked of the sacred fire burning at this protesters' camp, of the
cleansing powers of a sweat lodge and of how the earth was their
mother.
</P>
<P>
   The schoolchildren, on a field trip from the Standing Rock Sioux
tribal reservation, kicked at the dirt and fiddled with their
yo-yos while Merrival tied the political to the spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   This land belongs to the Lakota people, Merrival told them, and
no United States Congress or South Dakota governor can make it
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he and about two dozen others have occupied La
Framboise Island. They hope to stop a deal that hands over hundreds
of miles of riverfront property to the state and two tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making our last stand,'' Merrival insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a mile away in the state Capitol, Gov. William Janklow
fumed over this latest showdown between South Dakota and its
American Indian tribes. Can't they, he wondered aloud, see a good
deal when it's handed to them?
</P>
<P>
   To his thinking, a recent bargain struck in Congress that
wrestles 133,000 acres along the Missouri away from the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers is win-win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one resource we have in the central part of the state is
water,'' Janklow said. ``Now, finally, we can develop it.''
</P>
<P>
   As they have for generations, the tribes and the state of South
Dakota stand at odds over who controls the land they share.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the fight are Janklow, U.S. Sen. Tom Daschle and
the Lower Brule and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes. Bonded in their
dislike of federal control of the riverfront, they savor the
pending land transfer like the recovery of a stolen legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, who include members of several tribes, also want
the Corps to surrender the land. But they suggest the deal wrongs
them by handing over part of the land to the state.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement springs from dueling ideas about treaties
dating to the early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began in the mid-1940s when Congress decided to
reduce Missouri River flooding in states such KSK-9Mas and Missouri
by damming up the waterway in the Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   That submerged vast areas in reservoirs, stealing much of the
best farm soil in South Dakota. Some of that land was on Indian
reservations and some was under the control of the state and
private landowners.
</P>
<P>
   The state's white ruling majority _ the nine Sioux tribes in
South Dakota account for about 8 percent of the state population _
has gradually developed a tourism industry dependent on hunters and
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   But the Corps, an institution geared for flood control and power
production, has disappointed the locals by failing to cater to the
tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, tribes want more control of the riverfront to protect
various cultural assets.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, Daschle convened a meeting of state officials and
leaders from the Yankton, Crow Creek, Lower Brule, Cheyenne River
and Standing Rock Sioux tribes, who had uncontested borders along
the Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the beginning of a coalition to pull the land away from
the Corps,'' said one congressional source. ``That much, everyone
could agree on.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, that alliance shrunk and solidified
until the state and the Cheyenne River and Lower Brule tribes
rallied behind a measure muscled through Congress by Daschle last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation establishes a trust fund _ $165 million to be
divvied among the state and tribes on a dollars-to-acres formula _
to pay for things such as preserving wildlife habitats and the
various cultural assets on the land.
</P>
<P>
   It also arranged for the Corps to relinquish about 91,000 acres
to state control, some 33,000 acres to the Cheyenne River tribe and
nearly 9,000 acres to the Lower Brule.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Standing Rock, Crow Creek and Yankton tribes opposed
the deal, the Corps remains the owner of roughly 20,000 acres of
riverfront along their reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Those tribes chose not to join in the legislation partly
because, they said, it was brokered by the state. Some think the
land destined for state control should instead go to the greater
Sioux nation.
</P>
<P>
   The state doesn't belong in the negotiations, said David
Archambault, a member of the Standing Rock tribal council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is the state doing this? They're just trying to use us,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those tribes also worry that the land transfer might not
preserve their Missouri River water rights and leaves unclear their
ability to control hunting and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition includes other South Dakota tribes who don't even
border the river. They cite a treaty in 1851 that promised the
Sioux nation reign over all land in South Dakota west of the east
bank of the Missouri River.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of subsequent treaties and laws passed by Congress
have shrunken that Indian territory, Janklow argues.
</P>
<P>
   The occupation began in late March, after protesters came to the
capital demanding the land transfer _ which still requires a
federal appropriation to pay for land surveys _ be halted.
</P>
<P>
   At first, there were just seven men at the camp. Now, with the
weather warming, the numbers range from 20 to 40.
</P>
<P>
   They gather firewood from a nearby campground, draw water from
spigots and shower at the homes of supporters in Pierre.
</P>
<P>
   Many sport T-shirts boasting allegiance to the American Indian
Movement, a group best known from the bloody siege of Wounded Knee
in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Evenings pass with songs chanted in the Lakota tongue to a drum
beat and in conversation in English on lawn chairs circled around
the campfire.
</P>
<P>
   The campers believe an 1868 treaty requires that any handoff of
land requires the signatures of three-fourths of all Sioux men.
</P>
<P>
   They concede, too, that such a pact is not imminent and that
Congress is unlikely to grant riverfront property to tribes like
the Oglala Sioux whose reservations don't touch the river.
</P>
<P>
   Will they stay through summer, through fall, for yeqR

ELDERS CHANGE STANCE ON SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST
EX-PASTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN IWASAKI  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Elders of Overlake Christian Church now have
testimony that supports allegations of sexual misconduct against
the Rev. Bob Moorehead, who resigned last year from Washington
state's largest congregation amid a cloud of suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   The elders have heard from multiple witnesses to corroborate at
least some of the allegations leveled against Moorehead, according
to a letter sent Thursday to members of the Redmond, Wash., church.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the elders dismissed allegations of sexual misconduct
against Moorehead by 17 men because they said the incidents
couldn't be substantiated by eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But since Moorehead stepped down last June, ``the eldership has
received testimony that meets the biblical standard of multiple
witnesses,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The elders said they ``reviewed the entire matter and
unanimously concluded that Pastor Bob Moorehead did violate the
scriptural standards of trust, self-control, purity and Godly
character required for the office of elder and pastor'' at
Overlake.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 elders, who serve as the church's governing body, met
several weeks ago with Moorehead, presented him with the new
testimony and asked him to acknowledge their conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chose to reject the appeal for his acknowledgment,'' the
Rev. Rick Kingham, Moorehead's successor, said Thursday. Moorehead,
who steadfastly denied the accusations in the past, now lives in
Florida. Efforts to reach him Thursday night for comment were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the elders publicly acknowledged in their
letter that they were prepared to ask for Moorehead's resignation
last year _ even before receiving the latest evidence _ ``because
his reputation and witness in the community (were) damaged beyond
repair.''
</P>
<P>
   The elders did not talk earlier about asking Moorehead to quit
because ``at the point Pastor Bob resigned, there was not the need
to say it,'' Kingham said.
</P>
<P>
   Moorehead's decision to step down ``was not because the elders
pressed him to do that. That was of his own choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingham, who also serves as an elder, was not at Overlake when
the elders investigated Moorehead.
</P>
<P>
   The elders also announced a new written policy and procedure to
follow when any serious allegations are made against an elder,
pastor or other staff member. No written policy previously existed
that adequately addressed the issue, Kingham said.
</P>
<P>
   Any serious allegation brought against a church staff member or
elder, including the senior pastor, ``will cause that person to be
immediately suspended pending a full investigation,'' the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kingham said the policy and procedures are intended to be as
``user-friendly'' as possible because of the discomfort members may
have in accusing a church leader of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sinclair, a former pastor at Overlake, left the church in
1997 over concerns about Moorehead's conduct. Asked for comment
Thursday night on the elder's letter, Sinclair said, ``I think it's
a good start, but it's just a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingham said it was critical for Overlake ``to bring some
closure to this issue. It's been going on for a period of time. For
the spiritual health of the church, the elders felt it was
important to make a statement, especially in light of the
conclusions that came.''
</P>
<P>
   The elders struck a conciliatory tone in their letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ordinary and fallible men earnestly seeking God's will
and endeavoring to do what is right,'' they wrote. ``Where we have
failed to correctly perceive God's will, we are sorry and seek your
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Godly leadership to which elders are called requires that
they seek wisdom, righteousness and unanimity in every decision. A
great deal of prayer accompanies our decision-making process. Our
greatest desire is to serve you, our church family, in a
God-honoring way.''
</P>
<P>
   About 4,500 people regularly attend Sunday services at Overlake.
</P>
<P>
   Moorehead came under scrutiny starting in late 1997 when it was
publicly disclosed that he had been arrested in Daytona Beach,
Fla., in July 1996 and charged with masturbating in a public
restroom.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were dropped under controversial circumstances, but
the disclosure of his arrest prompted several men to come forward
last year with allegations that Moorehead sexually molested them
during adult baptism and wedding ceremonies in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The elders hired a private investigator who reported that 17 men
made accusations. But the elders said scripture required at least
one witness for an allegation to be substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   That interpretation drew criticism from other pastors and Bible
scholars. Some elders later said they followed a correct process,
but had made mistakes and that their actions were open to scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the accusations in the investigator's report stemmed
from alleged incidents in the '70s, elder Gary Scott said last
year. Of the 17 men making direct accusations, one group included
those who said they were groped or fondled, another group believed
they were the victims of incidental sexual touching and a third
concluded that Moorehead attempted to touch them inappropriately.

PEREZ WORKS ON CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers left-hander Carlos Perez lost
6 mph off his fastball and lost his control, which has led to the
worst start of his four-year career.
</P>
<P>
   The club is hoping Perez's 18-minute bullpen session in front of
pitching coach Charlie Hough and Dodgers pitching coordinator Jim
Benedict solved the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict spent four seasons in the same capacity with the
Montreal Expos when Perez was pitching north of the border. He said
Perez's struggles aren't new.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the maintenance of Carlos Perez,'' Benedict said
before the Dodgers and Houston Astros played Thursday at Dodger
Stadium. ``We were trying to create an angle for the ball's flight
from the release point to the catcher's glove. He was flying open.
It's a result of coming off the (pitching) rubber too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll lose deception. If you don't have deception, 91 (mph)
becomes 85, and the changeup is something that is very visual.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez normally throws a fastball 91 or 92 mph, but Hough said
he's been clocked in the low 80s his past few starts. That's also
made Perez's changeup, his best pitch, more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   It has caused Perez to start the season 1-5 with 6.63 ERA. He
lasted only 31/3 innings in his last outing, giving up six runs on
five hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm too quick in my legs,'' said Perez, who starts
Sunday against St. Louis. ``I'm only using my arm, and that's why I
had no velocity. That's why I also (lost) velocity later in the
game. It also hurts my control.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he'll throw bullpen sessions between starts,
something he normally doesn't do, in an effort to remain sharp.
</P>
<P>
   __ Osuna surgery successful: Recently disabled right-handed
reliever Antonio Osuna underwent successful surgery to remove a
bone spur from his pitching elbow Thursday at Centinela Hospital
Medical Center. The surgery was performed by team physicians Dr.
Frank Jobe and Dr. Ralph Gambardella.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, who had a bone spur removed from the same spot last
September, is expected to miss two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a small piece of bone outgrown in the back of the
elbow,'' Dr. Jobe said. ``It's more like a pea in your shoe, stuck
there. It looked more like a piece he broke off after the last
surgery. It would kind of pinch him after he extended his elbow.
That's where the pain came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he'll be able to return to his regular method of
throwing. I thought his ligaments were in good shape. I think he'll
be fine now that we've got this rock out of his shoe.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Pena gets start: Lefty Mike Hampton started for Houston,
which means catcher Todd Hundley sat. So rookie Angel Pena,
recalled Tuesday from Triple-A Albuquerque, got his first start.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he isn't concerned about the
offensive output from Pena, who hit .231 during six games last
season with the Dodgers, but rather Pena's defensive prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it looks like his setup got a little more polished
from the spring,'' Johnson said. ``I liked his setup and it's
gotten better. That part of the game _ the blocking, the throwing
is pretty good. I was impressed with some of his signal-calling,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The switch-hitting Hundley has started one game against
left-handers and is hitless in nine at-bats from the right side.
Johnson said Pena will start Sunday against St. Louis lefty Darren
Oliver.

CHURCH HAS BEEN A SANCTUARY FOR SEATTLE'S JAPANESE AMERICAN
COMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN IWASAKI  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Above the altar at Japanese Baptist Church of Seattle,
near a row of windows lighting the six-sided sanctuary, hangs a
framed piece of Japanese calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kamiwa ai nari,'' the words read. Translated, the expression
is simple yet profound: ``God is love.''
</P>
<P>
   That message has comforted Seattle's first Japanese Christian
congregation over the past century, through waves of immigration,
periods of war, changes in location and shifts in demographics.
</P>
<P>
   The red brick church on the corner of Broadway and East Spruce
Street, once the heart of the Japanese American community, will
celebrate its 100th anniversary starting Friday. The theme of the
three-day event is ``Pass the Torch to New Generations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier part of the century, prejudice kept people of
Japanese ancestry from gathering in certain areas, said Hisako
Arakawa, the church moderator, or president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't go downtown. Most of them lived around this area
since the Depression days,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just for (Japanese) Baptist people, but for all Japanese
people, this was the place to congregate.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven immigrants, including the Rev. Fukumatsu Okazaki, who
served for more than 30 years, organized the church on May 23,
1899. Offering services in Japanese, the church added about 100
converts in its first decade.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the congregation counts about 200 regulars for services
in Japanese and English.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Japanese American community in general, interracial
families are increasingly common at the church. And like other
congregations borne by an ethnic group, the culture is interwoven
in the fabric of church life.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked in some corners of the church are graceful ikebana flower
arrangements. The pine tree in the courtyard behind the altar is
pruned in a classical Japanese style. Wood-frame windows with
rice-paper panes adorn the memorial chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potlucks are the best,'' member Andy Iwata said,
salivating at the thought of sushi and teriyaki, along with
American foods.
</P>
<P>
   For Jane Cho, whose grandparents were among the early members,
the church has ``always felt like home,'' even when she lived away
from Seattle. The Japanese Baptist Church was ``where my faith
grew,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry of the church over the years reflected changes in
Japanese American society.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, the church helped female Japanese
immigrants, including the ``picture brides'' coming to Seattle to
marry Japanese men with whom they had exchanged photographs.
</P>
<P>
   In the 13 hotels and rooming houses that catered to Japanese men
at the time, ``no safe and decent place could be found for a
woman,'' according to an article by the American Baptist Home
Mission Society.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Okazaki's wife, Yoshiko, opened a Christian
residence known as Fujin Home, which later became a training center
for young married couples and provided classes in English and on
the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   The church first met on Jefferson and Jackson streets, then on
Washington Street, where young Japanese living in the church
dormitory would get homesick hearing the train whistles from Union
Station. The church moved to its present site in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Members organized Scout troops and competed in church league
athletics, filling shelves with trophies.
</P>
<P>
   When people of Japanese ancestry on the West Coast were
imprisoned in the hysteria following Japan's bombing of Pearl
Harbor in 1941, church members were among those sent to a barren
camp at Minidoka, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in hard times, they had their faith in God,'' Arakawa
said. ``They had this determination.''
</P>
<P>
   When the war ended, the church's denomination _ now known as
American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A. _ didn't want the Japanese
Baptist Church to re-establish, perhaps for safety reasons, Arakawa
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Emery ``Andy'' Andrews, a Caucasian, was adamant
that the church survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the major denominations after World War II wanted to
assimilate all the ethnic minority groups, especially Japanese
Americans,'' said the Rev. Paul Nagano, pastor from 1971 to 1986.
``I thought, `No, we've got to affirm who we are. We should take
pride in our backgrounds as Japanese Americans.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Alfred Van Selow, the current pastor, said reaching
people of different ethnic backgrounds requires cultural
sensitivity without dilution of the Gospel message.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very certain that you do not mistake culture
for faith,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While church members once lived mostly in the neighborhood, the
congregation now is far flung, with worshipers coming from as far
as the Washinton communities of Fall City, Lynnwood and Winslow.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to the future, the congregation is attempting to reach
out more to younger families and to its surrounding community,
where the ethnic mix includes an influx of Southeast Asians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a large Nisei (second-generation Japanese American)
population in the church, but we also have to look at what we need
to do to serve the community,'' Iwata said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might not be a Japanese Baptist Church in the next 100
years. We have to look at that realistically.''

SALAD IN A CUP MAY SHAKE UP FAST-FOOD WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ McDonald's has come up with something new for a
car's cup holder: tossed salads.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-food giant is selling McSalad Shakers, a 21 oz.
salad-in-a-cup, in Los Angeles-area restaurants in a test run that
began last week. Customers buying McSalads just pour dressing over
their salad, pop the domed lid onto the clear plastic cup, and do
the James Bond thing _ shake it, don't stir.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a portable tossed salad, with the dressing
distributed across the salad and coating the sides of the cup. It's
served with a longer-than-usual plastic fork.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cup itself fits into most cup holders in the car,'' said
Lisa Dellerson, regional marketing supervisor at McDonald's Corp.'s
San Diego office. ``You hit the brake and you don't have salad and
packaging flying around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolution in salads.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers can choose between a garden, chef, or chicken Caesar
McSalad Shaker. Dressings are Caesar, ranch, light vinaigrette,
light French, Thousand Island, and honey mustard. Prices range from
$1.89 to $2.59.
</P>
<P>
   Oakbrook, Ill.-based McDonald's Corp. also is selling the salad
in a test run in Salt Lake City; Columbus, Ohio; and
Raleigh-Durham, N.C. Some of the cities have had the product for as
long as two months, Dellerson said.
</P>
<P>
   Though in the testing stage, the Shakers are likely to become a
permanent fixture on local menus, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very confident it will do well and we'll keep it, if
it's what our customers need and satisfies them _ and we believe it
definitely will,'' Dellerson said.
</P>
<P>
   The salads have been released without the usual McDonald's
fanfare, so far. The only notice of their availability are small
signs and a display bin inside each store.
</P>
<P>
   But an advertising blitz is scheduled to start May 28. and all
600 or so Los Angeles-area McDonald's will be equipped to prepare
and sell the new salads, Dellerson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles region, which includes parts of Ventura and
Orange counties, was an ideal testing ground for the new product
for several reasons, according to Dellerson.
</P>
<P>
   First, Southern California practically invented the healthy
lifestyle. And the automobile craze. Plus, Angelenos eat out
frequently and are looking for dining options, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a diverse customer base here and we're pretty
confident that Southern California is a good salad market,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Miller, a spokeswoman for Miami-based Burger King Corp.,
said the company does not comment on competitors' products.
</P>
<P>
   However, she did say that the Burger King chain for several
years had required that all its restaurants carry salads.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, the chain left it up to local restaurants to
decide whether to carry the product when it became apparent that
salads didn't sell well in every market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had spot success in some markets that performed very
well,'' she said. ``And in some, consumers didn't make a special
trip for the salads.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the McSalad should appeal to the parent who
takes a youngster in for a Happy Meal but who might not otherwise
eat at McDonald's, Lopaty said.
</P>
<P>
   And they're perfect for the on-the-go diner, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cup allows the salad to be totally portable,'' Lopaty
said. ``It's as easy to walk around with as a drink.''
</P>
<P>
   The salads attracted the attention _ and curiosity _ of Jack
Dennison, a West Hills resident who dropped by a Woodland Hills
McDonald's on Thursday with his wife, Rosemary, for a burger and
soda.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he wandered over to the glass case sitting on the
counter containing the freshly mixed salads.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you eat it?'' he asked, examining the long cups.
</P>
<P>
   After being assured that the longer forks reach all the way to
the bottom of the cup, Dennison said he would have bought one had
he only spotted them before he ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Dennison immediately recognized how the McSalad could
appeal to the harried, hungry commuter. ``It makes it easier when
you're in a car.''

SHAQ NEEDN'T BE CENTER OF ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The Los Angeles Lakers' playoff performance against
San Antonio has been so up and down, a lot of fans are getting
seasick. In the wake of the Lakers' 79-76 loss Wednesday in Game 2
of the Western Conference semifinal, we heard the first cries of
``Man overboard.'' Some of the faint-hearted wasted no time jumping
ship.
</P>
<P>
   After two physical and frantic losses to the Spurs, it's obvious
the Lakers are fishing for an NBA title in really rough waters.
Casting for answers before Game 3 of the best-of-seven series
Saturday at the Forum, it always comes back to the bait dangling at
the end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers aren't beyond angling their way into the Western
Conference final. This doesn't have to be another big season that
got away. The Lakers aren't a lure short of a tackle box, though
how swell would it be to have Elden Campbell at their disposal
right now?
</P>
<P>
   Having effectively thrown back one of their 7-footers, Campbell,
earlier in this mutinous season, the Lakers must improvise with the
other. They have to take their Big Fish, Shaquille O'Neal, and use
him as a 315-pound chub.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers don't need O'Neal to be Superman, just Superbait. On
Wednesday he attempted 11 shots. That's seven below his
regular-season average. That's also just about right.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Spurs are suffocating O'Neal with their double and
triple teams, it's foolhardy to expect O'Neal to match his
29.5-point average from the Lakers' first-round playoff series
against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much space is going to be there for
Shaquille,'' forward Rick Fox said Thursday. ``It's tough to be him
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell O'Neal about it. He can't pivot in the low post without
finding himself in an awkward dance with fellow 7-footers David
Robinson and Tim Duncan. Robinson and Duncan are taking away his
shots, his passing lanes and his breath.
</P>
<P>
   They've taken away everything else, so O'Neal ought to give them
his ego, too. If the Spurs are denying him his shot, that means
they're granting him other options. His challenge is to make the
good decision, not the impossible basket.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to making a statement, O'Neal finds himself in the
same boat as charismatically challenged presidential hopeful Al
Gore. Right now in the case of both men, less is more.
</P>
<P>
   Forget bearing the brunt of the scoring, if O'Neal really wants
to be Captain Shaq (and we believe him to be sincere in this
regard), he won't get mad and scream at an official or trash a
television set and videotape recorder. He'll get even.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lakers work the ball inside to O'Neal, he'll pretend to
be a volleyball player _ how hard can that be for a card-carrying
member of the Screen Actors Guild? _ and set the ball back to the
perimeter, to Glen Rice or Kobe Bryant or someone else, for the
kill.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a little space O'Neal wants, he's going to have to pay
dearly for it (Isn't that just the way in Southern California?). If
that means putting the ball _ and the game _ in somebody else's
hands, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're at a stage now where we have to do what is best
for the team,'' said coach Kurt Rambis. ``If they're doing a real
good job clamping down on (O'Neal) and he just becomes a passer the
entire series, we'll be able to take advantage of that. Whether
(O'Neal) gets 30 shots or zero shots, whatever works out best for
us. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal long has heard the rap that he spreads himself too thin
with his forays into music and movies. In trying to be more than a
basketball player, he has become less of a basketball player in
some people's eyes. His critics say the time O'Neal spends in the
recording studio or on a movie set could be better spent in the
gym, shooting free throws if nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   His critics probably crowed when they saw this week's Sports
Illustrated. O'Neal is on the cover, alongside rapper Ice Cube.
Studying the picture, you could read his critics' thoughts as sure
as the small print beneath the caption ``Jocks and Rock'':
</P>
<P>
   ``All the covers Michael Jordan graced and he never posed like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Let us hope O'Neal graces next week's cover. In a Lakers
uniform. Blocking a shot. And if he's bumped for some other Laker,
all the better.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has proved he doesn't need to be the center of attention.
Remember the Lakers' regular-season finale, a 119-91 win over
Portland?
</P>
<P>
   The seven-year veteran took just 13 shots, effectively ceding
the league scoring title to Allen Iverson. On that night, he was
content to show off his deft passing touch, feeding Rice for a few
of his 40 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq's sense of urgency has increased,'' Fox said Thursday.
``I can hear it in the comments he makes. I can see it in his face
when we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Will it be a passing emotion? We'll know after this weekend.

ELDERS CHANGE STANCE ON SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST
EX-PASTOR 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Elders of Overlake Christian Church now have
testimony that supports allegations of sexual misconduct against
the Rev. Bob Moorehead, who resigned last year from Washington
state's largest congregation amid a cloud of suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   The elders have heard from multiple witnesses to corroborate at
least some of the allegations leveled against Moorehead, according
to a letter sent Thursday to members of the Redmond, Wash., church.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the elders dismissed allegations of sexual misconduct
against Moorehead by 17 men because they said the incidents
couldn't be substantiated by eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But since Moorehead stepped down last June, ``the eldership has
received testimony that meets the biblical standard of multiple
witnesses,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The elders said they ``reviewed the entire matter and
unanimously concluded that Pastor Bob Moorehead did violate the
scriptural standards of trust, self-control, purity and Godly
character required for the office of elder and pastor'' at
Overlake.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 elders, who serve as the church's governing body, met
several weeks ago with Moorehead, presented him with the new
testimony and asked him to acknowledge their conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chose to reject the appeal for his acknowledgment,'' the
Rev. Rick Kingham, Moorehead's successor, said Thursday. Moorehead,
who steadfastly denied the accusations in the past, now lives in
Florida. Efforts to reach him Thursday night for comment were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the elders publicly acknowledged in their
letter that they were prepared to ask for Moorehead's resignation
last year _ even before receiving the latest evidence _ ``because
his reputation and witness in the community (were) damaged beyond
repair.''
</P>
<P>
   The elders did not talk earlier about asking Moorehead to quit
because ``at the point Pastor Bob resigned, there was not the need
to say it,'' Kingham said.
</P>
<P>
   Moorehead's decision to step down ``was not because the elders
pressed him to do that. That was of his own choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingham, who also serves as an elder, was not at Overlake when
the elders investigated Moorehead.
</P>
<P>
   The elders also announced a new written policy and procedure to
follow when any serious allegations are made against an elder,
pastor or other staff member. No written policy previously existed
that adequately addressed the issue, Kingham said.
</P>
<P>
   Any serious allegation brought against a church staff member or
elder, including the senior pastor, ``will cause that person to be
immediately suspended pending a full investigation,'' the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kingham said the policy and procedures are intended to be as
``user-friendly'' as possible because of the discomfort members may
have in accusing a church leader of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sinclair, a former pastor at Overlake, left the church in
1997 over concerns about Moorehead's conduct. Asked for comment
Thursday night on the elder's letter, Sinclair said, ``I think it's
a good start, but it's just a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingham said it was critical for Overlake ``to bring some
closure to this issue. It's been going on for a period of time. For
the spiritual health of the church, the elders felt it was
important to make a statement, especially in light of the
conclusions that came.''
</P>
<P>
   The elders struck a conciliatory tone in their letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ordinary and fallible men earnestly seeking God's will
and endeavoring to do what is right,'' they wrote. ``Where we have
failed to correctly perceive God's will, we are sorry and seek your
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Godly leadership to which elders are called requires that
they seek wisdom, righteousness and unanimity in every decision. A
great deal of prayer accompanies our decision-making process. Our
greatest desire is to serve you, our church family, in a
God-honoring way.''
</P>
<P>
   About 4,500 people regularly attend Sunday services at Overlake.
</P>
<P>
   Moorehead came under scrutiny starting in late 1997 when it was
publicly disclosed that he had been arrested in Daytona Beach,
Fla., in July 1996 and charged with masturbating in a public
restroom.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were dropped under controversial circumstances, but
the disclosure of his arrest prompted several men to come forward
last year with allegations that Moorehead sexually molested them
during adult baptism and wedding ceremonies in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The elders hired a private investigator who reported that 17 men
made accusations. But the elders said scripture required at least
one witness for an allegation to be substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   That interpretation drew criticism from other pastors and Bible
scholars. Some elders later said they followed a correct process,
but had made mistakes and that their actions were open to scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the accusations in the investigator's report stemmed
from alleged incidents in the '70s, elder Gary Scott said last
year. Of the 17 men making direct accusations, one group included
those who said they were groped or fondled, another group believed
they were the victims of incidental sexual touching and a third
concluded that Moorehead attempted to touch them inappropriately.

BROAD, NFL WILL DISCUSS ALTERNATIVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ With a meeting scheduled for early next week with
NFL owners, Eli Broad said he will present four alternatives to
area parking problems and has reduced the proposed size of the
Coliseum to 60,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum would still be expandable to 80,000 for Super
Bowls, and USC games against UCLA and Notre Dame, by adding
temporary seats.
</P>
<P>
   Broad, the billionaire who joined Ed Roski Jr. to lead the New
Coliseum effort, said Thursday his group has also developed answers
to NFL concerns about financing, marketing and stadium design, and
will present them at the ownership meetings in Atlanta on Monday.
Broad said his proposals will help distance his group from rival
Michael Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to conclude that we could be finished in time for
the 2002 fall season,'' Broad said.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL awarded Los Angeles a conditional expansion franchise
last March and selected the Coliseum as the stadium site six weeks
later.
</P>
<P>
   That left Ovitz, who had championed Carson as his preferred
stadium site, at a major disadvantage in trying to suddenly
formulate new plans for the Coliseum. He did not return phone calls
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Broad said he has also hired one of the country's top
advertising firms, Deutch-LA Inc., to formulate a marketing
program.
</P>
<P>
   He met with NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue earlier this week to
discuss the package his group will present to the NFL expansion
committee Monday night. Ovitz will also present his new plans.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has given Los Angeles until Sept. 15 to meet its various
requirements, or said the expansion franchise would shift to
Houston. Broad would like the NFL to announce the franchise fee and
new owner at next week's meetings to meet the September deadline,
but he said it might now be unlikely to happen in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Broad said his four parking solutions included an
all-underground proposal, which Ovitz has promoted, but said that
plan would cost $270 million. The renovation of the Coliseum is
expected to cost $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their call,'' Broad said. ``We do not recommend going to
this underground parking scheme that someone else is proposing. But
we're prepared to do it if that's what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad said his group will recommend one of the four plans that
would cost between $80 million and $90 million, and include a
parking structure. He said the current environmental-impact report
allows for one parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   John Semcken, executive vice president of the New Coliseum
group, said the structure would combine with previous parking plans
to provide 17,500 spaces. The NFL had talked about having as many
as 27,000 parking spaces at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Broad said the one-structure plan would include using some USC
parking and a shuttle service to empty lots downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of other things that are going on,'' Broad
said. ``There is a possibility that the Blue Line could be extended
to the Coliseum, which would allow fans from Long Beach and/or the
Valley, not to have to drive downtown at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL implied it was not fully satisfied with the Roski-Broad
rennovation for the Coliseum when it opened up stadium-design
plans, but Semcken said his group had made only minor changes in
their plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing they were concerned about in our design was,
because of the size of our market, they felt we should have more
club seats than the 15,000 we originally proposed,'' Semcken said.
``So we increased that number to 17,200. Other than that, it wasn't
a major change in the design.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad said he will present a detailed financial plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will show a hefty amount of equity _ at least $400
million,'' he said. ``The financial plan will also show what we can
accomplish in terms of some public support. The parking will be
used not only for the Coliseum but the museums and might be part of
a park-and-ride situation and some other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad also mentioned he plans to meet with former Denver Broncos
quarterback John Elway for a second time to discuss the possibility
of the former player becoming team president.

SPORTS COLUMN: THAT NOISE YOU HEARD WAS IMPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You could hear they were New Yorkers even before
spotting the orange and blue colors supporting the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Loud and familiar and pointed, these fans made up fully one
quarter of Thursday night's sellout crowd of 22,558 in the looming
Georgia Dome. They gave a verbal touch of Noo Yawk as the Knicks
humbled the home team, 77-70, to make it two straight in their
second-round playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   The New York fans outyelled their counterparts about the same
way that Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby _ the two lithe athletes
Ernie Grunfeld acquired _ cut through the weary Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   The game itself was a stinker, with Patrick Ewing deploying
himself as a decoy on leaden legs, Allan Houston unable to get off
a good shot, and Steve Smith of the Hawks barely able to get off
the ground. And this is only the second round at the end of the
short, grim season.
</P>
<P>
   At least the New York fans were up for it. When Camby made a
Pippenesque flying dunk late in the game, it was as if he had done
it in Madison Square Garden. And when the Hawks could not even
reach the rim in the final minute, the resounding chant of ``Air
ball! Air ball!'' echoed throughout the dome.
</P>
<P>
   Who were these people? Some of them were transplanted New
Yorkers, brought here by the vicissitudes of transient corporate
life. Others were current New Yorkers who realized they had a
better shot at buying tickets here than at the fat-cat emporium on
Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Estrella from the Washington Heights section of Manhattan
had bought his tickets on the Internet and flown down, via Dallas,
for $250, a bargain for Knicks tickets up north. He even brought
along his nephew.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Brown from Freeport, N.Y., said he drove down. Constantin
Marta from Howard Beach in Queens and Marco Buono from Mineola,
N.Y., couldn't stay away. There were fans wearing Starks jerseys,
Ewing jerseys, Houston jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Even factoring in the air fare, some of them were probably
saving money over what they would have to pay the friendly gents in
the shadows around the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to have fans behind you,'' said Chris Childs, who
did most of the work at point guard. ``Now we go home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same in Miami for the first game,'' Chris Dudley
noted the other day. ``There were guys with KNICKS painted on their
chests, just like Yankee fans. I think it helps us.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Hawks were not amused that Knicks' fans could
dominate the crowd of 18,513 during a 100-92 victory by the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate,'' said Tyrone Corbin. ``It's in our home
building, and they're cheering for the other team. But it happens.
We can't get wrapped up in it.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a depressing playoff game by the home team would
prompt a massive volley of boos _ just to show that New Yorkers
care, in our own surly way. On Thursday night, many of the home
fans left in the final five minutes, leaving the people in blue and
orange to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that the Hawks are merely using the dome
while their new arena is being constructed just up the hill. The
Hawks also play some games at Georgia Tech, which produces an
identity crisis among fans, who never know where they are parking
or sitting.
</P>
<P>
   The man from Congo, Dikembe Mutombo is of the opinion that
Atlanta fans ``do not care for games,'' but he is only judging from
the tepid reception to his sport. For example, Ted Turner has not
been here for any of the five playoff games _ and he owns the team.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, of course, is that there is only one sport down here,
and that is the sport called ``foo'ball.'' The Falcons rarely fill
the dome's 71,000 seats, and the National Hockey League is
returning here, after failing once before. And the Braves, one of
the great baseball teams of the decade, do not always sell out
their playoff games, either.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is the diffused nature of Atlanta, with its
_ shall we say? _ modest downtown, and suburbs that sprawl out to
Gingrich Country and beyond, dependent on clogged interstates.
Turner, the visionary, adamantly insisted on placing the new arena
next to the CNN building, rather than in the `burbs, but downtown
sports events do not produce much of a buzz.
</P>
<P>
   The way Sprewell and Camby outran the Hawks _ and the way
Knicks' fans outrooted Atlanta fans _ they probably can seal up the
dome, until it's time for foo'ball.  &QL;

ARTESIA HIGH STANDOUT PICKS UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Jason Kapono's performance on the
basketball court was fairly predictable during his Artesia High
career. No matter who the opponent was, there was little doubt
Kapono would deliver his usual 20-plus points, 10 rebounds, six
assists and overall stellar play night in and night out for the
Pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   So when the time came for Kapono to announce his collegiate
plans, you would think that he would stay true to form, right?
Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision that's sure to be viewed as shocking to some, the
6-foot-8 standout announced that he would be following in the
footsteps of Artesia alums Ed and Charles O'Bannon and attend UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by parents Joe and Joni Kapono, sister Jillian, Pioneers
coach Wayne Merino and an estimated 40 supporters at Legend's
restaurant in the Belmont Shore section of Long Beach, Kapono chose
the Bruins over Missouri, which was thought to be a heavy favorite
during the recruiting process, ahead of Arizona and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in Los Angeles, I always watched UCLA play and I
dreamed about playing for the Bruins,'' Kapono said. ``I've also
dreamed about being able to contribute to my college team as a
freshman. This past summer, when the recruiting process began, I
didn't include them on my short list of schools because I didn't
see that happening at UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   But once the Bruins failed to sign two of the prep frontcourt
players they coveted _ Juneau, Alaska, power forward Carlos Boozer
and swingman Kareem Rush of Kansas City, and a pair of frontcourt
players decided to transfer from the school _ Kapono knew he had a
chance to step in and play immediately at one of the forward
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I feel that not only can I contribute at UCLA, but I can
contribute immediately,'' Kapono said. ``It's time to follow my
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapono rewrote the record books during his four-year stay at
Artesia. He's the school's all-time leader in points (2,678) and
several other categories. As a senior, he averaged 23.5 points, 9.0
rebounds, 7.6 assists and 3.3 steals in leading the Pioneers to a
second consecutive Southern Section Division I-AA title.
</P>
<P>
   A McDonald's All-American and Parade Magazine first-team
All-American, Kapono was the second-leading vote getter in the Long
Beach Press-Telegram's Best in the West basketball poll, and was
one of three players who finished as unanimous selections.

BCS WILL REVAMP SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK GIRARDOT  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Bowl Championship Series proved anything last season, it
was that there is still no way to settle the debate over which
college football team is the nation's best.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS hopes to silence some of its critics this season by
adding two new computer formulas to its scoring system, officials
said this week.
</P>
<P>
   It will also tweak some of the more complicated aspects of the
rating system and likely give even more weight to a team's strength
of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this does is bring in more diversity and lessens the
impact of one individual computer poll,'' said Roy Kramer,
commissioner of the Southeastern Conference and mastermind of the
BCS.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS promises college football fans that the top two teams in
the country will play for the national championship during New
Year's week. In its current configuration the championship game
rotates among the Sugar, Orange, Fiesta and Rose bowls.
</P>
<P>
   This year the championship was played at the Fiesta Bowl. The
Rose Bowl will host in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Before being joined by the Rose Bowl, the BCS was called the
Bowl Alliance and relied mostly on The Associated Press media poll
and the USA Today-ESPN coaches poll to determine which teams would
play in the Sugar, Orange and Fiesta bowls.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the 1998 season, BCS standings were determined by a
combination of national polls, won-loss records, strength of
competition and computer rankings. After crunching all the numbers,
the BCS assigned each team a score. The lower a team's score, the
higher its BCS ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the BCS uses computer rankings from the New York
Times, the Seattle Times and college sports guru Jeff Sagarin of
Boston. Still the system can't get a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   One example: Through games of Nov. 21, the three computers came
up with three different No.1 teams _ UCLA, Kansas State and Florida
State _ while the coaches and writers had Tennessee and Kansas
State as their top choices. Because of its schedule strength and
the fact the Vols were undefeated, Tennessee got the top seed.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least 82 other computer rankings available on the
Internet. Although most arrive at similar conclusions as to the top
team, filling in the blanks below is a free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS needs to determine which of those ranking systems best
fits its needs, Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   But, BCS officials also believe the computers currently in use
may have some built-in bias, according to Jack French, CEO of the
Tournament of Roses Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``They felt that last year there was some regional
discrimination and by adding some computers from the South or the
Southwest it might reduce the number of comments along those
lines,'' French said.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said the region where a computer ranking is generated
could become a factor in the BCS decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each computer has various factors that they consider,'' Kramer
said. ``The goal is to get all of the various factors together. It
would be to our advantage to have a group of diverse computer
rankings to give you the best possible composite ranking.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said the revamped BCS will be unveiled in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it worked extremely well the first year,'' he said.
``Whatever changes we have will be there because we just want to
add to the excitement of college football.''

   LOS ANGELES -- The Force turned out be powerful indeed but
hardly overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's opening of ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom
Menace'' grossed $28.5 million at 2,970 U.S. theaters -- a
single-day record but far short of the $40 million-plus some
analysts predicted. Trackers offered mostly good news/bad news
reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number is quite disappointing because it's quite a bit
below consensus forecasts,'' said Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum's Barry
Hyman, who had predicted a $40 million box office take earlier this
week. ``On the other hand, I wouldn't be concerned if I were George
Lucas. Getting over $28 million in one day is still tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   The total, aided considerably by 2,011 shows starting a minute
after midnight, bested by 9 percent the single-day high of $26.1
million set by ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'? T9

   ``The number is quite disappointing because it's quite a bit
below consensus forecasts,'' said Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum's Barry
Hyman, who had predicted a $40 million box office take earlier this
week. ``On the other hand, I wouldn't be concerned if I were George
Lucas. Getting over $28 million in one day is still tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   The total, aided considerably by 2,011 shows starting a minute
after midnight, bested by 9 percent the single-day high of $26.1
million set by ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace'' generated ticket sales of 5.6 million; the
average theater took in $9,610 and sold nearly 2,000 tickets.
</P>
<P>
   It also in one day nearly matched the $28.6 million taken in by
``Titanic'' in its first three days in December 1997. But in a
business that thrives on hype, the combination of unenthusiastic
reviews and box office results below expectations underscore the
growing probability that ``Phantom Menace'' will not match the $601
million domestic total for ``Titanic'' nor its $1.8 billion
worldwide take.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, who issued a $42 million forecast Wednesday,
said issuing opening-day predictions is tricky because moviegoers
can be dissuaded from attending for a wide variety of reasons.
``The main thing that held down attendance was that Wednesday was
still not a holiday,'' he said. ``We were counting on the public to
be less morally responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a trio of factors led to the opening-day gross not
matching the inflated predictions:
</P>
<P>
   --The massive advance sales, which led to sellouts at the 12:01
a.m. and early-evening shows, did not translate into sell-outs for
the rest of the day. ``All these reports of soldout shows and huge
lines clearly made a lot of people decide to wait,'' said Linda
Bannister, analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day of a movie isn't like a piece of fruit that will
go bad if you don't eat it right away,'' agreed Kevin Skislock of
Laguna Research Partners. ``Today was the first day I thought about
even trying. So this may have been a victim of its own success
because everyone was expecting if they went they would not be able
to get a ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   --Heavy rains fell on the Northeast on Wednesday night. ``There
was horrendous weather on the East Coast, serious rain from Philly
to Boston for most of the evening and it wasn't just a drizzle
either,'' Hyman said. ``There were only 15 or 20 people in line at
some theaters last night in midtown Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   --The strong work ethic in Middle America and small towns held
down grosses for midnight and daytime shows. ``People want to see
it but I don't think we had a lot of people around St. Louis who
took off from work,'' Bannister said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than focus solely on the dark side, analysts emphasized
that setting a box office record at midweek on a nonholiday was an
impressive accomplishment. Lucas and 20th Century Fox decided in
March to move opening day from Friday to Wednesday in order to give
hard-core fans first crack at ``Phantom Menace'' and make it easier
for families with children to see the film on its first weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the first-day total is something for Lucas to be very
proud of,'' Bannister said. ``I think the expectations were out of
line.''
</P>
<P>
   David Davis, an entertainment analyst with investment bank
Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin, agreed. ``I don't see anything
negative about the opening-day figure,'' he said. ``I still think
it's well-positioned to be one of the top two releases of all time.
There is going to be massive repeat viewing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum held on to his forecast that the movie will hit $135
million in the first five days and a final gross between $375
million and $410 million, citing the strong positive responses from
audiences. ``The word of mouth is far better than the reviews,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The current record for best five-day opening is ``Lost World''
with $92.7 million while ``Independence Day'' owns the mark for top
five-day debut for a movie opening on a Wednesday, with $85
million.
</P>
<P>
   Movie analyst Arthur Rockwell said it's still unclear how well
the movie will play once serious competition arrives. ``Clearly,
this is going to break records this week, but the question is what
kind of legs it will have,'' he added. ``One would still expect it
will dominate the early part of summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Fox distribution head Tom Sherak has a bullish
outlook. ``We're going to see the audience spread out this weekend
to a lot of kids and families because people know they'll be able
to get in,'' he said. ``This movie is going to take us on a roller
coaster ride and we're holding on for dear life.''

BELL CHIMES IN TO BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The euphoria from pinch-hitter Tripp Cromer's
two-out, game-tying solo homer in the ninth inning against Houston
Astros closer Billy Wagner lasted less than half an inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was quickly transplanted by dejection after the Los Angeles
Dodgers' Jeff Shaw yielded a run-scoring double to Derek Bell in
the 10th inning as the Astros won 4-3 Thursday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Cromer hit six homers in spring training, but had just two hits
this season. Wagner hadn't allowed a homer, nor did he blow a save
in his first 11 chances this season. So on a 2-2 pitch Cromer hit a
long homer into the left field bleachers to tie the score 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   But before Shaw could record an out in the top of the 10th
inning Craig Biggio walked and Bell doubled to the right-center to
give the Astros a 3-2 lead. An error by Dodgers third baseman
Adrian Beltre on Jeff Bagwell's grounder and a sacrifice fly from
Ken Caminiti made it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner (1-1) recorded his first win while Shaw (1-2) lost for
the second time in the last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi hit a solo homer in the 10th for the Dodgers' third
run.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took a 2-1 lead in the top of the ninth by more
unconventional means thanks to a few miscues from Dodgers rookie
catcher Angel Pena. Houston's Carl Everett walked in the ninth,
stole second with one out and moved to third when Pena's throw went
into center field. Everett then scored on Alan Mills' wild pitch,
though it could have been blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Mills struck out Paul Bako but the ball went through Pena's legs
to allow Bako to go to first and Everett to score and break a 1-1
tie.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the strangest thing that happened on the base paths.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros stood on
third after apparently stealing second and moving up a base when
the catcher Bako's throw went into center field. It put the tying
run on third with one out of a one-run game.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until home plate umpire Ed Montague ruled batter's
interference on Devon White and also ruled Karros out.
</P>
<P>
   Inning over.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight night the Dodgers had a stolen base
taken away for batter's interference, but when it happened
Wednesday it was overshadowed by Kevin Brown's masterful eight
innings.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's 5-2 win, Adrian Beltre stole second but was sent
back to first when it was ruled Mondesi interfered with catcher
Tony Eusebio's throw to second.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, it threatened to destroy what was a
magnificent appearance by right-hander Chan Ho Park. The only run
he allowed came off Everett's bat, a solo homer to right field that
gave Houston a 1-0 lead in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's 430-foot blast landed in the orange seats on the
stadium's loge level, marking the sixth time in the 38-year history
of Dodger Stadium a home run landed on the loge level.
</P>
<P>
   Park wasn't as splendid as Kevin Brown was the night before, but
his seven innings of five-hit ball was a welcomed sight for the
Dodgers. Park's unwillingness to use his fastball in his previous
two starts brought the ire of Dodgers manager Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Park, who entered the game 3-3 with a 5.32 ERA, used it against
the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the first five innings, Houston had at least one
baserunner. Twice the Astros had a runner on third with less than
two outs and didn't score.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Park struck out Bagwell and got Ken
Caminiti to pop to shortstop to strand Biggio at third. An inning
later Everett homered to give Houston a 1-0 lead but after Bako
doubled with one out, Eric Young saved a run with a diving stop on
Tim Bogar's grounder. Park struck out Mike Hampton to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Park's best escape came in the fourth. Richard Hildago
doubled with one out, Bako walked and Bogar was hit by a pitch to
load the bases. But a bit of fortune smiled Park's way for a
change.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton checked his swing on an inside pitch, but hit a slow
roller to Park, who threw to Pena at the plate for the first out.
Pena threw to first to complete the double play.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hampton was throwing a similar game as Park, allowing
baserunners but never in a string to cause damage. He allowed seven
hits and walked five, but allowed one run and struck out five.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An extended family that fled the Kosovo town of
Hani-Elezit ahead of Serbian troops and NATO bombs was expected in
Los Angeles late Thursday, forced to forge new lives, yet ready to
return home one day.
</P>
<P>
   The long journey to freedom for the first 28 ethnic-Albanian
Kosovars arriving in Los Angeles from the war-torn Balkan region
hit an unexpected immigration snag following the flight from
Macedonia to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Anxiously waiting at Los Angeles International Airport was the
son, brother, cousin and uncle Hajrush Vlashi. He immigrated to the
United States eight years ago amid the first signs of the
disintegrating peace between Serbs and ethnic Albanian Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love them. I wouldn't think of going on without them,''
said the 31-year-old Vlashi. ``I want to thank every one of them
for their safety, their lives. These are the lucky ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The West Hills waiter has gleaned what few accounts of the war
his relatives reluctantly recalled in phone conversations. Vlashi
also thinks of the brother and uncle fighting for the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   So he clearly was anxious to hug and kiss his family, share sobs
and smiles before getting them resettled in the city he now calls
home.
</P>
<P>
   By his side was Renee Vlashi and their 20-month-old daughter,
Jeta _ the wife and daughter his family has never seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited. I'm nervous too,'' said Renee Vlashi, a
professional puppeteer and Valley native. ``The fact that I know
I'm doing something for them, it calms me down a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vlashis were busy calling a mattress store and making other
plans to house his parents and three siblings. At the same time,
seven San Fernando and Conejo valleys families the couple had not
met until this week were readying their homes for the 23 other
family members.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Friedman is ready to turn over two rooms in her spacious
Agoura Hills home to one family.
</P>
<P>
   The Westlake Village travel agency owner only learned of the
need for host families during a Jewish Federation lecture Thursday
morning, yet was ready to respond. After witnessing resettlement
work by the federation in Israel on a recent women's mission there,
Friedman found a way to make her own humanitarian gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people are in great danger. We've been told that
they feel they're in danger and are really afraid to go back,''
Friedman said. ``So I think they're really coming with a feeling
that it's a new life. I'll do my own little part.''
</P>
<P>
   Vlashi said such a swift outpouring of support overwhelmed them.
``We never can thank them enough. They're going way out of their
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The only setback for the Vlashi family was learning an aunt and
her three children who were expected on the flight remained in
Macedonia with eight other family members.
</P>
<P>
   Those and 21 other ethnic Albanian Muslims with relatives in
Sherman Oaks and Altadena are expected to reach Los Angeles over
the next few weeks, said officials with The Jewish
Federation/Valley Alliance, the agency sponsoring the resettlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready and we're really proud to be able to do this,''
said Miriam Prum Hess, who oversees the federation's resettlement
program.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilwoman Laura Chick arranged for a charter bus through
the city Department of Transportation to take the families to the
Jewish Federation center in West Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The federation provides signed assurances to the federal
government that the agency will resettle the families, who are
recognized as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts have been asked to house families for as long as two
weeks. The federation is seeking longer-term rental housing and
area Jewish temples are gathering assistance from the
congregations.
</P>
<P>
   While the NATO goal is to return the refugees to their Kosovo
homes under the protection of an international security force, they
are eligible to remain here as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely want to go back. They want that,'' Vlashi
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first 20 years living there, the way you grew up with your
friends and schools, that's what you first learn and nothing, no
bombing, can take that away.''

   BRITISH-AMERICA (Undated) _ Much has been made of the fact that
British culture has of late been flooding these shores with almost
colonial aplomb. Just look at Broadway and British film. Paranoia
sets in quickly: everywhere one looks there are Young British
Artists or old British television programs or new British plays.
But despite all the hemming and hawing about the Anglofication of
American life, very few cultural connoisseurs have bothered trying
out all these dandy English imports. I, on the other hand, did. My
mission was simple: to immerse myself during a mere 48 hours in all
things British, from food and drink (with an emphasis,
understandably, on the latter) to sports and sounds to theater and
art. It would take Bondian endurance (as in Bondian, James

   APPLES-VIRGINIA (Norfolk, Va.) _ Hampton Roads, the natural

Virginia Beach, Hampton and Newport News, plus the towns of
Jamestown, Yorktown and Williamsburg _ has long since overtaken
Richmond as a metropolitan area. Its population now exceeds 1.5

BANANA GLUT FORCES DOLE TO LOWER EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Faced with an oversupply of bananas in Europe,
Dole Food Company Inc. said Thursday that its second-quarter
earnings would be substantially below previous estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The company -- an international retailer of fruits, vegetables
and flowers -- expects earnings from continuing operations to be in
the 55- to 75-cent-per-share range for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, a survey of four analysts by First Call Inc. pegged
Dole's earnings at 99 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Dole treasurer Beth Potillo said an increased supply of bananas
and continued soft demand from Eastern Europe and Russia led to
generally lower prices across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union sets a fixed amount of bananas that can be
imported during the year. In the second quarter, it allowed 36
percent of that total, vs. 27 percent in the 1998 second quarter,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   That percentage could be lower on an annual basis during the
balance of the year but there is no way to predict the impact on
prices, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole also said earnings in its other core businesses were in
line with previous estimates. And the company said insurance
proceeds from Hurricane Mitch should contribute between 10 cents
and 15 cents per share to earnings for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Hill, research director at First Call, said some analysts
already are revising their second-quarter estimates for Dole, which
will report sometime in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any case they already did not like this stock,'' he said,
noting that the consensus of four analysts was a hold on Dole.
</P>
<P>
   During the March first quarter, Dole reported net income of
$37.1 million, or 65 cents per share, on sales of $1.19 billion.
That compares with income of $22.76 million, or 37 cents, in the
1998 first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy S. Ramey, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
now pegs Dole's second earnings at 75 cents a share, the upper end
of the company's estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's the high end of the range but I think we'll
leave it there for the time being,'' he said. ``It's a cheap stock
but they seem to be somewhat accident prone. They have not had
anything positive to announce in the marketplace for well over a
year now.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole's stock closed Thursday at $31.75, up 62.5 cents, a gain of
2.01 percent, on volume of 429,000 shares, about double its 30-day
average.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Westlake Village, Dole is the world's largest producer
and marketer of fresh fruit and vegetables, and markets a growing
line of packaged foods and fresh flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Dole is the second big banana producer to announce a hit on
earnings from market problems in Europe. On Wednesday, Chiquita
Brands International Inc. said it too would take a substantial
balance sheet hit during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita did not provide a range but said second-quarter
earnings would be well below the 66 cents per share of the year-ago
period.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release it blamed the decline on a
``disproportionately large second quarter allocation of the annual
supply of banana import licenses as compared to licenses issued in
any prior second quarter since inception of the (European Union)
banana quota regime.''

KNIEVEL SOARS 200-PLUS FEET AT WEST END OF CANYON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND CANYON WEST _ OK, so he really didn't jump over the Grand
Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   It was just 150 feet between the two ramps over a drainage ditch
of the big hole, not even important enough to be given a name on
local topographical maps.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is barely a wash in this country,'' chuckled Hualapai
tribal member Allan Smith.
</P>
<P>
   And Robbie Knievel wouldn't have plunged 2,000 feet to his
death, as breathless Fox network broadcasters told a nationwide
audience as Knievel revved his motorcycle's 500 cc engine for the
big moment. Maybe 75 feet and change.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Knievel showed some major intestinal fortitude as
he broke 80 mph down the takeoff ramp, soared 40 feet in the air,
flew well over 200 feet and came down hard, laying the bike down.
</P>
<P>
   He went skidding into cactuses and bales of hay before coming to
a painful stop.
</P>
<P>
   After five nervous minutes, friends helped Knievel limp gingerly
back to the ramp. He gave a weak thumbs-up to cheering supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little dingy in the head,'' he told reporters as Fox
television cameras rolled. ``I don't know what's going on. Thank
you, Jesus, I'm still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, another smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Robbie, White man can jump!'' yelled Dean Wilder, a
tribal security guard at this isolated visitors center and airstrip
on the Canyon's south rim.
</P>
<P>
   Knievel grimaced and was helped slowly to the ground. He was
loaded onto a stretcher and flown by helicopter to a Las Vegas
hospital. Jump sponsors refused to talk about his medical
condition.
</P>
<P>
   But actor Dan Haggerty, of ``Grizzly Adams'' fame, a close
friend of Knievel's who rushed to his side, said his injuries are
nothing major.
</P>
<P>
   ``He yelled, `Oh, man!' because that grade beyond the landing
area was so rough. And he went tumbling away from his bike,''
Haggerty said. ``He told me he thought he had pulled some muscles
in his back and maybe sprained his ankle.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 people came to the site at the far west end of the
Canyon, about 80 miles southeast of Las Vegas as the crow flies.
The only access is on a rough, narrow, winding dirt road through a
forest of Joshua trees.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty of Knievel's closest friends made the trip in recreational
vehicles and set up ``Knievel's Kamp'' on a mesa above the jump
site.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Havatone, a human services worker for the Hualapais, said
he was very skeptical that the jump would ever come off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cross wind was gusting up to 35 mph and most people
thought he would call it off again,'' said Havatone, who had came
to the site for Knievel's jump April 29, when snow, winds and poor
visibility forced him to postpone the stunt three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people who were there then didn't come back,'' he
said. ``But you have to hand it to him. This took a lot of guts.''
</P>
<P>
   David and Jan Murphy, who drove up from Corpus Christi, Texas,
said it was definitely the coolest thing they'd ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   David Murphy said it even beat the thrill of piloting his
tugboat as a hurricane approached in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give that man more than a 10, especially on style and
technique,'' he said. ``It was just fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Murphy said she was overcome by the moment, falling to the
ground when Knievel did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave out a big whoop when I saw Robbie get back on his
feet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hype, Haggerty said he didn't think the jump was as
difficult as Knievel's February jump of 130 feet between towers of
the Jockey Club in Las Vegas, 13 stories up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wet that night and he really had to work it to keep
from crashing into the elevator shaft on the other side of the
landing ramp,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Knievel, 37, has been jumping motorcycles for 26 years. He
jumped over the Ceasars Palace fountain in 1988 and 30 limousines
last year, as well as recording a 223-foot jump in St. Louis. He
appeared to beat that Thursday.  &QL;

YANKEES DEFEAT RED SOX, 3-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Confidence had been replaced by self-deprecation in the
New York Yankees' clubhouse. Tino Martinez lounged in front of his
locker before batting practice on Thursday and joked that he could
not stand to watch ESPN highlights anymore, because it was as if
everybody except him was driving the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill, often convinced that he will never get another
hit, asked a broadcaster if his network was looking to hire a
baseball analyst _ immediately. But Martinez, O'Neill and their
brethren could laugh at themselves because they knew a slump was
probably a temporary condition for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   They did not extricate themselves from their collective hitting
problems against Boston on Thursday night, but they did enough to
win: pitcher Orlando Hernandez found his control in the third
inning and held the Red Sox to two hits over eight innings, as the
Yankees eked out a 3-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   This was as big a victory, said pitcher David Cone, as you can
have in May. It was the Yankees' first victory since the return of
Manager Joe Torre, it prevented Boston from sweeping the three-game
series and it enabled the Yankees (22-17) to pull within a
half-game of first-place Boston. ``It felt like a must-win
situation,'' Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good time for Hernandez to rediscover his control,
which reappeared in the third inning. The right-hander had walked
two of the first six batters he faced and had labored through the
second inning, needing 21 pitches. But with a one-ball, no-strike
count on Boston's Jason Varitek leading off the third inning,
Hernandez spun a curveball for a strike. And he kept throwing
curveballs for strikes, any time he wanted, and this prevented the
Boston hitters from leaning on his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada, his catcher, saw Hernandez's intensity early, from
the way he stared in at the hitters, from the way he concentrated.
After the first inning, Hernandez returned to the Yankee dugout,
looked up at the lineup card posted on the wall and asked, ``Who's
coming up next inning?''
</P>
<P>
   Posada had never seen him do this before; Hernandez has always
pitched instinctively, never really worrying about the relative
strengths or weaknesses of the opposing hitters, insisting they
adjust to him. On Thursday night Hernandez made his own
adjustments, created a plan and a strategy, and with his control
buried the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who allowed 18 runs over 14 innings in his three
previous starts, did not allow any walks in his final six innings
tonight, and his control was so spectacular that by the seventh and
eighth innings, El Duque had expanded the strike zone being called
by Greg Kosc, the home-plate umpire. Two of the final three hitters
he faced took called third strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from their recent failures, the Yankees' hitters
provided just enough. Overeager at the plate recently, the Yankees
demonstrated some patience against Boston's Mark Portugal, and for
this they were rewarded. Martinez drew a walk leading off the fifth
inning, moved to second and then third on ground balls, bringing
Chad Curtis to the plate with a .150 batting average, more than a
month removed from his last hit with a runner in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing pitchers have exploited Curtis by throwing breaking
balls to the outside corner, and to combat this, Curtis moved
forward in the batter's box, his arms looming over home plate like
branches on a maple tree. Once Portugal reached a 3-2 count on
Curtis, Varitek, the Boston catcher, called for an inside fastball
_ he wanted to jam Curtis _ and set his target.
</P>
<P>
   But Portugal badly missed the bull's-eye: his fastball drifted
over the outside corner and Curtis whacked a single to right field,
his first hit with a runner in scoring position since April 9 and
the Yankees' first run in 14 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch was hit by a pitch to start the sixth inning and
eventually scored, and after the Red Sox cut the lead to 2-1 in the
seventh, Bernie Williams blasted a home run to center field, into
the face of a strong wind; he had to crush the ball, Jeter said
later, to hit the ball out tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's run was his second in 13 games. Jeter has no runs
batted in in his last eight games. O'Neill has no extra-base hits
in his last 12 games, and has hit into three double plays and
collected two rbi Williams' home run was his second extra-base hit
in his last 13 games, and the first home run hit by the Yankees'
3-4-5 batters _ O'Neill, Williams, Martinez _ since May 4. Scott
Brosius has no rbi in his last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez's outing gave them a chance. Mariano Rivera took
over in the ninth inning and with two on and two out, Jeter walked
the ball to the mound and slammed it into the glove of Rivera
before he pitched to Reggie Jefferson. ``Strike this guy out,''
Jeter said, quite seriously, and with a high fastball, Rivera
finished off Jefferson. Finally, the Yankees could remember what it
felt like to shake hands. &QL;

REFUGEES WEARY BUT RELIEVED TO BE IN NEW HOME IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATAC, Wash. _ They were threatened and chased from their homes
in war-torn Kosovo. On Thursday night, after a two-week stopover at
an Army camp in New Jersey, Xhavit Korqa and his family touched
down at Sea-Tac Airport, one of three refugee families resettled in
cities across the nation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I thank the American government that took the
initiative to save us from the bloody hand of the Serbian regime,
to save my family and my children,'' said Xhavit Korqa, an auto
mechanic and bus driver from Gnjilane, a small town about 25 miles
from Pristina, the capital of Kosovo province in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Korqa and his wife, Magbule, and their three daughters and two
sons were greeted by a throng of reporters and their host family.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through a translator, Korqa said he and his family
hoped to find work and a school for their children, ages 6 to 17.
Despite their long journey and exhaustion, the family managed
smiles last night.
</P>
<P>
   The Korqas are the first of an estimated 300 Kosovar refugees
expected to resettle in Washington state in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle was one of three cities Thursday to receive the first
families leaving Fort Dix, N.J., where 3,300 Kosovar refugees have
lived since fleeing their battle-torn homeland in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The three families, 18 people in all, learned only on Wednesday
that they would be moving from Fort Dix to apartments in Sarasota,
Fla., Boise, Idaho, and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Korqas will stay first in the Burien, Wash., home of Karleen
and Bruce Kennedy, before moving in to their own place.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys, who were given 24 hours' notice to prepare for
their guests, rushed to Costco to buy bulk groceries for what will
be a much bigger household.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just anxious for their arrival and hope that we can be a
little beacon of hope in their lives,'' Karleen Kennedy said. ``We
hope to help them to see that there are people who care about them
here even though it's hard to be a refugee in America.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of coincidences put the Albanians in the Kennedys' home
Thursday night. The Kennedys were the first family to volunteer to
host a family through their church, John Knox Presbyterian. The
church was one of the first to offer to sponsor refugees through
World Relief Inc., a Seattle resettlement agency.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kennedys, this is the sixth time they will welcome a
refugee family into their home. The Kennedys first hosted a
Vietnamese family in 1975 after the fall of Saigon. Every
Christmas, Cambodians, Vietnamese, Laotians, Bosnians and Romanians
gather at the Kennedys' _ their first home in America _ for a
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Each family's experience is different, Karleen Kennedy said. She
said she's looking forward to getting to know the Korqas _ though
at first, that will be through a translator, or elaborate charades.
</P>
<P>
   She wonders if the adjustment will be even harder for them, if
like many other Kosovars, they are determined to return home
someday.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, 20,000 refugees are expected to be brought to the
United States, though it is hoped that many will go back
eventually. The Korqas, while expressing gratitude for their warm
welcome, said they want someday to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Five different agencies in Seattle are working to line up group
and individual sponsors and volunteers to help refugee families.
More than 300 refugees are expected to arrive in the Puget Sound
area in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   World Relief Inc. also expects to resettle another 100 or
refugees in the Tri-Cities and Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   Many ethnic CLD9%n refugees fled at gunpoint, forced out of
their homes in Kosovo by Yugoslav forces. Often they had only
minutes to leave. Up to 800,000 Kosovars are reported to have fled
or been forced out.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next week, volunteers from the Kennedys' church, John
Knox Presbyterian, will help ferry the family to doctors'
appointments, to schools so their children can get enrolled and to
government offices _ rituals that mark the entry into American life
for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the world feels smaller, said Toby Wilson, an associate
pastor at John Knox who is helping the Kennedys. ``It's kind of fun
to be able to be a part of them starting again,'' he said.

`MENACE' MELTDOWN IN OAKTOWN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SPECIAL FX: We got your Phantom Menace right here, fans.
<P>
   Shari Sollars files this report from a city far, far away from
anywhere _ Oakland. Shari was at the 4:10 p.m. Wednesday showing of
``Phantom Menace'' at the Jack London Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``About halfway through the movie, when a plot was about to peek
out from under the special effects, the film melted in the
projector and broke. Pandemonium ensued for half an hour. They
didn't even offer us free popcorn to compensate for the
(ital)filmus interruptus(end ital).''
</P>
<P>
   It took Shari 15 minutes to realize the bizarre 3-D space
creatures were actually her fellow movie-goers.
</P>
<P>
   I checked with the theater. The film melted down because the
hamster went on a break. Blame the Rodent Union.
</P>
<P>
   NO WAY! That's not my mug shot attached to this column. It's a
computer-generated alien villain in ``Phantom Menace,'' from the
scene where Captain Ahab battles Mork on planet Livermore. Name the
villain and win a free movie popcorn or a fully loaded Ford Aspire,
whichever is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   OOPSIE! In the business world, you gotta take the good with the
bad. For super-hot credit-card company Providian Financial Corp.,
the bad is that the city DA is investigating the firm for possible
consumer fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The good is that just last month, the Examiner's annual Top 100
poll named Providian the Bay Area's No. 1 publicly traded company.
Congrats!
</P>
<P>
   SAY AHH: The city's street dentists, furiously filling cavities,
have repaired two potholes so old they had nicknames _ Piney the
Elder (Pine near Sacto), and Old Faithful (on the Embarc).
</P>
<P>
   It's sad, because both holes were under consideration for
Historical Landmark status. They provided drivers and cab riders
with some of the city's most memorable special effects.
</P>
<P>
   SAY HEY? The Giants gave away thousands of Willie Mays
bobblehead dolls, which might have to be recalled due to a defect
spotted by Scott McKellar. No matter how fast you run with your
Willie doll, the cap won't fly off.
</P>
<P>
   And a related rumor: To honor former frightfielder Glenallen
Hill, the Giants will give away G. Hill bobbleglove dolls.
</P>
<P>
   DAN Q VIRUS ALERT: Lou Bristol watched the Senate debate on gun
control, maybe because his TV test pattern wasn't working.
(Whatever happened to TV test patterns? So artistic.)
</P>
<P>
   Lou heard Utah's Orrin Hatch say the Senate needs ``to balance
the rights of law-abiding citizens against the rights of the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Look, we all have to ask ourselves: Which group am I in? No fair
sitting on the fence, unless you're a cross-dresser.
</P>
<P>
   ADD VIRUS: Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown, interviewed on ``Mornings
on 2'' Thursday, was talking about crime stats. Roberto Gonzalez
heard Mayor Moonbeam say, ``When you talk to the average person,
they're not victims of homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Good point! And when you talk to the average victim of homicide,
they don't have much to say.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that was Jerry Brown's impersonation of Dan Quayle
channeling Yogi Berra.
</P>
<P>
   SHE DOES THE TRIM: Wonder if the hotel on Sacto had any luck
with its want-ad last Sunday for a painter, offering a salary plus
rm &AMP; broad.''
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Milton Berle, give me the room and broad, and you
can keep the paint and the salary.
</P>
<P>
   Nice to see that not everyone is overly PC. I thought the term
``broad'' died with Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, anyone seen Old Blue Eyes? Elvis pops up regularly,
why not Frank? Maybe because the Chairman is way too classy to hang
out in laundromats.
</P>
<P>
   CRIME BEAT: From ``The Pine Cone'' police log, in Carmel (sent
here by Daryl Glen): ``Person at Albertson's reported an unknown
lady let a shopping cart go downhill so that it almost hit her. The
person was mainly upset the woman did not say she was sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   I tell you, Dirty Harry has let that town go straight to hell.
</P>
<P>
   E TOUND THIS: Good thing Willie's car-confiscation posse didn't
see the driver of the white stretch limo do a curbside ganga score
near Haight and Masonic.
</P>
<P>
   My spy Steve wonders if that driver provides his customers with
a designated driver.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE WAS I? Oh, yeah, talkin' doobies. Buzz out of L.A. is the
big cooe2Eh[$?g+;H97+9HgY ikVw[1ent is a balding tax accountant.
His rival is Skunk Baxter, former star of the Doobie Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Guess which guy is the far-right Republican? Hint: It's L.A.
</P>
<P>
   LAST DOOBIE ITEM: My favorite ``Phantom Menace'' character is
Oobie Doobie Doobie Doo, who looks like Roy Orbison. Dead ringer
for dead singer.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's Friday.

ANALYSIS: ZEDILLO VISIT A TRIUMPH OF SYMBOL OVER SUBSTANCE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ California Gov. Gray Davis and Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo wrapped up a three-day swing through the state
Thursday, a trip full of political symbolism and the promise of
lucrative business deals.
</P>
<P>
   No major developments were announced, despite attempts by both
sides to hype some minor initiatives and repackage others that
already exist.
</P>
<P>
   But the two leaders forged a tight cross-border alliance that is
likely to reshape California's economy and politics for many years
to come.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, they met with audiences whose ranks included
billionaires and top corporate executives, telling them that
Southern California and Mexico's Baja California are on the verge
of becoming a single integrated economy, which Zedillo said will be
``the most dynamic economic growth area of the world for the next
century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Take advantage of these new opportunities,'' Zedillo said,
noting that Mexico has recently become California's biggest trading
partner. ``California and Mexico are now partners _ we are now one
market and one area of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the movers and shakers in San Diego and elsewhere during
the trip were Carlos Slim, Mexico's richest man, and nearly the
entire roster of Mexico's business elite, many of whom have
invested in California. Others included Los Angeles-based
supermarket king Ron Burkle, one of Davis' biggest campaign
contributors last year.
</P>
<P>
   As he had throughout Zedillo's trip, Davis used the occasion to
say that the Mexican leader's visit was bringing immediate economic
benefits to California. But in the company of such economic titans,
the deals that he announced seemed modest by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Davis claimed that luring the U.S. headquarters of
Telmex, Slim's huge telephone company, from Houston to San Diego
would bring 500 new jobs to California. However, company officials
have acknowledged that all but 20 of those jobs would have been
created anyway, even without the headquarters move.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also said he will create 15 international trade centers at
community colleges throughout the state to train small firms for
Mexico trade. But Davis' move merely retools an existing program,
called the Centers for International Trade and Development, that
has operated successfully since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Other initiatives announced by Davis included: a high-speed
Internet link between California and Mexican universities; a joint
program to help Mexico fight agricultural pests; and a decision by
the El Segundo-based toymaker Mattel Inc. to open a new, $30
million factory in the northeast Mexico city of Monterrey.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the talk of quick benefits for California, the main
result of Davis' new Mexico gambit may be a further division of the
border economy between the white-collar north and the blue-collar
south.
</P>
<P>
   North of the border, corporations are establishing their head
offices and laboratories; south of the border, in Tijuana and
Mexicali, they are building their assembly plants, known as
maquiladoras, to take advantage of low wages and
government-enforced labor peace.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Zedillo said they plan to expand an existing program
of sending joint foreign trade missions to Asian nations. The
delegations, composed of government representatives from California
and Baja California, urge foreign investors to put corporate
headquarters north of the border and factory jobs south of it.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say that although Mexico is the state's largest
export destination, the statistics may be misleading. According to
U.S. statistics, 73 percent of exports are sent to the
maquiladoras, where they are assembled and then reimported to
California and other states in a revolving-door process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were the maquiladoras to be removed from the equation,
Mexico's importance as a trading partner would be dramatically
diminished,'' said Jock O'Connell, an international business
consultant and expert on California's international trade policy.
``We're our own best customers.''
</P>
<P>
   If the maquiladora trade were eliminated, Mexico would drop to
11th place among California's trading partners. But O'Connell and
Mexican officials say the maquiladoras are gradually evolving from
unskilled assembly work to complex, high-tech manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of immediate specifics, it's very hard to tell the
results of this trip,'' said Herminio Blanco, Mexico's secretary of
commerce. ``But the real results will come in the months and years
ahead. This visit is giving the green light to all sorts of
economic relationships between companies across the border.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the economic benefits from the trip for average
Californians are likely to be limited in the near future, Davis is
likely to reap immediate political gains. Zedillo's repeated
expressions of support for the governor over his controversial move
to continue the state's legal defense of Proposition 187 appears to
have stopped a backlash from the state's Latino voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis has made a lucky move,'' said Raul Hinojosa, director of
the North American Integration and Development Center at the
University of California at Los Angeles. ``He's saved himself
politically with Latinos by getting Zedillo to pull back the
wolves. Latinos are now going to give him the benefit of the doubt,
and see how mediation will work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinojosa said that although the governor will emerge a winner,
the state as a whole will also win. ``From now on, relations with
Mexico are going to have to be center stage for any California
state government. There's been a tectonic shift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This trip is all about Proposition 187. A Wilson-style hard
line against Latinos will not be tolerated anymore,'' he said.
``We've turned the corner on that type of politics.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ Coca-Cola may be America's most popular soft drink, yet
Orlando housewife America Vaughan(CQ both) is eager to point out
how her new soda, Havana Cola, is different.
</P>
<P>
   It has a citric taste, she says, with the distinctive touch of
Key lime. And although Havana Cola's can is red -- like Coca-Cola's
-- its shade is a candy-apple one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a different taste, and I think a better one,'' boasts
Vaughan, a 48-year-old mother of four. ``I believe once people try
it they'll pull a switcheroo.''
</P>
<P>
   If sheer exuberance were an asset, Vaughan -- who's never run a
business before -- would already be a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   But exuberance alone may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   By launching a new soft drink, Vaughan has taken the plunge into
the already crowded and hostile American beverage industry, one
that's filled with ample examples of prodigiousness.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers in the United States already down more soft drinks
than in any other country outside of Mexico, leaving the Coca-Cola
Co. and the Pepsi-Cola Co. battling for every smidgen of market
share they can find.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Two together enjoy more than 75 percent of market share
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And they have decades worth of advertising know-how to make sure
sales keep climbing.
</P>
<P>
   So with the average American currently drinking more than 800
servings of soda a year, industry experts doubt that the U.S.
market can yield much more growth -- unless it's at someone else's
expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``A uniquely flavored brand has the potential of getting a niche
in some regional markets, but beyond that I think the challenge
would be a herculean one,'' said John Sicher, editor of Beverage
Digest, an industry newsletter based in Bedford Hills, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are already so many soft drinks,'' he said. ``I think
people have plenty of choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vaughan's not the type to be easily deterred.
</P>
<P>
   Since it went on the market last November, she has sold some
75,000 cans of Havana Cola. Tens of thousands more have been given
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a nice clean taste that will liberate the taste buds,
and people just love it,'' the Cuban-born Vaughan beams, ``so I
think it's going to do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The product has started to win a faithful following in Florida,
one which Vaughan hopes will grow to include customers in several
other states.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she scored perhaps her biggest coup yet when
Houston-based Sysco Corp., the nation's largest marketer and
distributor of food-service products, agreed to distribute Havana
Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan is so emboldened by her product's potential that she's
striking out with another risky venture: the development of a diet
version of Havana Cola with the help of a chemist in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Dead serious, she says her goal is to earn 3 percent of the cola
market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That's news to Atlanta-based Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, I guess I'm aware of the product, but not all that
much,'' said Cocal Cola spokeswoman Polly Howes, emphasizing,
though, that Coca-Cola welcomes any and all competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there is plenty of room for anyone out there who
wants to get into this business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Havana Cola's currently available at restaurants and small
grocery stores across central and south Florida, including several
in Miami and Orlando. Barnie's Coffee and Tea Co. has agreed to
sell it, as has the Latin Quarter, a new restaurant at Universal
Studios in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the Havana restaurant in West Palm Beach, Fla.
call it their ``house soda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The drink is selling really well,'' said Rafael Perez,
Havana's assistant owner. ``Everyone who tries it wants more.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for Havana Cola was born by happenstance in the Florida
Keys, where Vaughan and her children often vacationed in the 1980s.
While there, her brother, who didn't always like to drink alcohol,
would mix Cuba Libres minus the rum, a taste the whole family
enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always enjoyed the taste of cola and lime,'' she said.
``I thought, 'Why not share the taste with others'?''
</P>
<P>
   In her native Cuba -- which she left in the 1960s for the United
States -- cola splashed with lime juice was a popular drink.
</P>
<P>
   She spent months refining that cola-and-lime taste in her
Orlando kitchen, experimenting on friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, she finally felt the time was ripe to launch her own
company. She did some research at the public library and called the
U.S. Department of Commerce to find out how to register a
trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan said her son, Greg, 23, came up with the name Havana
Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were in the Floriday Keys we would see a lot of Cuban
rafters trying to make it to Florida, and so my son became very
interested in Cuba and came up with the name,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before it can become a registered trademark, a product's name
must be published in a weekly government trademark magazine, giving
objectors a chance to notify the commerce department's patent and
trademark office.
</P>
<P>
   One early hitch developed after attorneys representing Havana
Club rum opposed registration of the name Havana Cola in early
1995, fearing consumers might be confused by the products' similar
names.
</P>
<P>
   Havana Club backed down, though, in late 1997, and Havana Cola
was registered as a trademark by August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She was then free to sign up with a bottler, and start locating
sales outlets.
</P>
<P>
   But the road ahead will be a tough one, as even major national
brands have gone from hot to not in just a few years.
</P>
<P>
   For example, California Cooler, the brand that sparked the wine
cooler craze that spread in the 1980s, faded rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   And the industry's major players are adding new products all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has developed a host of new drinks, including a
citrus-flavored one called Surge. Royal Crown Co. has come up with
a drink called RC Edge it dubs a ``power cola'' loaded with extra
caffeine and other energy boosters.
</P>
<P>
   But far from shrinking from the challenge, Vaughan has launched
a publicity blitzkrieg in Florida that's already fomented a buzz
about her cola.
</P>
<P>
   In March, she set up a promotional booth at the popular Carnaval
Miami festival. Vaughan crowned a Miss Havana Cola at the booth, a
Colombian named Lexdiana Ortiz. In April, the cola was the featured
beverage at a three-day, dead-fish-throwing contest -- known as a
mullet toss -- near Pensacola, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Havana Cola logo also will be featured on Ron Burkett's race
car when he competes June 19 in the Slim Jim NASCAR race at the
Lanier National Speedway in Gainesville, Ga. One of her neighbors
is a friend of Burkett's -- now a big fan of the drink.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vaughan continues to give away free samples of Havana
Cola everywhere she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my belief that people's palates have a very good
memory,'' Vaughan said. ``If I give them a taste, you can bet
they'll be back for more.''

   In 1992, she finally felt the time was ripe to launch her own
company. She did some research at the public library and called the
U.S. Department of Commerce to find out how to register a
trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan said her son, Greg, 23, came up with the name Havana
Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were in the Floriday Keys we would see a lot of Cuban
rafters trying to make it to Florida, and so my son became very
interested in Cuba and came up with the name,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before it can become a registered trademark, a product's name
must be published in a weekly government trademark magazine, giving
objectors a chance to notify the commerce department's patent and
trademark office.
</P>
<P>
   One early hitch developed after attorneys representing Havana
Club rum opposed registration of the name Havana Cola in early
1995, fearing consumers might be confused by the products' similar
names.
</P>
<P>
   Havana Club backed down, though, in late 1997, and Havana Cola
was registered as a trademark by August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She was then free to sign up with a bottler, and start locating
sales outlets.
</P>
<P>
   But the road ahead will be a tough one, as even major national
brands have gone from hot to not in just a few years.
</P>
<P>
   For example, California Cooler, the brand that sparked the wine
cooler craze that spread in the 1980s, faded rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   And the industry's major players are adding new products all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has developed a host of new drinks, including a
citrus-flavored one called Surge. Royal Crown Co. has come up with
a drink called RC Edge it dubs a ``power cola'' loaded with extra
caffeine and other energy boosters.
</P>
<P>
   But far from shrinking from the challenge, Vaughan has launched
a publicity blitzkrieg in Florida that's already fomented a buzz
about her cola.
</P>
<P>
   In March, she set up a promotional booth at the popular Carnaval
Miami festival. Vaughan crowned a Miss Havana Cola at the booth, a
Colombian named Lexdiana Ortiz. In April, the cola was the featured
beverage at a three-day, dead-fish-throwing contest -- known as a
mullet toss -- near Pensacola, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Havana Cola logo also will be featured on Ron Burkett's race
car when he competes June 19 in the Slim Jim NASCAR race at the
Lanier National Speedway in Gainesville, Ga. One of her neighbors
is a friend of Burkett's -- now a big fan of the drink.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vaughan continues to give away free samples of Havana
Cola everywhere she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my belief that people's palates have a very good
memory,'' Vaughan said. ``If I give them a taste, you can bet
they'll be back for more.''

 &HT;    CUBA-RUSSIA DEAL TO BUILD NUCLEAR PLANT IN CUBA DOWNPLAYED BY
SKEPTICS
 &HT;    With JURAGUA-TIMELINE-$ADV22.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., May 22 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For Cuba watchers, it has become a familiar pattern:
Cuba and Russia announce a deal to jump-start construction of the
mothballed Juragua nuclear power plant on the communist island.
</P>
<P>
   Then, due to prohibitive costs -- it would take an estimated
$650 million to $1 billion to finish the project -- construction
never resumes.
</P>
<P>
   The latest such announcement came May 14, when Cuba and Russia
declared that they had reached agreement on forming a joint venture
to complete the plant and its first reactor.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was part of a trade deal that allows Cuba to swap
its sugar for Russia's oil.
</P>
<P>
   But similar declarations have been made before -- perhaps four
times in seven years -- leading experts on the project to downplay
its significance, as well as reiterate their insistence that the
plant will likely never be completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement is meaningless,'' said Jonathan
Benjamin-Alvarado, a University of Georgia professor writing a book
on the Juragua (pronounced ``HUR-ra-gwa'') project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing more than two very poor and economically
strangled countries trying to consummate an agreement that is
mostly hollow and fiction,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He said the signing of such agreements has become almost as
reliable as Christmas, although no progress has ever been made in
arranging actual financing.
</P>
<P>
   Construction on the plant was launched in 1982 with the hopes of
alleviating the chronic electricity shortages that still plague
many parts of Cuba. But construction stalled 10 years later with
the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba's main benefactor, after
more than $1 billion had been pumped into it.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, Cuban officials announce that work will resume,
but even Cuban President Fidel Castro said last year that prospects
for the project looked bleak, and that Cuba would start searching
for alternative energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarado said Cuba has recently built small geothermal energy
plants tapping into steam from deep wells to provide reliable
electricity in areas frequented by tourists, such as Varadero,
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Juragua project is opposed by U.S. officials -- and
especially conservatives in Congress -- who worry about the
prospects of a Chernobyl-like disaster 240 miles away from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   They say Cuba lacks safety standards and a mature regulatory
body to oversee Juragua, which utilizes old Soviet technology.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they worry that a leak could spew radiation as far
west as Texas and as far east as Washington, D.C. with the brunt
falling on Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Many American nuclear experts, though, say the Juragua plant is
conservatively designed and is safer than Ukraine's ill-fated
Chernobyl plant because it has a containment wall.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential threat has prompted the Pentagon to spend $2
million this year on a radiation-monitoring system to collect air
samples scattered across Florida, Mexico and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear physicists at Florida State University have spent the
last two months collecting and analyzing air samples. Four other
air-monitoring stations are scheduled to be established in states
along the Gulf of Mexico within the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   But experts familiar with the Juragua project say the U.S.
government is wasting its money protecting citizens from something
that doesn't yet exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan borders on lunacy because no one even knows if the
Juragua plant will ever be finished,'' said Thomas Cochran, a
senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a
Washington-based environmental lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Even a U.S. State Department official told Cox Newspapers this
week that the plan would appear to be a waste of money if its sole
purpose was to monitor radiation from the Juragua plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see no evidence that the Juragua project is moving forward
or that any financing is being made available,'' said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran, who has visited the Juragua plant twice, said that even
if construction resumed today, it would take four to six years to
complete the plant. He said the Pentagon's radiation-monitoring
scheme -- if needed -- could be up and running within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby Kemper, the chairman of the FSU physics department, agreed
that a baseline for the project will likely be finished within a
year.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the May 14 announcement made by Cuba and
Russia proves the radiation-monitoring project is valuable and must
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really just insurance because we really don't know
what these countries are going to do from one minute to the next,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army Lt. Col. Bill Darley, spokesman for the U.S.
Department of Defense, said the radiation-monitoring stations are
being established ``out of prudence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba has always stated an intention to complete the plant,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed, though, that no country is in a position to provide
the kind of financing that's needed to finish the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The May 14 agreement was signed by Russian Trade Minister Georgy
Gabuniya and Cuban Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the Juragua plant, Cuban officials this week
agreed that the lack of financing was a major obstacle to finishing
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish we could work with the Americans on it,'' said Carlos
Fernandez de Cossio of the Foreign Relations Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Georgia's Alvarado, who's visited Cuba five
times to research the project, said buildings at the Juragua site
are 70 percent complete, but that the ``instrumentation and
control'' system -- the most important part of the project -- is
only about 20 percent complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be completed but it is difficult to conceive how
anyone would get a return on an investment of this size,'' he said.
``Many international firms from Italy, Spain, Brazil, and France
have taken a look at this project, and walked away.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSARE, Kosovo _ The hard-faced soldiers lining the perimeter of
the guerrilla army base stood at the ready, fingers on the triggers
of their AK-47 assault rifles, prepared to mow down an attacking
Serb force.
</P>
<P>
   But the immediate purpose of the Kosovo Liberation Army troops
standing guard in their mountain compound was to serve as targets
for us, a dozen visiting foreign correspondents and cameramen
escorted by the KLA from Albania into the southwestern highlands of
Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA wanted us to see their remote base at Kosare (pronounced
ko-SHAR-ah) and talk to their earnest soldiers. They wanted us to
document their military toehold in the face of claims from Belgrade
that the armed resistance movement has been eliminated, along with
the 800,000 refugees who have been pushed out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence was plain to see in the dense Kosovo forest,
shadowed by towering, snow-dappled peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Here, a mile inside Kosovo from the Albanian border, the rebels
exist.
</P>
<P>
   They also bleed.
</P>
<P>
   A sudden artillery duel with the Serbs that left three KLA
soldiers seriously wounded wasn't part of the KLA's publicity plan.
But it was all too genuine.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has discovered, as has NATO since it began its daily
bombing campaign on March 24, that conquering Yugoslavia's army and
security forces is not an easy task.
</P>
<P>
   A loose collection of clan-led militias before the NATO air war
began, the KLA lacks sufficient training, heavy armament and
vehicles hearty enough to handle the rugged mountain tracks.
Ammunition and other supplies from Albania are often moved on
horseback or tractor cart (the latter was our mode of travel in one
leg of our journey into Kosovo).
</P>
<P>
   But they seem to have plenty of rifles and bullets, light
artillery and mortars captured from the Serbs. They also are armed
with a firm devotion to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not afraid to kill or be killed because we fight for
what we believe in, to free our homeland,'' said 18-year-old Roland
Rama, a student from the Kosovo's provincial capital, Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken young man cradling his rifle to his chest, Rama
has been stationed at the base for a month but has yet to use his
weapon in battle. He peered at the horizon, listening longingly to
the echoes of artillery fire and the pop-pop-pop of automatic
rifles from the forward positions.
</P>
<P>
   While KLA and Serb foot patrols on occasion skirmish in close
proximity, the combat here is primarily limited to artillery and
snipers positioned in opposing mountain ridges. For the past 40
days or so, the result is a standoff that is producing casualties
on both sides
</P>
<P>
   The KLA's 138th brigade, based at Kosare, a former Serb police
barracks, has had three firefights with Serb forces in as many
days. The rebels managed to push another 300 to 500 yards into
Kosovo, only to retreat in the teeth of superior firepower from the
Yugoslav army and police units. The gains and losses are slight
real estate that do not essentially change the equation.
</P>
<P>
   This is an authentic corner of the war over Kosovo, albeit at
the moment an inconsequential one. Nothing the KLA does in the next
few days or week is likely to have a bearing on when Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic might capitulate or when NATO will end
its air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the KLA is in a race against time to establish itself firmly
as an organized fighting force in Kosovo, and as a real player to
be included in a diplomatic formula for peace. The more land it can
control before a settlement is imposed on Yugoslavia, the more
clout it could bring to the table. (The current diplomatic
framework agreed upon in the U.S.-brokered Rambouillet peace
proposal calls for the KLA to be disarmed.)
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has been using the ramshackle Kosare base, a two-story
brick building pockmarked by holes from shelling and small-arms
fire, as a launch pad for efforts to break open a corridor deeper
into Kosovo. They control the territory that runs about a mile
between the base and the Albania border, providing a supply line of
men and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The strategic aim is to link up with pockets of the KLA who
never left the province, but who retreated deeper into the
mountains and away from the towns and villages being brutally swept
by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   If the guerrilla army at Kosare can break through, it could gain
territory and re-supply ammunition to soldiers already in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are striving to further organize our forces and bring
forward more troops to get rid of these Serb positions once and for
all,'' said Xhafer Gashi, the deputy commander in charge of
security and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   During our visit last week(CQ), three KLA fighters were
seriously wounded during artillery exchanges with Serb forces dug
in about a mile away. It is not a convenient place to be injured.
The only exit into Albania runs over deeply rutted dirt roads cut
through the torturously steep mountains. The nearest hospital,
poorly supplied, is hours away.
</P>
<P>
   In tactical terms, NATO provides help in the form of its air
attacks on the Serb positions. It is inadvertent air support for
the KLA ground troops. Despite rumors of cooperation, there seems
to be no coordination between NATO jets and the guerrilla fighters
on the ground other than the fact that they share common targets.
</P>
<P>
   But since the KLA has been always outmanned and outgunned by the
Serbs, NATO has helped to equal the playing field. Yugoslav forces
probably could easily retake the base at Kosare, according to
Western military observers in Albania, but they dare not because if
they moved in mass, they would make their positions known to NATO
warplanes, and be struck.
</P>
<P>
   But from the KLA's perspective, this is a separate war apart
from NATO. The KLA has its own agenda and claims it will not give
up until Kosovo achieves independence from Yugoslavia, something
any diplomatic solution between NATO and Belgrade is not likely to
include.
</P>
<P>
   In the lush woods and blossoming mountain pastures along the
border with Albania, there is no talk of cease-fires or peace
negotiations, only of war and victory.
</P>
<P>
   As we hiked about three miles out of Kosovo to a KLA training
base near the Albanian border town of Papaj, we passed new recruits
going in. Some of them are volunteers from America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Most are young men from Kosovo who were pushed out of the
province by the same cleansing of ethnic Albanians that produced
the masses of refugees in neighboring Albania, Macedonia and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters walked in platoon-sized, single-file columns. They
were dressed in green camouflage uniforms and each with a rifle and
banana-shaped clip of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   They, as we, passed the result of Serb shelling in recent days:
large bomb craters along the road, splintered trees in the hills
and the carcasses of several dead horses. Our KLA guide pointed out
one wide hole in the ground where he said three guerrilla soldiers
died in an artillery barrage a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers walking by appeared excited and scared, like
stereotypes from a B war movie, raw recruits eager to get into the
action and frightened by the prospect of what was just around the
bend. Some flinched as the sound of outgoing artillery from a
nearby KLA position issued a thunderous, bone-rattling roar as a
shell was launched; others just smiled and gave us the thumbs-up
sign.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kosare base, the KLA commanders had made a conspicuous
effort to impress upon us that this makeshift army now pursues the
war as a well-oiled military machine.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the young men headed to battle left a sense that the
propaganda may not yet be completely true, but the passion and
sense of purpose are there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not like it was before, when we had bad organization and
no vehicles and poor equipment,'' said Nevruz Hasani, a former
schoolteacher from Junik in Kosovo who, at 38, is a veteran among
the fighters we saw that day. ``Now it is really a pleasure to
fight because we feel we are equal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   (Cox Newspapers foreign correspondent Charles W. Holmes was the
only American among a dozen journalists recently taken into
embattled Kosovo province by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.)

 &HT;    Toledo: A Spanish city full of spirituality, art and lots of
history
 &HT;    By BOB RUFF
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After returning from Spain, I was watching sports on TV when the
commentator yelled, ``Holy Toledo, what a play!'' I had just been
in Toledo. Not the one in Ohio, but Spain's religious capital, its
spiritual center, its holy city. Is that where the expression
originated?
</P>
<P>
   Toledo (pronounced tow-LED-oh in Spanish) is 1 1/2 hours south
of Madrid by train. Approaching the city, which is on the banks of
the River Tajo, and seeing its skyline, makes one eager to get
there. Miraculously preserved from the effects of the modern world,
this castled city retains the atmosphere and structure of an old
medieval fortress. Churches, museums, hotels, shops, restaurants
and parks blend together in a maze of narrow stone streets that beg
to be explored.
</P>
<P>
   While Toledo is an ancient city, it is no museum piece. A modern
city exists around and among the precious antiquity. In the city's
main square, where the buses pull up with tourists, there is a
Museum Santa Cruz, old-fashioned eateries and a McDonald's. Walking
the winding streets, one finds the old and new mixed together as if
it were planned that way all along.
</P>
<P>
   The first written testimony, by the Roman historian, Tito Tivio,
describes ``Toletum'' as a small fortified town. Being at the
crossroads of the Spanish peninsula, the city was strategically
important for controlling this country. The Visigoth kings made it
the capital of their kingdom in the sixth century AD, giving it the
name, ``The Royal City.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic people called it ``Tolaitola'' during their rule;
the 10th-century mosque, Crist de la Luz, is the oldest building
preserved intact. King Alfonso VI of Castille reconquered the city
in 1085, making it the capital of his kingdom. This began Toledo's
most glorious era, and it was during this period that Christians,
Jews and Muslims lived together in relative harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo remained the capital of Spain until 1561, when Felipe II
moved the government to Madrid. The Catholic Church, however, kept
the seat of the primate in Toledo, where it remains to this day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1577, Domenico Theotocopoulos arrived in Toledo from Rome.
The Italians there, not being able to pronounce his name (Try
saying it aloud. See what I mean?) just called him ``El Greco'' _
literally, ``The Greek.'' This 36-year-old artist, a native of the
island of Crete, and perhaps the greatest mannerist of his day,
would live and paint in Toledo until his death in 1614. His work
adorns the city, and if these treasures were all Toledo had to
offer, it would be worth the journey just to gaze at these
wonderful masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Churches and museums throughout the city house his art,
including the El Greco Museum, which adjoins the artist's home.
Although El Greco became Toledo's most famous adopted son, many
other works of the old masters can be found here, including Goya.
This city is an art lover's paradise, filled with museums and old
churches that house vast collections.
</P>
<P>
   Waking up on a weekday morning, one hears the sounds of people
hurrying to work and young children laughing on the way to school.
This city is no relic preserved for tourism. It is humming with
daily life. On the weekend, festivals in and around the city add to
the excitement. Traditional dancers fill the main square, to the
delight of locals and tourists alike. Almost anything one cares to
do or see is within walking distance.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has been declared, in its entirely, a part of the
Heritage of Humanity. Few cities can compare with the varied
architectural styles found here. Arabic, Mudejar, Gothic and
Renaissance buildings are mixed together with many monuments,
making every corner turned a new experience.
</P>
<P>
   While there are too many architectural treasures to relate in
one story, the most significant building of the city is the great
cathedral. The dominant structure of the city's skyline, it was
built to commemorate the victory over the Muslims in the Battle of
Las Navas de Toloso in 1212. Construction began in 1221 and the
main structure was completed in 1493 in the time of Cardinal
Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   His successors, the great patron-prelates, thanks to their large
financial resources, continued to enrich and furnish the cathedral,
adding chapels, jewels, paintings, organs, altar pieces, codexes
and sculptures, converting it to one of the most opulent churches
in Christendom.
</P>
<P>
   Like all Gothic cathedrals, the front was planned to have two
symmetrical towers but only the one that holds the 20-ton bell was
completed. The companion tower is covered with an octagonal tambour
and a lovely dome built by Jorge Manuel, El Greco's son.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo is world-renown for its sword making. In fact, the U.S.
military has its swords manufactured here. Many of these factories
offer tours and have large gift shops where one can purchase or
order a custom-made sword from any era in history. I opted for a
letter opener shaped like a sword.
</P>
<P>
   This city is the capital of the province of La Mancha, and of
Don Quixote. There is no lack of statues of this famous mythical
figure in the local souvenir shops. In fact, one can buy a
full-size Don Quixote. In this case I opted for a T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing over the River on the St. Martin bridge, I watch the
sun set on this incredibly beautiful medieval city. Whether part of
a visit to Iberia, or as one's only destination, this castled city
will make one realize why Toledo will always be revered and
considered holy.

 &HT;    Reading routine continues, a warm deal between Mom and Son
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ I'm not one of those parents who daydream of the
big moments in their children's lives: the driver's license, the
graduations, the wedding day.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to look that far ahead. But for a year or two, I've
been looking forward to _ and dreading _ a different milestone:
learning to read. Not the see-Spot-run stuff my son mastered last
year in kindergarten, but the real enchilada.
</P>
<P>
   Forget ``The Wedding March'' and ``Pomp and Circumstances;'' I
couldn't wait for ``A Wrinkle in Time'' and ``The Narnia
Chronicles,'' ``Little Women'' and ``Treasure Island.''
</P>
<P>
   But I also had mixed feelings. One of the greatest joys, from
babyhood on, has been reading to my kids. Nothing makes me feel
closer than snuggling with them, a book on my lap.
</P>
<P>
   I charted Alec's intellectual growth through his library,
starting with ``The Very Hungry Caterpillar'' and moving up to
``The Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil Frankweiler.'' I approved some
of his tastes _ the late, great Shel Silverstein and E.B. White _
and tolerated others (``Goosebumps,'' ``Scary Shark Tales,'' bad
knock-knock jokes). It almost didn't matter, so long as we sat side
by side, sharing the story, waiting breathlessly to see how it
would turn out.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen when he didn't need me any more, when he could
read on his own? Would it signal the first of many steps toward
separation?
</P>
<P>
   I worked with Alec anyway, buying stacks of
teach-your-child-to-read books. I tried to drill diphthongs,
inculcate consonants.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted none of it. He wanted me to read to him, according to
the natural order of things. And he wanted to learn to read on his
own. His progress was his _ and his teacher's _ business alone.
Butt out, Mom.
</P>
<P>
   How well could he read? I couldn't be sure. He loved books, but
he didn't seem to pick them up very often on his own. The mystical
connection hadn't happened yet, when you and the book become one.
Was it possible that it never would? He would become a capable
reader, of course; we would see to that. But we couldn't force him
to love reading.
</P>
<P>
   What if all those Good Night Moons and Berenstain Bears had been
for naught? What if two inveterate bookworms had brought yet
another nonreader into the world?
</P>
<P>
   And then it happened, the day that I saw the key turning in the
lock. The catalyst was ``The Simpsons. A Complete Guide to Our
Favorite Family.'' Alec chortled as he read aloud: ``I will not
pledge allegiance to Bart.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegiance? Was this the same kid who, not so long ago,
struggled with ``frog''?
</P>
<P>
   He reads cereal boxes, billboards. He picks up Time magazine and
the newspaper, especially when ``The Phantom Menace'' is featured.
</P>
<P>
   To my relief, our reading ritual remains virtually undisturbed.
Last night, Alec asked me to read the last story in ``Scary Shark
Tales'' (which had proven too scary for me if not for him, with
limbs being devoured with alarming frequency).
</P>
<P>
   But I did notice one change in our bedtime routine. ``How about
you read a book to me,'' Alec will say, ``and I'll read a book to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a deal to me.

 &HT;    Did even Honest Abe fudge in defending a client?
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ Now that modern technology and DNA
evidence have confirmed that Thomas Jefferson, our third president
and a founding father, has a few skeletons in his closet, and after
learning several other White House residents are guilty of
indiscretions not included on their campaign resumes, I was further
shaken by a letter from Neal Dettmering, a prominent Douglasville
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   A while back, I wrote a column about my brilliant defense of
Helen Adams in a mock trial staged in our eighth-grade civics
class. Helen had been identified by witnesses who swore they saw
her going into Mr. Durham's chicken house at night, and emerging
with two laying hens. I was her court-appointed defender.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution appeared to have an airtight case until I, the
budding Clarence Darrow, stumbled across an account of how Abraham
Lincoln, when he was a young lawyer in Illinois, had gotten an
accused murderer off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant had been charged with stabbing a man to death in a
late-night street fight. Like my client, he had been identified by
witnesses who claimed to have seen him do the deed. Lincoln,
wondering how they could see so unerringly at night, maneuvered
them into testifying that they were helped by light of a full moon.
</P>
<P>
   He then produced an almanac showing there was no moon on the
night of the murder. His client was acquitted. Hoping for the same
luck in my case, I consulted an almanac. There was no moon on the
night Helen was accused of stealing chickens. Using Mr. Lincoln's
tactics, I led prosecution witnesses into testifying how they had
clearly recognized her in the moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   After I produced the almanac, the jury quickly voted for
acquittal. Ferrol Sams, the presiding judge and a real lawyer, said
later he considered issuing a directed verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Dettmering, a native Fayette Countian who went on to play
football at Auburn before going to law school, wrote to say that my
account of the almanac cases had come to his attention, and perhaps
there might be an added twist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I attended a seminar on trial tactics and evidence, including
how to get publications accepted as evidence,'' he wrote. ``The
seminar speaker added a postscript to Mr. Lincoln's Illinois murder
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that in the original transcript of the trial the
almanac Mr. Lincoln produced was described as having a blue cover,
and that subsequent research determined there was no almanac with a
blue cover published anywhere at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So there is speculation that the almanac publisher was Lincoln
himself!''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know. I'd hate to think Honest Abe cheated, even as a
young lawyer. You'd think judges and jurors of that time, being
mostly rural folks, would know when the moon fulled without relying
on an almanac. But strange things happen in courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The most astonishing not guilty verdict _ before O.J. Simpson _
I know about came several years ago in a local court. Two young
hoodlums had broken into the home of an elderly lady. She was
robbed and badly beaten. The whereabouts of one assailant was
unknown. The other had been arrested, positively identified by the
victim and had made a confession.
</P>
<P>
   The court appointed the late Howard Handley to defend him. Mr.
Handley was a brilliant courtroom lawyer, but despite his best
efforts, the accused was plainly headed for a lengthy prison
sentence. After finishing his closing argument, Mr. Handley was
obviously surprised and baffled when the defendant asked to take
the stand.
</P>
<P>
   The young man proceeded to spin a yarn about how the other
fellow, whereabouts unknown and unavailable for questioning, had
pulled a pistol and forced him, at gunpoint, under threat of death,
to participate in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated for several hours before returning a
verdict of not guilty. Mr. Handley seemed to be in shock when I
went up to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with the verdict,'' I said, ``but you won an
impossible case.''
</P>
<P>
   We were joined by several jurors. ``Mr. Handley,'' one inquired,
``when did you learn about the gun?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What gun?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun that the other person used to make him commit the
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that gun!'' said Mr. Handley. ``I learned about it at the
exact moment you did.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers do get surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago one of my partners defended a guy for stealing a
hunting dog,'' Dettmering wrote. ``When the fellow was acquitted he
was so excited that right there in front of the judge and jury he
blurted out: `Does that mean I get to keep the dog?'''

 &HT;    It grows on trees, but not all wood works outdoors
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the more vexing questions to confront a
woodworker is which wood to use for an outdoor project.
</P>
<P>
   Of course you can use any wood strong enough to suit the purpose
if you paint it, but painting often goes crossgrain to someone who
is accustomed to making indoor furniture in lovely wood selected
and finished to show off its natural beauty.
</P>
<P>
   I have constructed only one such project _ a pair of Adirondack
chairs. I built them in white oak.
</P>
<P>
   Oh my, those things were a beast to build. The oak was so hard
that screws kept breaking off in it. But they came out looking very
nice. They did not look nice for long, however. They turned gray,
which I expected, but it is a blotchy, sickly-looking gray.
</P>
<P>
   You will still find lots of folks recommending oak for outdoor
things, but I wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The only reasonably available choices that remain, as far as I
know, are redwood, cedar, mahogany and teak.
</P>
<P>
   Cedar isn't very strong. It's also splintery. I've never made
anything of redwood, but it ought to be fairly good if great
strength isn't required.
</P>
<P>
   Mahogany, like oak, has been widely used in the ship-building
trade, especially for trim. It ought to be pretty good, but it will
also be pretty expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The best wood for outdoor use is probably teak. It's strong and
stable and will weather to a pleasant gray color. It will also cost
an arm and part of a leg and it is very tough on edged tools
because of its unusually high silica content.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the stuff made for redwood, and perhaps for cedar, I
know of no finish that will really protect a wood's natural color
when left outdoors. They will all turn gray.

</P>
<P>
   Mahogany, like oak, has been widely used in the ship-building
trade, especially for trim. It ought to be pretty good, but it will
also be pretty expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The best wood for outdoor use is probably teak. It's strong and
stable and will weather to a pleasant gray color. It will also cost
an arm and part of a leg and it is very tough on edged tools
because of its unusually high silica content.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the stuff made for redwood, and perhaps for cedar, I
know of no finish that will really protect a wood's natural color
when left outdoors. They will all turn gray.

world's highest mountain (Everest, 29,029 feet), and the deepest
ocean (Mariana Trench, in the Pacific, 35,797 feet). And this would
suggest that the Earth is all explored. But at the dawn of a new

still haven't been charted. What are the unexplored places, and why
hasn't anyone reached them yet? (Cox Washington Bureau)

   CANCER-TOBACCO _ At a gathering of American Cancer Society
affiliates in Atlanta this week, the big topic is evil tobacco and
how companies are luring new smokers, particularly young people, in
foreign countries. In Poland, for instance, the most popular
selling brand is Lady Di cigarettes. While the U.S. has limited
billboards and sales to young people, most foreign countries
haven't, and they're exchanging information on what works to slow
cigarette sales. (Guthrie, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15. FOR

   LOWCHOLESTEROL-MARGARINE _ The people in white lab coats have
pulled another fast one on Nature, by creating margarine-like
spread that actually lowers cholesterol levels. Two brands of
cholesterol-reducing spreads have been approved by federal
officials within the past month. On Monday the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approved Benecol, manufactured by McNeil Consumer
Healthcare, a division of Johnson &AMP; Johnson. Three weeks ago, the

him up by first threatening, then seducing Dalton's then-wife

of the world's population will remain impervious to the full effect
of this mania. But there are others for whom ``Star Wars'' was

   FILM-CAPSHAW-PROFILE (Undated) _ ``The Love Letter,'' which Kate
Capshaw developed and co-produced, is her most significant role

Doom.'' But the film's debut butts heads with ``Star Wars: Episode
I _ The Phantom Menace.'' The Love Letter could be slaughtered.
Capshaw is not looking at it that way. She thinks there might be a
lot of viewers who crave a romance rather than a ``Star Wars.'' By

A JUST WAR OR JUST IRRESPONSIBLE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALEX A. VARDAMIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARMEL, Calif. _ Prime Minister Tony Blair, the fiery warrior,
advises widening the war in the Balkans by introducing ground
forces, while bellicose President Clinton's faith in aerial
bombardment remains unswerving.
</P>
<P>
   Both are adamant in pursuing their ``just war'' against Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic. However, another Englishman may offer
sounder guidance. In ``Henry VI,'' William Shakespeare wrote:
``Thrice is he arm'd that hath his quarrel just, And he but naked,
though lock'd up in steel, Whose conscience with injustice is
corrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   In its relentless bombing of Yugoslavia, is NATO thrice arm'd or
naked? Are our two warrior chieftains morally exposed? Are they
conducting a just war? Both Blair and Clinton draw moral lessons
from World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Blair spurns Neville Chamberlain, the arch-appeaser. Clinton
insists that if Franklin Delano Roosevelt had intervened early
against Hitler, the Holocaust might have been prevented.
</P>
<P>
   World War II, both agree, was a ``Just War.'' They compare it to
their struggle with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But is this Balkan battle really a just war, in the theological
and ethical sense? Or is it merely a feel-good public relations
war? Since armed conflict inevitably causes vast destruction and
slaughter, it is justified, in the tradition of Augustine and
Thomas Aquinas, only if it meets certain criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Theologians have agreed upon five ethical standards that must be
met before a civilized nation, or alliance, has the moral right to
start a war.
</P>
<P>
   _ First and foremost, there must be a just cause to wage war.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization found it in the ethnic
cleansing of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. However, when the war
began, the flood of refugees was largely potential. It did not
begin, at a catastrophic level, until the first bombs fell.
</P>
<P>
   _ The aims of the war must be controlled by just intent. Early
on, Blair and Clinton said that they had to attack Yugoslavia in
order to preserve the credibility of NATO. Extending the power of a
military alliance and augmenting American influence in Europe is
dubious moral justification for waging war.
</P>
<P>
   _ The decision to go to war must be made as a last resort after
every other reasonable means of settlement have failed. Diplomacy
requires patience. Rambouillet was a hasty ultimatum to Serbia and
not a serious attempt at negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   _ The decision to go to war must be made by a legitimate
authority. To ignore this principle is to invite primitive blood
feuds and gang warfare. Neither the United Nations nor the U.S.
Congress sanctioned this war. NATO, a defensive organization,
violated its own charter by intervening, militarily, in a civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   _ A just war requires a reasonable prospect of success. The
means used by NATO, around-the-clock bombing, or even a land
invasion, is hardly likely to promote the only justifiable end,
ethnic harmony in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Once a war begins, two criteria must govern the conduct of
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Discrimination must be observed. A belligerent must avoid harm
to civilians and refrain from wanton violence. The hundreds of
innocent civilians who have been pulverized, incinerated and
dismembered prove that it is hard to achieve discrimination from
15,000 feet. NATO's desire to avoid pilot casualties increases the
horrific carnage that is euphemistically called collateral damage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Proportionality must be observed. If a war does more harm than
good, it is ethically indefensible. Over 10,000 munitions have been
dropped upon a small country. Unexploded bombs drift in the
Adriatic. Stability in the Balkans teeters on the brink.
</P>
<P>
   The human, physical, environmental and political devastation
caused by the NATO war is disproportionate to the goal of pacifying
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the failure to meet any of the just war criteria,
NATO insists that its war with Yugoslavia is legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   The allies emphasize that the enemy, Milosevic, is an evil thug,
responsible for the murder, rape, plunder and displacement of
Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is more to the picture than Western spin. The Serbs
tell another story. They emphasize the mangled, charred corpses of
innocent civilians. They remind us that the Kosovo Liberation Army,
too, has blood-stained hands. They speak of ecological devastation.
But what they conceal might be even more gruesome.
</P>
<P>
   NATO killed nearly a hundred refugees in the village of Korisa
because of a mistake in targeting. Imagine how many hundreds of
young Yugoslav draftees, asleep in barracks far from the
battlefield, have been intentionally blown to bits every night by
NATO smart bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Truth lies somewhere between the propaganda of either side.
</P>
<P>
   Did years of Serb discrimination of the Kosovars or weeks of
NATO bombing cause the worse humanitarian catastrophe? Have torches
in the hands of paramilitaries or cluster bombs dropped from B-52s
destroyed more homes? Have more young Albanian men been shot by
Serbs than young Serb men been incinerated by NATO bombs? Is death
from a bullet fired at close range more a violation of human rights
than the risk-free, systematic ``degradation'' of Milosevic's
military from three miles up? Does the bombing campaign in the
Balkans really constitute a just war?
</P>
<P>
   NATO's leaders insist it must ``win'' at all costs. But at what
moral price? Shakespeare might have foreseen the bare rumps of our
warrior chieftains peeking through rusty, corrupted armor.

EXTRAVAGANT `CLEOPATRA' MAKES WASHINGTON LOOK TRIVIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is what politics should be all about. None of this
mamby-pamby special prosecutor stuff and powerless intern
mistresses and hoary howls of outrage from adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   No, in the old, old days the head of state had affairs with
another head of state, and there was none of that ``I did not have
sexual relations with that woman'' stuff. And back then, political
backstabbing was no figurative term.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in some fratricide, double-dealing, triple-dealing and
coalitions that shift faster than the Sahara in a sandstorm and you
have the story of Cleopatra.
</P>
<P>
   It is a story worth retelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleopatra,'' the extravagant miniseries that in many ways is
more of an original than a remake, will air Sunday and Monday at 9
p.m. Eastern on ABC (check local listings).
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleopatra'' can't be done small, and the latest Hallmark
Entertainment version for ABC is no exception: The cost for the
four-hour television movie is in the neighborhood of $33 million.
We are talking almost three ``ER'' episodes here.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the 1963 movie version, a disaster of epic
proportions starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and Rex
Harrison, cost $44 million (after an original budget of $3
million). That would make it the most expensive movie ever,
according to various sources, since in contemporary dollars that
translates to somewhere around $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   The new miniseries also engages in some wretched excess in the
best sense of the word. Filmed in Morocco and London, Hallmark
boasts that the set for the city of Alexandria measured a
quarter-mile. One ton of copper was used to make jewelry and
costumes, including breastplates. In the largest of scenes 1,000
extras and 600 horses were used. This is a televised DeMilling.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the versions in 1917 (a silent movie), 1934 (which Cecil
B. DeMille actually made, starring Claudette Colbert) and 1963, the
updated ``Cleopatra'' portrays the Egyptian queen as much more than
just an evil seductress.
</P>
<P>
   In her eyes and body, sex is a weapon, a political weapon, and
she wields it deftly and often. The difference is, her actions are
founded in the belief that what she does, she does for her country.
She is as smart in the boardroom as in the bedroom, a Cleopatra for
1990s sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The characters are titans of history and literature: Julius
Caesar, Marc Antony, Octavian, Brutus and, of course, the Egyptian
ruler. And ABC and Hallmark Entertainment have also assembled an
impressive lineup, from Timothy Dalton (the former James Bond, as
Caesar), Billy Zane (Cal Hockley of ``Titanic,'' as Marc Antony),
Rupert Graves (``A Room with a View,'' as Octavian, also called
Octavius), to director Franc Roddam (``Quadrophenia'') and
executive producer Robert Halmi Sr. Most of Halmi's recent
miniseries (``Gulliver's Travels,'' ``The Odyssey,'' ``Alice in
Wonderland'') have been masterful-event television. ``Cleopatra''
is a worthy addition to this lineage.
</P>
<P>
   But who plays Cleopatra? Well, the long-dead monarch needed a
makeover, free of preconceptions, the filmmakers said. Enter
relative newcomer Leonor Varela, an exotic Chilean raised in
Colorado who now calls where else? Paris her home.
</P>
<P>
   Varela, who previously appeared with another ``Titanic'' alum,
Leonardo DiCaprio, in ``The Man In the Iron Mask,'' plays the queen
as someone willing to play any and all angles to keep Egypt at
least semi-autonomous from Rome even at the risk of being branded
``the Whore of the Nile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you, Cleopatra?'' Caesar asks her before bedding her.
``Are you someone I can trust?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am Egypt,'' she replies, ``and Egypt is yours for one night
only.''
</P>
<P>
   And ours for two nights.

TRUE CONFESSIONS OF A CERTIFIED JEDI GEEK 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Star Wars,
</P>
<P>
   nothin' but Star Wars ...''
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Murray's ``Saturday Night Live'' lounge-singer
character sang those inane lyrics to John Williams' ``Star Wars''
theme music, he was lampooning the hold the original movie had on
American (and world) popular culture for months after its May 1977
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' was then a pervasive phenomenon that could have
been described the way Obi-Wan Kenobi described the Force: ``an
energy field created by all living things; it surrounds us, it
penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 22 years later, Murray may have to warm up his vocal chords
and put on his leisure suit again. With the arrival of ``Episode I:
The Phantom Menace,'' ``Star Wars'' mania has hit the cultural
landscape with all the force of, well, the Force.
</P>
<P>
   A certain segment of the world's population (they may number in
the dozens) will remain impervious to the full effect of this
mania. To them, George Lucas' original movie was an exciting,
well-produced science-fiction adventure with great special effects
and fake-looking aliens _ remember the bat-faced creature begging
for a drink in the cantina scene? _ nothing more, nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   But there are others for whom ``Star Wars'' was something else
altogether. Let's call them, for simplicity's sake, Jedi geeks (we
know who we are).
</P>
<P>
   For us, ``Star Wars'' (and its sequels, ``The Empire Strikes
Back'' and ``Return of the Jedi'') was a fable for the Space Age, a
myth on the order of ``The Iliad.'' Between scenes of galactic
destruction, it imparted the wisdom of the ages to our
adolescence-addled minds.
</P>
<P>
   To us, merely watching the movie several (or several dozen)
times wasn't enough. We read the novelizations, the
behind-the-scenes books, the comic books. Yes, we bought the action
figures. A few years later, we even listened to the 13-part
National Public Radio version (let's see them try that with ``The
Matrix.'')
</P>
<P>
   We learned that in addition to shamelessly borrowing from
sources as diverse as ``Flash Gordon,'' Hollywood westerns and
Akira Kurosawa films, Lucas was heavily influenced by esteemed
mythology professor James Campbell's seminal book, ``The Hero With
a Thousand Faces.'' Lucas took the basic structure of the hero
myths of various cultures across the globe _ which Campbell called
``the hero's journey'' _ and refashioned it in a futuristic setting
that, while technologically far ahead of our own, was still ``a
long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   This mythological sense was created on many levels:
</P>
<P>
   _ Small pieces of dialogue, such as the early scene when the
persnickety 'droid C-3PO addresses hero Luke Skywalker as ``Sir
Luke,'' echoing the Arthurian legends.
</P>
<P>
   _ The clearly delineated characters representing Good and Evil.
</P>
<P>
   _ Williams' rousing score, patterned after the Romantic-era
Norse epic operas of Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   _ Darth Vader, in his black robes and breath mask, looking for
all the world (or solar system) like the Black Knight.
</P>
<P>
   But the thing that really sealed the deal was the lightsaber.
When Ben Kenobi gave Luke his father's weapon, and Luke set it
alight with that great whoosh, our hearts leapt to our throats. A
sword made of laser-light. How cool could you get?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the references were easy to spot. Obi-Wan Kenobi was
clearly patterned after Merlin the magician, with some samurai
master thrown in for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   Others were harder to catch. We learned that the Death Star
trash compactor was the dark, dank place that (according to
Campbell) the Hero must enter before emerging again into the light
(as in the biblical story of Jonah in the belly of the whale).
</P>
<P>
   Yoda, the Jedi Master who took Kenobi's place in ``Empire,'' was
the equivalent of the small gnomes who guide the Hero through his
perilous journey. But the puppet-makers who fashioned him also gave
Yoda the eyes of Albert Einstein, to enhance the little green guy's
sage status.
</P>
<P>
   It was Yoda who gave voice to the Saga's (we Jedi geeks always
refer to the films as the Saga) most profound tenets:
</P>
<P>
   ``Always in motion is the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Jedi uses the Force only for defense, never for attack.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course: ``Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.''
(The last was quoted fairly recently in the ultra-hip ``Chasing
Amy.'')
</P>
<P>
   This is the thing that noninitiates don't get about the Saga's
hold on us Jedi geeks. To those of us growing up in the
freewheeling, post-Watergate Me Decade of the 1970s and the early
'80s, the films were discussing, in an entertaining way, what the
politicians call ``values.''
</P>
<P>
   To wit:
</P>
<P>
   If an evil Galactic Empire is about to use its most fearsome
weapon against a ragtag group of rebels (including a beautiful
princess), you help out, even if the odds against you are abysmal
and even if you've just been given the equivalent of the Texas
Lotto.
</P>
<P>
   If your best friend has been flash-frozen in a block of metal
and is being held captive by a 3000-pound slug, you must help your
friend. It's just that simple.
</P>
<P>
   If the worst villain in the galaxy, who has previously cut off
your hand, turns out to be your father, well, you might cut off his
hand, too, but you still give him a chance to redeem himself.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, most of us aren't presented with such dilemmas very
often. Still, the basic messages are universal: courage in the face
of wrong-doing; loyalty to friends and family; taking
responsibility; compassion. Or, as Spike Lee put it, ``Do the right
thing.''

VIDEO CARD GAME GETTING COMPETITIVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For serious computer game players, there was only one type of
video card worth considering for 3-D graphics six months ago _ one
that used the Voodoo2 chip from 3Dfx Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   The cards built around Voodoo2, such as Diamond Multimedia's
Monster II or Creative Labs' 3D Blaster Voodoo2, were the fastest
around and provided a gorgeous look when using the OpenGL 3-D
graphics system, or 3Dfx's own Glide scheme.
</P>
<P>
   These were add-in cards, which supplemented but did not replace
a PC's standard graphics adapter. The complication of adding a
second graphics card into a finicky PC was worth the trouble to
intent gamers, who consider onscreen speed a sort of high-tech Holy
Grail.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that was then. This is now.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 3Dfx announced plans to merge with Richardson,
Texas-based STB Systems, which makes graphics cards. No longer
would 3Dfx simply supply its chips to other card makers. The
company changed its name to simply 3dfx (note the lower-case ``d'')
and began cranking out its own 2-D and 3-D cards with a new chipset
_ the Voodoo3.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, fans rejoiced.
</P>
<P>
   The Voodoo3 is faster _ much, much faster _ than the Voodoo2.
And, because it can handle standard Windows graphics as well as
3-D, it eliminates the hassle factor.
</P>
<P>
   But 3dfx's competitors weren't standing still. While it can be
argued that, for now, the Voodoo3 remains the fastest 3-D card out
there, it may not hold that claim for long. And, it may no longer
be the best 3-D game option.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO 3-D &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I tried out a Voodoo3 3000 card ($180), which is designed for
computers that have an AGP graphics slot. A less-powerful version,
for users who require a graphics card that fits in a PCI slot, is
available in the Voodoo3 2000 ($130).
</P>
<P>
   I also tried out a competitor's card, though unfortunately not a
retail version. Nvidia, another graphics chip company, supplied me
with a reference board built around its new Riva TNT2 chips.
Companies such as Diamond will be producing cards with these chips
_ the Diamond Viper V770 ($180) should be available soon, if it's
not already on store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The two cards represent very different approaches to 3-D
graphics. The Voodoo3 doesn't do much to advance the now-classic
Voodoo ``look,'' focusing instead on raw speed. In fact, some
detractors have called it the ``Banshee2'' _ a reference to another
3dfx product that offered both 2-D and 3-D capabilities, but cut
back a bit on the latter.
</P>
<P>
   The TNT2 is almost as fast as the Voodoo3, but produces a much
prettier look. This is not to say that the Voodoo3 doesn't look
great _ it does _ but the TNT2 takes the graphical appearance to a
new level.
</P>
<P>
   And an even faster version of the TNT2, call the TNT2 Ultra,
also will be offered by card makers. I'll be looking at one soon.
</P>
<P>
   To test the look and playing speed of the cards, I used Q3ATest,
a preliminary version of the upcoming Quake III Arena from id
Software. Like the previous installments in the Quake series, it's
a first-person, hunt-it-down-and-kill-it game in 3-D, but the
emphasis in this version is on multiplayer death match, where
people play against each other on a network or over the Internet.
Its beautiful environments require a powerful 3-D graphics
accelerator, and it's tailor-made for either of these cards.
</P>
<P>
   I also tried them out with Quake II, as well as Microsoft's
Flight Simulator 98. All games and cards were used on a Dell
Dimension T500 PC, with a 500-megahertz Pentium III chip and 256
megabytes of memory.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SHORT OF NIRVANA &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Voodoo3 3000 runs at a clock speed of 166 megahertz and has
16 megabytes of video memory. This allows it to display resolutions
of up to 2,045-by-1,536 pixels. However, the Voodoo3 is limited to
16-bit color rendering, or 65,000 colors. (Through some internal
conversions, 3dfx says the Voodoo3 actually has 22-bit color
capability).
</P>
<P>
   But, it cannot display 32-bit color, or 24 million colors,
considered the Nirvana of game display.
</P>
<P>
   The TNT2 card I tried had 32 megabytes of video memory and a
clock speed of 120 megahertz. (Be aware that the companies that
will actually sell this card likely will ratchet that speed up a
bit.) The TNT2 can display 32-bit color at resolutions up to
2,045-by-1,536, and does so beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   The Voodoo3 is incredibly fast _ in most of my tests, it nudged
out the TNT2 at resolutions of 1,024-by-768 and lower. At higher
resolutions, though, the TNT2 won because it has more video memory.
The Voodoo3 began to run sluggishly with Quake III Arena above
1,024-by-768, while the TNT2 didn't start bogging down until it got
to 1,600-by-1,200. Also, the TNT2's performance suffered very
little when running at 32-bit color.
</P>
<P>
   While the Voodoo3 is fast, its graphics just can't match the
richness of the TNT2 card. Note that this is only for those games
capable of 32-bit graphics. Quake III Arena is 32-bit enabled;
Quake II is not.
</P>
<P>
   But even with 16-bit games such as Quake II and Flight
Simulator, I still like the overall look of the Nvidia card better.
</P>
<P>
   How are these cards for 2-D? Both are blazing when working in a
Windows desktop, playing video and working with educational and
children's software. You couldn't lose either way.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are serious about 3-D games, there is a clear choice
here, and it's any card that uses Nvidia's TNT2 chips.

`LOVE LETTER' ISN'T A BAD GREETING CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's the mawkishly generic title, or maybe that it's been
programmed as the distaff ``Phantom Menace'' alternative, but ``The
Love Letter'' is a movie you dislike on principle.
</P>
<P>
   So damn director Peter Chan and the nook-and-cranny whimsy of
Maria Maggenti's script for disarming skeptics with a lack of
saccharine and an ensemble in equal refusal to leave things sugary.
Cute, however, is another story.
</P>
<P>
   But when sanguine, dewy-eyed and dreamy conversations about the
rapture of two people sharing an ``epistolary relationship'' end in
lascivious barbs, it's difficult to fault this film for
occasionally wandering into pleasantville. Throughout the script,
there are salty exchanges between Kate Capshaw's lonely bookstore
owner and her man-hungry best friend Janet (Ellen DeGeneres at her
sublimely Thelma Ritter-est).
</P>
<P>
   Helen (Capshaw) starts having fantasies about a letter she found
jammed between the cushions of her sofa, fixating on the idea of
the man who could have sent it. Soon people are catching the letter
like a cold, finding it hanging around Helen's store, reading it
and falling in love with the writer. This is one of those New
England sleepy towns where no one locks doors, the eccentrics ride
bikes and it wouldn't be surprising if Jessica Fletcher has a
charge account at Pop's.
</P>
<P>
   There's a classy, subversive polish to all this familiarity that
snaps the pap into shapely storytelling, thriving on conveniences
and contrivances. Only you don't see the film for the cheeky
statement on real love it is until you know who the author and
addressee of said love letter are.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chan makes a formidable, attractive Hollywood debut
with a film whose subject rivals his own Hong Kong work in its
sophisticated dances of disconnect between the romantically
challenged. He seems frighteningly content early on being swamped
in Nora Ephronica with old-heads like Roy Orbison and Louis
Armstrong telling you how to feel on the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Like the pro-literacy Ephron and www.webphobic.org movie
industry, ``Love Letter'' finds the Olde Book Shoppes as the last
sanctuary of mental purity, cultural cleanliness and Luddite
romanticization. But Chan tempers the restlessness with less pep
and pop than Ephron (``You've Got Mail'') and a larger reserve of
confidence and self-control that similarly delays the inevitable
long enough for archetypes to grow into characters.
</P>
<P>
   Capshaw has been trying for two decades to parlay that
Hollywood-Golden-Age name and her seductively angular face into
something more than Dame Spielberg and the ersatz fame that
follows. The closest she's come is darkly slinking off with '89's
``Black Rain.'' Here, she's effortlessly withdrawn and as appealing
as she's been on film. The spindly, inspired, entirely brilliant
Tom Everett Scott as Helen's love-struck employee persuades Capshaw
to loosen up.
</P>
<P>
   And a post-``Ellen'' DeGeneres slings one-liners the way the
less articulate flip birds. The cast also features Scotswoman
Geraldine McEwan and fidgety pixie Julianne Nicholson, as the
candied feminist Scott's character uses her to get close to Helen.
</P>
<P>
   The only stiff is Tom Selleck, playing a fireman also burning
for Helen, who always seems to be acting with commercial breaks in
mind. By the time Blythe Danner and Gloria Stuart as Helen's mom
and granny wander into town and the piano in great Luis Baclav's
otherwise fantastic score starts twinkling intermittently, ``Love
Letter'' is already as suspiciously confabulated as an long-form
Hallmark ad. But Chan, Maggenti and Co. infuse it with the rankled
wit of a Shoebox Greeting.

`EPISODE I' FILM NOTHING LIKE BEING THERE FOR ACTORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Critics may complain that there's less life in the
human elements of ``Star Wars: Episode One _ The Phantom Menace''
than in the computer-generated ones.
</P>
<P>
   But the actors who worked on the movie beg to differ. They say
making George Lucas' follow-up to his influential science-fiction
trilogy was a fantastic experience.
</P>
<P>
   When it wasn't driving them nuts, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I showed up on this set, the hardest job I had was to
stop grinning,'' says Samuel L. Jackson, a ``Star Wars'' fan since
he saw the first New York screening of the original film in 1977.
``It was, `Look at this!' I walk into my dressing room, Jedi
outfits, put one on, stand in front of the mirror, went, `Yeaaah.'
A guy comes over and says, `Pick a lightsaber.' I take one _ boom!
_ put it on. Walk on the set and there's Yoda. I said, `OK! Here we
go.'''
</P>
<P>
   To put it more succinctly: ``All of it was cool,'' according to
Jake Lloyd, the 10-year-old actor who plays Anakin Skywalker in
``Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``Phantom Menace'' demanded the most of its actors'
imaginations and stamina. Shot in England, Italy and the Tunisian
Sahara, incorporating an unprecedented 2,000 computer effects shots
and packed to bursting with weird creatures, machines, costumes and
environments, it was a tough job just to keep up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, it seemed like I was just going to have the best
summer ever, but it was so much harder than I expected,'' notes
Natalie Portman, who plays the heroic _ and outlandishly wardrobed
_ teen-age space queen Amidala. ``I really liked the people that I
worked with, and George is wonderful, but we worked really long
days, we were in the desert for a long time, and I had to wear ...
not the greatest costumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have done harder things for money,'' she notes with a
laugh, ``but it wasn't as big of a breeze as I thought it was going
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Liam Neeson, who plays veteran Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn in the
prequel, has numerous scenes with alien co-stars who were
completely generated by computers long after he'd filmed his parts.
In many of those cases _ such as with the elastic-limbed,
hyperactive Gungan Jar Jar Binks or the crude, hovering junkyard
owner Watto _ actors were on the set impersonating the creatures.
</P>
<P>
   But it was still a challenge to play against essentially unknown
quantities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to act with something that isn't there,'' notes the
towering Irishman, who's more accustomed to playing notable
historic figures (Oskar Schindler, Michael Collins, Oscar Wilde) on
screen and stage. ``Yet there's a technique to it. My main
consideration was that I didn't want to be like those early, early
science fiction films where you see the hero with a glassy-eyed
stare, trying to fight some huge ant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were anxious to get some kind of input from in back of the
camera,'' Neeson continues. ``Sometimes, little colored pingpong
balls helped focus the eyes. Yet you didn't always want to do that,
because in real life your eyes go all around the room when you're
talking to someone. For the first couple of weeks, that was
tricky.''
</P>
<P>
   Even trickier was a climactic lightsaber fight pitting Qui-Gon
and Ewan McGregor's youthful Obi-Wan Kenobi against Darth Maul, a
devil-headed villain played by stuntman Ray Park. More vigorous
than the swordfights in the original trilogy, this confrontation
required intense acrobatics as well as a more elaborate
choreography, since Darth Maul's laser blades shoot out in two
opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a problem finding time to rehearse it, and I especially
love to rehearse something which can potentially be dangerous,''
says Neeson, who did his share of swashbuckling in the likes of
``Excalibur,'' ``The Bounty'' and ``Rob Roy.'' ``The `Rob Roy'
fight was rehearsed for 10 weeks. But (`Menace' stunt coordinator)
Nick Gillard and Ray Park were absolutely superb. Ray not only had
to play Darth Maul, he learned my moves and Ewan's moves, so
anytime we'd get stuck or couldn't remember the balletic step or
whatever it was, Ray could always show us the way. It was like a
very intricate dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Dance _ breakdancing, to be exact _ was the major component of
Ahmed Best's performance. That and some Charlie Chaplin, Jackie
Chan and Buster Keaton. Best was both the stand-in and model for
the computer animated Jar Jar, and also provided the creature's
mostly indecipherable, hard-to-warm-up-to voice track.
</P>
<P>
   ``No accent!'' insists Best, a native New Yorker of Caribbean
heritage. ``I mean, I dunno, I guess there is an accent because
everybody has been hearing one. But it's completely unintentional.
There was no Caribbean in it, no Jamaican, no patois, no Creole, no
French, no German, no nothin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Jar Jar's body language is another unique form of expression.
Best came up with all of the clumsy amphibian's jellyfish
movements, then modeled them for lead animator Rob Coleman after
the fact in the computer studio. While on the actual set, Best wore
a complete Jar Jar costume, sans only the floppy, uncontrollable
ears.
</P>
<P>
   This made jumping around like a fool difficult enough. But in
Tunisia, where scenes set on the desert planet Tatooine were
filmed, Best says the latex costume added some 80 degrees to the
already scorching, triple-digit temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cool because I was so hot, it was easy to shoot laser
beams out of my eyes,'' Best jokes. ``Actually, what you see here
is completely digital animated; I really didn't survive!''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extreme demands, Best claims that ``every day was
fun. I didn't have a bad moment on the set. There's no dirt in
`Star Wars: Episode I.' Isn't that shocking? Everybody was really
happy, as far as I could tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who has a small, sedentary role as Jedi Council member
Mace Windu, claims he would've been pleased just to play a guy in a
nondescript Stormtrooper uniform. But even though his ``Star Wars''
enthusiasm knows few bounds, he repeatedly expressed the hope that
he'll get some real action in the prequel sequels.
</P>
<P>
   And if there's a dark side to his encounter with the Force,
Jackson indicated that the idea of computer-manipulated performers
does not sit well with this acting Jedi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The synthespians,'' the Oscar-nominated star of ``Pulp
Fiction'' says dismissively. ``I don't think you can get a
synthespian to do what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Oscar nominee Neeson does not echo Jackson's sassy
confidence. Indeed, he recently said that he was quitting movie
work; he now claims that statement was made in jest and anger, but
it was definitely a reaction to the dehumanizing demands of modern
high-tech moviemaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult to constantly have to hit marks and be
careful about what you're doing with your arms and such,'' Neeson
reports. ``If you make the slightest wrong move, you might knock
something that's going to be there in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   The final result, though, was worth it _ even if it does come
with its own unique frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with the movie,'' Neeson says. ``But I've only
seen it once. It's like being very hungry and somebody brings you a
tray of all your favorite foods, but you just have time to grab the
french fries before it's taken away. I need to see it a few more
time to digest it.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger actors are predictably more enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome; there are whole scenes that didn't even enter
into my mind the first time I saw it,'' says Israel-born Portman,
who was not a ``Star Wars'' fan before she started taking in
multiple screenings of ``Phantom Menace.'' ``I was just so amazed
by all the scenery that I got distracted. I didn't recognize 99
percent of the settings; it's funny to watch yourself walking
around a place that you've never been to. It's a huge exercise in
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it. All of it,'' young Lloyd concludes, having seen
the movie three times. And counting. &QL;

FOR FLOYD MAYWEATHER JR., A BRIGHTER FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Floyd Mayweather Jr. should have known life was
going to be a little different for him the day his dad got shot in
the leg while he was holding his son. The shooter was Floyd Jr.'s
mother. Floyd Jr. was a year old.
</P>
<P>
   Things have been kind of hectic ever since.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Floyd Sr. was four months removed from losing a
tough bout to Sugar Ray Leonard in which he broke his hand early
and lost consciousness late. In the middle he did pretty well,
which sums up the way most of his career went in boxing. Pretty
well in the middle. Not so good at the end.
</P>
<P>
   The same has not held true for his only son, however. Floyd Jr.
went on to steadfastly follow in his father's footsteps when they
led to a boxing ring, but studiously avoided the ones that led his
father to bullet holes and a federal prison in Michigan. Just call
it a boxer's story. A family story. Just don't call it a Kodak
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to make the mistakes I made,'' Floyd Sr. said
as he prepared his undefeated son for Sataurday night's third
defense of the World Boxing Council super featherweight title they
won together last October, 24 months after Junior came out of the
Olympic Games and nine months after Senior came out of the prison
cell where he'd resided the past 5 1/2 years. ``I made enough for
both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The son was 16 and already a highly ranked amateur when his
father made the biggest mistake of his life and was convicted of
conspiring to traffic in drugs, large detergent boxes filled with
cocaine being central to the case. He was sentenced to 5 1/2 years
in prison and did them all, and while he was away, his boy grew
into a man, a young man who would become a 1996 Olympic bronze
medalist, a three-time National Golden Gloves champion, and a
budding professional who would make his debut Oct. 11, 1996,
without his father in his corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't so much about doing the time as it was losing the
time,'' Floyd Sr. said. ``I'd trained him since he was a baby. He
was boxing doorknobs when he was a kid. I used to take him to the
gym and put him on my shoulders so he could hit the bags. Then I
missed so many moments.''
</P>
<P>
   He missed his boy becoming the first American Olympian to beat a
Cuban fighter in 20 years, but he heard about it. He missed him get
robbed of the chance to fight for gold in Atlanta in 1996 and
settle for a bronze medal, but he heard about it. He missed his pro
debut, a second-round knockout of Roberto Apodaca in Las Vegas, but
he heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   Heard about all the moments he missed but saw none of them, no
TV in prison available on the nights young Floyd began to move
farther along in boxing than old Floyd ever reached.
</P>
<P>
   All he had were his memories and the days his son would come to
visit, days that were hard on the old fighter and the young
fighter, as well. Hard on the father and on the son, even though
the son works hard to hide the hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at it as he was gone away for a while but he'd be
back,'' Mayweather said Thursday. ``It wasn't that hard for me to
deal with. When he wasn't part of my life, I did what he wanted me
to do. I kept winning.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the father was away, life went on. The son continued to
fight under the occasionally watchful eyes of his uncles, two-time
world champion Roger Mayweather and longtime professional Jeff. He
continued to fight even without his father to take him to the Tawsi
Gym in Grand Rapids any more like he did in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   He kept fighting and he kept winning, going 84-6 as an amateur
and 13-0 as an professional before his father finally came back to
him last year. Yet when he's honest about it, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
had to admit those days were hard to deal with. Hard for the father
and harder for the son. Hard the way a boxing life can be hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me become a man,'' Mayweather said. ``It hurt when he
told me he was going away. I needed him so much some times it hurt
inside. It hurt until he came back. But there was no more crying
after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your father's locked up, he don't want to see his son, who
he taught to be a man, crying. But things happen for a reason. I
saw my father's downfall. I learned to stay away from drugs. I
learned if you didn't, you end up dead or in jail. I feel I know
how to deal with pressure better than anybody because I faced it
since I was young.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad went to prison and I went on and won a world
championship and he was right there in my corner. He's been down a
bad road but he's back now to make sure I do the right things.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, he's done nothing but. After the Olympics, Mayweather
signed a promotional deal with Bob Arum that paid him a $100,000
bonus plus living expenses in Las Vegas and a guarantee that he
would earn at least $100,000 his first year and $150,000 his
second. Eight days short of his second year as a prizefighter, his
father was training him again and he was destroying a game super
featherweight champion named Genaro Hernandez, who had never lost
at 130 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fight most people thought young Mayweather was not yet
ready for. Hernandez was considered the class of the 130-pound
division, having lost only once when he moved up to fight Oscar De
La Hoya at 135, while Mayweather had had only 17 professional
fights.
</P>
<P>
   His father laughed at the skeptics, promising that the world
would see Hernandez ``isn't crap.'' His son backed up his words,
making Hernandez look that way until the fight was stopped with the
dethroned champion sitting on his stool and declining to continue
after eight rounds.
</P>
<P>
   One fight later, the father thrust the son back in against
highly regarded Angel Manfredy in a tough match many felt was
coming too soon. Manfredy lasted only two rounds. Unlike many
people, Floyd Mayweather Sr. was not surprised. Just as he is not
surprised today that his boy is considered among the top fighters
in the world at 22, an undefeated world champion who seems in
little jeopardy when he fights a replacement named Justin Juuko
because his original opponent, Goyo Vargas, pulled out 72 hours
before their match was scheduled to be broadcast on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   The father knows things happen in boxing and in life so he is
unfazed by the ups and the downs, just as he is unfazed at the
possibility that all this celebrity is rushing in too fast on his
young son.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of success that has undone a lot of fighters.
Frankly, it took far less to undo the father, who once was the No.
1-ranked welterweight in the world but never stayed there long
enough to get a title shot.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Mayweather Sr. strokes his wrinkled face for a moment as
he ponders what the son has accomplished with him, then without
him, and now with him once again, and nods his head. Yes, he seems
to be saying, the world can overwhelm a young man with talent and
the belief that nothing can stop him but it won't. Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's pound for pound the best fighter in the end,''
Mayweather said of his son. ``Some people are surprised by what's
happened to Little Floyd but I knew it was going to happen. None of
this was a secret to me. Even in the years I was away, I always
felt Floyd was destined to be a world champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch him some times in the gym when we're training and it's
like he's the whole family rolled into one. One minute he'll tuck
his chin behind his shoulder like I did. Then he'll throw a hard
jab or a big hook like Roger did. Or he'll slip punches the way
Jeff used to. He's become the best of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take my career seriously. I wasted my talent. That's
why I get on his ass. He can be more than just a good fighter. He
can be a great fighter. I can honestly say he's the whole
package.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say at 22 that Floyd Mayweather Jr. already is. He was
selected fighter of the year by both KO and Ring magazines last
year, the sport's two most high-profile bibles. He is included in
many of the pound-for-pound top 10 rankings and is considered the
leading 130-pound fighter in the world today.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing loves Floyd Mayweather at the moment. And then there's
his opinion of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm the one bringing all the charisma to the 130- pound
weight class,'' young Mayweather said. ``I've fought the best guys
out there. I know Saturday night Oscar fights the main event but I
feel like it's a doubleheader. I feel I'm a main event, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to overshadow Oscar but I feel I'm the best
fighter in the world, just like he feels he's the best fighter in
the world. I learned how to become a champion. You work hard and
hit your opponent first, fast and often. I did it in a year and 11
months because I listened. If you listen and you put it together,
see what you come up with?''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, you can come up with a boxing family's story. A
story of hard luck, hard punches, and heart. A story, in the end,
of survival. It's a son's story . . . and a father's.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, my son is one of the best fighters in the
world,'' the father said Thursday, the pride clear in his face.
``So I don't want him to blow his chance. This is his journey. I'm
just glad to share it.''
</P>
<P>
   As glad as his son is to share it with him.

HIGH COURT SELECTION PANEL CAN RESHAPE BAY STATE COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Over the next two years, Governor Paul Cellucci will
have the chance to reshape the state Supreme Judicial Court,
replacing four of seven judges on what is one of the most respected
courts in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Acutely aware of his power to influence the future of the
state's highest court, the governor has assembled a group of nine
lawyers, headed by former US Attorney Wayne Budd, to recruit and
select the best candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he wanted the group to find great legal minds who
will ``apply the law, not make it.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics already nervous about the sway the Republican
administration could have on the SJC _ the oldest appellate court
in the Western hemisphere _ said Cellucci was trying to hide behind
the added layer of headhunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has pretty much made up his mind that he wants
judges of a certain ideological stripe, and in picking a diverse
committee of lawyers to enlist applicants and to screen them, I
think he's trying to give himself political cover,'' said Boston
defense lawyer Harvey Silverglate.
</P>
<P>
   But Budd disagreed. ``If I believed we were being asked to serve
as political cover, I'm sure I would not wish to serve and I'm sure
the other members would feel the same. Trust me,'' Budd said.
</P>
<P>
   The former federal prosecutor, now New England group president
at Bell Atlantic Corp., said he had been cleared of potential
ethical conflicts in dealing with the SJC, whose decisions could
impact the telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, who has the final say over SJC appointments, justified
the new commission. He said the existing nominating committee,
which will remain in place, would have a hard time filling four
posts in such a short time frame, especially given the weight and
permanency of the decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do want to move quickly and there's a lot of work that
needs to be done,'' Cellucci said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Charles Fried will step down June 30 to return to
Harvard Law School, and Chief Justice Herbert Wilkins will retire
Aug. 31. Cellucci hopes to fill both positions immediately. Also,
faced with mandatory retirement at age 70, Justice Neil Lynch will
leave in June 2000, and Justice Ruth Abrams in December 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Francis W. Sargent was the last governor to have so many SJC
appointments, officials say, with six vacancies between 1969 and
1972, when he named the current chief justice to the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has the authority to shape this court for the
next two decades,'' said Lauren Stiller Rikleen, president of the
Boston Bar Association. ``That is just very historically
significant and very crucial to the future of the courts of
Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he wanted the new judges to reflect the diversity
of the state. The panel now comprises two white women, one black
man, and four white men.
</P>
<P>
   After signing an executive order establishing the volunteer
commission, Cellucci said he faced an ``awesome responsibility of
appointing the majority of the SJC,'' and he vowed to ``not apply
any sort of narrow ideological litmus test.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone could be nominated who's opposed to the death
penalty,'' added Cellucci, who is in favor of capital punishment.
``I'm just looking for top-notch legal minds. . . . They'll be
serving on the court long after I finish my term for governor.''
</P>
<P>
   He also praised the volunteer commission _ and downplayed any
potential conflict of interest Budd could face _ saying it is a
group with integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The commission members are: Budd; Michael Angelini, chairman of
Bowditch &AMP; Dewey in Worcester; Ronald Cass, Dean of Boston
University Law School; Robert Cordy, managing partner at McDermott,
Will &AMP; Emery of Boston; Ellen Kearns of Epstein, Becker &AMP; Green of
Boston; William Lee, senior partner at Hale &AMP; Dorr of Boston; Nancy
Frankel Pelletier of Robinson, Donovan, Madden &AMP; Barry of
Springfield; Regina Pisa, managing partner at Goodwin, Procter &AMP;
Hoar of Boston; and Ellen Zack of McLellan &AMP; Zack of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Silverglate said it was not necessarily a good idea to have only
lawyers, albeit from diverse legal specialties and races, help
choose the justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the governor is enlisting input it would be a good idea to
have nonlawyers,'' he said. ``Lawyers get myopic about what it
takes to make a good judge.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stiller Rikleen of the bar association disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all share enormous intellectual firepower,'' she said.
``These are very bright lawyers. . .(Cellucci) seems to have
touched all the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   The SJC has oversight of the Board of Bar overseers, the
Commission on Judicial Conduct, and the Massachusetts Mental Health
Legal Advisors' Committee, among other agencies. The single
justices also decide about 800 cases a year and the full bench
renders about 265 written decisions annually.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of deadlines for applications is June 18.

REACTION OF INDIANAPOLIS BOSS WAS OFF TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone must have sent the Indianapolis Racing League a copy of
the US Constitution, specifically the First Amendment, which
prohibits the most powerful institution on the planet, the US
government, from interfering with the freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe someone informed IRL president and founder Tony George
about the modern-day repercussions of meddling in media business.
</P>
<P>
   There's no other way to explain George's sudden retreat Thursday
after banning a Sports Illustrated writer from the Indianapolis
500. George didn't like a photograph published with a May 10th
story about three fans killed by flying debris May 1 at the
VisionAire 500 in Concord, N.C., and denied credentials to SI's Ed
Hinton. Well, Hinton can now cover the event, but the cost of his
reinstatement to the IRL boss was the national revelation that
George isn't the god he thinks he is.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, the Founding Fathers had no idea journalism would
become part of a trillion-dollar entertainment conglomerate, one
that would spend millions, sometimes billions, on sports properties
that, in essence, are without the slightest hint of social
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   But laws are laws, and time has a way of transforming even
celebrity gossip into ``journalism,'' and auto racing into a very
wide world of sports.
</P>
<P>
   The races are not particularly evil, but it is one of the few
sporting events in America in which fans can actually die from
watching.
</P>
<P>
   The crash at the VisionAire 500 rocketed debris, including a
tire, over a 15-foot fence and into the packed grandstand, killing
three and critically injuring a 9-year-old girl and eight others.
Last July, a similiar accident occurred, leaving three dead and six
injured during a race at the Michigan Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Those tragic events were news by any definition, and deserved
all due coverage. Sports Illustrated thought so and published a
story by Hinton under the headline ``Fatal Attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinton argued persuasively that the two tragedies within the
last nine months deserved immediate attention. ``Either incident
without the other might have passed into memory as a grievous
fluke,'' Hinton wrote. ``Together they should ignite a public
outcry that doesn't dissipate until track officials devise a plan
to prevent further episodes of this nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinton offered possible solutions, including building higher
fences and prohibiting open-wheel cars from racing on high speed
oval tracks. Some of Hinton's suggestions have already been
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the story was a photograph of two of the three
bodies, covered in sheets, lying on the blood-stained concrete
aisles. On the next page, the magazine ran a full-page Valvoline
advertisement. The ad featured four guys working under the hood of
a car with the caption: ``You're born. You die. In between you work
on cars. We should all be so lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRL brass took umbrage over the photograph, and took the
unusual step of barring Hinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The photograph in Sports Illustrated was very tasteless and
offensive, not only to the family of the deceased but to many
people, including us,'' IRL spokesman Fred Nation told the
Associated Press. ``The total coverage of the story, we thought,
was offensive and inaccurate, and that's why we took the action we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the photograph was horrifying, but then again so was
the tragedy. The placement of the ad, well, was plain stupid.
</P>
<P>
   But to pull the credentials of a writer who had nothing to do
with the headline or ad and everything to do with trying to ensure
auto racing fans a little safety at the track is lunacy.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, that what's some of the owners of sports
properties have become _ lunatics.
</P>
<P>
   While IRL officials are trying to assign stories at national
sports magazines, they also have their hands out, trying to squeeze
a few more million dollars from television networks to broadcast
their events.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they successfully negotiated a $4 million increase in
their rights fee with ABC. That's incredible, especially
considering the ratings for the Indy 500 have dropped by 35 percent
over the last three years. The drop is largely the result of
George's decision three years ago to start his own league, leaving
CART out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the First Amendment is not the right piece of paper to
send to the IRL as a reminder of its mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe NASCAR's financial statements and television ratings would
be more instructive. George sorely needs lessons in marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, let's just ignore the IRL all together _ at least
until the next tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not giving up
</P>
<P>
   CNN/SI's ``Page One with Nick Charles'' scores a nice interview
with injured Patriots running back Robert Edwards, who tells
Charles he might play again. ``Yeah, I hear people,'' he Edwards
said. ``They come up and talk to me and I hear them whispering.
They see my knee and say that I am not coming back. He can't
recover from that. But you know that's dumb. They don't know what's
inside of me. I've got the Lord on my side.'' Edwards goes on to
say that playing in the NFL was his childhood dream. ``That dream
has been kind of altered,'' he said. ``But I feel like it's not
over. It hasn't ended.'' . . . NBC has busy a lineup this weekend
with five NBA playoff games. Dick Enberg and Bill Walton call the 3
p.m. Utah-Portland game and Bob Costas and Doug Collins work the
San Antonio-LA Lakers game at 5 p.m. Saturday. Indiana plays in
Philadelphia on Sunday at 12:30 p.m. with Mike Breen and Matt
Guokas working. Tom Hammond, Steve Jones, and Walton work the 3
p.m. Atlanta-New York game. The last game of the tripleheader is
San Antonio at Los Angeles with Costas and Collins.

CAPSHAW SENDS `LOVE LETTERS' TO VIEWERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Kate Capshaw crazy, or crazy like a fox?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Love Letter,'' which Capshaw developed and co-produced, is
her most significant role since ... well, since she won the heart
and hand of director Steven Spielberg while starring in his
``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.''
</P>
<P>
   But the film opening this weekend, butting heads with ``Star
Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' which opened Wednesday as
the most anticipated movie since ``Gone With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Love Letter'' could be slaughtered by ``The Phantom
Menace'' at the box office. Then again, if a lot of movie-goers are
turned away from sold-out Star Wars screenings, they might opt for
a less-crowded picture playing in the auditorium next door. Like
``The Love Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Capshaw is not looking at it that way. She thinks there might be
a lot of viewers who crave a romance rather than a ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone loves a love story,'' Capshaw said, calling
from Los Angeles to talk about her first film as a producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A romance makes you feel warm and good. If you're not involved
in a love relationship, it makes you want one, I believe. And
that's nice, because it does feel good to have a warm hug and
someone who listens.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, we'll buy that, but we're not sure how many people
will brave the ``Star Wars'' crowds to get a movie hug.
</P>
<P>
   Capshaw, who did her own telephoning rather than having a helper
place the call, was running a little behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I get through here, I have to pick up my kids,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Capshaw and Spielberg are noted for being hands-on parents with
their seven children, even when they are working on films. Not
surprisingly, Capshaw usually gets a lot more of the at-home duties
than her more famous partner, even though she has been working more
steadily than it might seem _ about 20 films or TV movies since
``Temple of Doom'' in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But for the seven weeks that Capshaw acted in ``The Love
Letter,'' it was her husband who mainly held down the fort at home.
</P>
<P>
   Capshaw's career was on the rise when she met Spielberg. But
since their romance and marriage, she has definitely been ``Mrs.
Spielberg.'' Does she now feel an urge to let her own light shine?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't,'' she said, with little hesitation. ``I
actually don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never was a very ambitious actress, and I don't feel ...
Maybe the world might look at us and think I'm in his shadow. But
because I'm in the world with him, it's my perception that counts.
And I don't feel like I'm in his shadow because he's such a great
partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so collaborative. He doesn't go to work and make his
movies and come home and eat dinner. I'm on his movie sets, and
he's bringing scripts home. A good deal of our dialogue is around
his creative life, which involves and includes me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Capshaw who bought the rights to Cathleen Schine's novel
``The Love Letter.'' When Spielberg saw what she was working on, he
asked if she planned to offer the project to his company,
DreamWorks. She said, no, it was a small film. Spielberg asked if
DreamWorks could at least pass on it (consider it) first. Instead
of passing, the company picked up the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband's no fool,'' Capshaw said with a laugh. ``Because
the idea came from within the family, he was able to purchase (it
for development) and at least keep it very close, before it went
somewhere else. He actually thinks he's quite clever that way.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Love Letter,'' Capshaw plays Helen, a bookstore owner
in the small New England town of Loblolly by the Sea. Helen has
given up on love: it's just not for her.
</P>
<P>
   Then she discovers a passionate love letter _ no envelope, no
signature _ in her shop. Suddenly, she is looking at every man she
knows with different eyes, which makes each of the guys see her in
a new way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something magical about the letter that is sort of
transformative,'' Capshaw said. ``It casts a spell of some sort.
People get giddy; they blush; their hearts start to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tell a child they have a beautiful voice, they sing
louder and more. I believe it's the same with love. If someone
tells you you're lovable, you become more lovable.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see the letter, and each reader believes it is written to
him or her. All of which creates a series of confusions, bruised
feelings and unexpected entanglements. Helen becomes involved with
a much younger man, one of her employees (Tom Everett Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most charming ingredients of the book was that the
well-controlled, ordered, quite satisfied Helen could get undone by
a young man, who really pulls the rug out from under her,'' Capshaw
said.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, Helen becomes aware of an old suitor, a rather
shy fireman played by Tom Selleck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom was always the first idea for me,'' said Capshaw, who
participated in all the casting choices. ``Tom feels small-town.
Maybe because he was on television, and TV people are in your
living room, he feels very familiar, like someone you'd bump into.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want the Tom Selleck with the mustache _ gorgeous,
cool. We wanted the big glasses, silly fireman, suspenders. It
wasn't an attempt to make him less appealing, but to sink him into
this community. And he can play that guy who tries to do the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Love Letter'' strives for an almost dreamlike quality
about romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love stories are hard to make,'' Capshaw said. ``Romantic
comedies are really hard to make. They made it look so easy back in
the '40s when there were a hundred (romantic films) a year.''
</P>
<P>
   She gives a little breathy, ironic laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to hit a note that feels real but not so real
that it's mundane or depressing or insignificant. Love is so
personal. Audiences want to fall in love, but if you hit a false
note, you can lose them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 3 p.m. in California, time for Capshaw to get the kids.
But since her film was about to take on the ``Star Wars'' empire of
George Lucas, a close friend of Capshaw and Spielberg, I asked if
she remembered the first time she saw the original ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief silence in which Capshaw took a deep breath.
Almost inaudibly, she whispered, ``I've never seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, like a naughty child running away from a confession, she
yelled, ``Bye,'' and with a laugh she was gone.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   William Alfred, a playwright, poet, and scholar whose literate
observations about Irish-American life graced the Broadway stage,
and whose pedagogic devotion graced the lives of thousands of
Harvard College students, died at his home in Cambridge, Mass.
Wednesday. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The author of ``Hogan's Goat'' and other plays, Mr. Alfred
joined the Harvard faculty in 1954 as a medievalist. He quickly
became one of the college's most popular and versatile teachers,
branching out from ``Beowulf'' to teach drama, poetry, and
screenwriting.
</P>
<P>
   A 1969 book about Harvard named Mr. Alfred as the college's most
sought-after professor, in part for once having given a midterm
exam on ``Bonnie and Clyde.'' Even in retirement (he left Harvard
in 1991) and in failing health, Mr. Alfred continued to tutor one
Harvard student a year _ and to open his doors to countless other
intellectual proteges who came to regard his Athens Street house as
a kind of one-stop continuing education center.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Alfred once said that his great love was the Roman Catholic
Church; he attended Mass nearly every day. But his other great love
was actress Faye Dunaway, who starred in the 1965 off-Broadway
production of ``Hogan's Goat,'' Mr. Alfred's play about
Irish-American politicians, when she was still a Boston University
student. And Dunaway adored Mr. Alfred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just latched on to him and wouldn't let go,'' she said in a
1996 Boston Globe interview. ``This man changes your life with how
he looks at human behavior and play writing. He's taught me how to
work. How to investigate material. How to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mr. Alfred of their first meeting, ``It was as if the
goddess Aphrodite had appeared in the rehearsal hall.'' Not only
did the then-unknown actress get the part, but she became one of
Mr. Alfred's most cherished friends. In 1982, having established
herself as a Hollywood star, Dunaway returned to the Broadway stage
in ``The Curse of an Aching Heart,'' a play written by Mr. Alfred
in collaboration with Dunaway.
</P>
<P>
   American Repertory Theatre director Robert Brustein reviewed
``Hogan's Goat'' for The New Republic and recalled Thursday ``the
geniality of the writing and the person behind it. It was unusually
literate yet not an academic play, a tough-minded one with a deep
feeling for human encounters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Brustein came to Harvard in 1979, ``Bill extended the hand
of friendship, and it was appreciated because theater didn't mean
much to Harvard then,'' Brustein added. ``He probably befriended
more Harvard undergraduates than any teacher in the school's
history.'' Last year, the ART bestowed on Mr. Alfred its equivalent
of a lifetime-achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Alfred grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., where his father laid
bricks and his mother worked as a telephone operator. Graduating
from Brooklyn College in 1948, he got his master's and doctoral
degrees from Harvard, where he later held the Abbott Lawrence
Lowell humanities professorship. He also served in the US Army tank
corps in World War II. At Harvard, he cultivated close friendships
with Robert Lowell, Archibald MacLeish, and Seamus Heaney, among
others, and had a profound influence on the likes of Tommy Lee
Jones, Stockard Channing, and John Lithgow.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Alfred's published works included ``The Annunciation
Rosary,'' ``Agamemnon,'' ``Cry for Us All,'' ``Nothing Doing,'' and
many poems and scholarly articles. When he died he was working on
his memoirs, a project friends indicate they will try to bring to
completion. Among his awards were the New York Drama Desk Award.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Mr. Alfred helped organize a benefit for the Poet's
Theater of Cambridge. At the time, he said his goal was to ``drive
home the importance of words,'' a goal he championed far from the
limelight of Hollywood celebrity. Harvard College senior Sam
Speedie was Mr. Alfred's designated tutee this year. In 1970, Mr.
Alfred taught Speedie's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the last true gentleman of Western society,'' Speedie
said Thursday. ``He focused on a writer's strengths, which was
unusual for a writer of his accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   Accomplishments aside, Mr. Alfred was equally revered for his
gentle mien and generosity of spirit. He often strolled around
Putnam Square in Cambridge like a vision from another era. His pale
complexion, set off by a gray or blue suit, and the omnipresent hat
_ fedora in winter, boater in summer _ gave Mr. Alfred the
appearance of a character out of one of the turn-of-the-century
novels he so adored. His daily walks were punctuated by a tip of
the hat and a smile for anyone inquiring about his own health or
about the latest ART production.
</P>
<P>
   While Mr. Alfred's dress was formal, his personality was not. He
was, among other things, a true friend to the homeless. Each day,
the dispossessed would show up at Mr. Alfred's house, where he
would ask how their evening had gone and whether they'd like some
tea. Then he'd reach into a jar he kept by the door and hand over a
dollar or two.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Alfred is survived by a half brother, Vincent Allfrey; a
niece, Allison Allfrey; and a nephew, Richard Allfrey.

NOVELL BANKS ON SOFTWARE TO PERSONALIZE COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; There's always something annoying about working at someone
else's computer. Everything's wrong: the software settings, the
bookmarked Web pages, everything. Because it's not your
computer.But suppose you could transform it into your computer,
just by pressing a few keys? Suppose you could personalize any
communications device _ computers, cell phones _ to suit your
personal needs?
</P>
<P>
   Someday you will, as an obscure but vital technology called
directory services begins to take root in the electronic world.
Directories are powerful repositories of personal information
stored in computer databases. For years, corporations have used
them to customize their internal computer networks. Now directories
are moving into the Internet and telecommunications markets.
</P>
<P>
   Directories are shaping up as one of the key technologies of the
wired world. ``In the next five years, this is going to be a major
battleground,'' says network software analyst Richard Villars of
International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. Microsoft Corp., IBM
Corp., Oracle Inc., and Sun Microsystems Corp. are all taking their
shots at the market. But for now the leader is Novell Inc., a
company written off as doomed just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Novell was born as a computer networking company, and at one
point Novell software ran nearly 70 percent of corporate computer
networks. But in the early 1990s, the firm lost its way in a series
of ill-conceived efforts to challenge Microsoft's dominance of word
processing and spreadsheet software.
</P>
<P>
   But since former Sun Microsystems engineer Eric Schmidt took
over in 1997, the company has returned to solid profitability, with
$102 million in earnings in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt ordered a relentless focus on Internet-compatible
networking. Last year the company finally introduced a version of
its bellwether NetWare operating system that is fully compatible
with Internet protocols.
</P>
<P>
   But the company is betting its future on Novell Directory
Services, or NDS. Novell has long sold directory services to
corporate America. But in a world where millions of us use Internet
browsers and cell phones, directories may soon become vital for all
kinds of electronic communications.
</P>
<P>
   Say the word ``directory'' to most people and they think of a
telephone book. Fair enough. Imagine your own listing in the White
Pages. There's a name, a street address, and a telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine a bigger listing _ a lot bigger. In fact, a listing
as big as you want it to be, with a vast array of information about
you. At work, your company's directory might include your cell
phone number, your e-mail address, the department you work in, the
company computer systems you're permitted to use, and the ones
you're locked out of.
</P>
<P>
   The directory is a company's ``common repository of critical
information,'' according to Steve Adelman, Novell's vice president
of corporate development. And by using that information, the
directory can assign exactly the right services to each employee. A
clerk logs on to the directory, and is given access to the lowest
level of the company computer network, while a top executive gets
access to everything. One worker can download the latest word
processing software; another gets an advanced engineering program.
</P>
<P>
   The worker can go to any other computer in the company, log on,
and get the same services he'd find on his own machine. ``It's not
by what desk you're sitting at,'' says Adelman. ``It's by the
person and their authority inside the net.''
</P>
<P>
   That's net with a small n, as in a corporation's internal
networks. Many huge firms have hundreds or thousands of computer
networks scattered around the world. Novell's NDS makes it possible
to manage workers' access to all these networks from a single
database. Currently 50 million people in large organizations use
NDS.
</P>
<P>
   But Novell wants to extend the technology far beyond corporate
America, into the basic infrastructure of all telecommunications
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Each of us might one day have our own lengthy listing in a
digital directory, stored on a highly secure computer run by
somebody we trust _ the phone company, say, or a bank. The
directory could contain huge amounts of information about you _
your credit card numbers, your favorite Internet sites, your
membership in an Internet discussion group, your shoe size. You
would decide what information the directory would contain, and
whether to share it with others.
</P>
<P>
   Samm DiStasio, Novell's director of NDS product marketing, calls
this concept a ``digital persona,'' an electronic biography of
yourself that you can share in whole or in part.
</P>
<P>
   Sit down at any Internet-connected computer, anywhere on earth,
and log on. Instantly, all your Web page bookmarks appear on the
browser, because you've told the directory your favorite sites.
Your e-mail starts to scroll across the screen, because the
directory knows all five of your e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   You order flowers for your spouse without typing in your credit
card number, because your directory already knows it. Just send it
a command, and it shares the number with the on-line florist.
</P>
<P>
   Then someone calls your office, but your cell phone rings. Your
directory is linked to your Internet-based calendar program, so it
knows that you're traveling. When somebody dials your home or
office phone number, the directory instantly routes the calls to
the right phone _ the one in your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly any of these services are available, but they will be in
the near future if Novell has anything to say about it. The company
has announced a new service called digitalme, which will offer the
bare beginnings of these services. digitalme, which will be made
available free over the Internet later this year, will let a user
store a range of personal information on a Novell NDS directory,
then provide that information selectively to his favorite Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Novell won't make any money from digitalme, but the company is
betting the product will generate new demand for Novell's NDS
software and accessories. Active Directory, a rival directory
product from Microsoft, won't even come to market until late this
year.
</P>
<P>
   By winning mindshare early, Novell is aiming to take a permanent
lead in directories, emerge from Microsoft's shadow, and reassert
its role as an industry leader. ``We have a unique opportunity
right now,'' says Novell's chief information officer Shari
Anderson. ``We have created an opportunity, a window, to win. And
we want to win.''

FIRM, ON THE BLOCK, IN PUBLIC SPAT WITH EX-STAR MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The one thing we know without doubt about the case at hand: This
is no time for a struggling investment firm to get hit with a mud
pie.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrim, Baxter &AMP; Associates, a once-hot money management firm
owned by Boston's United Asset Management Corp., is locking horns
in Superior Court with one of its star managers, who wants to jump
ship and run money at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   A non-compete clause in the employment contract signed by James
McCall is at the core of their dispute. But the big picture is
crowded with many other complications, most importantly the ongoing
efforts of UAM to sell Pilgrim, Baxter amid a relentless stream of
bad news.
</P>
<P>
   McCall has already signaled his willingness to play rough. His
suit is peppered with references to the lackluster recent
investment performance of firm cofounder Gary Pilgrim, claims of
nepotism benefiting daughters of another cofounder, Harold Baxter,
and comments about plunging morale as shareholders pull money out
of the company's PBHG funds.
</P>
<P>
   A Pilgrim spokesman said only that allegations in the lawsuit
``will be answered fully and are an attempt to break a valid and
enforcable contract.''
</P>
<P>
   We don't know if his claims are true. As a practical matter, it
doesn't make much difference.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers have been trying to slip the chains of employment
contracts to work elsewhere for many years. In the past, deals
almost always have been struck privately.
</P>
<P>
   Employers that have secured non-competes may enjoy the legal
upper hand, but even when they win in court they usually lose in
the real world. Recent cases that have spilled into public view
make our point.
</P>
<P>
   Wellington Management Co. went through a public trial in
Middlesex Superior Court against manager Arnold Schneider, the
first Wellington partner ever to get the boot by his own
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Wellington won its case in court based on the non-compete signed
by Schneider, who had attracted several old institutional clients
to a new firm he started. But Schneider still wound up with most of
those customers and Wellington took a series of public lumps in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   McCall's departure from Pilgrim, Baxter couldn't come at a worse
time. Gary Pilgrim and the PBHG Growth fund he managed helped make
the firm famous, but McCall has been the star of recent times.
</P>
<P>
   UAM bought Pilgrim, Baxter for an estimated $135 million in
1995, when the investment management conglomerate was riding high.
It seemed like a smart move right out of the box: Pilgrim, Baxter
assets under management ballooned from about $4 billion to $15
billion and even skeptical columns like this one called Gary
Pilgrim a ``stock-picking wizard.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall had joined Pilgrim, Baxter as an unknown bank investment
manager months before the firm was sold to UAM. This was the kind
of career move we dream about, moving from a $175,000-a-year job to
become a money manager earning more than $1 million within two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, customers have been fleeing from Pilgram, Baxter.
Redemptions outpaced sales by $2 billion last year and another $1
billion in the first quarter of 1999, according to Financial
Research Corp. Only three fund firms suffered steeper business
declines last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Pilgrim's PBHG Growth fund was one of the firm's worst
bleeders. Net outflows amounted to $1.5 billion last year and
another $543 million in the first quarter of this year, according
to FRC. The fund, which once invested almost $9 billion, had $3.3
billion under management on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several funds managed by McCall, particularly those
that bought large stocks, were shooting out the lights. His PBHG
Large Cap 20 fund earned 67.8 percent last year and 33 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   McCall's lawsuit beefs that he was getting the short end of the
bonus stick in 1997 as his funds performed well while Harold
Baxter's daughter Christine was getting the highest bonus even
though her fund was losing ground.
</P>
<P>
   His suit also rehashes press accounts about how Harold Baxter
gummed up a deal for UAM to sell Pilgrim, Baxter to Nationwide
Financial Services but doesn't offer any new proof. Former Fidelity
executive Paul Hondros, who had been recruited to lead a Pilgrim,
Baxter sales reorganization, left shortly after the Nationwide deal
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, UAM has dispatched Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. to find another
buyer for Pilgrim, Baxter. Whoever buys the firm certainly won't
get McCall as part of the package.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine UAM and Pilgrim, Baxter win their case, which is
entirely possible. What will they win? Perhaps McCall will be
prohibited from joining a big firm like Merrill until his contract
expires in 2002 or someone will pay to make the problem go away.
Those seem to be the options.
</P>
<P>
   Now think of all the damage the case can do to UAM and Pilgrim,
Baxter in the middle of a hobbled campaign to sell the company.
It's the last thing in the world they need.

IT'S BECOME A MANAGEABLE SITUATION FOR TORRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When you listen to Joe Torre, it's easy to forget the
Yankees came to Boston and promptly fell out of first place. He is
the eye of a hurricane, a calming force. Sooner or later you knew
his Bronx Bombers would right the ship, and they took steps toward
that with a 3-1 victory over the Sox at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   After two straight losses, Torre was the winning manager for the
first time since a four-game sweep of San Diego in the World Series
last October.
</P>
<P>
   Boston still maintains a half-game lead in the American League
East over New York after winning two of three games in the May
showdown. The teams will meet again next week in New York. But when
they do, the Sox will be facing a more relaxed Yankee team, chiefly
because of Torre, who returned to the helm Monday after prostate
cancer surgery. His presence _ win or lose _ takes a lot of weight
off everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distractions are gone,'' he said Thursday night. ``I don't
know if it's as much renewed confidence as it is that the puzzle
has been put back together. Everybody is here. I'm surprised how
quickly I feel comfortable in a uniform. It doesn't feel like I
ever took it off, and yet the time away seemed like an eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   If there were any doubts that Torre could handle the catbird
seat again with professional ease, rest assured he can. Before the
game he took on all comers from the media brigade that is always
present when the Yankees and Red Sox meet. He made no promises of
an immediate return to greatness of the Yankee team that won 114
regular-season games last year. But he did promise they'd be
relaxed and play hard. With the talent the Yankees have, that's a
formula for winning.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't worried that a recent stretch in which the Yankees
lost seven of eight had put New York a game and a half behind the
Red Sox. They had only five hits Tuesday night, but received a
stellar two-hit performance from Orlando Hernandez, who had lost
three of his last four starts. It wasn't the same El Duque. He's
one of Torre's guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put it all together,'' said Torre. ``We went up in the same
elevator last night. We had watched a frustrating game the first
night and got beat up the next night. He knew what his job was
tonight. And I knew he was capable of accomplishing what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to start panicking after only two days on the job. I
know we're going to hit. These guys have hit all their lives.
They're not going to all of a sudden stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching has to be the key. You can't freeze the ball. You
have to get 27 outs sometime. I've been on the other side of the
fence. Sometimes you really wonder if you're ever going to get 27
outs. We haven't gone through this for a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   His calmness under fire should surprise no one who knows Torre.
A lesser man might have taken six months off to recover from the
surgery. There were no miracles in the victory. The Yankees got
good pitching, good defense, and scored enough runs to win. That's
how you break out of a slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get a lot of hitting tonight,'' he said. ``But we
played well except for one play in left-center. It feels great to
win again. It's something we can build upon. Until now, the concern
was always for me when I saw them on a regular basis at home. When
you coming back? How you doing? I think mainly it was that there
was somebody missing _ not that they were going to play the game
differently. I think this just put their minds at ease. I'd like to
get used to that again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have been pressing. But with Torre back, they figure
to grow in confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Roger Clemens coming back (Friday) will give us a
lift. It might help David (Cone) lead the club back. Starting
pitching is what any success is going to be based upon. At least it
always has been since I've been here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll stress having a little fun. I think we can find the
rhythm. But it's a matter of handling the responsibility. With
Roger on the disabled list, David Cone has had to do it himself and
he's done a hell of a job. The good clubs are the ones that fight
their way out of it. If we can't fight our way out, we're not as
good I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   A big plus, said Torre, is that because of daily talks with
bench coach Don Zimmer, he doesn't really feel that far away.
Zimmer will be there alongside for as long as he wants. But there
is no doubt as to who is running the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty well tied into everything that has happened,'' said
Torre. ``But I missed sitting in the dugout talking to the media
and watching the players come in. We still have a lot of people out
there who will gradually contribute to having a good pitching staff
but who are not going to be the ones who will eventually lead your
pitching staff.''

REDHOOK ALE AD HAS A TOUCH OF FROST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Budweiser ads have starred frogs and lizards. Created by Heater
Advertising of Boston, a new TV ad for Redhook Ale features the
poetry of Robert Frost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something there is that doesn't love a wall,'' intones the
ad's voiceover as a hearty stone mason piles boulder onto boulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger Hopkins builds stone walls like Robert Frost wrote
about,'' the voiceover continues. ``When he's done, he goes for the
solid taste of Redhook, a well-built beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Redhook seemed to burst on the scene during the microbrewery
craze of the early 1990s. For a while, such brands as Redhook, Sam
Adams, and Pete's Wicked Ale were all the rage. Then sales
flattened in 1997, though the fortunes of Sam Adams' parent, Boston
Beer Co., have since improved.
</P>
<P>
   Now a booming economy and an increase in the vital beer-drinking
population of twentysomethings have brewers hoping for a rebound.
With a new brewery in Portsmouth, N.H., Redhook has identified
three key cities for an ad campaign designed to increase brand
awareness: Boston, San Francisco, and its hometown of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where library books per capita are high, our beer sells
well,'' said Redhook chairman Paul S. Shipman, explaining in part
the reason for using Frost as an ad copywriter. In places where
there is ``political open-mindedness'' and plenty of college
campuses, a ``well-built beer'' is most appreciated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Radio ads feature a guitar maker and a Native American who
builds log cabins by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch Cos., makers of Budweiser and Michelob, own a
minority stake in Redhook Ale Brewery Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Most beer ads are about ``boys behaving badly,'' said Heater
chairman Bill Heater. But Redhook is ``not a party beer. . . It's a
quality beer for people who can read.''

   When the rest of the sneaker industry zigs, Puma zags.
</P>
<P>
   Most big sneaker companies, such as Nike Inc. and Reebok
International Ltd., have reduced the number of sports stars they
employ as product endorsers. Over time, the public seems to have
grown immune to the sales pitches of most super jocks.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop Puma, whose North American office is based in
Westford, from signing up boxing champ Oscar De La Hoya. De La Hoya
joins Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams, pro basketball rookie
Vince Carter, and tennis player Serena Williams in the stable of
Puma endorsers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when sporting brands are shying away from athletes'
endorsements, Puma's ability to identify athletes before their
prime is proving to be an integral part of the brand's current
success,'' Puma said in a statement.

   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Cofounder Andy Beaupre said he was persuaded to sell his firm
because his clients were requesting services that only a larger PR
firm such as Brodeur can provide. Beaupre had revenues of $4
million last year; Brodeur had global revenues of $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Beaupre &AMP; Co. will retain its name and autonomy, and Andy

STUDY CONFIRMS SEVERE HOUSING SHORTAGE IN BAY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco area is in the throes of a
chronic housing shortage that has hit middle- and low-income people
particularly had, according to a new study by a business
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that out of a projected need for 182,542 housing
units in the San Francisco Bay area, only 101,490 had been built
since 1988. For those in lower-income brackets, that shortfall was
even more severe. Out of a projected need of 36,672 units, only
some 9,759 units were built.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a housing crisis in the Bay area today,'' Sunne Wright
McPeak, president and chief executive of the Bay Area Council, said
in a release accompanying the study. ``There simply isn't enough
housing to accommodate the numbers of people moving here for
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The study used housing need projections published in 1989 by the
Association of Bay Area Governments, which at the time sought to
set a bottom line on housing needs for anticipated population
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The council is a public policy organization supported by
businesses. The study released Thursday is based on housing needs
in 50 municipalities in the Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lack housing that is affordable to the work force and that
is located near job centers,'' McPeak said. ``This is why workers
and their families have been forced to the fringes of the Bay
area.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, 4,581 units were needed by San
Francisco's moderate-income population, defined as those making 80
to 120 percent of median income for San Francisco. But only 163
units were built for this income group since 1988. According to the
National Association of Home Builders, San Francisco's
single-family median income in the final quarter of 1998 was
$68,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis is hitting those folks that keep things going,''
McPeak said. ``They're our teachers, firefighters, retail store
workers and nurses.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, those in the above-moderate income category, making
121 percent and up of the area's median income, had 56 percent of
their housing needs met, with 5,271 units built with 9,352 needed.
</P>
<P>
   The study comes as no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pretty much confirms what anyone commuting already knows,''
said Cynthia Kroll, a regional economist with the Fisher Center for
Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll said the housing shortage started in the early 1990s, when
a sluggish economy slowed new housing construction. When the
economy heated up, housing markets were caught short.
</P>
<P>
   That shortfall continues, added Kroll, because of construction
time lags and local zoning and density laws, which restrict the
supply of housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Housing growth doesn't always coincide with job growth,''
Kroll said. ``And you're seeing that in a very exaggerated way
here.''

LOOK TO SPLIT RETIREMENT PORTFOLIO INTO TWO POOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 23, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a 50-year-old single woman and I have just resigned my
position as a faculty member at a nursing school and will be moving
to Florida. My salary will drop considerably, to about $35,000 or
$40,000. I hope to continue to save for retirement, but not at the
current rate. I now contribute $150 a week to a 403(b) plan and
will do so until August of this year. This account was worth
$37,500 at the beginning of the year with $12,200 in Fidelity Blue
Chip, $5,000 in Fidelity Contrafund, $13,600 in Fidelity
Equity-Income and the rest in Fidelity Magellan. I also have a
rollover IRA with Fidelity, worth $127,000 at the start of
February, with no ongoing contributions. This holds $17,000 in
Magellan, $22,300 in Contrafund, $38,000 in Equity Income, $12,500
in Growth Company, $7,000 in Investment Grade Bond, and the rest in
Blue Chip Growth. Assuming I am able to add only $200 a month after
relocating, what can I expect to have in 15 years? Is my fund mix
appropriate? I don't mind some risk, but this represents most of
the money I have. I sold my house here and realized a net gain of
$40,000; I have not decided if I will buy another home or not _ I
already own a home in Florida, which will be paid off in 12 years.
What kind of income stream might I except at age 65? I expect to
receive about $1,000 a month from Social Security. If I decide not
to buy another home, how should I invest the $40,000?
</P>
<P>
   R.S., Brockton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's begin with the math. For all of these calculations I'm
going to presume that you will achieve average annual portfolio
returns of 10 percent. By the end of August with your continued
$150 weekly contributions to the 403(b), that account plus the
rollover IRA would be worth $180,814. During the next 172 months
until you reach age 65, presuming 200 monthly contributions, the
combined accounts would grow to $783,155.
</P>
<P>
   What can you expect as an income stream from such a nest egg?
Well, what I'd like to see you do upon retirement is to separate
the portfolio into two pools _ one to supply you with an income
stream, and another to generate capital growth to protect you
against inflation in the later years of your retirement. Let's say
you devoted $200,000 of your savings to capital growth, leaving you
with just over $583,000 to generate your income stream.
</P>
<P>
   It's reasonable to presume that a diversified fixed-income
portfolio would yield you about 6.5 percent in your retirement
years; thus you could expect an income stream of about $37,900 a
year, and with steady growth in the value of the additional
$200,000 that you have invested for continued growth. The effect of
this is that, with Social Security added in, you would have an
annual income stream of nearly $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   As for the portfolio, I tally just 4.3 percent that isn't in
large-cap domestic stock funds. You have no substantial level of
diversification. With the exception of that 4.3 percent in the
Investment Grade Bond, all of your money is invested in the same
market sector. Moving into different market sector wouldn't
increase your risk _ in fact, it would likely have the opposite
effect, since different market sectors tend to move at different
paces.
</P>
<P>
   I would suggest that you move about $30,000 to Fidelity Puritan,
which holds about one-third of its assets on the fixed-income side,
and accordingly would reduce risk. I would then move about $15,000
to Fidelity Select Health Care, which would increase risk, but also
put your money in one of the market sectors I feel is poised for
solid long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I would put $15,000 each into Fidelity Mid-Cap Growth and
Small Cap Stock funds, both moves designed to give you exposure to
additional market sectors. Finally, I would move $10,000 to
Fidelity International Growth and Income, giving you exposure to
yet another market sector. The effect of all these moves would be
to reduce your reliance upon the domestic large-cap stocks from
more than 95 percent of the portfolio to about 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide not to buy more real estate, I think I'd just put
that $40,000 in a solid fixed-income fund such as Fidelity
Government Securities, calculating that you will enjoy having a
solid and sizable chunk of your savings at the conservative end of
the investment spectrum, and that if you left it there until you
retired, it would then represent a $102,873 wild-card _ funds you
could use for travel, other treats, or simply to boost your
everyday standard of living. That growth projection presumed
reinvestment of all dividends, and annual portfolio growth of 6.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You have received a couple of letters regarding the Vanguard
GNMA fund, and you pointed out the possibility of a negative yield
for any given year. This certainly would concern someone cashing in
shares, but what about the retiree who relies on the interest
payments for his income? In other words, how much would the monthly
return be expected to fluctuate over the years, on an investment of
$100,000? Would a Vanguard bond fund be a better investment?
</P>
<P>
   M.S., Foxborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First, we have a problem with terminology. When a fund such
as Vanguard GNMA has a bad year, which all such funds tend to do
about twice in any given decade, it is the total return that goes
into the red. The yield, which represents the amount of the
distributions from income on the securities held by the fund, keeps
rolling on in. As for fluctuation in yield, let's look at the
record. In the last decade, the high level of annual distribution
for Vanguard GNMA was 88 cents per share in 1989, and the low was
65 cents in 1993. Income distributions for 1998 were 69 cents per
share. (In addition, in two years of the last decade the fund has
made small capital gains distributions _ 1 cent in 1994 and 1.2
cents per share last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Generally, you can expect the yield on this and other GNMA funds
_ and bond funds in general to slowly trail interest rates in
general, but since the payments of both principal and interest on
the securities which underlie the fund's holdings are guaranteed by
the federal government, you will not see sharp swings in the
month-to-month dividend checks. If you invested $100,000 in
Vanguard GNMA at the price prevailing as this is written, you could
expect a monthly dividend check of about $536. I think the Vanguard
GNMA fund is a better investment than any of the comparable
intermediate-term bond funds at this point.

PROVISION TAKES AIM AT GUN SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gun-control advocates and federal agents have long
complained that gun shows are traveling arms bazaars where
cash-and-carry is the rule, and a loophole in federal law makes it
easy for anyone _ gang member, felon or fugitive _ to buy a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   In a report this year, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms wrote, ``A review of criminal investigations . . .
reveals a wide variety of violations occurring at guns shows and
substantial numbers of firearms associated with gun shows being
used in drug crimes and crimes of violence, as well as being passed
illegally to juveniles.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Senate Democrats pushed through changes in the federal
gun control law aimed at closing a loophole that allows all
firearms _ handguns, semiautomatic assault weapons, shotguns, and
rifles _ to be bought and sold off the books at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The provision, sponsored by Senator Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat
of New Jersey, proposes to change law by requiring that all sales
at gun shows be conducted through a licensed dealer who would
perform a background check on the buyer and imposing up to a
three-day waiting period on purchases. It also would require
gun-show promoters to register with the ATF and inform vendors of
the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, only licensed dealers must run background
checks to determine whether purchasers should be barred from buying
a gun because they fall into a ``prohibited category,'' such as a
felon or fugitive, outlined in the 1993 Brady law.
</P>
<P>
   Private dealers and collectors _ those who do not earn their
principal income from buying and selling guns _ are not required to
be licensed and are free to sell guns without following the
background checks, waiting periods, and record-keeping requirements
mandated by the Brady law.
</P>
<P>
   ``These background checks have kept thousands of guns out of the
hands of criminals and others who have no business owning guns,''
Senator Edward M. Kennedy said Thursday on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates and the ATF have complained that private
gun dealers deliberately exploit the loophole at gun shows by using
their special ``exempt'' status as a selling point, advertising
with signs that say, ``No background checks required; we need only
to know where you live and how old you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Lautenberg provision, private dealers would be
required to use federally licensed dealers to do background checks
on their behalf when selling a weapon. However, the legislation
would not apply to purchases of weapons through newspaper ads and
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Even while the majority of people attending gun shows are
law-abiding citizens, gun shows and flea markets have long served
as a mecca for those who want to sell a weapon used in a crime or
buy one they could not purchase in a retail gun shop because of
their record.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by Handgun Control Inc., a Washington
organization led by James Brady, the former White House press
secretary who was seriously wounded during an assassination attempt
on President Reagan, dozens of notorious criminals have bought and
sold firearms at gun shows, including Branch Davidian leader David
Koresh, Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, and Hank Earl Carr, a
convicted felon who killed three policemen in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the teenage gunmen who killed a dozen students
and a teacher a month ago at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo., used guns acquired at a local gun show.
</P>
<P>
   It is still uncertain whether the House will adopt similar
provisions and whether the bill will be signed into law.
Gun-control advocates warn that if the loophole is not fixed,
unregulated gun sales will continue to fuel violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of all the attention focused on them, especially by
kids, gun shows will just become more popular, more notorious, and
an even greater source for crime guns,'' said Kristen Rand, senior
counsel for the Violence Policy Center, a gun-control research
group that first uncovered the loophole in its 1996 report, ``Gun
Shows in America: Tupperware Parties for Criminals.'' ``It really
is a huge threat.''
</P>
<P>
   But the National Rifle Association, a lobby representing gun
owners, disagreed, saying the Lautenberg measure would put a
greater burden on lawful gun owners buying and selling firearms.
The NRA also cast a skeptical eye on the Clinton administration's
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, the Clinton-Gore administration is papering over a
shameful record of not enforcing existing gun laws,'' said Wayne
LaPierre, NRA executive vice president, and James J. Baker, the
NRA's chief lobbyist, in a statement released after the close
Senate vote. ``Now they want more gun laws they won't enforce. The
federal courts won't want to try these cases. It's more
made-for-television lawmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA might have a point. There are no federal laws regulating
gun shows, and it is unofficial ATF policy to stay away from
conducting surveillance or enforcing the law at gun shows unless
there is compelling evidence to suggest gun trafficking is taking
place, according to ATF agents speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   They said the agency is understaffed and could not cover even
half of the 4,000 shows held annually in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says it is trying to change that by
requesting money for more agents in this year's budget, according
to Justice Department spokesman Brian Steel.

FUTURE UNCERTAIN FOR JEWS ON WEST BANK

   SHILO SETTLEMENT, West Bank _ As a dry wind swept through a
cluster of five trailer homes on a hilltop, overlooking the rocky,
terraced terrain, Shmuel Kohen declared, ``We are here to protect
the land that God gave us.''

<P>
   Netanyahu's government gave some tacit support to the settlers'
view that the West Bank, where about 150,000 Jewish settlers have
staked a claim among 1.2 million Palestinians, is part of ``eretz
Israel, or the biblical land of Israel, and that the Jewish right
to that land is ordained in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, a tough-talking former general, is also an unorthodox
Labor politician. He pull won the largest margin of victory for any
prime minister in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials say he comes to the office with less ideological
baggage on peace talks than did Netanyahu, and with a more
practical approach to security for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The public, right and left alike, appears to trust him on the
issue. Barak won about 25 percent of the vote among settlers in the
West Bank, a traditionally nationalist crowd that viewed Labor's
previous leaders as mortal enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Kohen, a hard-line settler with a knitted kippah and the long
side curls of the strictly observant Orthodox, said he had voted
for Netanyahu, but reluctantly. When asked about Barak, he said:
``Barak knows the importance of us being here. He knows that we are
here for the security of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohen admitted that the far right had suffered a terrible defeat
in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the settlers had led indirectly to Netanyahu's
defeat. They felt he had betrayed them by moving forward on the
peace agreement hammered out last fall at the Wye River Plantation
in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by the mosque minarets and stone homes of Palestinian
villages, Kohen's encampment is what he calls a satellite of the
Shilo settlement two miles away.
</P>
<P>
   He said the hilltop where the five trailers lie has been named
``Achia,''which Kohen says refers to a biblical prophet who hailed
from these hills. The trailers ring a water tower next to which a
one-room synogogue is being built.
</P>
<P>
   Six Israeli soldiers were also camped out in a nearby steel
bunker, shouldering automatic rifles and listening to Janis Joplin
belt out ``Take A Piece of My Heart.'' The Netanyahu government
says that the soldiers had been put there to protect the settlers,
and that their presence becomes an example of how the settlements
``create facts on the ground,'' as the settlers put it.
</P>
<P>
   The area falls within a swath of land that is under shared
Palestinian and Israeli control, and one of the areas that would be
likely to shift to full Palestinian control in troop withdrawals
outlined in the Wye agreement, which became deadlocked under
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   This small settlement is one of more than two dozen that sprang
up in the West Bank in the final months of Netanyahu's government.
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon went as far as to urge settlers to
``occupy every hilltop'' before Israel moved any further in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The settlements effectively break the contiguity of Palestinian
villages and become Israeli security outposts in the middle of the
small circles of full Palestinian control that dot roughly 10
percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Galia Golan, a spokeswoman for Peace Now, which is lobbying
Barak to remove settlers like Kohen, also has faith that Barak will
understand the peace camp's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settler movement lost in these elections,'' said Golan,
whose group is made of Israelis and Palestinians who support the
peace process. ``We think Barak understands these settlements are
illegal and that for the peace process to move forward they'll have
to be dismantled.''
</P>
<P>
   People as far apart politically as Kohen and Golan, unfocused as
they seem, appear to show that for now, Israelis can view Barak as
they want to. This is possible because Barak took a tough but vague
line on security issues in the campaign, and the Israeli media did
not make him define his positions.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Barak, who is preparing to take office within six
weeks, seems to have momentum to forge ahead, not only in the
Palestinian peace process, but on the Syrian track as well.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has vowed to pull Israeli troops out of the security zone
they occupy in South Lebanon. Such a move would help to pave the
way to a peace agreement with Syria. Some Israeli political
observers have even advanced the idea that Barak could possibly
return the Golan Heights, the region that Israel captured from
Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his first interviews as prime minister-elect, Barak
responded to a question about the future of West Bank settlements
by saying: ``There are places which I know we will have to make
hard decisions about. That is one of the reasons why I need a broad
government. Then the public can more easily accept the decisions,
and the other side expects to get less.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked more generally about his view of peace, Barak told the
Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, ``I feel like I am a sober
person, a realist, a person who reaches peace not by studying the
visions of the later days of the prophets, but through confronting
reality. I believe in peace from a position of strength, not
fear.''

ETHNIC ANIMOSITIES WORSENING IN MACEDONIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOULA VLAHOU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Nina Karagiozova is retired, but that does
not mean she is not working hard.
</P>
<P>
   She washes dishes, makes beds and sweeps floors _ not for her
family but for foreigners now occupying her two-bedroom home on the
edge of Macedonia's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Like hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other Macedonians,
Karagiozova moved into a modest apartment and rented her family's
home for $1,000-a-month _ up to three times the local rate _ to a
foreign organization, one of hundreds brought to Macedonia by the
war in nearby Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Stefanovski, 25, a taxi driver, saves every dollar or
German mark he earns from driving foreigners around for $100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Both say the income in foreign currency is their only source of
security at a time when their tiny nation could be ready to erupt.
</P>
<P>
   Warfare in nearby Kosovo, a potential ethnic time bomb at home
and a plummeting economy have combined to shake the very foundation
of this tiny backwater _ the only former Yugoslavian republic to
break away without bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is in the Army,'' she said. ``I am very afraid for him
and for all of us. . . . We live from day to day now,'' said the
55-year-old Karagiozova, a former employee at an import-export
firm. ``I feel like we're in prison here,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   She is afraid of Serbia retaliating because Macedonia has
accommodated NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia's future, analysts say, lies with having closer links
to the European Union. For the moment, however, the government is
setting short-term goals to survive.
</P>
<P>
   It finally persuaded the international community helping the
refugees to stop importing most supplies and buy Macedonian
produced goods ranging from toothpaste to bottled water. This at
least is some compensation for NATO bombs in Yugoslavia _ which was
once Macedonia's economic lifeline. Macedonia's Chamber of Commerce
estimates that some businesses suffered a 50 percent loss and that
50 to 60 percent of the work force could become jobless. Before the
Kosovo crisis, Macedonia's unemployment rate was near 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Macedonia is not helped in time and if the promised aid
from developed countries does not arrive, it may experience
economic collapse, which nobody wishes. And I think that this is a
scenario for destabilization of the Macedonian state,'' said Deputy
Prime Minister Dosta Dimovska.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has said that it will give Macedonia $21
million in aid; others have agreed to loan it millions more and
still others have started investing in the creaky economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest concern is Macedonia's volatile demographic mix
between ethnic Albanians and the majority Slavs _ the same makeup
that shattered Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian and Slav Macedonian leaders have desperately
tried to tame the mutual animosity between the two groups,
particularly by the Slav Macedonians.
</P>
<P>
   But with the addition of nearly a quarter million Kosovo
Albanian refugees, the demographic balance is tilting. Conservative
government figures placed the ethnic Albanian population at 21
percent before the refugee crisis. Ethnic Albanians and others set
the figure now at 30 percent or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Now this shift in demographics could give more weight to those
in the Albanian minority who want greater autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a democratic country. But Macedonians and the
Albanians don't like each other. But we have learned to tolerate
each other,'' said political analyst Saso Ordanovski.
</P>
<P>
   Although efforts by political leaders from both groups have so
far succeeded in avoiding violent clashes, signs of intolerance are
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the primarily Slav part of Skopje, residents say they get
nervous when they see cars with license plates from Kosovo. The
government won't allow the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to
expand the camps. Work documents for Kosovar Albanians are only
good until the end of the month. At police checkpoints and border
crossings, Kosovar Albanians are questioned at length and sometimes
harassed. Brawls between the two groups are common, and in some
neighborhoods the graffiti speak loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cure for Albanians is Dr. Professor Vojislav Seselj,''
said big block letters on an apartment building. The ``doctor,'' a
notorious leader of a Serb paramilitary group during the Bosnian
war, made hateful public statements, including an assertion that
the Serbs would take out the eyes of Croats with a rusty spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``is doing good for his
country. He will clean his country of all Albanians who make the
trouble all these years. What are we going to do now? Do you think
that the refugees will go back?'' said Stefanovski, the taxi
driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a guy who will take away all these refugees from our
country and make the Albanians love this country. As long as they
want to separate from Macedonia, Albanians are no good for
Macedonia'' Stefanovski said.

KOSOVO RELIEF WORKERS FACE CHAOS, GRIM SCENES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Four weeks ago,'' David Pryor told his Harvard students
Wednesday, ``I wasn't sure where Albania was.'' He knows now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get sick in Albania,'' was his first advice. Following
three weeks work in the Balkans with the International Rescue
Committee, the former US senator from Arkansas returned to finish
up a post-Senate Kennedy School fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably 70 refugee camps in Albania, holding about
700,000 refugees,'' he began. There are 135 different NGO's
(non-governmental organizations) trying to help, but the system, or
lack of system, makes it chaotic, with a lot of black-marketeering,
theft, profiteering, and sheer confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 problem I see is water, water, water,'' Pryor told a
luncheon audience. ``They're about to run out of water. . . . in
about 60 days, they'll be on the brink.''
</P>
<P>
   He told former Wyoming senator Alan Simpson, his colleague for
18 years in the Senate, that the US Army Corps of Engineers could
do a useful bit of work with water to head off ``the No. 2 problem,
the potential for epidemics and disease, with the lack of sanitary
facilities,'' which will worsen as the heat of the summer breeds
bacteria and all the diseases of crowding, contagion, and
exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The relief workers are often overwhelmed by the scale of the
Serb-instigated tidal wave that dislocated a million Kosovar
Albanians, he said. What's really needed in Pryor's mind is ``a
benevolent dictator,'' to sort out the upheaval and set groups to
appropriate tasks.
</P>
<P>
   He told of some undoubted success stories, like The Flying
Doctors out of Atlanta, a group of docs, nurses, and a dentist _
who ``pulled 140 teeth in one afternoon, some without anaesthetic,
with 40 or 50 people sitting around watching.''
</P>
<P>
   But the overall picture is grim, he said, and left him with a
feeling that it is perhaps best for workers to narrow their focus
and adopt a village or a bunch of refugee kids and work on a
smaller scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might consider adopting a village,'' Pryor told his
audience, which included two men just back from Albania and Dr.
Anne Goldfeld of the Center for Blood Research, who leaves Tuesday
for Tirana for the American Refugee Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Durant, the ARC board member from Mass. General, said
the problem with relief work, which he's done since Vietnam, is
``we keep reinventing the wheel every single time.'' There are 66
million refugees worldwide at the present time, he said, but what
preys most frequently on refugees' psyches is ``separation anxiety
_ `where's my husband, where's my son?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Lucas, who helped the ARC staff negotiate the Albanian
bureaucracy till his return one week earlier, acknowledged the
scene on the ground in the camps is one of ``mass confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to motivate the Kosovars to get organized to help
themselves because of shock, trauma, cultural differences, as well
as ethnic, religious, and class rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, who used to chair the Senate's immigration and refugee
subcommittee, had some scorching words for bureaucracy. ``The UN
High Commissioner's Office for refugees is bureaucracy up the rear
end,'' said Simpson, and changes in US laws to grant refugees
government money meant a lot of immigrants lie or cheat to obtain
benefits. ``We need to redefine the word `refugee,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor noted that Albania is said to have more Mercedeses per
capita than anyplace else. Lucas said many of them are stolen, or
restolen, in a land where you cannot get car insurance.
</P>
<P>
   For Pryor, the lingering image was one of troubled children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw a playground or a play area for children, not
one,'' he said. He suggested the Harvard students consider
volunteering to help the refugee kids, who are kept under close
control by their anxious parents.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts are being made by Microsoft, IBM, and others to
computerize camp records, to attach names and temporary addresses
to information-age lists to lessen the confusion and anxiety over
missing relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might consider adopting a camp,'' said Pryor, whose fellow
Harvard fellow, former South Carolina governor David Beasley, is in
Macedonia now doing similar work. Pryor showed drawings made by
Kosovar kids, typically illustrating their house being torched or
Serbs shooting or shelling Albanian families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanians call the Serbs `The Black Hand,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he was leaving Tirana, said Pryor, the last camp he visited
was one of 3,000 refugees, who'd stood in long lines behind a truck
carrying oranges. One refugee, one orange. As he turned to go, said
Pryor, a boy about 10 motioned for him to wait. The kid ran off to
his tent, then ran back, clutching his orange, which he proudly
presented to the American.
</P>
<P>
   Hefting the orange in his hand, Pryor concluded: ``I'm going to
keep that orange for a long time.''

HOW TO MAKE HIDDEN FILES TRULY HIDDEN, AND WHY MONITOR CONVERGENCE
IS GOOD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I was wondering if you could tell me about the hidden
attribute for folders or files in Windows 98. It doesn't seem to
work on my computer.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when I right-click on a folder and go to
Properties, there are several check boxes that one can select, one
of which is called Hidden. However, when I checked it, the only
thing that changed was the way the folder looked. It was
translucent, but I could still see it. Is there any way that I can
prevent other people who use my computer from seeing certain
sensitive files or folders?
</P>
<P>
   A: There actually are two settings you must check in order to
make hidden files and folders truly hidden.
</P>
<P>
   The first is in the Properties dialog box for the file itself.
</P>
<P>
   This will result in that ``translucent'' icon you mentioned. But
then you also must tell Windows to hide the hidden files and
folder. While this may seem silly, there's a very good reason for
it.
</P>
<P>
   To completely hide hidden files and folders, open any folder.
Click on View, then Folder Options, then click the View tab. You'll
see a Hidden Files category _ under this, check Do Not Show Hidden
Files or Folders. Now, the things you want to remain unseen will be
invisible _ until someone changes that particular setting, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of hidden files and folders is to keep those who
don't know what they're doing from messing with sensitive
components. But there are times when you might want to see
something that is normally hidden _ when troubleshooting or
manually moving files around. That's why you have the ability to
turn off hidden files and folders.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently began having problems with my NEC monitor. I've
had it a long time, but I really like it, so I took it to be fixed.
The technician said all that needed to be done was to fine-tune
something called the convergence. I asked her what that meant, and
her answer was so full of gobbledy-gook that I don't know what she
actually said. Can you tell me what ``convergence'' is in a
monitor?
</P>
<P>
   A: Just as in a television set, a computer monitor works by
having a set of electron beam guns fire at a screen coated with
particles. When the electrons hit the screen, the chemicals glow.
Each gun is responsible for a specific color _ red, blue, green _
and when the colors come together, they form a realistic image.
</P>
<P>
   Convergence is when the beams all focus tightly on the same spot
on the screen. This is what produces a nice, crisp look on a
monitor. If you were having a problem with this _ called
misconvergence _ then the guns weren't lining up just right. Things
probably seemed out of focus, text had a rainbow-like aura and the
corners of the screen were fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   The technician had to align the guns so they converged on the
screen at the same point. Modern monitors let you adjust this
yourself with onscreen controls.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Thanks for your review of Internet Explorer 5.0. I downloaded
it and really like it. I particularly like the Radio Bar, which
lets you play Internet radio stations. However, I have a problem.
When I launch the browser, the Radio Bar isn't there. I go to View,
Toolbars, then Radio, and it appears. But the next time I start
IE5, it's gone again! Is there any way to make it stay permanently?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is another one of those situations, similar to the
previous question, where there are two settings you must change to
get a single result.
</P>
<P>
   Look under Tools, Internet Options, then Advanced. In the
Multimedia area, there's a checkbox called Always Show Internet
Explorer Radio Bar. Click it, and the bar should stay visible.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect the Radio Bar was an afterthought for the Internet
Explorer 5 team, which may explain why it doesn't behave like all
the other toolbars in the browser.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Durant, the ARC board member from Mass. General, said
the problem with relief work, which he's done since Vietnam, is
``we keep reinventing the wheel every single time.'' There are 66
million refugees worldwide at the present time, he said, but what
preys most frequently on refugees' psyches is ``separation anxiety
_ `where's my husband, where's my son?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Lucas, who helped the ARC staff negotiate the Albanian
bureaucracy till his return one week earlier, acknowledged the
scene on the ground in the camps is one of ``mass confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to motivate the Kosovars to get organized to help
themselves because of shock, trauma, cultural differences, as well
as ethnic, religious, and class rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, who used to chair the Senate's immigration and refugee
subcommittee, had some scorching words for bureaucracy. ``The UN
High Commissioner's Office for refugees is bureaucracy up the rear
end,'' said Simpson, and changes in US laws to grant refugees
government money meant a lot of immigrants lie or cheat to obtain
benefits. ``We need to redefine the word `refugee,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor noted that Albania is said to have more Mercedeses per
capita than anyplace else. Lucas said many of them are stolen, or
restolen, in a land where you cannot get car insurance.
</P>
<P>
   For Pryor, the lingering image was one of troubled children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw a playground or a play area for children, not
one,'' he said. He suggested the Harvard students consider
volunteering to help the refugee kids, who are kept under close
control by their anxious parents.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts are being made by Microsoft, IBM, and others to
computerize camp records, to attach names and temporary addresses
to information-age lists to lessen the confusion and anxiety over
missing relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might consider adopting a camp,'' said Pryor, whose fellow
Harvard fellow, former South Carolina governor David Beasley, is in
Macedonia now doing similar work. Pryor showed drawings made by
Kosovar kids, typically illustrating their house being torched or
Serbs shooting or shelling Albanian families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanians call the Serbs `The Black Hand,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he was leaving Tirana, said Pryor, the last camp he visited
was one of 3,000 refugees, who'd stood in long lines behind a truck
carrying oranges. One refugee, one orange. As he turned to go, said
Pryor, a boy about 10 motioned for him to wait. The kid ran off to
his tent, then ran back, clutching his orange, which he proudly
presented to the American.
</P>
<P>
   Hefting the orange in his hand, Pryor concluded: ``I'm going to
keep that orange for a long time.''

THE LOST HISTORY OF THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the lingering legacies of the Harold Evans era at Random
House is an unfinished history of The Wall Street Journal, which
was to be written by veteran Time magazine editor Richard Clurman.
Originally contracted for $300,000, the book was about 70 percent
finished at the time of Clurman's death in 1996. Clurman's
manuscript was then turned over to Newsweek writer Jon Meacham, who
kicked in 25,000 more words. But then Newsweek promoted Meacham to
managing editor and he didn't have time to work on the manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the problem. The manuscript needs to be polished and
brought up to date. The project clearly calls for a Ron Chernow
(biographer of John D. Rockefeller) or a Joe Nocera (author of a
Fortune magazine cover story on rifts among the family that owns
the WSJ) to pull the book together. But Random can't afford _ or
won't spring for _ a Chernow or a Nocera. There's only about
$40,000 of the advance left _ and plenty of work involved. Yes,
Random could hire some pup from Bloomberg or even the Journal
itself, but that writer wouldn't bring the needed authority to the
book.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of who wants to read a book about the
Journal. Three such histories have been published since 1982, and I
doubt you've heard of any of them. Which may be why Random doesn't
want to throw any more dollars down this particular hole.

   It's pretty widely known that Cambridge's own Martin Peretz had
a paper gain of $180 million when his on-line financial news
service, thestreet.com, went public earlier this month. (His stock
is now worth closer to $120 million.) Less well known is that
Peretz, the owner and editor of The New Republic, made out nicely
in another recent Internet deal _ the sale of Williamstown-based
home-page portal Tripod to Lycos _ and could profit handsomely when
two other Web ventures go public.
</P>
<P>
   Peretz invests through a low-key Manhattan-based company called
Clark Estates. Clark Estates invests the considerable legacy of one
Edward Clark, who was a 50 percent partner in the Singer sewing
machine company. Peretz's wife, Anne, is a Clark family cousin. A
different branch of the Clark family, coincidentally, founded the
lovely Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, where Tripod and
another of Peretz's Web businesses have been based.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Estates owns The New Republic. It also owns the Electronic
Newsstand (enews.com), a widely hyped Publishers
Clearinghouse-style magazine discounter that seems quite
unprepossessing at first glance. Nonetheless, as a ``dot.com,'' it
is expected to go public in the near future at an unreasonably high
valuation. Aside from Tripod, Peretz and Clark Estates have also
invested in Employease.com, an Atlanta-based human resources Web
site, this time under the name Federal Partners. FP owns about 12
percent of the stock in Employease, which can be expected to go
public at some future date.
</P>
<P>
   Social note: Employease was, and Tripod is, based in
Williamstown partly because Tripod's Bo Peabody and Employease
founders John Nail and John Alberg all attended Williams College.
As did America Online bossman Steve Case. Ephgeeks one and all.

   New Yorker writer Susan Orlean has been skittish about attaching
her byline to a comic diet book, ``The Skinny,'' that she
coauthored with her friend, humorist Patricia Marx. Orlean, best
known for stylish nonfiction prose jobs like the recently released
``The Orchid Thief,'' used her married name, Susan Sistrom, on the
diet book. But in a recent two-page spread in the National
Enquirer, Orlean/Sistrom's name has disappeared entirely. In nine
columns of breathless hype, the Enquirer reprints the ``Weight Loss
Secrets of Skinny Women'' and attributes the information to ``diet
expert'' Patricia Marx.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the uptown Susan Orlean didn't want her name in the
down-market tabloid? ``I wouldn't say that the peak of my fantasy
as a writer is to appear in the National Enquirer,'' Orlean/Sistrom
told me. ``I was neither dodging them nor courting them. I have no
clue why they didn't use my name.'' Enquirer editor Steve Plamann
won't reveal how the piece ended up in the tab. ``If she wrote it
for us, I wouldn't tell you,'' Plamann said. ``We have freelancers
in the Boston Globe newsroom, and we're not giving out their names,
either. Your editor might well be one of our contributors.''

NO CURE FOR GAPS IN HARDWOOD FLOOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 23, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My new Canadian maple floorboards are separating. Is there a
cure?
</P>
<P>
   BILL HOYSGAARD, Sherburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no cure; well, there is, except it entails taking up
the boards in winter, and relaying them tight. The reason they
should be laid in winter is that they are at their dryest and
smallest at that time. They should be laid tight so that in summer,
when they take up moisture and expand they will become even
tighter. Then, when in winter they dry out and shrink, the gaps
will not show.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing will fill the gaps because the boards are tongued and
grooved, and the gaps are too shallow for anything to fill
properly. A wood strip filler works only with square-edged (not
tongued-and-grooved) boards.
</P>
<P>
   A way to disguise the gaps is also involved: Sand the floor to
the bare wood, stain the floor and the gaps a medium to dark color,
and revarnish. The gaps will be the same color as the boards, and
simply will not show as much.
</P>
<P>
   Some people recommend filling the gaps with a mix of glue and
sawdust of the maple. That may work for a while, but it hardens,
then breaks up as the boards expand and contract, making the gaps
look worse than ever.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My porch ceiling is made of plywood sheets, and I can see the
seams. Can I caulk them and paint? What is good for a new ceiling?
</P>
<P>
   STEVE FUSI, Bedford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Caulk the seams this way, which will work best if there is an
actual gap in the seams: Put a bead of caulk (from a caulking
cartridge) in the seam and press it in with your fingers, scraping
and wiping off excess. This will give a smooth, even surface for
painting. Or, cover the seams with a double-edged molding; it will
make everything neat and paintable.
</P>
<P>
   For a new ceiling, install 1 x 6 cedar boards, tongued and
grooved with V-joints. They do not have to be finished; they will
darken with age, but that's OK.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am doing indoor projects that are creating dust and debris,
which I would like to keep out of the rest of the house. Is there a
kind of zipper system that will encase the project while work is
being done?
</P>
<P>
   W. W., Martha's Vineyard, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is a new tent system for sale that allows you to zip
polyethylene around the project to prevent dust and debris from
getting all over the house. It is called Zipwall: 122 Jason St.,
Arlington, MA 02174, 800-718-2255. Two poles cost $139; you provide
the polyethylene.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My bed is on wheels, which I have been pushing back and forth
to make it for 36 years. The wheels have worn deep grooves right in
the wood. Is there a way I can replace that wood, which is regular
hardwood flooring?
</P>
<P>
   CLAIRE O'BRIEN, Newburyport, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure there is, but it will take a carpenter with some
gumption and imagination to cut them out and replace them properly.
If the grooves are parallel to the boards, you may have to take
only one or two boards out. If the grooves are crossing the boards;
that is, are at right angles to the boards, you will have to
replace more boards.
</P>
<P>
   But to remove them, cut the tongue of one board by inserting a
chisel between boards and giving the chisel a whack with a hammer.
If you have to replace a short board, then you will have to cut the
board short with a very sharp chisel, and hope that you get a good
square edge. Replace the grooved boards with new hardwood; the new
boards may be narrower than the old, so you may have to cut them to
fit. Use square-edged boards for ease of installation; then finish
them as necessary and you're home free. Well, not free; this work
will not be inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: Make sure the wheels or casters are turning
properly; replace them if necessary. It sounds as if the wheels or
casters were not turning and were scraping into the wood. And, to
prevent further grooving, consider putting one of those desk chair
floor mats made of heavy plastic under the bed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A piece of Tupperware melted on a hot stove burner. How can I
remove it?
</P>
<P>
   LESLIE HAUSMAN, Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Heat got the plastic on the burner; heat will remove it. Turn
on the burner and scrape the softened plastic with a wood spatula
or other scraper made of wood. You could use a metal scraper, but
try to avoid metal except to remove residue.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'd like to put a nice tool shed in my yard, but the
ready-made ones I found in stores are $2,000. Can I build it myself
for less?
</P>
<P>
   TONY BISCHIA, Norfolk, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Certainly, for maybe half (the materials; you don't count
your labor). Get plans from Craft Patterns (630-587-9650 or
800-747-1429). Build a proper concrete foundation or secure the
shed on concrete piers or pressure-treated posts. You can set the
shed on concrete blocks on the ground, but the shed will move in
winter; your only hope is that the shed will move evenly up and
down, and not get all skewed.

`CLEOPATRA' PILES ON THE CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
CLEOPATRA 
Starring: Leonor Varela, Timothy Dalton, Billy Zane, Rupert Graves 
Directed by: Franc Roddam 
On: ABC 
Time: Sunday and Monday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TV14 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The camera loves Timothy Dalton's chin, with its smooth,
cavernous, and surprisingly expressive dimple. In the new
``Cleopatra,'' Dalton maximizes that formidable chin, using it
along with his heavy, inky brow to make his Julius Caesar into a
big, angry, toga-wearing hunk of passion. Like the rest of this
two-part miniseries, he is cheesy in an amusing, high-strung,
overblown sort of way, and the movie suffers after he's stabbed to
death at the end of part one.
</P>
<P>
   But there's plenty of garish melodrama and spectacle to be found
elsewhere in this story of the Queen of Egypt. Filmed some 36 years
after Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton's wonderfully awful
version, ABC's ``Cleopatra'' is a bit of fun network camp that can
only be appreciated when approached with low expectations and a
good sense of humor. From Rupert Graves' poufy 1970s hairdo as
Octavian to the soft-porn lovemaking between Cleopatra and Marc
Antony, it's all silliness in (and out of) robes and breastplates,
with enough amateurish acting and grade-B dialogue to keep the
boredom at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The script is particularly bloated, with the sort of Cecil B.
DeMille-sized lines that absolutely require overacting. Cleopatra
is forever making pushy comments like, ``You are nothing to me,''
and ``I am the Queen of Egypt, and you are in my palace. Now step
aside.'' After Caesar's death, the stronger, wiser Queen falls in
love with Antony, who takes her hand and says, ``Do you feel this
beating heart? That's life you feel.'' As they deliver these
clunkers, the leading actors are always clutching at one another
out of love and hate, and in one typical scene Caesar segues from
choking Cleopatra with his bare hands to hugging her lovingly.
Meanwhile, the supporting actors _ Caesar's generals, in particular
_ yell out their dull military instructions with an almost
high-school-stage-production blankness, as though they had 10
minutes to prepare for their performances. Occasionally, if you
listen carefully, you can hear the script lapse into contemporary
affect, as Caesar looks at Cleopatra's young brother saying, ``And
you are . . .?''
</P>
<P>
   The first night of ``Cleopatra'' revolves around the Queen's
efforts to save Egypt by hooking up with Caesar _ hooking being the
right word, since she consults with a prostitute on how to ensnare
and hold onto him. Once he is killed, she spends the part two
glomming onto Antony, who is younger and, we gather indirectly,
better in bed. Thankfully, the moviemakers have kept all the
political plotting and battle strategies EZ-to-read, allowing the
focus to remain on the gaudier romantic activities and, of course,
the big-budget pageantry. The movie tries hard to be one of those
``lavish'' TV events, and some of the settings are indeed lush and
realistic. But a number of backdrops _ mostly those involving boats
(do actors get nauseous on a see-saw?) _ are quite obviously fake.
</P>
<P>
   As Cleopatra, newcomer Varela is incredibly miscast. She's too
petulant, and in no way believably commanding as she dresses down
powerhouses like Caesar and Antony. Leading the army screaming,
``The future of Egypt depends on it,'' she's like a 10-year-old
girl acting in front of the mirror. Her Cleopatra is all nervous
posing with bold attitude, and never the real thing. While she fits
into the tacky spirit of this production, her pouty French accent
quickly becomes annoying. Billy Zane, Kate Winslet's fiance in
``Titanic,'' mostly plays it straight as Antony, loyal friend to
Caesar, and loyal (and horny) lover to Cleopatra. It's only toward
the end of part two that he's able to loosen up, as he washes away
his despair in a downward spiral of liquor and free women. Alas,
Zane pales next to the gravel-voiced authority of Dalton, who can
chew scenery with the best of them. He could never equal the brio
of Dalton's victorious Caesar, who rises topless from a steaming
pool in slow-motion exclaiming, ``Dictator for life!''

TEENS ARE BARRED FROM RISKY JOBS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ During a recent local investigation of wage and hour
violations in the roofing industry, investigators from the U.S.
Department of Labor were driving from one job site to another when
they spotted what appeared to be a teen-ager working on a saw at a
concrete company.
</P>
<P>
   The boy turned out to be 16. Allowing someone that young to
operate a power-driven saw is a violation of wage and hour laws,
said Shirley Gardner, district director of the Wage and Hour
Division of the U.S. Department of Labor in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It's not uncommon for investigators to stumble upon those kind
of child labor violations, said Gardner. Many employers are unaware
that there are federal restrictions on the number of hours, time of
day and the types of work that teens can do.
</P>
<P>
   Grocery stores are some of the most frequent violators because
they often have teen-age workers operate paper baling machines,
Gardner said. That problem is so common that Gardner will be
investigating a chain that reportedly allows its teen employees to
operate the paper baler and work an excessive number of hours.
</P>
<P>
   Several grocers have been caught before and should know better,
said Gardner, who is working off a tip.
</P>
<P>
   While many small employers aren't as familiar with child labor
violations, the problem isn't limited to them.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Sears Roebuck and Co. agreed to pay a
$325,000 penalty to settle allegations that it violated child labor
laws by letting teens operate electrical machinery or work too many
hours. A Labor Department investigation uncovered 227 children who
were working at Sears in violation of child labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide sting, in which wage and hour offices were asked
to visit one of their local Sears stores, uncovered problems at a
store in Houston. There, a 17-year-old employee was operating a
freight elevator in violation of child labor rules against
operating a hoisting apparatus, Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the investigation, Sears will check its stores to
locate trouble spots and beef up its supervisory training program,
according to Paula Davis, spokeswoman for Sears in Chicago. The
chain employs 11,000 teens under the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PARENTS SHOULD ASK ABOUT TASKS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sears also will give parents of its teen-age employees
information about what to look for in a good employer and the
importance of asking their children what kind of work they're
doing. That way, a parent could spot a potential problem _ a child
being asked, for example, to drive a forklift.
</P>
<P>
   Parents also can visit the work site, Gardner said. Employers
shouldn't mind.
</P>
<P>
   Frank S. Manitzas, an employment lawyer who handles a lot of
wage and hour cases with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &AMP; Feld in San
Antonio, said he can't remember a single instance in his 38 years
of experience of a parent supplying a tip that led to a violation.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a good idea, he said. If parents hear something that
doesn't sound right _ like a 16-year-old operating a power-driven
meat grinder _ they could talk to the employer, who should
straighten out the situation immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Or a parent could call the Wage and Hour division.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner said child labor is the agency's priority. It tries to
respond to such complaints the same day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HOURS CAN BE A VIOLATION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is a partial list for parents of jobs that no one under 18
is supposed to do:
</P>
<P>
   _ Manufacture explosives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Drive a motor vehicle to make deliveries, such as pizza or
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mine coal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Operate power-driven woodworking machines.
</P>
<P>
   _ Operate a hoisting apparatus like a forklift.
</P>
<P>
   _ Operate metal, punching or shearing machines.
</P>
<P>
   _ Operate paper machines such as box crushers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Roofing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Excavation, if the holes are deeper than 4 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Another common violation is working teens more hours or later in
the night than federal law allows, Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   During the school term, 14- and 15-year-olds can't work past 7
p.m. Nor can they work more than three hours a day and 18 hours a
week. On a non-school day, they can work eight hours _ but still no
more than 18 in a week.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, 14- and 15-year-olds can work up to 40 hours
a week _ but no more than eight hours a day or after 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Once they turn 16, there is no limit under federal law to the
number of hours they can work.

`THE LOVE LETTER' DELIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE LOVE LETTER 
Directed by: Peter Ho-Sun Chan 
Screenplay by: Maria Maggenti (novel: Cathleen Schine) 
Starring: Kate Capshaw, Blythe Danner, Ellen DeGeneres, Geraldine
McEwan, Julianne Nicholson, Tom Everett Scott, Tom Selleck, Gloria
Stuart 
Running time: 90 minutes 
Rated: R (some sexuality and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Love Letter'' is what an astute friend of mine calls a
village comedy. That is, a merry boil of characters snooping into
one another's business as if it's their birthright just because
they've known one another for years. This, of course, gives rise to
a lot of concealment and secrets. Which, of course, means more than
a few juicy misunderstandings. Usually, this kind of film comes
from, and is done to perfection by, countries like Ireland and the
Czech Republic. But ``The Love Letter'' transports the recipe from
Hollywood to New England and turns it into the kind of flavorful
clambake that defines summer escapist entertainment. The kind you
want to escape to, that is, and not from, as is so often and so
lugubriously the case.
</P>
<P>
   It's built around a tried-and-true _ and in this case foolproof
_ plot device, the love letter of the title. We don't learn until
the end who wrote it, and to whom. Until then, all we see is
various people finding it in turn and, human nature being what it
is, never entertaining the slightest flicker of doubt that it was
meant for them. You do have to cut the film some slack and believe
that each one who discovers the letter would refrain from hiding it
away and would leave it lying around for the next person to find.
But indulgence seems a small price to pay for the tasty screenful
of performances that push off from the mischievous missive.
</P>
<P>
   It's centered on Kate Capshaw's single mom, who runs a bookstore
and keeps a tight rein on her life until she finds the letter and
it sets her mind racing. In this case, it races to Tom Everett
Scott's hunky young summer clerk, who has already made it clear
with the odd sheepdog look that he's interested. He doesn't seem to
possess the command of language available to the letter writer, but
she's willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. By doing so,
however, she might ruin her chances with town fireman Tom Selleck's
single dad, an old flame of hers who's still carrying a torch. It
might put a crimp in her friendship with Ellen DeGeneres's shop
assistant and confidante. It might also drain some of the sunshine
from the smile of Julianne Nicholson's adorably spunky clerk, who
admires what she sees as the stand-alone feminism of Capshaw's
Helen.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Stuart (as Helen's grandmother), Blythe Danner (as
Helen's mother) and Geraldine McEwen (as the town eccentric) add
spice and character to the mix, too. DeGeneres has fun with what I
can't help thinking of as the Eve Arden role and Selleck continues
to impress as an actor, following his winning performance in ``In &AMP;
Out'' with his character here, a convincingly feelingful if not
especially articulate man. But mostly ``The Love Letter'' is
Capshaw's show, without seeming too obviously to be so. She
reinforces the impression that she's doing much more interesting
work than she ever did in her ``Indiana Jones'' days.
</P>
<P>
   She's remaking her persona, emerging as one of the most
persuasive proponents of jangly but big-hearted sympathetic women.
Building on her warm, wayward mom in ``How to Make an American
Quilt,'' her tempestuous rancher in ``Locusts,'' and her generous
and unpredictable romantic adventuress in ``The Alarmist,'' she
makes the erosion of her control-freak routine in the face of
romantic yearning seem funny and simpatico. Maria Maggenti's script
keeps things bright and humane and Peter Ho-Sun Chan makes an
auspicious directorial debut, calling forth enough behavioral
nuance and underplaying to keep the film from being capsized by its
sometimes overbearing music. All that and Rockport, too, at its
most picturesquely alluring. ``The Love Letter'' is a winning
romantic confection.

`TREKKIES' CHARTS A PHENOMENON'S COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
TREKKIES 
A documentary by Roger Nygard 
Running time: 88 minutes 
Rated: PG (nothing objectionable) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Making fun of ``Trekkies,'' those get-a-lifers obsessed with all
things ``Star Trek,'' has always been rather like shooting fish in
a barrel. It's just too easy, too obvious a target. Who doesn't
laugh at the thought of people greeting each other with Vulcan
handshakes or in mumbo-jumbo Klingon, or adults driving around with
``Starfleet Academy'' window stickers on their cars?
</P>
<P>
   So it says an awful lot about Roger Nygard's often-hilarious
look at the 30-years-and-counting ``Star Trek'' phenomenon, and its
fans in particular, that ``Trekkies'' never really feels like an
88-minute put-down. It's all pretty funny, to be sure, but Nygard
isn't so much interested in making fun of Trekkies, as he is in
taking a light-hearted look at their particular world, and just how
far some have gone to honor their favorite television show. In
``Trekkies,'' you can laugh with them, even as you're laughing at
them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps only Elvis fans rival Trekkies in devotion. But whereas
Presley fanatics usually make annual sojourns to Graceland, there's
a ``Star Trek'' convention held somewhere in the world every
weekend of the year. And Trekkies have become such a part of the
cultural lexicon, they are the only fans listed by name in the
Oxford English Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly an official definition is needed for some of the fans
introduced in the film. There's Dr. Denis Bourguignon a Florida
dentist who not only calls his office ``Starbase Dental,'' and has
it decorated with all kinds of memorabilia, but wears his ``Star
Trek'' uniform while he works. His entire staff _ it's a
requirement for the job _ and family also wear the colors of the
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   There's Gabriel Koerner, a 14-year-old in Bakersfield, Calif.,
who has attended 28 conventions in eight years, and is planning his
own ``Star Trek'' movie, complete with redesigned, hand-sewn
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Barbara Adams, who earned her 15 minutes of fame a
few years back when she wore her Starfleet commander's uniform
every day while in the jury pool at the Whitewater trial. It wasn't
a gag; Adams, a lieutenant commander of her local Trekkies club in
Arkansas, wears her uniform, with badges and phaser, everywhere.
Beam me up, Scotty, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Our guide through Trekkie-dom is Denise Crosby, who played Lt.
Tasha Yar on ``Star Trek: The Next Generation.'' When she joined
the series, she quickly realized she was ``part of something larger
than a new TV series. I was becoming part of a phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Crosby attends the conventions, as do many of the stars from the
original ``Star Trek,'' including DeForrest Kelley (Dr. ``Bones''
McCoy), George Takei (Sulu), James Doohan (Scotty), and Nichelle
Nichols (Lt. Uhuru). Like most folks, the cast members first
thought Trekkies were a little loony, and that the whole thing
would wither and fade. Instead, they've watched it grow each year
with a new generation of fans.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the fans are tech-heads, others are attracted to
``Star Trek,'' because the show, even in the 1960s, promoted
racial, ethnic, and gender diversity. Nichols, one of the first
black actresses featured on television in a non-stereotypic role,
recalls a story told by a black woman who said that when, as a
child, she first saw Lt. Uhuru, she screamed through her house,
``There's a black lady on TV, and she ain't no maid.'' That
youngster grew up to be Whoopi Goldberg, who would herself appear
in ``Star Trek: Generations.''
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible not to laugh at the people translating the Bible
into Klingon, a fabricated language which sounds a bit like German,
or the man who wishes he could afford to have his ears surgically
altered to resemble Mr. Spock's. But really, what makes their
obsession any more bizarre than people who eat, sleep and drink
golf, meticulously chart every Red Sox statistic, or spend their
weekends perusing yard sales to complete their Fiestaware
collections? It may fall short of common definitions of normalcy,
but as a film, ``Trekkies'' sure beats sleeping outside for days to
see a mediocre movie about some galaxy far, far away.

TEENS URGE FEDS TO CRACK DOWN ON HARSH CIGARETTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC DRUDIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A flavored, filterless Indian cigarette often
smuggled into the United States has become trendy among teen-agers
who mistakenly believe it's harmless, according to a study that has
caught the attention of the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny cigarettes called beedies are cheap and fairly easy to
find even for underage buyers, according to the Booker T.
Washington Community Service Center task force in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Ten San Francisco teens _ several of whom spent a year
researching beedies _ filed a complaint with the FTC that caused
the government to step up its regulation of the import of beedies.
Nearly 40 percent of the cigarettes are smuggled into the United
States to avoid federal and state tobacco taxes, according to the
task force's research.
</P>
<P>
   Both the FTC and Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, have vowed swift
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have urged the Customs Department to comply with this
laudable request from the young people of San Francisco,'' Doggett
said. ``These young Californians are taking the lead to protect
both their neighbors and children on the other side of the world,
all of whom are being exploited by the traffickers of these deadly
cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Beedies, hand-rolled tobacco wrapped with thin strands of pink
thread, contain 7 percent more nicotine than Marlboros, 250
milligrams of tobacco and as much tar as regular Winstons,
according to the manufacturers of the popular Kailas Brand of
beedie.
</P>
<P>
   But their colorful, cylinder-shaped packages are sometimes sold
without federal health warnings when importers have smuggled them
into the state to avoid California's hefty tobacco tax, customs
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Teens and others are eager to buy the ``natural high'' the Hindi
writing on the package promises.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, customs officials seized 440,000 untaxed beedies in the
San Francisco Bay area, but admit they probably missed hundreds of
thousands of other packs. Some are legal _ registered through
customs and taxed as tobacco products. Most aren't. Forty-one
percent of beedies purchased by the teen-agers in the study had no
tax-paid stamp from customs, said Laurie Moss, a staff worker at
the Booker T. Washington Community Service Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means they were smuggled illegally into the country and
sold illegally to underage kids,'' Moss said. ``Youth in the United
States are being exploited by the beedie industry.''
</P>
<P>
   By not paying taxes in California, buyers of beedies knock at
least 90 cents off the price of an American-brand pack.
</P>
<P>
   The availability, cheap price and inspired flavors _ clove,
strawberry, chocolate and mint are the most popular _ have
transformed the tiny beedie into the latest must-try-trend for
teens who consider them ``healthy Jamaican cigarettes,'' said
Frederick Johnson, one of San Francisco teens who filed the FTC
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 16, said he tried beedies once, ``but they weren't
ordinary cigarettes'' and he vowed never to smoke them again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we can't change the minds of people who smoke it, we're
hoping to at least raise awareness and stop people who would use
(beedies) from using them,'' Johnson said. ``It's not only tobacco,
but it's the worst kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 percent of the teens surveyed said beedies couldn't
give them cancer, and 40 percent who smoked them said it didn't
damage their lungs. The surgeon general warns that beedies are as
dangerous as cigarettes and more addictive because of higher
nicotine levels.
</P>
<P>
   Federal guidelines require that all tobacco products, not just
cigarettes, carry one of the 12 surgeon general's warnings stamped
or printed on cigarette and cigar packs.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco study also revealed that underage buyers
(minors under 18 are prohibited from buying tobacco products)
convinced 24 percent of the San Francisco stores they visited to
sell them packages of 20 to 25 beedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some stores they asked for our ID,'' said Maurice Evans,
17. ``But in other stores, we went in and asked them for it and we
were able to buy them. You've got to be 18 or older to purchase
this kind of product, but we were able to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Public Health funded the survey.

OF `PRAYING INDIANS,' WAR AND ONE MAN'S MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
JOHN ELIOT'S MISSION TO THE INDIANS BEFORE KING PHILIP'S WAR 
By Richard W. Cogley 
Harvard University Press, 331 pp., $45 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In December 1675, the Puritan missionary John Eliot visited the
Indians who had been interned on Deer Island as King Philip's War
inflamed Eastern Massachusetts. As Daniel Gookin, the colony's
superintendent of Indian affairs who accompanied Eliot, reported,
``the island was bleak and cold'' and as for the 500 men, women,
and children they found there, ``their wigwams (were) poor and
thin, their clothes few and thin.''
</P>
<P>
   They were not allies of King Philip, whose Algonquian warriors
had already forced the English to abandon their westernmost
settlements. They were ``praying Indians,'' the native people whom
Eliot had been laboring for some 30 years to convert to Puritan
Christianity and for whom he had established ``praying towns''
north and west of Boston. But the Massachusetts General Court had
ordered them removed from their towns and taken to Deer Island
``for their and our security.''
</P>
<P>
   The oddly cumbersome, 10-word title of Richard Cogley's book
focuses attention on the intersection of Eliot's mission, perhaps
the most positive religious endeavor of the young Puritan colony,
and the devastating conflict that threatened to break the
colonists' fragile hold in New England.
</P>
<P>
   If the mission represented a noble effort to enable the two
races to live together, the war, particularly its impact on Eliot's
converts, ``signaled the failure of the English and the native
peoples to live together peaceably,'' as historian Jill Lepore has
noted in ``The Name of War.''
</P>
<P>
   Cogley, an associate professor of religious studies at Southern
Methodist University, has carefully traced Eliot's missionary
activities, placing them in the context of Colonial politics _ and
Colonial relations with the mother country _ and judiciously
considered their role in causing the war that effectively brought
them to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Cogley also makes it clear that Eliot was not out to destroy
Indian culture, but was actually interested in fostering the
survival of the native Massachusett language _ which he learned,
``in contrast to virtually all other colonists in prewar
Massachusetts'' _ and of many native customs, particularly the use
of herbal remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 14 years from the arrival of the Puritans in Boston
in 1630 to the establishment of the mission in 1644 may seem a
short interval, considering the other and more pressing concerns
that would have required the settlers' attention, Cogley sees ``the
major historical problem'' as not why they waited so long, ``but
why the colony began it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the submission of six Algonquian sachems to the colony's
General Court in March 1644 that ``was the decisive event'' in
establishing the mission. The sachems apparently acted in order to
secure the protection of the English from rival tribes. It was
also, Cogley suggests, a recognition of Puritan righteousness, and
it prompted the General Court to require them to receive religious
instruction. Eliot apparently thought he would be just the first in
a series of rotating missionaries, but such was not to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   By the time war broke out in 1675, 14 praying towns had been
established and contained a population of about 1,200. In the more
established ones closer to Boston, such as Natick, many Indians
farmed along English models but, Cogley notes, ``many features of
the natives' old ways also survived.''
</P>
<P>
   But the native settlements were feeling the pressure of Colonial
expansion, which led to disputes over land, notably between the
Plymouth Colony and the Algonquians, led by Metacom, whom the
colonists knew as King Philip.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot attempted to mediate the quarrel, but _ in the greatest of
ironies _ his ``peace initiative,'' writes Cogley,
``inadvertently'' led to war.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of Eliot's peace initiative, commissioners from
Massachusetts and Connecticut were to mediate the dispute between
Metacom and Plymouth. But they imposed humiliating conditions on
Metacom, which required him to submit to Plymouth under threat of
invasion. And the triggering event was the subsequent murder of one
of Eliot's disciples, John Sassamon, who had urged Metacom to
submit to mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Cogley's emphasis on the mission rather than the missionary
leaves Eliot a somewhat shadowy figure. That aside, ``John Eliot's
Mission'' is a major contribution to an understanding of
English-Indian relations during the first half-century of Colonial
settlement _ relations that promised so much but had so tragic an
outcome.

A GAY TEEN STORY WITH PLEASANT SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
GET REAL 
Written by: Patrick Wilde (based on his play, ``What's Wrong With
Angry?'') 
Directed by: Simon Shore 
Starring: Ben Silverstone, Brad Gorton, Charlotte Brittain, Stacy
A. Hart, Jacquetta May, David Lumsden 
Running time: 110 minutes 
Rated: R (sexual situations, strong language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steven Carter is gay. That this is not a source of hand-wringing
and teeth-gnashing for the 16-year-old is the first, but not the
only, pleasant surprise in ``Get Real,'' a refreshing new film from
Simon Shore. This movie, which screenwriter Patrick Wilde adapted
from his play, ``What's Wrong with Angry?,'' is less about coming
out than about the hardships of all teenagers trying to find their
place in the world as they stumble toward adulthood. Throughout,
the film feels real and familiar without being hackneyed, and in
this movie year packed with adolescent angst, ``Get Real,'' easily
emerges as the best of the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Steven, winningly played by Ben Silverstone, has known since age
11 that he was ``dodgy,'' or gay. He's at peace with his sexuality,
although it is something he has shared only with his best friend,
Linda (Charlotte Brittain). But he longs for meaningful
companionship beyond the clandestine trysts he has with older men
in public bathrooms at a local park.
</P>
<P>
   Like his school chums, Steven spends his energies pacifying his
parents, although his mother (Jacquetta May) isn't as clueless as
he thinks. He doesn't so much lie to them as let them believe what
they want _ such as a love of soccer is the explanation for all
those photos of handsome soccer stars covering his bedroom wall.
</P>
<P>
   But it's just as well, since he's consumed with amorous thoughts
of John Dixon (Brad Gorton). With his sexy smile and curly hair,
John is an Oxford-bound upperclassman, the school hunk described by
Linda as ``sex on legs.'' Indeed, he is quite the dish. John is a
tall, popular, athletic eyeful _ everything Steven isn't. It's
usually John's lunkheaded jock buddies who taunt Steven's sensitive
nature.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Steven is that rare thing in film _ a confident teenager.
When he discovers that he unknowingly cruised John at the park
tearoom _ all conversations occur courtesy of written notes passed
through a bathroom stall gloryhole _ Steven never shies away from
pursuing a relationship with the most popular boy at school. Their
relationship begins haltingly, sweetly as they try negotiating the
unsteady terrain of young love.
</P>
<P>
   But John is still wrestling with his sexuality. He is a prisoner
of his popularity, bound to live up to the expectations of his pals
who demand an accessible god to worship. While Steven wants
everyone to know about his burgeoning relationship, John can't even
bring himself to say hello to Steven at school.
</P>
<P>
   It's to Wilde's credit that the film's outcome is never
completely obvious. Steven and John's relationship seems doomed,
yet perhaps strong enough to survive peer pressure and homophobia.
Most of the cast hits the right notes. Gorton is heartbreaking as
the conflicted John, and Brittain deserves special mention for
sprucing up a role that began as a cruel punchline and has become a
cliched film staple _ the zaftig, unlucky-in-love gal pal of a gay
teen or man.

DAVE MATTHEWS LIVES TO TOUR, AND INVITES FRIENDS TO COME ALONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dave Matthews doesn't play games. He doesn't have to, based on
his phenomenal popularity of the past few years. He's done it his
way by touring, touring, touring _ and by sticking to beliefs that
might be termed idealistic. Matthews simply believes that music is
a bridge to other people, not a way to feel superior to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems that a lot of times there's a sense of
competition in this business,'' says Matthews. ``It seems like such
an odd place to have it in music. I don't know if it comes out of
the industry or what, but there's too much talk of who's better or
who's valid or who's contemporary? Who cares? Get a life.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Matthews assembled his summer stadium lineup.
The bill features the Dave Matthews Band, '60s Latin-rockers
Santana, and '90s hip-hop/rockers the Roots. Some of the
competitive individuals Matthews is talking about might find it an
unwieldy bill, but he isn't about to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted a good show, that was our focus,'' Matthews,
31, says recently from a tour stop in Detroit. ``I just think it's
a great lineup. It's a couple different generations of music. And
Santana is a great live band. Most people in the states probably
don't know that they tour all of the time. They're constantly
working. They still sell out huge shows in South America and
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Consistent with Matthews's all-embracing philosophy, he expects
the groups on the bill will jam together. ``With Carlos Santana,
we've played and written together. So I can't think of a reason we
wouldn't play with him,'' says Matthews. ``I'm sure there will be
some sort of exchange with Carlos and the Roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, if there's people around to jump onstage,
we'll bring them on,'' says Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews is lumped in with the ``jam band'' movement, but he,
frankly, takes issue with that phrase. ``The jam band thing is a
funny phenomenon,'' he says. ``I don't think we ever thought of
ourselves as a jam band. It's not anything I ever think about. I
think when a lot of people say `jam band,' they're trying to be
derogatory. It can be sort of a flippant remark.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it means a `live band,' as opposed to a band that goes
on tour reluctantly to back up an album, then I suppose we
certainly are,'' says Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia-based group includes the South African-born
Matthews, Cajun-spiced violinist Boyd Tinsley, saxophonist Leroi
Moore, bassist Stefan Lessard, and drummer Carter Beauford. They're
touring as a back-to-basics five-piece unit this year, after going
out last summer with guitarist Tim Reynolds (with whom Matthews
just released an album as a side project) and South African penny
whistler Big Voice Jack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll change as the tour goes on,'' Matthews says. ``But it's
nice right now to have the five of us. The dynamic sort of grows.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Phish and the Allman Brothers, the Matthews Band has also
reached a point where it doesn't have to release a new album to
tour. The crowds come based on the reputation of the live shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really good about where we're at right now,'' Matthews
says. ``How can I not? We'll just stay on the road and try to keep
it fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   He anticipates that the group may release a live album later
this year (``if we can find a tape we like''), then another studio
disc next year. But the focus, as always, is road work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stop touring when we are in the studio, but aside from
that, we never really stop touring,'' he says. ``So we've been
lucky not to get into this album/tour, album/tour thing. When
people say, `Oh, you're going out to support this new album' when
we do have new albums, I say, `Well, I guess so. We're not in the
studio, so what else are we going to do? I have a job. I should do
it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews, whose hits include the consumer satire ``Too Much,''
the protest song ``Don't Drink the Water'' (about Native American
rights), and the romantic ``Crash Into Me,'' has come up with a
signature fusion of percussive rock, jazz, and roots music. It's
not a fusion commonly associated with stadiums, but Matthews, whose
band played its first-ever stadium date at Foxboro last year, is
getting accustomed to these oversized settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've been getting more comfortable,'' he says. ``If
there's an audience there, I'm not opposed to playing in
(stadiums), as long as we can supply people with a show, and as
long as people don't leave bummed out by it. I don't think that
happened last year and hopefully it won't happen this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of large crowds, Matthews also has signed on to play
the 30th anniversary of the Woodstock Festival in Rome, N.Y.,
during the weekend of July 23-25. ``I love to play; that's the
principal reason we're doing it,'' he says. ``And there's a lot of
great bands there, so it should be a great show. My initial
reaction when asked was `no,' but somehow my `no' went through the
pipeline and came out a `yes' at the other end, so I'll make the
best of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no disrespect to the whole thing at all,'' he says of
Woodstock. ``It was a case of `Do you want to fly in from (a gig
in) Texas to New York to play, then fly back to Texas to play
another show the next night?' Well, no. I'd prefer to fly to
Shangri-La for a day off. I'd like to go sip some tea. But no, off
we go to that beautiful concrete block up near the original place.
But as I say, we'll make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as Matthews is performing somewhere, you get the sense
that he'll be happy. Nor is he out there gouging fans with the high
ticket prices that have become all too common at some superstar
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems only fair to keep ticket prices low,'' says Matthews.
``We used to charge $5, and now we're at $25. It's a long way from
when we charged $5, but I don't think we're going to be charging
$150 any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   So Matthews is not going to play a New Year's Eve gig and charge
$1,500 a ticket like the Eagles?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I think I just may go sit under the stars and not do a
thing on New Year's Eve.''

SOCIAL D'S NESS SHOWS HIS SENSITIVE SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even a self-respecting punk has to step out sometimes. Look at
Mike Ness, the front man for Social Distortion. He's a punk legend
through his work with the slamming Social D, but he just released
his first solo album, the surprising ``Cheating at Solitaire,''
which busts into styles as diverse as primitive rock, stomping
rockabilly, darkly haunting country, covers of Bob Dylan and Hank
Williams songs, and even some bluegrass and a smokey jazz ballad or
two. All of it high quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show people that I could do more than one thing,''
says Ness. ``Primarily, Social Distortion has been a punk band. We
have evolved and brought in other styles, but it's still one style
to me. So this is to show people, and show myself, that I can do
other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Ness will make another Social Distortion album in the future,
but for now, he's with a hand-picked solo group. They play a few
Social D tunes (``I think the crowd would be disappointed if I
didn't''), but they'll feature the new ``Solitaire'' album, which
is one of the best solo discs so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ness's take on it: ``I feel like I brought roots music to punk
with Social Distortion, and I think on this new record that I
brought the attitude and angst of punk to roots.''
</P>
<P>
   He also shows a different emotional side. He's known as a tough
guy, but on the new disc he's a tough guy with a heart. He wraps
his deep, somewhat ravaged voice around a number of original songs
that start with the protagonist on the run or in jail, but end with
regret and tears. ``Look for the one with watery eyes,'' he sings
in the title track. His covers of weepy country hit ``You Win
Again'' (by Hank Williams) and the Johnny Cash-identified ``Long
Black Veil'' are stunning.
</P>
<P>
   Ness once did a Cash song with Social Distortion, namely ``Ring
of Fire,'' but ``it had to be fast in order for us to pull it off.
I wanted to get away from those restrictions on this new record.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, though. Most of the record still rocks. Of
particular interest is his rockin' cover of Dylan's ``Don't Think
Twice,'' which has been earning airplay. ``I'm a big Dylan fan.
He's right up there with the Rolling Stones for me,'' says Ness.
</P>
<P>
   The Lynn, Mass. native grew up in Orange County, Calif. His dad
was into country and bluegrass, his mom into folk, and his uncles
were ``like greaser guys who turned me on to Rolling Stones records
. . . I heard all of that before I ever heard the Sex Pistols.''
</P>
<P>
   Ness pulled in some illustrious guests on his new disc _ Bruce
Springsteen and Brian Setzer. Springsteen sings backup and plays
some lead guitar on the gritty ``Misery Loves Company.'' Guitarist
Setzer embellishes ``Crime Don't Pay.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Springsteen: ``I met Bruce a couple of times in LA. He
told me he was a huge fan and that blew me away. I think he said in
a Rolling Stone magazine article that (Social Distortion's)
`Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell' was the best record of that
year. . . So when I asked him to join this solo project, he jumped
aboard with nothing but enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Setzer: ``I heard he liked my vibe and wanted to meet
me,'' says Ness. ``And then he came in, and we smoked a cigar, and
went out and played. It was like, `Wow, what an inspiring session
that was!' This was a rewarding record to make.''
</P>
<P>

   Fairbairn remembered: Bruce Fairbairn, who produced Aerosmith's
top-selling comeback albums ``Pump'' and ``Get a Grip,'' as well as
records for Bon Jovi, Van Halen, and AC/DC, was found dead Monday
in his Vancouver home. He was 49. He apparently died in his sleep,
but no official reason has been given.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an incredible guy,'' says Tim Collins, who managed
Aerosmith during the two albums that Fairbairn produced. ``He was
always cool, calm, collected. . . . And he danced really well
between the record company's desire for a hit, and the artistic
integrity of the creators.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairbairn made a lot of money during his career, Collins adds,
but ``he used to drive an old VW bus.'' His contract also
stipulated the need for free time at night ``so he could coach his
kids' soccer team. His family was his priority,'' added Collins.
Fairbairn had three sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music industry has lost a great one,'' says Collins.
</P>

   Ministry has a new album, ``Dark Side of the Spoon,'' due June
8, followed by a US tour in August. . . . Paul McCartney and Pink
Floyd guitarist David Gilmour jammed on a bunch of oldies (by Carl
Perkins and Gene Vincent, among others) for an album McCartney has
decided to release in July. It will also have two new McCartney
songs. . . . Richard Thompson releases a new CD, ``Mock tudor,''
Aug. 9.

FALL TV: NEW SHOWS BY THE SAME NAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great Fred Allen once said that ``Imitation is the sincerest
form of television.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, however, TV's most talented writer-producers won't
have to imitate anyone but themselves, because they will control a
huge and possibly unprecedented chunk of the prime-time schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen of the new shows unveiled to advertisers this
week are the creations of producers who already have shows on the
air. In other words, in a medium already starved for originality, a
handful of top producers will control nearly 20 hours of prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   They will wield that power because network programmers are
terrified of losing even more audience share by gambling on
unproven talent, especially with both production costs and the
failure rate of new shows higher than ever. When coupled with the
array of newsmagazines that gobble up the rest of prime time, this
concentration of TV entertainment power in the hands of a small
fraternity of producers makes it exceptionally difficult for a new
voice to break through on series television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Network executives have taken the programming Hippocratic
oath: First, do no harm,'' remarked John Rash, a senior vice
president at Campbell Mithun Esty of Minneapolis, which buys TV
time for advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When viewers were more loyal to network television, trying new
producers and writers was an easier task,'' added Rash, who
attended the networks' ``upfront'' presentation of the fall lineup
in New York this week. ``This year, the decisions generally have
been safe, with nothing that is going to transcend the medium and
go into the general consciousness in the way that `ER' has, or land
on the cover of Time magazine the way `Ally McBeal' did.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a breakthrough show is exactly what television
needs at this moment, according to Robert J. Thompson, director of
Syracuse University's Center for the Study of Popular Television.
``People keep complaining that we're seeing the same old stuff, and
network television is desperately in need of a new Great Idea,''
said Thompson. ``We're not going to get the next Great Idea by
giving contracts to the same people.''
</P>
<P>
   But in television, the bottom line is the bottom line. Whatever
the creative consequences, networks want to send reassuring signals
of stability to advertisers, who will be more apt to pony up big
money if brand names like John Wells of ``ER,'' Dick Wolf of ``Law
and Order,'' or Chris Carter of ``The X-Files'' are behind a new
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the shows are going to be of that kind of quality, that
would absolutely make it a little easier for advertisers to spend
their money,'' said Tracey Riener, an associate media director at
Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopoulos, a Boston advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's stability in the sense that the networks will probably
stick with their programs longer than they would with an unproven
producer,'' said Riener. ``There's not a lot of new here; the
impression during the upfront was status quo. But having proven
winners is better than having 20 new shows where you can't tell the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a track record has always been important in
television. Also, it cannot be denied that many of the established
voices who are creating the new shows _ Wells, Wolf, Carter, David
E. Kelley of ``The Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal,'' Aaron Sorkin of
``Sports Night'' _ have more than justified network confidence in
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is these guys have produced some of the finest
moments in the history of television,'' said Thompson. ``We're
definitely seeing a period where going for the auteur is the order
of the day. Kelley and (Steven) Bochco are the equivalent of
Hitchcock and John Ford in their time. Seeing what David Kelley has
been able to churn out in a brief career, it would be silly not to
give him a chance to see what else he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But who are the next Wolfs and Kelleys and Bochcos?'' he
asked. ``That is what the networks are perhaps not so successful
at.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some analysts question whether, given that the top
producers often write many of the scripts for their shows, they
will simply be spread too thin. That effect was seen on ``Frasier''
this year as its writer-producers were distracted by their efforts
on the disastrous ``Encore! Encore!'' In addition, there is the
issue of whether there will be enough diverse styles on television,
since the producers in question are all white males, or whether
they will become formulaic under the pressure of having to produce
so much.
</P>
<P>
   To Steven Stark, author of ``Glued to the Set,'' the reliance on
the same established producers to fill up the TV schedule
illustrates the supply-and-demand quandary created by the explosion
of new broadcast networks and cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened is the talent pool has been incredibly diluted
at a time when they have to create three times as many shows,''
said Stark. ``So they're trying to take the creative people they
know are good, and overtax them. What you end up with is a diluted
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the dominant writer-producers are gambling that
they can deliver another winner. John Wells, of NBC's ``ER,'' will
add two more dramas to the Peacock Network: a drama set inside the
White House and titled ``The West Wing,'' which will be written by
Aaron Sorkin (who scripted ``The American President'' before
creating ``Sports Night''), and ``Third Watch,'' a drama about New
York cops, paramedics, and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley will launch the detective drama ``Snoops'' on ABC and a
half-hour version of ``Ally McBeal'' on Fox while retaining
involvement in the hourlong version of ``Ally,'' CBS's ``Chicago
Hope,'' and ABC's ``The Practice. Chris Carter, creator of ``The
X-Files,'' will oversee his new creation, ``Harsh Realm,'' on Fox.

   LOTTERY-IMPACT (Orange, N.J.) _ With lottery machines as
prevalent as cash registers in 38 states and $35 billion bet on

The impact that state lotteries are having on communities around
the country has been a major focus of the National Gambling Impact
Study Commission, which is examining the social and economic
consequences of gambling. It is in communities like Orange where
the lottery is a dominant force and many poor and modest wage

HILLARY CLINTON CAN LOOK TO WOMEN IN NEW YORK TO BOOST SENATE BID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 23)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN and STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, accelerating
preparations for a likely Senate race in New York in 2000, is
counting on broad support from women voters to help her win the
seat held by retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is showcasing ties with prominent women in New York on
Monday during her ninth visit to the state since Jan. 1 as she lays
the groundwork for what is widely expected to be her announcement
in mid-June that she is forming an exploratory committee to raise
funds for her Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to reach a final decision during a Memorial
Day vacation with President Clinton and the couple's daughter
Chelsea at White Oak Plantation in Yulee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of an exploratory committee would enable the first
lady to raise funds to finance her campaign through private
contributions. Republicans have criticized her for traveling to New
York on Air Force planes at taxpayers' expense.
</P>
<P>
   One former senior White House adviser who remains close to
Clinton said she is ``nudging toward running. She's much closer
than I ever thought possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans two additional trips to the state in early June
and a politically-valuable trip to Israel later in the month.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is expected to seek the
Republican nomination for the Senate seat. New York Gov. George
Pataki has scheduled an announcement on Monday about his own
political future, sparking speculation that he also might seek the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   During her visit Monday, Clinton is expected to raise more than
$1 million at two fund raising events. She will appear at a $1,000
per person fund raiser for Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., the veteran
six-term House member who has vowed to seek the same Senate seat if
Clinton declines to run.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also will appear at an exclusive $10,000 per person
fundraiser at a private residence in Manhattan. The $500,000
expected to be raised there will go to the Democratic Senate
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also plans to take part in a book party honoring Matilda
Cuomo and her new book, ``The Person Who Changed My Life.'' Cuomo,
wife of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, asked Clinton to write
the forward for the book.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also is taking part in an awards gala at Lincoln
Center where the Americans for the Arts will honor her and two
prominent patrons of the arts _ Brooke Astor and Agnes Gund.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's multiple appearances with prominent women in New York
underscores her ongoing effort to highlight her commitment to
issues of concern to women voters, including child care for working
women, the role of women in society and strengthening public
education.
</P>
<P>
   William Schneider, a public opinion specialist at the American
Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., says Clinton is already
reaping a windfall from women voters in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who are Democrats and independents really have a reason
to vote for her,'' says Schneider. ``They want to make a statement
about how she has been wronged and support her effort to strike out
on her own.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider added: ``Supporting her sticks a thumb in the eye of
the Republican Congress, as if they're saying, `Take that, you
middle-aged, conservative old white men.'''
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show sizable support for the first lady in
a hypothetical Senate race against Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinnipiac College Poll completed April 20 shows Clinton
leading Giuliani among women by 17 percentage points _ 54 to 37
percent _ a margin that more than accounts for her eight percentage
point lead over Giuliani among all voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women always vote a little more for Democrats, but in
Hillary's case, it's not just the gap, it's a chasm,'' says Maurice
Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Mandel, director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at
Rutgers University in New Jersey, predicts that Clinton will
continue to benefit from an edge among women voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent anyone can predict anything in politics and
elections this far ahead, I'd have to say that if Hillary Clinton
runs for the Senate from New York, she will benefit from the gender
gap.''

<P>
   Women voters helped propel Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to
victory last fall over incumbent Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
Schumer won the votes of 59 percent of the women compared to
D'Amato's 40 percent share, more than accounting for the Democrat's
55 percent to 45 percent victory over D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Women exceed men in New York not just in voting registration,
but also in actually turning out to vote. According to a U.S.
Census Bureau survey taken after the 1996 election, 52.3 percent of
those who voted in 1996 were women.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Malcolm, president of Emily's List which raises money and
bankrolls pro-abortion women running as Democrats, says her network
will support Clinton in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm says a Clinton-Giuliani race would be decided in the
suburbs where independent minded so-called ``soccer Moms'' are
often the deciding factor in close races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary will do better upstate than Democrats usually do, and
Giuliani will do better in (New York City) than Republicans usually
do,'' Malcolm said. ``So the battle will be in suburbia, among
suburban women.''
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine DeAngelo, president of the New York State Federation
of Republican Women, said Clinton may be underestimating the
pitfalls of a New York candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think that just because she's a woman, she's got all the
woman in New York state behind her,'' DeAngelo said. ``I think
she'll be in for a big fight,''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, echoed the sentiment: ``The best day
(Clinton) has will be the day before she announces.''

<P>
   In addition to formation of the exploratory committee, Clinton
plans to continue her efforts to forge close ties with the main
Democratic constituencies that she would rely upon in a Senate
race. The first lady plans a trip to Israel in June to become the
first member of the first family to meet in Israel with
newly-elected Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been working for months to ease the concerns of some
Jewish Americans who expressed worry over her remarks at a meeting
in Davos, Switzerland, last year when she voiced support for an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Democrat with ties to the party organization said
Clinton has spent hours on the telephone with Democratic county
chairman and other local Democrats and has contacted more than 100
prominent Democrats. Those names were suggested to her by Moynihan,
Democratic state party leader Judith Hope and Harold Ickes, the

   GEORGIA SCHOOL SHOOTINGSHOOT-MAIN _ CONYERS, Ga. _ Main folo
from the courts, cops, hospital and families and students on
Thursday's Conyers, Ga., school shooting that left six students
wounded. This will wrap up the loose ends from Thursday. If suspect
gets a lawyer, etc. (Staff/Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40. WITH

<P>
   SHOOT-PERP _ CONYERS, Ga. _ More on the suspect. Attitude in
neighborhood about suspect, about media attention and cops
searching the house down the street. Can we find a minister or
other confidant who has talked to parents or suspect since
shooting? (McDonald/Simpson/Sanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   SHOOT-LAW _ CONYERS, Ga. _ The legal outlook for the 15-year-old
suspect. Does he have a lawyer trying to keep the case in juvenile
court? Does defendant even have a say in that, or is it all up to
DA and judge? What are the range of charges available in this case
or cases like it? What's criteria for move to adult court? What are
maximum penalties in adult vs. juvenile? If possible, pin down
whether any juvenile trial would be open to public. (George
Edmonson got confusing advice on this from lawyers last night.)
Need some juvenile lawyers, maybe public defenders, child justice
advocates. A little perspective on Legislature's moves in recent
years to push more cases into adult court and punish youthful
offenders. Also need to explore for this story or another if there
is any possible charges against parents for either giving the guns
or making them available. (Croft/McDonald, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   SHOOT-HEROES _ CONYERS, Ga. _ More on assistant principal,
teachers (maybe a dad) who talked the suspect into surrendering).
Recreate the scene. (Stafford/Towns, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

get from the Web. (Roughton, Cox News Service).

   WASHINGTONCUBA-JURAGUA _ MIAMI _Cuba and Russia have announced a
deal to resume construction of the long-stalled Juragua nuclear
power plant in Cuba, reviving U.S. concerns over safety. Pentagon
officials already have shelled out $2 million this year to
establish several radiation-monitoring stations around Florida in
case Juragua is finished and has an accident. But many experts,
including a University of Georgia professor writing a book about
the Juragua project, say the two countries simply don't have the
money needed to complete the project. They say the project is
almost beyond the point of rescue. (Emling, Cox News Service). 30.

   READINESS _ WASHINGTON _ In the latest sign of declining
military readiness, a new government study says that a lack of
spare parts has grounded planes and cost $64 million for the
labor-intensive work of cannibalizing parts from other aircraft.
Pilots are flying only 83 percent of their required training hours.

   OLY-RECORDS _ ATLANTA _ Concern over the open records issue is
hitting the state university system, propelled by the board of
regents who are warning university foundations that their donor
lists are subject to inspection under the new Open Records Act. The
regents fear that if donor lists are made public, people will be
disinclined to donate. Trying to determine if this is related to
open records battle between GAAF and AJC. (Turner, Atlanta

   HOLYFIELD-DIVORCE _ Janice Holyfield testified Friday that she
and her estranged husband, heavyweight champ Evander Holyfield,
have had sexual relations four times since he filed for divorce two
months ago. But a Fayette County Superior Court judge says that not
reason enough to dismiss the divorce action. The champ, by the way,
says he can't remember. Also coming out of today's hearing were a

<P>
   SCHOOL-PRAY _ The federal appeals court ruling this week against
student-led ``messages'' at graduation in Jacksonville, Fla., flies
in the face of growing public sentiment for greater moral emphasis
in schools threatened by student violence, say some First Amendment
experts. Atlanta's 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the
messages are unconstitutional attempts to sanction school prayer,
but officials in the sprawling Jacksonville district seem
determined to keep up their fight. We use their decision to take
the case to the U.S. Supreme Court as a peg for a close look at the
current status of the school prayer issue, which continues to crop
up in districts across the country. (MWilliams, Atanta
Journal-Constitution).

   POW-GONZALEZ-VISIT _ Former POW Stephen Gonzalez is expected to
visit the Legislature today to continue his hero's welcome tour
after being (backslash)released by the Yugoslavian army. If we get
a chance, we'll ask if he sees any irony in this adulation for
doing something wrong in the first place. (Austin
American-Statesman).

<P>
   DUKES-LOTTTEY _ The former wife of Georgia's biggest lotto
winner, Kenny Dukes, is expected to file a motion Friday to set
aside their divorce, granted shortly before he picked up his share
of the $31 million jackpot. Although Dukes, of Midway, learned he
had won several months earlier, he waited until his divorce from
Sherri Lynn Barber Dukes of Brunswick was final to claim his prize,
a $16 million cash payout. Bob Crowe, attorney for Sherri Dukes,
said Georgia is a community property state and his client is
entitled to half of of her ex-husband's winnings because they were
legally married when he won. (Davis, Atlanta Journal

   LOTTO _ A problem you'd love to have _ not getting your Florida
Lottery winnings in a lump sum _ isn't really a problem anymore.
Gov. Jeb Bush signed a bill last week making Florida the 19th state

third-party investors for the entire jackpot in cash. (Owers, Palm

ZEDILLO TOUTS TRADE RELATIONS IN CALIFORNIA VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo earned a
doctorate in economics at Yale, where he argued that Mexico's
staggering national debt was the result of government
irresponsibility. A former banker and financial bureaucrat, the
bespectacled Zedillo appears most at ease citing trade statistics
and unemployment figures.
</P>
<P>
   Economics is his life.
</P>
<P>
   So while journalists and demonstrators wanted to ask Zedillo
about immigration policy during his visit to California this week,
the Mexican president and California Gov. Gray Davis have focused
most of their attention on strengthening their trade relationship
after eight years of strained relations under former Gov. Pete
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade between California and Mexico has increased 17 percent
each year, even when our political leaders were not talking to each
other,'' Zedillo told business and political leaders Wednesday in
Los Angeles. ``Think what would have happened if we had been on
speaking terms. Seventeen percent is very little _ we can do much
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo and Davis, a Democrat, announced several trade-related
ventures, including the opening of a new Mattel Inc. toy factory in
Monterrey, Mexico. The California company plans to invest $30
million in the new factory, which is scheduled to open in November.
It will employ 2,500 Mexicans, displacing the company's current
factory in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also announced the state would set up 15 California-based
Mexican Trade Centers at community colleges around the state. The
trade centers will offer intensive 5-day seminars on how to do
business in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   These gestures were small. Like the announcement two months ago
that the Mexican state telephone company would open a field office
in San Diego, the Mattel factory opening was in the works well
before Davis was inaugurated in January.
</P>
<P>
   But both Zedillo and Davis said the real focus should be on the
potential markets. California sells about $13.3 billion a year in
electronics and computers to Mexico every year.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo has been continually assuring California audiences that
he is making economic and social reforms in Mexico, where 100
million people still struggle with poverty and produce a relatively
small $335 billion in goods and services, compared to California's
$1 trillion economy with 33 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future,'' Davis told Spanish-language TV, ``California
and Mexico will be one nation state, just like the mayors of
Tijuana and San Diego consider that region to be one area.''
</P>
<P>
   While Zedillo said he looks at the lost opportunities during the
Wilson administration, not what got accomplished, others saw trade
between California and Mexico double under the Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the rhetoric was, whatever the political situation,
the true reality is that trade relations were never better under
Governor Wilson,'' said Rosario Marin, a former Wilson aide.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo made his first trip to the heart of California's
Hispanic community Wednesday, but he stayed mostly out of reach of
Hispanic immigrants and Mexican workers who live here. The trip was
more about the friendship between Zedillo, Davis and Hispanic
leaders in California who have for years been ignored by the
Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, the son of a construction foreman and movie house candy
vendor, still owns a home just five blocks from the California
border, where he grew up attending public schools and selling cans
to help his family.
</P>
<P>
   A noted movie buff, Zedillo spoke of feeling immense pride when
director James Cameron opened the movie ``Titanic'' in Mexico City
a week after the New York premiere, and thanked the Mexican people
for their help on the picture. The epic movie was filmed in Baja,
and many of the sets were built by Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said he wanted to see more partnerships like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economics is very important,'' Zedillo said, ``but it's not
everything. The other good reason I am here is because I want
Californians and Mexicans to communicate with each other, to
understand each other in friendly ways.''

 By PAUL KEEGAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Hiro's on a rampage. He's a vaguely Asian crusader with giant
muscles bursting through an armored torso, but since you're
watching the world through his eyes, all you see is his Ion Blaster
gun and dungeon floors and walls hurtling by so fast your stomach
somersaults into your throat.
 &HT;    Whoa, look out! It's Superfly Johnson _ Hiro's gargantuan bald
and black nemesis _ streaking by, blasting away with his Sidewinder
gun.
 &HT;    Hiro leaps to avoid the rocket-powered missiles, then pivots and
fires. Green laser beams ricochet off the fortress walls, exploding
like fireworks.
 &HT;    Superfly's fragged! Body parts drop from the sky like bloody
rain, gibs splattering the walls _ and if you don't know that's
short for ``giblets,'' slang for chunks of flesh, then you're a
llama, a newbie loser, and shouldn't be hanging around Kyoto 2455
A.D. in the first place.
 &HT;    ``Ha! Take that, dude!'' John Romero sits at his computer,
chortling. A colleague curses from another room.
 &HT;    It's early March, before anyone has ever heard of Littleton,
Colo., and the co-creator of the computer games Doom and Quake is
showing off his new gorefest, Daikatana. As Hiro, he has just
fragged a co-worker playing Superfly Johnson in a ``death match,''
a battle via linked computers.
 &HT;    ``That's cool, huh?'' Romero says. ``You can see how much more
visceral this game is.''
 &HT;    Romero is 31, with long, silky black hair. He wears tight
designer jeans and a black T-shirt. It was Romero, along with a
programming genius, John Carmack, who revolutionized the
computer-games industry in the mid-'90s with the seminal
shoot-'em-ups Doom and Quake, two of the biggest sellers of all
time. The pair made millions, bought several Ferraris each and
turned Dallas into the blood-and-guts capital of their industry.
 &HT;    Though they have since broken up in a spat over precisely what
makes a computer game cool, to hard-core fans they are still gods _
``the Paul McCartney and John Lennon of our business,'' says a
Dallas game developer who insists on being identified only as
Levelord.
 &HT;    Then the nation was suddenly confronted with the image of Eric
Harris and Dylan Klebold, both avid Doom fans, rampaging through
the halls of Columbine High with an arsenal of deadly weapons and
laughing at the ``gibs.'' For the mass-market audience that
developers like Romero have always coveted, the connection was hard
to miss.
 &HT;    Video and computer games had been criticized for violent content
before, but what happened at Columbine High instantly gave the
industry term for this relatively small game genre _ ``first-person
shooter'' _ ominous new resonance.
 &HT;    The same qualities that made Doom and Quake so
adrenaline-pumping, so unlike any other form of violent media, now
made them a primary target of outrage. These games plunge you into
a three-dimensional world where you must kill to survive, whether
your opponents are controlled by the computer or by real-life
rivals.
 &HT;    Romero refuses to talk now about the events in Littleton, but
when he sat fragging Superfly Johnson into bloody chunks, it seemed
that nothing could threaten this world he'd created. With a severed
head rolling one way and a rib-sprouting torso bouncing another, he
was perfectly candid when asked if he was concerned about criticism
of game violence.
 &HT;    ``I'm the one who made this stuff _ why would I care about
that?'' he said, not looking up from the screen. ``I make games I
want to play. If I want to see more gibs, I make it. If people
don't like it, they don't need to play the game.''
 &HT;    Shortly after Romero split up with Carmack and left their
company, Id Software, he scored a $25 million advance in 1996 from
Eidos Interactive, a London-based game publisher. Romero
immediately plunged $2 million into renovating the glass-bubble
penthouse floor of the Texas Commerce Tower, one of the most
prestigious office addresses in Dallas.
 &HT;    Today, oilmen who worked their whole lives to get into the
Petroleum Club on the 40th floor find themselves sharing the
elevators with the '90s version of Texas wildcatters _ techie
20-somethings wearing nose rings and cutoff shorts.
 &HT;    Ion Storm is an astonishing place, like something out of a
``Jetsons'' cartoon _ with walkways suspended above a maze of
stainless-steel cubicles, wall lighting embedded in marble sconces,
glass cases filled with models of one-eyed monsters, the whole
enterprise wrapped in clouds and sky.
 &HT;    It bustles with 88 employees, including screenwriters and
producers, developing three games at once and making plans to
branch into movies, action figures, comic books and clothes. There
are leather couches and giant projection screens, a locker room
with showers, Ping-Pong and pool tables, a million-dollar recording
studio for making game soundtracks and a special area for
death-matching that's linked to 16 television sets in a nearby
spectators' lounge. And, of course, all the junk food you can eat.
 &HT;    It's a dream clubhouse for game freaks, the kind Romero could
have only imagined as a kid drawing violent cartoons of
superheroes, hanging out in the video arcades and flunking his
classes.
 &HT;    While growing up in Tucson, Ariz., and Rocklin, Calif., Romero
was pretty much left to whatever engaged his imagination _ until,
Romero says, his angry stepfather, a retired military officer named
John Schuneman, crept up behind him while he was playing an arcade
game and smashed his face into the glass.
 &HT;    One of Romero's recurring cartoon characters was Melvin, a
crew-cut kid who was always getting blown away by his dad. Then
Schuneman noticed his stepson's fascination with computers and
bought him an Apple II+. Romero became a brilliant programmer, with
no interest in anything besides making games, and eventually made
his stepfather proud.
 &HT;    After high school, he bounced around several game companies
before landing a job at Softdisk in Shreveport, La. There he hooked
up with Carmack, a teen-age prodigy from Kansas City. In 1991, the
two split off to found Id Software and moved to Dallas to form a
partnership with Apogee Software, a company pioneering the use of
the Internet for distribution, instead of merely relying on floppy
disks sold in stores or through the mail.
 &HT;    Their first game, Wolfenstein 3-D, is considered the original
first-person shooter, letting players shoot Nazis in dungeons
adorned with swastikas and pictures of Adolf Hitler. It was an
instant smash, bringing in about $120,000 a month in sales.
 &HT;    ``Everybody thought it was awesome,'' Romero recalls. ``But when
we started playing, it was like, 'We have to have more blood, more
violence in there.' It seemed real, but we needed to show the guys
dying.' ''
 &HT;    Their next game, Doom, had a seismic impact on the computer-game
industry when it was released in 1993, just as the Internet was
coming of age.
 &HT;    Id's marketing was brilliant. You could download the first
stages or ``levels'' of Doom free. But once addicted, you couldn't
get the whole game unless you forked over a credit card number. So
many people tried to download Doom that it crashed the computer
system at the University of Wisconsin, on which it was posted.
 &HT;    By now, Doom and Doom II have sold about 2.7 million copies in
the United States, over the Internet or through retail stores (as
most software is distributed). Though it's impossible to know for
sure how many free copies of the opening levels were downloaded
worldwide, some estimates range as high as 20 million.
 &HT;    ``Nobody had ever seen anything as cool as Doom,'' Romero says.
``The music, the sound effects, how scary it was, the attitude,
weapons balance, everything was perfect about that game.''
 &HT;    But even as Doom and its successor, Quake, became wildly
successful, a fundamental disagreement erupted between their
creators about what made a computer game great. Was it Carmack's
specialty, the programming advances that allowed for increasingly
fast and realistic play? Or the cooler stories, weapons and
monsters that Romero dreamed up?
 &HT;    ``You don't watch a movie because it's 35 millimeters or 70
millimeters,'' Romero says. ``It's the idea of the movie.'' That
was when Romero started to succumb to what Carmack calls
``rock-star stuff'' _ maneuvering for fame instead of working hard
(a charge Romero denies).
 &HT;    As nerves frayed, there wasn't much question about which one
would have to go. Doom was a huge hit not because of its ``plot'' _
something about a marine stationed on a moon base that was so lame
that even people at Id can't recall how it goes _ or even the scary
creatures and artsy backdrops.
 &HT;    The key was Carmack's magnificent software, the ``engines'' _
the underlying operating systems that take full advantage of
increasing computer power and made him a programming cult figure.
Romero was handed his resignation and asked to sign it in 1996 _
though with characteristic bravado he says he planned to leave
anyway to start his own shop.
 &HT;    While Romero has yet to earn a penny through Ion Storm, Id's
revenues in 1997, the year Quake II came out, were $28 million, a
staggering $2 million per employee. With only small overhead _
mostly salaries and computers _ fully 80 percent of that is profit.
 &HT;    For Romero's next venture, Daikatana, he has actually had to
license Carmack's technology. In fact, one of the things that held
up the game, now scheduled to reach stores this winter, was the
wait for Carmack to release his latest engine. Why that's important
becomes clear when you sit down to play.
 &HT;    Sitting at a computer at Ion Storm, Romero expertly leads a
visitor through Doom, and at first it's hard to understand what all
the fuss is about _ fuzzy figures attacking, a crude pistol firing,
splotches of red appearing on falling bodies.
 &HT;    Then he starts playing Quake I and II, the next stops in his
historic tour of the first-person shooter. The ``story'' doesn't
change much, but as Romero moves through 1996 and 1997 the games
gradually enter new dimensions of realism. You can see Carmack's
programs becoming more sophisticated and taking advantage of the
soaring processing speed of computers and powerful 3-D
graphics-accelerator cards.
 &HT;    By the time Romero reaches Daikatana, the illusion is truly
remarkable. Physical reality suggests that you are sitting in a
chair operating a mouse and keyboard. But with the computer screen
replacing your field of vision, you believe you're actually
creeping around a corner, causing your breath to shorten. Afraid an
enemy is lying in wait, you feel your pulse quicken. When the
monster jumps out, real adrenaline roars through your body.
 &HT;    And few things in life are more exhilarating than spinning
around and blowing the thing to kingdom come, the flying gibs so
lifelike you can almost feel wet blood. Hurtling through the 3-D
environment can give even serious gamers motion sickness.
 &HT;    The technology pioneered by Carmack's shooters has spread to
other genres, and in recent years Doom and Quake have been passed
on the all-time best-seller list by titles like Myst, which takes
you on peaceful adventures to exotic places. Other games allow you
to build cities, simulate flying and play a big-league sport.
 &HT;    Still, it's telling that the first thing Americans wanted to do
upon discovering this remarkable new virtual world was start
shooting up the place.
 &HT;    Shortly after Littleton, a military expert appeared on ``60
Minutes'' calling shooter games ``a how-to manual for killing
without a conscience''; politicians howled, and then came the
lawyers. Last month Id Software was among 24 entertainment
companies named in a $130 million lawsuit by the families of three
victims killed in last year's school shooting in West Paducah, Ky.
It turns out that the 14-year-old gunman in that case, Michael
Carneal, also loved Doom.
 &HT;    Before Littleton, such talk sounded ludicrous. How could
clicking a mouse possibly help someone fire a real gun any more
accurately?
 &HT;    But shooter developers _ like the media that lionizes them one
minute and demonizes their games the next _ want to have it both
ways.
 &HT;    Most refuse to address questions linking games to the real
world, but even as he shows off his wares for a reporter, Romero
himself points out that the Marines have used a version of Doom for
training troops how to kill: ``They made a special version, an
add-on, so that soldiers played Doom to feel like they were in a
war situation, where you have one-shot kills.''
 &HT;    The ``one-shot kills'' argument is precisely the one made by Lt.
Col. David Grossman, the point man in the effort to blame computer
games for Littleton. Grossman teaches courses on the psychology of
killing to Green Berets and federal agents and has been hired as an
expert witness by the parents of the three girls killed in the West
Paducah shooting.
 &HT;    Not only do games like Doom and Quake help people overcome what
he calls the natural human reticence to murder, Grossman maintains,
they also counter the natural instinct for neophyte hunters and
soldiers to shoot repeatedly until a target drops.
 &HT;    The Kentucky teen-ager Carneal, he argues, followed the
computer-game pattern of moving quickly from one target to another,
with an emphasis on head shots. Though he'd never fired a gun
before, the teen-ager hit eight people with eight bullets, five to
the head and three to the upper torso.
 &HT;    And that's what makes shooters unlike any other form of media
violence we've ever seen before. You're not just watching a movie,
you're in the movie. You're not just empathizing with Arnold
Schwarzenegger as he blasts the bad guy to smithereens, you're
actually pulling the trigger.
 &HT;    Unlike a movie, this three-dimensional world has a peculiar
logic and set of rules that can be entertaining for hours on end.
Getting killed is a drag because suddenly the game stops, and the
only way to remain master of this intoxicating new universe is to
kill. How that translates to the real world varies according to the
individual playing the game.
 &HT;    For his part, Romero is pulling all-nighters to finish
Daikatana, the game that could confirm or destroy his legendary
reputation. It was originally scheduled to compete against
Carmack's Quake II during Christmas of 1997 but has been delayed so
many times that Romero is becoming the subject of ridicule in the
gaming press.
 &HT;    Now the consensus is that he'll be lucky to get it out by this
Christmas, two years behind schedule. Even his publicity agent,
Heidi Davis, says: ``The feeling out there is: 'OK, we've been
reading about John Romero. Where's the game?' ``
 &HT;    Romero is fed up with the criticism. Daikatana will give fans an
``awesome'' ride through 4,485 years of human history, he says,
armed with more weapons of annihilation that will destroy more
monsters than ever before. ``Nobody's made one like this before,''
he says, ``and I doubt that anyone's ever going to try to make
something this big again.''
 &HT;    In other words, for the shooter-game community, nothing has
changed since Littleton.

environment can give even serious gamers motion sickness.
 &HT;    The technology pioneered by Carmack's shooters has spread to
other genres, and in recent years Doom and Quake have been passed
on the all-time best-seller list by titles like Myst, which takes
you on peaceful adventures to exotic places. Other games allow you
to build cities, simulate flying and play a big-league sport.
 &HT;    Still, it's telling that the first thing Americans wanted to do
upon discovering this remarkable new virtual world was start
shooting up the place.
 &HT;    Shortly after Littleton, a military expert appeared on ``60
Minutes'' calling shooter games ``a how-to manual for killing
without a conscience''; politicians howled, and then came the
lawyers. Last month Id Software was among 24 entertainment
companies named in a $130 million lawsuit by the families of three
victims killed in last year's school shooting in West Paducah, Ky.
It turns out that the 14-year-old gunman in that case, Michael
Carneal, also loved Doom.
 &HT;    Before Littleton, such talk sounded ludicrous. How could
clicking a mouse possibly help someone fire a real gun any more
accurately?
 &HT;    But shooter developers _ like the media that lionizes them one
minute and demonizes their games the next _ want to have it both
ways.
 &HT;    Most refuse to address questions linking games to the real
world, but even as he shows off his wares for a reporter, Romero
himself points out that the Marines have used a version of Doom for
training troops how to kill: ``They made a special version, an
add-on, so that soldiers played Doom to feel like they were in a
war situation, where you have one-shot kills.''
 &HT;    The ``one-shot kills'' argument is precisely the one made by Lt.
Col. David Grossman, the point man in the effort to blame computer
games for Littleton. Grossman teaches courses on the psychology of
killing to Green Berets and federal agents and has been hired as an
expert witness by the parents of the three girls killed in the West
Paducah shooting.
 &HT;    Not only do games like Doom and Quake help people overcome what
he calls the natural human reticence to murder, Grossman maintains,
they also counter the natural instinct for neophyte hunters and
soldiers to shoot repeatedly until a target drops.
 &HT;    The Kentucky teen-ager Carneal, he argues, followed the
computer-game pattern of moving quickly from one target to another,
with an emphasis on head shots. Though he'd never fired a gun
before, the teen-ager hit eight people with eight bullets, five to
the head and three to the upper torso.
 &HT;    And that's what makes shooters unlike any other form of media
violence we've ever seen before. You're not just watching a movie,
you're in the movie. You're not just empathizing with Arnold
Schwarzenegger as he blasts the bad guy to smithereens, you're
actually pulling the trigger.
 &HT;    Unlike a movie, this three-dimensional world has a peculiar
logic and set of rules that can be entertaining for hours on end.
Getting killed is a drag because suddenly the game stops, and the
only way to remain master of this intoxicating new universe is to
kill. How that translates to the real world varies according to the
individual playing the game.
 &HT;    For his part, Romero is pulling all-nighters to finish
Daikatana, the game that could confirm or destroy his legendary
reputation. It was originally scheduled to compete against
Carmack's Quake II during Christmas of 1997 but has been delayed so
many times that Romero is becoming the subject of ridicule in the
gaming press.
 &HT;    Now the consensus is that he'll be lucky to get it out by this
Christmas, two years behind schedule. Even his publicity agent,
Heidi Davis, says: ``The feeling out there is: 'OK, we've been
reading about John Romero. Where's the game?' ``
 &HT;    Romero is fed up with the criticism. Daikatana will give fans an
``awesome'' ride through 4,485 years of human history, he says,
armed with more weapons of annihilation that will destroy more
monsters than ever before. ``Nobody's made one like this before,''
he says, ``and I doubt that anyone's ever going to try to make
something this big again.''
 &HT;    In other words, for the shooter-game community, nothing has
changed since Littleton.

</P>
<P>
   The centers in 20 camps in Albania will provide education,
sports and other aspects of childhood which have been missing. The
children also receive psychological counselling about their
traumatic experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them have seen relations and neighbors killed and have
been chased out of their homes which have been burned behind them.
Some had seen their mothers and sisters raped.
</P>
<P>
   Child-Friendly Spaces will not only attempt to give structure to
the lives of the children, but also protection.
</P>
<P>
   There have been persistent reports of teenage girls being lured
or abducted into prostitution from the camps, boys becoming
enmeshed in criminality and others who want to become boy soldiers
and go and fight in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the program 3,000 prepacked schools are being flown
into Albania. The scheme has the backing of NATO and will be
overseen by the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
   Atdhetare, which means ``love of homeland'' in Albania, was
treated for bronchitis and diarrhea and placed with the Misini
family, of 17 children and 18 adults, themselves refugees. But the
search to find their natural parents had not so far been
successful.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was terrified of large vehicles and men in uniforms,
trembling and crying. But with the efforts of the UNICEF
counsellors she appears to be slowly recovering from the worst of
her nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   The counsellors come across evidence of the childrens' harrowing
experiences every day.
</P>
<P>
   One nine-year-old boy, who, asked to portray his home,
repeatedly sketched a rug. At first he would not say why, but
eventually burst into tears and told how the family were forced to
move home 17 times and the only thing left from the original home
was the rug which he had faithfully rolled up and taken with him
through his travels.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the case of the 14-year-old girl who lay in a
fetal position for two weeks and would not talk. She too has
recovered to an extent after counselling.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Cohen, of UNICEF, said: ``It takes a while to draw these
children out. When we first start working with them they tell the
same kind of stories and same kinds of drawings the children make
everywhere in the world _ fairy tales and nursery rhymes, pretty
houses, trees and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   But once they begin to unburden themselves in the drawings the
houses catch fire, there are dead bodies among the flowers and the
stories are no longer fairy tales but of people killing and
burning.
</P>
<P>
   These children have been through often unimaginable experiences,
but they are astonishingly resilient and hopefully most will
recover.'' &QL;

<P>
   Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic Thursday tightened the
noose on Montenegro, the smaller Yugoslav republic which has
repeatedly been at odds with Belgrade. The republic is slipping
constantly closer towards war.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army set up checkpoints at all Montenegro's main
border crossings. ``It's getting worse. They want to throttle us,''
one government official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrin president, Milo Djukanovic, warned that there
should be no ``dual power.'' But such dual power _ where government
forces and the army argue it out between themselves _ is exactly
what Montenegro now faces.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic accused ``top Yugoslav army officers'' in the
republic of wanting to serve ``the dictatorship in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in Montenegro fear that a coup is just around the corner _
a coup which would almost certainly be followed by civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrin television showed army bunkers with newly set up
machine-gun positions at checkpoints along the coastal road towards
the border with Croatia. The deputy prime minister, Dragisa Burzan,
travelled to the coastal town of Herceg Novi to try to negotiate
the removal of the army roadblocks, but without apparent success.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials also said that tanks and heavy artillery
are now positioned around the town of Cetinje. Hundreds of soldiers
have moved in recent days into the town, the old Montenegrin royal
capital and a heartland of Montenegrin nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Cetinje has been virtually an army-free zone,
apparently because the troops were still wary of provoking head-on
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the Cetinjans are determined not to be cowed. What was
officially described as a ``fairly tense situation'' arose when
Yugoslav soldiers demanded rooms in a hotel in the town, only to be
told that none were available.
</P>
<P>
   Miodrag Vukovic, a presidential adviser, warned of the ``tragic
fate'' now facing Montenegro, especially in view of the ``new media
and political campaign'' launched by Serbia against Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   From the Montenegrin point of view, the pattern is nightmarishly
clear. On the one hand, their independent standpoint cannot be
tolerated by Belgrade. On the other hand, further conflict in
Montenegro might help to distract Serbs from rebelling against
their own government.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Independent this month, President
Djukanovic made it clear that Montenegro would certainly seek to
break away from Serbia if, as seems increasingly likely, Milosevic
remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   In those circumstances, he said, a single Yugoslav federation
was ``not feasible.'' Djukanovic acknowledged that such a breakaway
would almost certainly be accompanied by civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro was an independent kingdom before union with Serbia
in 1918.
</P>
<P>
   The army this week turned back an Italian truck of humanitarian
aid, after confiscating the aid itself. Two truckloads of French
medical and food aid were confiscated over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The current tensions may recede again in the next few days, for
the moment at least. But none of the underlying difficulties seem
likely to be solved.
</P>
<P>
   Control over Montenegro's borders has in recent weeks been
ambivalent, at best. The Montenegrin government seeks to allow
foreigners into the country. But the army does not recognize the
government's authority to issue entry papers.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrin government has tried hard to remain uninvolved
in the war with NATO. For Belgrade, this merely compounds the
Montenegrins' offense. The Montenegrins are now accused of
``treachery.'' &QL;

   From the Montenegrin point of view, the pattern is nightmarishly
clear. On the one hand, their independent standpoint cannot be
tolerated by Belgrade. On the other hand, further conflict in
Montenegro might help to distract Serbs from rebelling against
their own government.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Independent this month, President
Djukanovic made it clear that Montenegro would certainly seek to
break away from Serbia if, as seems increasingly likely, Milosevic
remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   In those circumstances, he said, a single Yugoslav federation
was ``not feasible.'' Djukanovic acknowledged that such a breakaway
would almost certainly be accompanied by civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro was an independent kingdom before union with Serbia
in 1918.
</P>
<P>
   The army this week turned back an Italian truck of humanitarian
aid, after confiscating the aid itself. Two truckloads of French
medical and food aid were confiscated over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The current tensions may recede again in the next few days, for
the moment at least. But none of the underlying difficulties seem
likely to be solved.
</P>
<P>
   Control over Montenegro's borders has in recent weeks been
ambivalent, at best. The Montenegrin government seeks to allow
foreigners into the country. But the army does not recognize the
government's authority to issue entry papers.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrin government has tried hard to remain uninvolved
in the war with NATO. For Belgrade, this merely compounds the
Montenegrins' offense. The Montenegrins are now accused of
``treachery.'' &QL;

   TIRANA _ NATO's reluctance to send in ground forces against the
Serbs is creating a sense of foreboding among the Kosovar
Liberation Army, who fear they will be let down.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters in the organization report a mood of creeping pessimism
and worries that the West's desire to avoid a land war may lead to
a compromise peace deal falling far short of an independent Kosovo,
or even a NATO protectorate. Instead it may end up by leaving
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic with powers to interfere.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA leadership is grateful to British Prime Minister Tony
Blair for his much more hawkish views, compared to some of the
other Allied leaders. But they are anxious that voices such as that
of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder may encourage U.S. President
Bill Clinton to stiffen his antipathy to a ground campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At a private meeting with KLA leaders on Tuesday Blair is
believed to have stated NATO's commitment to extracting Kosovo from
Milosevic's grasp.
</P>
<P>
   But as one KLA senior official said: ``His country (Britain)
can't fight the war on its own. The Prime Minister was told that
the KLA is growing stronger all the time and NATO must not back
down now. We hope our alliance with the West will continue to grow
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also signs of friction with the West over the
relocation of refugees from the Kosovar-Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations High Commission for Refugees wants to move
tens of thousands of exiled Kosovars from the border region around
Kukes to the south because of the dangers posed by the coming
winter and a possibility of Serbian artillery attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Many KLA senior commanders oppose the scheme. They claim this
will make hinder a rapid return of the refugees to Kosovo after the
Serbs have been expelled. It also damages their ability to draw
from pools of recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Although the KLA leadership denies it sanctions these actions,
the U.N. says families who agreed to move south have suddenly
changed their minds after visits from local KLA members.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA position is that if NATO does not want to send land
forces to Kosovo it should arm the guerrillas with heavy weapons.
Lack of fire power compared to the Serbs is one of the major
problems. However, there is still no sign that NATO is prepared to
do this.
</P>
<P>
   The precise state of the KLA is a matter of debate. There is
little doubt that some outside supplies are getting through to the
guerrillas. But many doubt that the rebels have inflicted much
damage on the Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   According to some intelligence estimates, the KLA has fewer than
4,000 fighters inside the province, locked into small enclaves,
while the bulk of the 20,000 force are now in Albania hoping and
waiting for a NATO ground attack.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the KLA that is increasingly disappointed at the
procrastination of the West. Kosovar exiles in Albania say if NATO
fails to invade, the Milosevic regime will remain in power and it
will be unsafe for them ever to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Imrahim Bekir, a 48-year-old office worker from near Pristina,
now living in Albania, last saw his 17-year-old son when he was led
off at gunpoint by Serbian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   He said Thursday: ``We have endured our suffering in the belief
that one day we shall return home. Even if my son had been killed
maybe I can find his grave and give him a proper burial. But this
will not happen unless NATO goes in and fights the Serbs. Why are
some of their leaders saying they don't want to do this?''
</P>
<P>
   His friend Murad added: ``We know that people in Djakova are now
starving. They are hiding in the countryside without food. These
include members of my family I don't know how many of them are
alive now, but if NATO does not go into Kosovo all of them will
probably die.'' &QL;

   BRUSSELS _ More than two-thirds of Serbia's tanks and heavy
artillery inside Kosovo are still intact, NATO admitted Wednesday,
raising the prospect of many weeks of further bombardment before
the military capacity of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic is
rendered ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Despite greater success in the last two weeks of the air
campaign and reports of discipline beginning to disintegrate, NATO
concedes that the Serbs still have a formidable fighting force left
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After 57 days of concerted bombing an estimated total of 40,000
troops and paramilitaries remain in the province with 69 percent of
their tanks and heavy equipment intact.
</P>
<P>
   Even these figures are open to doubt because NATO's military
spokesman, General Walter Jertz, said Wednesday that the alliance
had ``struck'' _ rather than destroyed _ 31 percent of Serbia's
heavy forces, a nuance which means there is no evidence of
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics illustrate the distance NATO is from launching a
successful ground invasion of Kosovo, even if it could muster the
political will to assemble one.
</P>
<P>
   NATO would suffer ``enormous'' casualties, one source said _ in
addition to the suffering that would be inflicted on ethnic
Albanians inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At the current rate of destruction _ 5 percent a week _ the
allies would need to bomb for another month before Serb forces
could be close to breaking point. But there is some doubt as to
whether NATO's existing rate of destruction inside Kosovo can be
kept up .
</P>
<P>
   The alliance said 75 percent of fixed surface-to-air missile
sites and 69 percent of high-performance MiG-29 jets have been
destroyed, along with 11 command posts.
</P>
<P>
   But other statistics were less impressive: only 12 percent of
mobile surface-to-air missile units and 34 percent of remaining
combat aircraft have been destroyed, including 24 percent of
MiG-21s, 46 percent of Galebs and 33 percent of Super Galebs.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance claims to have hit 556 pieces of equipment of which
312 were tanks, artillery or armored personnel carriers. That
compares with the figures given two weeks ago when General Jertz
said that 300 pieces of equipment had been struck, 200 of which
were heavy artillery, roughly 20 percent of the Serbs' total
inventory.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the general cited a figure of 50 percent as the
point at which the Serbs would cease to operate as an effective
force, becoming more concerned with survival.
</P>
<P>
   But the alliance has conceded that President Milosevic might
order his troops to continue with as little as 20 to 30 percent of
its equipment. &QL;

DEA AGENT ADMITS INVOLVEMENT WITH WIFE OF SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sex, lies and tape recordings.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Drug Enforcement Administration has kept John
Dalton in federal prison for the past 2 1/2 years, the Mendocino
County machinist says.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming a federal agent's seduction of his wife for his plight,
Dalton is arguing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco that the
government's conduct is so outrageous that the charges against him
should be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton, 44, was indicted in October 1996 for involvement in a
continuing criminal conspiracy _ masterminding an industrial-scale
marijuana operation in Mendocino County in Northern California _
plus seven counts of growing marijuana for sale and one of witness
tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton, who has no criminal record, faces a sentence of up to
life in prison if convicted on the conspiracy count and five years
to life on some of the marijuana counts. He is being held without
bail.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and Dalton's lawyer, J. Tony Serra, will submit
legal arguments to U.S. District Judge Susan Illston before she
rules on the motion to dismiss the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton contends the charges against him should be dismissed
because DEA agent Mark Nelson, 37, set him up by first threatening,
then seducing Dalton's then-wife Victoria Horstman, 40, convincing
her that she was a ``special agent,'' and persuading her to install
a tape recorder in the Dalton bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Horstman testified she supplied the DEA with pillow-talk tape
recordings containing allegedly incriminating admissions about the
marijuana business.
</P>
<P>
   Serra, a redoubtable courtroom battler for underdogs, hammered
Nelson and Horstman for nearly eight hours this week with questions
aimed at demonstrating they had an illicit sexual relationship
which, in the end, victimized Dalton.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson and Horstman admitted snuggling and French kissing _ once
_ but said their physical relationship went no further.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, on the witness stand, refused to answer several
questions, invoking his constitutional right against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, a DEA agent for 13 years, began enlisting Horstman _ an
admitted alcoholic _ as an informant in 1992. During his agency's
investigation of Dalton, Nelson gave Horstman a special agent
number and supplied her with $4,800 in moving and other expenses,
plus tape recording equipment for her bedroom and purse.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1994, Nelson blindfolded Horstman and drove her to
a DEA ``safe house'' near Ukiah to fingerprint her, without
informing his supervisors, in what he admitted was a violation of
agency policy.
</P>
<P>
   Before the fingerprinting, the agent and Horstman testified,
they engaged in some heavy petting, which culminated with a tongue
kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said that he went too far in cultivating Horstman as an
informant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stupid,'' he said. But ``I thought it was important
enough to establish contact with her. That's why I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   He blamed himself for initiating the physical contact, which
occurred when his wife was pregnant with their second child.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson denied manipulating Horstman for his own sexual and
career purposes by threatening to charge her with laundering
Dalton's drug money through the credit union where she worked. But
Horstman testified the laundering charge was mentioned. And her
son, Joshua Corrigan, 20, of Oakdale, testified his mother said she
was cooperating with the DEA out of fear of going to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Horstman admitted that Nelson drove her to an attorney's office
to file for divorce from Dalton, but said the divorce was her own
idea _ an assertion contradicted by her son and her former best
friend, Chohni Baird. Baird testified she believed only the DEA's
interference prevented Horstman's reconciliation with Dalton.
</P>
<P>
   Horstman, weeping frequently and complaining that the years of
her marriage to Dalton were so traumatic that she couldn't recall
what happened, said she willingly cooperated with the DEA, in large
part because she wanted to escape a physically abusive
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Horstman said that it was she, not Nelson, who was most
responsible for the touching and kissing in the DEA's safe house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in desperate need of a human touch. I initiated it. And
the minute we did it, I knew it was wrong. I froze. I never should
have called (Nelson) in the first place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was ``my knight in shining armor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Horstman denied on the witness stand that she was
coerced, manipulated by, fearful of or seduced by Nelson, she
nevertheless wrote two letters to Nelson's DEA supervisors stating
just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   On the stand this week, Horstman said she typed the letters only
because her husband threatened to harm her if she didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was John. That wasn't me,'' she said under questioning by
Serra. ``He interrogated and beat me, because he wanted a
scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Horstman later recanted the accusations made in her letters to
the DEA.
</P>
<P>
   Horstman denied inflicting injuries on herself to support her
charges of spousal abuse and said that a Ukiah police report which
indicated that she had struck Dalton in the face with a baseball
bat was wrong in fact.

   &UR; By A.O. SCOTT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, May 12, Chris Matthews interviewed Kathleen Willey
on CNBC's ``Hardball,'' the cable program that aspires to be to the
Clinton scandals what ``Nightline'' was to the Iranian hostage
crisis and Robert MacNeil's PBS show was to Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Casual viewers may have thought they were watching some kind of
``Best of Monicagate'' retrospective -- isn't Kathleen Willey
awfully 1998?
</P>
<P>
   But to conspiracy theorists and media creatures for whom the end
of the scandal is likely to mean extinction, Willey's re-emergence
yielded a small, ambiguous, but nonetheless tantalizing tidbit.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 8 last year, shortly after she had testified in the
Paula Jones trial, Willey reportedly had a frightening encounter
with a jogger near her house in Richmond, Va., -- a complete
stranger who nonetheless seemed to know quite a bit about Willey's
children, her car and her cat.
</P>
<P>
   Though Willey declined to identify the man on ``Hardball'' --
Kenneth Starr's office, she said, had asked her not to -- Matthews
seemed to have a pretty good idea who he was -- an idea that he got
from the ``Drudge Report.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it someone in the president's family, friends?'' He pressed
Willey. ``Is it somebody related to Strobe Talbott? Is it a
Shearer?''
</P>
<P>
   What's a Shearer, you ask? A Shearer is a member of a
semi-prominent journalistic/political family connected to Bill
Clinton in a number of ways. To hard-core Clinton-haters, these
connections are evidence of Clinton's true political colors -- the
social-democratic, New Left, McGovernite, anti-free-enterprise,
America-hating tendencies he has so brilliantly camouflaged.
</P>
<P>
   The Shearers are also the kind of people Republican mugwumps
despise most viscerally: privileged, socially and professionally
ambitious dissenters whose liberal-left politics don't prevent them
from enjoying the prerogatives of membership in the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Shearer, the patriarch of the clan, was for many years the
editor of ``Parade'' magazine, which, during the Reagan era,
interspersed its celebrity profiles and sensible recipes with
anxious warnings about the dangers of the nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   His son Derek, a former professor at Occidental College, served
in Clinton's Commerce Department and then as his ambassador to
Finland. Derek also co-authored a book called ``Economic
Democracy'', which served as something of a manifesto for Tom
Hayden when the former SDSer abandoned radicalism for the
California Senate in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, Derek's wife, Ruth Yannatta Goldway, was elected
mayor of Santa Monica in 1981 on a pro-rent-control ticket. To a
Southern California Republican, this is like saying she was the
president of North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Derek's sister Brooke worked on Hillary Rodham Clinton's staff
and is married to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the
president's buddy from his Oxford days, long suspected by the right
of being soft on communism.
</P>
<P>
   But Matthews did not suggest that any of these Shearers were
stalking Kathleen Willey in a quiet Virginia subdivision on a damp
winter morning. The next night, chatting with Newsweek's Michael
Isikoff and NOW President Patricia Ireland, Matthews was less coy.
The Shearer in question, he declared, was Brooke's twin brother,
Cody.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Cody Shearer's name has floated to
the top of the murky stew of supposition, innuendo, and sleaze that
passes for political discourse in America these days. Joe Conason,
who debunks rumors about Clinton and his circle with the same
dogged zeal with which Matthews advances them, defended Shearer in
a recent Salon column. Shearer could not have been Willey's
stalker, Conason declared, because he was on a transcontinental
flight last Jan. 8 -- a flight on which Shearer happened to bump
into his brother-in-law's old boss former Secretary of State Warren
Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   And as a result of being smeared by Matthews, Matt Drudge, and
Rush Limbaugh, said Conason, Shearer had been subject to death
threats and other forms of terror. (Drudge, the proximate cause of
the harassment, supports this contention: According to a recent
Drudge posting, a man with a gun was arrested outside Shearer's
house a few days after Matthews' Willey segment aired. The man
turned out to be Pat Buchanan's brother Hank. Go figure.) Matthews
has since apologized for mentioning Shearer's name on the air.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Conason declined to explain why the bare
possibility of Shearer's involvement in the harassment of Willey
was so gleefully seized upon by Clinton's own designated harassers.
If Cody Shearer did not exist, Richard Mellon Scaife would have
given someone a grant to invent him.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe, like Lee Harvey Oswald in Don DeLillo's ``Libra'',
Shearer is both real and invented -- a creature of multiple
coincidences who seems at the same time to be operating in the
service of a grand, impenetrable design.
</P>
<P>
   When members of the vast right-wing conspiracy talk about their
counterparts in the vast left-wing conspiracy, Cody Shearer's name
is bound to come up sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   Is Shearer a private citizen unfairly sucked into the vortex of
public scandal? If so, the vortex is awfully good at finding him.
In published reports, Shearer is most often described as a
journalist or a free-lance writer. His byline has been rather
scarce during most of the Clinton era. Through the '80s he
co-wrote, with Maxwell Glen, a syndicated column on politics and
culture, which addressed such motley topics as trucking
deregulation and the ill effects of skin magazines on the male
libido.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the column dug up several embarrassing incidents of
drunkenness in the past of John Tower, whose nomination to be
secretary of defense was derailed by questions about his alcoholism
and sexual irresponsibility.
</P>
<P>
   A conspiracy theorist might infer that in helping to sink Tower,
Shearer was already acting as the cat's paw of a Democratic dirty
tricks operation -- or, at least, that the Tower affair whetted his
appetite for political dirt-digging and skullduggery.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it was Shearer who, during the 1992 presidential
campaign, introduced the world -- through the unlikely medium of
Doonesbury -- to Brett Kimberlin. Kimberlin, you may recall, was
the convicted bomber, habitual liar, and all-around sociopath who
claimed to have sold drugs to Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Was Shearer acting on behalf of the legendary Clinton
``opposition research'' outfit, which had floated damaging rumors
during the '92 primaries about Paul Tsongas' health and Jerry
Brown's drug use? Or was he just an enthusiastic free-lancer?
</P>
<P>
   A similar question arose during Sen. Fred Thompson's long,
comprehensive, and inconclusive hearings into the Democratic
Party's 1996 campaign fund-raising shenanigans. There, Shearer's
name popped up in the course of Sen. Don Nickles' angry questioning
of Terry Lenzner, the private investigator who would later, in the
thick of the Jones/Lewinsky/Willey/Who Knows Who Else matter, be
accused (by Dick Morris, among others) of coordinating efforts to
smear and intimidate those women.
</P>
<P>
   Shearer had apparently acted as a liaison between Lenzner's
firm, Investigative Group International, and the Cheyenne-Arapaho
tribe. The tribe had donated more than $100,000 to the Democratic
Party, hoping, according to testimony, that the administration
would intervene on its behalf in a dispute over drilling rights on
tribal land. Lenzner had been retained to uncover compromising
links between Nickles -- who opposed the tribe's claims -- and
local oil interests.
</P>
<P>
   Lenzner, while he admitted that he had accepted the tribe's
retainer, has denied that Cody Shearer had ever worked for IGI --
though the firm did once employ his sister Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   Shearer's efforts as a free-lance political fixer have not been
limited to domestic affairs. Much to the embarrassment of his
brother-in-law and the consternation of others in the State
Department, details have recently emerged about Shearer's efforts,
in 1996 and 1997, to arrange for Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic to surrender to the International War Crimes Tribunal in
the Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Shearer took $25,000 from an associate of Karadzic's in France,
and then, depending on who you believe, was either duped by the
Serbs or double-crossed by them. He was acting without the
authorization and, it seems, without the knowledge of any American
diplomat or policy-maker. Karadzic, as the saying goes, is still at
large.
</P>
<P>
   Cody Shearer is a man with many connections, able to convince
Bosnian Serbs, Cheyennes and, unintentionally, Washington
Clinton-haters that he is a player, a person who makes things
happen.
</P>
<P>
   But he may just be a person who things happen to happen to, a
guy with a penchant for pretending to be what others want to
believe that he is.
</P>
<P>
   Every time he turns up on the scene--and even when (as, perhaps,
in the case of Kathleen Willey) he doesn't -- people ask: What's he
doing here? He probably asks himself the same question.

A PANICKED RUSH TO `DO SOMETHING'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``They've got to do SOMETHING.''
</P>
<P>
   Boiled down to its purest essence, that is the mantra inspiring
the frenzy of on-again, off-again, on-again gun legislation gushing
out of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Calls from constituents to congressional offices are flooding
switchboards and swamping support staff. Lawmakers can hardly tell
sic 'em from come here, they've been pulled in so many different
directions in the wake of the Littleton, Colo., disaster. One can
only imagine the pressure today, one day after yet another troubled
youth opened fire in yet another American high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to do SOMETHING.''
</P>
<P>
   It is what drove House Speaker Dennis Hastert to raise the
suggestion this week that the legal age for buying handguns should
be raised from 18 to 21. Under current federal law, it is already a
crime for licensed firearms dealers to sell handguns to anyone
under 21.
</P>
<P>
   To quote Alan Korwin, author of ``Gun Laws of America,'' ``If
you want to fix the laws, it helps to know what they are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to do SOMETHING.''
</P>
<P>
   It's what motivated Vice President Al Gore to cast the
tie-breaking vote to require background checks on all transactions
at gun shows, whether the seller is a licensed dealer or a private
collector. Good idea? Perhaps. One little problem _ the FBI's
instant check system isn't exactly a 1-800 number that anyone can
dial up. It takes an access code, and those only go to federally
licensed firearms dealers. Welcome, new bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to do SOMETHING.''
</P>
<P>
   It's what prompted the safety lock requirement that includes the
inane provision that if a gun owner doesn't use a safety lock and
the firearm is stolen and then used in a crime, she can be held
liable.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the gun owner lives alone and therefore has
absolutely no need for trigger locks to keep the firearm safe from
... who, her cat? Never mind that someone else would have to commit
heaven knows how many other crimes to illegally enter the
residence, steal the gun and then use it in another crime. The gun
owner will be in deep yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to do SOMETHING.''
</P>
<P>
   It's what motivated President Clinton and members of both
parties to call for making sure that violent juvenile offenders are
never allowed to own firearms in their lifetimes. Good idea. One
problem: The feds don't control juvenile records _ the states do.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Constitution gives Congress no authority whatsoever
over crimes committed by juveniles within a single state. And
juvenile records, by state statute, are sealed. In a practical,
real-world, constitutional sense, how is this supposed to work?
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to do SOMETHING.''
</P>
<P>
   But is more legislation the answer? At least 41 federal laws
were violated in the Columbine High School incident a month ago.
Forty-one existing laws. Obtaining guns and ammunition through
bogus means. Possession of explosives with malicious intent.
Possession of bomb-making materials. Possession of a firearm by a
minor without the federally required permission slip from a parent
or guardian. Conspiracy to commit a felony. Providing a handgun to
a minor. Manufacture and possession of a non-federally approved
weapon _ two separate counts for that sawed-off shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   And those are just some of the laws violated before a shot was
fired or an explosive was detonated. Does anyone truly believe that
more laws are the answer to preventing this inexplicable blackening
of a heart and total disregard for rules of conduct in a civilized
society?
</P>
<P>
   Americans are frustrated and scared for their children, and they
are showing their fear by railing at their elected representatives
to do something or else. But panic on the part of lawmakers who
fear for their re-election chances is a very poor reason for
enacting redundant, unnecessary and in some cases unconstitutional
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   A true leader would be someone who calls for a thorough review
of existing laws _ on federal and state levels _ to see exactly
what's already on the books. A true leader would be someone who
encourages Americans to focus on their own lives and actions and
how they can regain control instead of looking to the Capitol to
legislate that which cannot be legislated: morality, personal
responsibility, kindness, compassion, humanity.
</P>
<P>
   If that isn't the biggest bunch of wishful thinking to come down
the pike.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to do something, DON'T THEY?''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Thinking of killing the president?''
</P>
<P>
   I have been asked this by many people lately. And I can't really
blame them. When I catch my reflection in a window, even I see a
stranger. Not just someone unknown. Someone strange. I don't need
antipsychotic drugs or shock therapy to tame the wild-man look. I
just need a barber who can mow down the strip of hair bisecting my
head.
</P>
<P>
   I am wearing the world's most provocative haircut: a Mohawk.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, the Mohawk is showing signs of a revival.
Alexander McQueen sent a couple down the runway for his fall 1998
ready-to-wear collection in London. Up-and-coming actors Matthew
Lillard and Adrian Brody have both worn Mohawks for roles, and the
July issue of Details magazine is to feature a model with a Mohawk
in a beach-wear story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the haircut to have for ages between 15 and 30,'' said
Ward Stegerhoek, the creative director of Bumble and Bumble, a
midtown salon with a Hollywood clientele.
</P>
<P>
   The Mohawk _ the word is an Algonquian term meaning
``man-eater'' _ has been favored for years by people seeking to
make a strong impression. In December 1773, for instance, American
patriots disguised as Mohawk Indians dumped 342 chests of tea into
the Boston Harbor _ the Boston Tea Party.
</P>
<P>
   For exactly these reasons, it was adopted by members of the punk
movement in the 1970s. Worn colored and stuck up with Krazy Glue or
spray starch, it was not only an affront to the flowing peasant
styles of the time, but also defiant even of gravity. It was a
declaration of youth on a rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The late-1990s version is no longer just for rebels without a
cause; it has been neatened up and reinvented for men, including
some with day jobs, who just want to look as if they have a
rebellious streak. Stegerhoek, who recently styled one for a
magazine shoot, explained: ``To bring it to a man who can still
wear a suit, the sides aren't completely shaved. They are just
trimmed very short. And there is a longer section in the center
that is just short and choppy. The proportions have come a lot
closer, and that's made it a much more handsome look.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, lay off the greasy kid stuff. Go natural.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Peddle, a scout for the Next modeling agency, discovered
the power of a Mohawk during the eight months he wore one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got through airports really quickly,'' Peddle said, no mean
advantage when his job has him flying 15 times a month. ``People
would literally clear a path for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, on a whim that was a year in the making, I walked
into Ginger Rose on East Houston Street, a salon with a neon
clipper and pictures of dazzling heads of cropped hair hanging in
the window. I entered with a messy pompadour and left with a strip
of hair an inch and a half wide, dividing two bald sides of my
head. Over the following weeks, I kept a diary of peoples'
responses to my Mohawk. They were typically pro or con _ and rarely
neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, April 9
</P>
<P>
   As I am disconnected before a Movie Phone ticket order can be
confirmed, I angrily pound the receiver into the keypad of a pay
phone on University Place. I have done this with normal hair
before, but this time, people stare disapprovingly at me. To them,
I am an anarchist declaring war on Ma Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The Mohawk magnifies things, making even small actions highly
charged. When I politely order lunch at Les Deux Gamins on Waverly
Place, there is mild shock on people's faces at my clear
articulation. At St. Marks Bookshop, where I browse through a copy
of Richardson _ an art magazine that specializes in high-toned
pornography _ I don't feel the urge to hide the cover. Since I
already look like a rebel, it is excusable to act like one. The
more conspicuous I am, the less self-conscious I feel.
</P>
<P>
   On a sidewalk in the East Village, I pass Jesse Camp, the MTV
host who has ululated his way through a year on television after
winning a ``Wanna Be a VJ'' contest. With his nappy spikes, he is
nobody's slouch in the hair department. He locks eyes on my Mohawk,
and gives me a look that suggests he knows me, or should.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, April 13
</P>
<P>
   As I pass Coney Island High, the punk-rock landmark on St. Marks
Place, the young man sitting on a stool at the door at 1 a.m. says:
``Come on in, brother. Support the cause.'' Just because I'm
advertising my authority complex _ perhaps working at home gives
this character trait room to grow _ doesn't mean I like a single
Dead Kennedys song.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the subway, I try an experiment. With my nose in the
paper, I randomly look up in any direction. Invariably, I lock eyes
with someone who has been staring at my head. They quickly look
away, except infants and the very old, who return my gaze blankly
or gleefully.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, April 15
</P>
<P>
   I drop by the opening reception of the Alfred Hitchcock
retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. A woman with hair dyed
white and black like Cruella De Vil's keeps looking at me. Perhaps
she's trying to figure out who the new strange-haired kid in town
is.
</P>
<P>
   A paparazzo clicks a few shots of me. Or rather, he clicks shots
of the Guy With the Mohawk, since paparazzi never photograph me
normally.
</P>
<P>
   I have stumbled onto some foolish middling degree of fame _ the
kind that former cast members of ``The Real World'' must enjoy.
Sometimes people want to touch my head, and I don't deny them the
pleasure. At a party in the East Village, after 20 minutes of
conversation, a woman abruptly asks, ``Want to make out?'' (This,
like the paparazzi's attention, is also new. Note to self: keep
Mohawk through Labor Day.)
</P>
<P>
   Introducing myself turns out to be a quaint formality, like
thank-you cards. It's nice if you do it, but not really necessary.
</P>
<P>
   As one of my friends says, ``Who knew that having an edge would
be so easy?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Friday, April 16
</P>
<P>
   At breakfast in the East Village, I overhear another diner say
to his companions with their backs to me, ``Don't look now.'' He
imitates a Mohawk, brushing open palms on the side of this head and
drawing an imaginary strip down the center.
</P>
<P>
   That night in Chelsea, I attend a party with very stylishly
coiffed European men and women. I am out with my friend Dave, who
with a head full of blond dreadlocks usually makes me look like the
straight man. Now we are some kind of strange hair cabal. I spot a
woman standing alone in the kitchen, and after fixing myself a
drink, I lean against the counter and survey the party from her
vantage point. Before I can say a word, she bolts.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, April 21
</P>
<P>
   Walking home in the late afternoon, I give a great, leonine
yawn. A full block later, at Orchard and Houston Streets, I run
into a friend, who says: ``Didn't your mother ever teach you to
cover your mouth when you yawn? I saw you from two blocks away.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, it seems, is noticing me from two blocks away, and
they do their best to give me a wide berth. I am no longer jostled
on the street, something I noticed on this day when someone did
bump me. It seemed like such an invasion that I sneered at him.
</P>
<P>
   One bonus to having a Mohawk is that panhandlers no longer pipe
up as I walk by. Either I look like a low-percentage hit, or they
figure I am not worth taking a risk over. But there are other
equally unwanted comments directed at me on the street. ``You
talking to me?'' people love to ask, imitating Travis Bickle from
``Taxi Driver.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going to dye it?'' is another favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, and stand out like a sore thumb?'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, April 24
</P>
<P>
   At an Upper East Side party in an apartment off Fifth Avenue, I
fear that the isolation of the previous weekend's party in Chelsea
is going to be even greater. For the most part, I am right. When
I'm not talking to the two people I knew when I arrived, I am
staring at the bookcases, studying the reading choices of our
hostess.
</P>
<P>
   I notice a trend. Most people wait for someone else to talk to
me, and then feel emboldened to join in. This is what a woman named
Jolie does. After about 20 minutes of chatter about careers and
such, she says, ``You know, you really don't look like a freak.''
The hostess chimes in, ``I bet he's really normal, and that's why
he has that haircut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget shy,'' I add.
</P>
<P>
   She taps her nose.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, April 25
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice hair, dude,'' a guy calls from his fire escape on
Elizabeth Street as I walk beneath him. By now, I am used to this,
just as I am used to being smiled at when I walk into stores. At
the Lotus Club, a cafe on the Lower East Side that I have visited
every day for a year, I am given a free cup of coffee for the first
time. The counter man even remembers how I take it _ iced, with a
splash of milk.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he remembers how the Guy With the Mohawk takes it.

YOU WANT ART, GO TO A MUSEUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have more than 500 megabytes of art files
from my old computer that I want to transfer to the new one. I'm
wondering if there is any way to transfer stuff via modems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Piles O' Files
</P>
<P>
   DEAR PILES: Sure there is, as long as you have a couple of days
with nothing better to do. Pack a couple of sandwiches, brew up a
pot of joe, call yourself with some terminal program, start a file
transfer and sit back and watch that progress bar inch along like a
``Star Wars'' ticket line.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you could do the sensible thing. Just hook up your two
computers with a cable and copy all your dirty pictures, uh, ``art
files,'' from one to the other. It shouldn't take an hour. And if
you have Windows 95 or better on both machines, you already have
the software. It's called Direct Cable Connection, and it's in
Accessories. If it's not, go to the Windows Setup tab in Add/Remove
Programs and install it. It requires networking support and file
sharing, which you add in the Network section of the Control Panel.
</P>
<P>
   One of your computers will be able to view the other's drives as
folders it can share. Then use Windows Explorer to move all those
Pam Anderson videos to the new machine.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you want to make things a heck of a lot easier, go
buy a program like Laplink or pcAnywhere, which actually comes with
the cable you need. Direct Cable Connection is notoriously balky,
and there's a good chance you'll pound one of the two machines to
death with a hammer long before you get the files to transfer.
Maybe both.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Can you please refer me to some location that
has an archive of your previous columns? _ No Accounting for Taste
</P>
<P>
   DEAR TASTE: Try looking in the closet in the back bedroom of my
mother's house, right under the box of used dress shields. C'mon,
now, if I put all the old stuff where people could get at it,
eventually somebody would figure out that I just recycle everything
every three or four months, and that would terribly embarrass my
editor, who's supposed to be reading this stuff instead of always
slipping out to have her nails done.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: When I turn on the computer, I get the
following: ``Error starting program. A required DLL file,
Pncrt.dll, was not found.'' OK. What have I done wrong?
</P>
<P>
   _ It's All My Fault
</P>
<P>
   DEAR ALL: What you did wrong was believing that Windows could
actually run forever without its wheels falling off.
</P>
<P>
   The thing you're missing is a support file for RealPlayer, the
audio/video player. No telling what gobbled it up. Could be a bad
installation. Could be an accidental deletion. Could be Windows
doing its normal self-destruct routine. The safest thing to do now
is to uninstall RealPlayer, then reinstall it. Go to Add/Remove
Programs in the Control Panel, then click on the Windows Setup Tab.
RealPlayer is under Internet Tools.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, just go to www.real.com and get the latest version.
And remember: It's always Windows' fault. Always. Even that nasty
business with Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Won't you answer letters in a way that is more
pleasant, leaving out the ridicule?
</P>
<P>
   _ MISS MANNERS
</P>
<P>
   Dear Miss: What kind of a pinheaded question is that?
</P>
<P>

OLD WARRIOR HOPES TO LEAD SIERRA CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ David Brower, the old environmental lion, is
roaring again.
</P>
<P>
   At age 86, he's running for the presidency of the Sierra Club,
aiming, he says, to revitalize an organization that has become
clubby, fearful of risk and preoccupied with procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Brower's 14 co-directors on the Sierra Club board, who will
elect a new president on Saturday, are all his spiritual children.
He was transforming the Sierra Club from a nonpolitical group of
mostly affluent backpackers into a mighty environmental lobby
before many of them were born.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, as he freely acknowledges, he's the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues are loath to criticize Brower publicly, but
conversations with club activists leave the impression that many
believe he's had his day, won't pay sufficient attention to the
nuts and bolts of club affairs _ and may be on an ego trip.
</P>
<P>
   Brower's bid to lead the 550,000 members of the century-old
Sierra Club is consistent with the bold moves that characterized
his 17 years as its executive director. His tenure was marked by
epic environmental victories, such as the creation of nine national
parks and seashores, and preventing the damming of the Grand
Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1969 the board _ of which he is now a voting member _
fired him because he was unmanageable. Brower repeatedly made
policy and financial decisions without consulting the board, even
as he increased the conservation organization's membership nearly a
hundredfold and its influence by at least that much.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent electronic mail message to friends, Brower observed
that he is often compared to Sierra Club founder John Muir and that
he's already 10 years older than Muir when he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having waited so long to be president of his club, I ought to
hurry. I'd like to do my best to make sure there will be a lot of
people helping achieve some of Muir's goals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brower said that ``what's worrying me is that the board is more
concerned with procedure than substance. There's practically no
talk about what's happening to Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Directors have become ``much too at ease about closed-door
sessions. They don't want democracy to interfere with process,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants to see the Sierra Club's staff decentralized,
its outreach program strengthened, its book program _ which he
initiated _ revitalized, and directors' closed-door sessions
opened. He also wants the board of directors to work on issues that
would enable environmentalists to build new political coalitions,
such as those that might target the revitalizing of U.S. railroads.
</P>
<P>
   And he sounds his recurring theme: ``No more club cop-outs. ...
Anyone who knows (Sierra Club history) knows the shame and
unnecessary destruction wrought by compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Brower has often said that the worst decision he ever made as
executive director _ one which had him contemplating suicide _ was
to recommend the compromise on the Colorado River system which
permitted construction of Glen Canyon Dam. The Sierra Club is now
involved in a campaign to drain Lake Powell and tear down that dam.
</P>
<P>
   The coolness toward Brower's presidential candidacy may have
less to do with his chronic contentiousness than with a general
feeling that the club under past President Adam Werbach and current
President Chuck McGrady is running smoothly and in the right
direction, albeit more slowly than some members would like.
</P>
<P>
   That Brower is likely to be denied his desire to head the club
with which he has been associated for 65 years ``is unfortunate and
in no way meant to minimize his accomplishments,'' said Besty
Gaines, a Sierra Club director from Bozeman, Mont. ``I really
admire Mr. Brower. He's an amazing figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Ferenstein, a director from Missoula, Mont., agreed.
``He's a wonderful person, but I don't think he wants to handle the
administrative side of it,'' she said, adding that McGrady, a North
Carolinian who is running for re-election, ``is a really good
person, and he's done more to pilot the Sierra Club in a positive
way than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Brower acknowledges that he has no intention of being a hands-on
administrator. ``It is my intention to de-emphasize the role of the
president'' and club staffers and to let real power be exercised by
directors, who are elected by the members.
</P>
<P>
   Brower's run for the Sierra Club presidency is his second _ he
lost his first bid last year _ and he concedes that ``at this
point, I don't see enough votes. I'm afraid I'll miss again.''

NEW SCULPTURE GARDEN TAKES SHAPE AT THE NATIONAL GALLERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARIA RECIO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sculpture garden, a museum without walls, has
been a dream of staff and officials at the National Gallery of Art
for more than 30 years. On Sunday, that dream becomes real, when
the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden opens to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The new garden features 17 pieces of cutting-edge art, set amid
manicured greenery and surrounding a fountain and pool. It occupies
more than six acres at Seventh Street and Constitution Avenue,
adjacent to the gallery. The museum, in turn, is one of several
lining the parklike Mall that links the Capitol and the Washington
Monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proud to bring to the nation these significant works of
sculpture in one of the few outdoor settings of this magnitude in
the country,'' gallery director Earl A. Powell III said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the artists represented are Joan Miro, David Smith, Lucas
Samaras, Tony Smith, Louise Bourgeois, Roy Lichtenstein, Alexander
Calder, Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, and Isamu Noguchi.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture garden cost $13 million to build, excluding the
amount paid for the artwork. The Washington-based Morris and
Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation contributed $10 million, with the rest
coming from private funds. Named for a pair of philanthropists and
art lovers, the Cafritz Foundation also purchased seven of the 10
new sculptures. Six other works have been moved from elsewhere in
the gallery, and one is on loan.
</P>
<P>
   Money given by the Nancy Lee and Perry Bass Fund of Fort Worth
was used to buy Samaras' ``Chair Transformation,'' a
gravity-defying stack of leaning chairs. Powell would not disclose
the cost of any artwork or say how much money came from the Bass
fund.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the sculpture garden is one of the most historic
events for the museum since it opened in 1941, Powell said. He
described the setting as a ``new forum for appreciating
20th-century sculpture'' and a ``perfect marriage between landscape
and art.''
</P>
<P>
   From a playful rendition of a 20-foot-tall typewriter eraser to
a menacing spider measuring 9 feet by 27 feet, the sculpture garden
touches on some of the diversity of modern sculpture and evokes
myriad emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really aiming for a dynamic, richly textured variation
of modern sculpture,'' said Marla Prather, the gallery's curator of
20th-century art. She said the prospect of the landscape changing
with the seasons was an exciting element in designing the garden
and anticipating how art will live outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   The fountain and reflecting pool, the focal point of the site,
will be converted to a skating rink in winter, replacing an earlier
rink. Adding to the viewing experience will be a cafe with indoor
and outdoor seating, expected to open in the fall. There is seating
all around the fountain and throughout the garden, including one of
the sculptures itself: Scott Burton's ``Six-Part Seating,'' a group
of red-granite seats that face each other in a circle.
</P>
<P>
   In a break from the traditional museum experience, the public
will be allowed to walk up to, around and under most of the
sculptures and even touch them, although museum officials are still
unsure how that will work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try to dissuade too much touching,'' Prather said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they touch or not, though, visitors are sure to be
absorbed, fascinated, amused and even repelled by some of the
works.
</P>
<P>
   The sculptures include:
</P>
<P>
   ``Typewriter Eraser, Scale X'' (1999), by Oldenburg and van
Bruggen. An eraser was one of Oldenburg's favorite childhood
playthings in his father's office in Sweden. In this giant
rendition, the painted steel and fiberglass sculpture is placed so
that the brush bristles playfully point to the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chair Transformation No. 20B'' (1996), by Samaras. ``A work
that defies all the conventions of balance,'' according to Prather.
The stacked chairs appear to lean back and forth simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spider'' (1996/1998), by Bourgeois. The spider is depicted
here as both nurturing and menacing. It is part of the artist's
spider series, which explores themes of childhood memory and loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinker on a Rock'' (1997), by Barry Flanagan. The artist here
plays with Rodin's classic by depicting the figure as a hare.
Flanagan has made the hare a signature for his work, often using it
to poke fun at tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puellae'' (1992), by Magdalena Abakanowicz. A disquieting
assembly of 30 bronze figures of pre-adolescent girls, the work was
inspired by a story about a group of children found frozen to death
in cattle cars as they were transported from Poland to Germany in
1942.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheval Rouge (Red Horse)'' (1974), by Calder. On loan from the
Calder Foundation in New York, this is a bold, aggressive portrayal
of a horse made of painted sheet metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``House I'' (1996/1998), by Lichtenstein: A whimsical,
two-dimensional house, the sculpture is outlined in black and
colored in the artist's signature primary colors. ``It's like
having a cartoon in the middle of the garden,'' Prather said.

RUBIN A HARD ACT TO FOLLOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 23, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is worth pointing out, midst the virtually wall-to-wall
praise which marks Robert Rubin's departure from high government
service, that his tenure as Treasury Secretary proves several
useful points:
</P>
<P>
   --Being smart, tough and modest can bring great professional
success.
</P>
<P>
   --Deft tugs on the levers of government can actually improve the
performance of the economy, contrary to the hoarse complaints of
the right-wingers that government can never do anything right.
</P>
<P>
   --It never hurts to get lucky from time to time, just so long as
you don't start counting on it.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of greasy journalism and downmarket triumphalism in
the media generally, a gentleman of principle and probity can have
a remarkable influence on the affairs of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The name ``Rubin'' and the word ``scandal'' never appeared in
the same sentence in the millions of words gushing out of
Washington. The man who'd made millions as a Wall Street trader
over 26 years of outguessing the markets completed his public
service without a smudge.
</P>
<P>
   He was the cabinet member in charge of the money; the
government's money, the public's money in the larger sense, and, in
the largest sense, the world's money. On his watch, the markets
prospered, the Dow Jones average tripled, inflation went aneroxic,
and Main Street discovered Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Rubin era was the century's Golden Decade, for just about
everything except gold, and oil, and some other commodities, as
information became the coin of the realm, displacing the ``stuff''
that used to move mountains and make millionaires, who are now too
numerous to catalogue.
</P>
<P>
   America's dizzying prosperity did not reach down to the bottom
rungs of the economic ladder. It never does reach all the way down.
But both Rubin and President Clinton noted the plight of the
left-behind in their parting remarks, even if the financial experts
and the journalistis generally did not bother to include those in
their summary of Rubin's accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Our relative wealth is the envy of the planet. In a recent paper
World Bank President James Wolfensohn and Nobel Prize economist
Amartya Sen sketched the plight of the bottom half of the globe's
peoples: ``Three billion people live on less than two dollars a
day, 1.3 billion (one human out of four) do not have clean water,
130 million children do not go to school, and 40,000 children die
every day because of hunger-related diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   They made a plea for more social safety nets worldwide, a cause
Rubin endorsed throughout his tenure, even as he remained the
hard-eyed market supremacists' favorite bureaucrat. Rubin had a
genuine knack for inspiring trust. Along with Alan Greenspan, the
Federal Reserve chieftan who is Wall Street's reigning heavyweight
champ, Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence Summers, 44, became the Three
Musketeers of the Clinton era, nerdy swashbucklers triumphing
routinely.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico goes belly up? No problem. Rubin works out a rescue
package, and all the bills get paid. Wall Street has a bellyache,
and the stock market dumps seven percent in one day? Here, take a
Bob Rubin steady-as-she-goes pill, with a few purred words about
the strength of the US ``fundamentals.'' Asia trembles, and the
tigers start falling like dominoes? Dr. Bob is there with asprin,
soft words, and wise counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese still can't get it right. Their weak political
system is incapable of bringing to heel an essentially crooked,
unbalanced, corrupt financial system. Some argue that the post-war
makeover imposed on Japan by the United States a half-century ago
crunched them into an essentially-coercive, unnatural system.
Clearly, Tokyo cannot find its Rubin, never mind its Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   And while you'll rarely hear a kind word for Bill Clinton from
the gang that profits most off the economy, or commenting upon it,
the old Arkansas hillbilly must have done something right here, or
at the least, he didn't screw it up. When I asked Bill Bradley
recently how much credit the Clinton-Gore team deserved for the
nation's prosperity, the Olde Princetonian ticked off a half-dozen
reasons for same, never mentioning the words ``Clinton'' or
``Gore.'' But Bradley did praise Rubin, Greenspan and Summers.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if Summers, described as brilliant but
brittle, can replicate Rubin's run as his successor. Summers was
only 28 when he became the youngest Harvard professor ever to win
tenure. For that alone, he'll be hated by hundreds of thousands of
envious graduate students. How will the markets take to Summers?
</P>
<P>
   To the Treasury-Secretary-designate, I commend the words of
Herman Hickman, football coach at Yale, when asked how he'd handle
restive alumni. ``The alumni,'' decreed Herm, ``should be kept
sullen, but not mutinous.''

   KOSOVO-POLICY (Washington) _ Between the two options that
President Clinton has declared unacceptable _ doing nothing or
all-out war _ the White House has devised a new kind of warfare for
Yugoslavia. It is a calibrated war, enabled by high-tech weaponry,
shaped by the flickering light of opinion polls and shackled by

against any military intervention in an obscure placed called
Kosovo. By Blaine Harden and John Broder.

   DRUGS-MARIJUANA (Washington) _ In an effort to promote research

the National Institutes of Health. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.

   LOTTERY-IMPACT (Orange, N.J.) _ With lottery machines as

them each year, the most prevalent purveyor of betting games in
America is no longer the corner bookmaker. Instead, it is state
governments _ the same entities that for years outlawed gambling.
The impact that state lotteries are having on communities around
the country has been a major focus of the National Gambling Impact
Study Commission, which is examining the social and economic
consequences of gambling. It is in communities like Orange where
the lottery is a dominant force and many poor and modest wage

   NY-ORCHARD-FASHION (New York) _ What was the woman in the
lime-green and gray suit, with shoulders sharp enough to poke an
eye out, doing in the middle of Orchard Street? The suit came from
Marcesa, one of the traditional ``I can get it for you wholesale''
stores on Orchard. Well, she was a fashion model; Orchard Street
had been temporarily fitted with an elevated catwalk, and the
garish green power suit was the tartly affectionate statement of
Ben Sturgill, a participant in the Orchard Street Style Slam last

   MOHAWK-HAIRCUT (Undated) _ Believe it or not, the Mohawk is
showing signs of a revival. Alexander McQueen sent a couple down
the runway for his fall 1998 ready-to-wear collection in London.
The up-and-coming actors Matthew Lillard and Adrian Brody have both
worn Mohawks for roles, and the July issue of Details magazine is

   NITEOUT-KIMHEIRSTON (New York) _ I know being fabulous is a
full-time occupation,'' Gregory Crewdson, an artist, said recently.
``But what exactly does she do?'' That seems to be the $100,000
question whenever Kim Heirston's name is mentioned. Neither a
collector nor a dealer, neither a curator nor a gallery owner, Ms.
Heirston, 35, is an art adviser, coaching the rich on how to spend
their fortunes on fine art. Ms. Heirston seems well suited to a
career that is equal parts socializing and commerce. At 6 feet
tall, she cut a striking figure as she glided into the contemporary
art sale at Sotheby's last Tuesday evening. By Elizabeth Hayt.

   TEENAGE-CONSULTANTS (New York) _ Looking for new and improved
ways to separate teen-agers from their money, the DuPont Co. has

preparing for the summer season by marshalling an army of front-end

latest trend: transforming the area's generally flat topography
into rolling hills, ridges and ponds, in some cases landscapes more

   GARDEN-COLUMN (Herefordshire, England) _ A few hair-raising
miles along a narrow road from Ludlow Castle, an 11th-century ruin
in west-central England, one comes upon a garden of great
distinction, the unlikely centerpiece of which is a magnificent
display of echinacea, North America's native purple coneflower. The
planting of echinacea in this garden at Elton Hall has been
designated a ``national collection'' by England's National Council
for the Conservation of Plants and Gardens, which is dedicated to
preserving the gene pool of garden plants. By Marty Ross.

A GRAND BEGINNING: BOOK HELPS FAMILIES BUILD BONDS BETWEEN
GENERATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SANDY GUERRA-CLINE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Susan V. Bosak has connections most people would envy.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of fractured families, long-distance relationships
and the special guilt that often comes with them, Bosak, a
children's author, shared a special bond with her grandmother that
defied geographic and generational differences and transcended an
earthly notion of time.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1997 book ``Something to Remember Me By,'' reprinted this
year by Canada's research and education group The Communication
Project, Bosak pays homage to that relationship. It's an
award-winning illustrated storybook that begins when Bosak was a
young girl visiting her grandmother and cooking in her kitchen.
``Every time the little girl visited her grandmother, the house
smelled so good _ homemade soup and roast chicken and fresh-baked
cookies.'' It follows the pair through the years, telling how after
each visit her grandmother would give the girl little keepsakes,
``something to remember me by.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sad book _ the grandmother grows too old to care for her
home and, in the end, has trouble recognizing her granddaughter _
but it's also, says the author, a learning tool and an inspiration
for building connections between young and old.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Reader's Companion,'' available free with the purchase
of the book and based on research Bosak has done using her book in
workshops for the The Communication Project, Bosak offers parents,
teachers _ and grandparents _ suggestions for exploring her book in
depth with children. The guide provides storytelling activity
suggestions (get someone you know to tell you about their
grandparents), questions for prompting discussion (''What is
`old'?'') and insights on intergenerational relationships, such as
these:
</P>
<P>
   The more complicated life gets, the more the simple things
matter. Walks, errands and even watching TV with a grandparent can
be special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indulgences'' are indeed the province of grandparents. Baking
cookies, getting to pick what's for supper ... those are the things
memories are made of. Bosak says interviews with several thousand
elementary school-age children revealed their vacation destination
of choice to be a grandparent's home, ``because it's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Young and old, we all have a basic human need to be loved. And
being needed is part of the package. The child who hears, ``You're
the best grandchild in the world'' learns to say, ``You're the best
grandpa in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple truths, maybe, but for Bosak, they are the beginnings of
life's happy endings.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR
</P>
<P>
   Building bridges for generations
</P>
<P>
   Susan Bosak's tips for building intergenerational bonds are
simple and stress-free. Here's a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   _Encourage family rituals, no matter how small. Sending cards,
baking cookies, planting seeds ... even ordering pizza on Fridays,
these all make memories. Bosak says some of the best memories are
made in the kitchen, because smells and sights move us. It really
doesn't matter that those cookies came from a mix.
</P>
<P>
   _Make regular phone dates with long-distance grandparents. Try
doing book exchanges by mail so that you can discuss the books by
phone.
</P>
<P>
   _Send a keepsake photo or item, and write down the story behind
it. Start a multigenerational family scrapbook. It's family history
made fun.
</P>
<P>
   _Bestow furniture. Assign a special piece of furniture to each
child or grandchild. Think of it as giving twice _ now and in the
future _ and it makes the recipient feel important.
</P>
<P>
   _Share your ``best memory.'' Even in a strained relationship, a
short note describing what you remember best about someone is a
powerful gift.
</P>
<P>
   _

   ``Something to Remember Me By'' ($15.95) is published by The

</P>
<P>
   3. Could you stop that thing from thumping? It's throwing my
concentration off!
</P>
<P>
   4. Wait a minute! If that's his kidney, then what's this?
</P>
<P>
   5. What do you mean he wasn't in for a sex change?
</P>
<P>
   During a tax audit
</P>
<P>
   1. Is this meant to be some sort of joke?
</P>
<P>
   2. If you sold your house today, what do you think you could get
for it?
</P>
<P>
   3. Don't think of it as prison; think of it as free room and
board.

<P>
   4. I hope you haven't made any plans for the next 20 years.

<P>
   5. You were close; you were only off by five decimal points.

<P>
   During a job performance review
</P>
<P>
   1. You weren't planning on making this your career, were you?
</P>
<P>
   2. On the positive side, you keep a very neat desk.
</P>
<P>
   3. You say your name is Grimes? I thought we fired you three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   4. It's not that we're unhappy with your performance. We just
think you'd be happier if your desk were moved out to the parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   5. Look on the positive side: You won't have to bring a covered
dish to the company picnic this summer.

   3. When was the last time you had an engine overhaul?
</P>
<P>
   4. Can you show me how to open your hood?
</P>
<P>
   5. I can never remember: Is it clockwise tighten or
counterclockwise tighten?
</P>
<P>
   On a blind date
</P>
<P>
   1. Look at this and tell me if you think it's infected.
</P>
<P>

   3. Phew! I shouldn't have had that second bowl of chili for
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   4. It probably won't happen, but if I do have a seizure, just
stick your belt in my mouth.

<P>
   5. I refuse to shave my legs for any man.

   1. Don't tell me your troubles, pal! I got problems of my own!
</P>
<P>
   2. You want a second opinion? OK, you're ugly, too!
</P>
<P>
   3. Could you talk a little faster? I've got a tee time at 11:30.
</P>
<P>
   4. If I were you I'd shoot myself.
</P>
<P>
   5. When I was in school, we used to beat up kids like you.

 &HT;    IN ALBANIA, INTERNET PROVIDES NATIVES, REFUGEES WINDOW TO
OUTSIDE WORLD
 &HT;    With Photo.

<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ In a small room one floor up from a narrow,
muddy street here in Albania's capital, you can rent a window on
the world for $3 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   For Leohora Lutolli, a 21-year-old refugee from Kosovo, the
Internet cafe Fastech provides the only outside connection she has
in a world that has unraveled so suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Serb forces forced Lutolli from her home in Kosovo's
provincial capital of Pristina at gunpoint. On Friday, she was
furiously writing e-mails to her friends who were scattered in the
exodus.
</P>
<P>
   While the Internet is becoming a common accessory in the West,
in Albania, which until 1989 was one of the world's most isolated
societies; it provides a dizzying amount of access to the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Kosovo, particularly in cities such as Pristina, the
computer culture is far better established. Many refugees coming
across the border ask reporters and aid workers awaiting them to
send e-mails to loved ones to let them know they're OK.
</P>
<P>
   And now Albania, which seems to be just awakening from a 50-year
sleep, is finding its way to the World Wide Web. ``Before a year
ago, there was no local Internet provider,'' said Sokol Bardhi, who
has worked at Fastech since it opened a few days before NATO began
bombing Yugoslavia in late March. ``Now there are three, maybe
four.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the new providers is AOL _ Albania On Line _ which has
been running frequent commercials on local television touting its
access to its American cousin with the same initials.
</P>
<P>
   But computers are still an expensive luxury in Europe's poorest
country, and the Internet remains beyond the reach of most
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Fastech -- the city's only place where people can go online for
an hourly rate -- intends to change that by providing a way to surf
the Web relatively inexpensively. In this former communist state,
Fastech is a fresh blossom of the fledgling free market. ``It has
been successful,'' Bardhi said. ``But this isn't what we planned.
We just wanted to sell the computers. This just happened and the
people like it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first floor of the small block building Friday,
foreigners as well as young Albanians typed messages and read
replies on the half-dozen computer terminals. The place has become
a favorite of journalists because local hotels charge up to $8 a
minute to plug in a modem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have many university students who have friends they
can e-mail,'' Bardhi said.
</P>
<P>
   For Lutolli, the Internet provides a more immediate and vital
purpose. ``There is no other way that I can talk to (fellow
refugees, friends and relatives), to see who is dead and who is
alive,'' she said.

DABS OF AMERICAN ROMANCE IN AN ENGLISH GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 23)  
(lh) 
 By MARTY ROSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEREFORDSHIRE, England _ A few hair-raising miles along a narrow
road from Ludlow Castle, an 11th-century ruin in west-central
England, one comes upon a garden of great distinction, the unlikely
centerpiece of which is a magnificent display of echinacea, North
America's native purple coneflower.
</P>
<P>
   The planting of echinacea in this garden at Elton Hall has been
designated a ``national collection'' by England's National Council
for the Conservation of Plants and Gardens, which is dedicated to
preserving the gene pool of garden plants. Five species and 24
cultivated varieties of echinacea thrive at Elton Hall, planted in
drifts and dabs of color in an extraordinary garden surrounded by a
fine, lacy young beech hedge.
</P>
<P>
   Purple coneflowers are members of the daisy family, the
compositae/asteraceae, one of the plant world's largest groups,
with 21,000 species. The genus echinacea is one of the smallest,
with only nine species but around 50 cultivated hybrids. They are
vigorous perennial plants with rough, handsome, deep green foliage.
The flowers' elongated petals, usually purple but also pink or
white, radiate from spiky, green-orange seed heads.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Brooks, 28, the gardener at Elton Hall, who created the
collection, has never been to America, so he has never seen
coneflowers in the prairies and open woodlands, where they
naturally flourish. He learned about them on busman's holidays in
Britain, visiting late-summer gardens. Coneflowers reach their peak
late in the season, when the bloom is likely to be off most of the
roses and the exuberant greenness of the garden demands more
assertive flowers.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 600 national collections in England, including
collections of trees, shrubs, annual and perennial flowers, bulbs
and vines. Brooks also holds a national collection of rudbeckia
(black-eyed Susans), with 25 species and 13 cultivars represented
at Elton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   His echinacea and rudbeckia were grown from seed and cuttings
from all over the world. They were sent to him by the National
Wildflower Research Center in Texas; botanic gardens in North
Carolina, Illinois, Romania, Lithuania and Switzerland, and friends
and colleagues in England, Holland and France.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really a clue why I collect,'' said Brooks, who is
just a few years out of the horticulture program at Pershore and
Hindlip College, in Worcestershire. Plant collectors often enjoy
the challenge of growing rare and difficult species, but Brooks
specializes in coneflowers because they are so easy to grow. ``They
self-seeded, and that's one indication that they are good for the
garden,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of the garden at Elton Hall run to the 18th century,
when the sprawling estate was the home of Thomas Andrew Knight
(1759-1838), a founder of what is now the Royal Horticultural
Society. There are still a few ancient cherry trees on the
property, but little else remained of Knight's garden when the
present owners, James and Anne Hepworth, bought the estate 15 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hepworth is much given to garden ornament: he has filled the
five-acre garden with curiosities _ classical columns; an enormous
stone puffin on a plinth; miscellaneous lichen-encrusted capitals,
busts and urns; a terra-cotta palm tree, and not a few statuary
elephants. There is a small Moorish palace inhabited by sheep, and
the low brick crenelations of a fort _ the merest folly _ rise
mysteriously out of the lawn behind the house.
</P>
<P>
   Hepworth's eclectic collections presented his gardener with a
formidable challenge. ``I wanted to bring it all together,'' Brooks
said. He drew a line from the brick fort to a venerable cedar, and
bisected this important axis with a path to a charming little
temple in the Gothic style. The two lines come together in the
center of what Brooks calls the ``collection garden,'' where the
coneflowers and black-eyed Susans are planted among other tall
perennials and ornamental grasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the contrast of the formal structure with the loose,
informal plants,'' he said. ``Luckily, it all worked out
perfectly.'' Word of this exuberant and romantic garden has spread
quickly: 500 visitors came to view the echinacea collection one day
last September when the garden was open to the public. (Information
is available by fax: 011-44-1568-770-753.)
</P>
<P>
   The name echinacea is derived from the Greek word for
``hedgehog'' or ``sea urchin,'' in reference to the spiny seed
heads. The petals may be single or double and may fall swirling
away from the cones, like a schoolgirl's pleated skirt, or stand
out horizontally, more like a daisy.
</P>
<P>
   The most common species are Echinacea purpurea, E. pallida and
E. angustifolia. One rare species, E. paradoxa, has yellow petals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very fond of the natural form of the wild species,
especially E. pallida, which has long twisted petals,'' Brooks
said. The petals of his striking and extremely rare Tennessee
coneflower, E. tennesseensis, jut upward around the seed head.
</P>
<P>
   Coneflowers thrive in well-drained soil in sunny gardens, and
once established they are very tolerant of drought and neglect.
Brooks mulches his plants with leaf mold, but he does not recommend
fertilizer, particularly for large varieties, which can easily
reach about 4 feet tall in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   A number of smaller echinacea varieties that produce many
flowers on branched stems have been recently introduced. Brooks
likes Augustkoningin, introduced by Piet Oudolf, a Dutch breeder.
One of the compact new hybrids is E. purpurea Magnus, hybridized in
Sweden; it was recognized as the Perennial Plant Association's
plant of the year in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coneflowers look after themselves, really, once they are
planted,'' Brooks said, but he has a backup collection, just in
case, growing in rows in the vegetable garden at Elton Hall. The
blooms are quite pretty there with the cabbages, at that.
</P>
<P>
   Most garden shops and mail-order suppliers sell two or three
coneflowers _ Magnus, White Swan, and E. purpurea are all easy to
find _ but the choices then narrow drastically. One of the best
selections is available from Thompson &AMP; Morgan, P.O. Box 1308,
Jackson, NJ 08527; (800) 274-7333; free catalog.

BUCOLIC RETREAT OFFERED SETTING FOR WORDS, TALES IN '40S

<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Writer John Malcolm Brinnin shed his
shirt and bent to peel off his pants, when a stranger interrupted
his morning sunbath on a secluded Yaddo patio.
</P>
<P>
   A clanging chime from the heavy terrace door broadcast the man's
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, shut up,'' Truman Capote said to the jangling door. ``May
I join you?'' Capote was breaking the rules. Social calls to other
rooms at this artists colony were banned before 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Capote, 21, was one of Yaddo's youngest guests. It was
the height of Yaddo's Southern period, led by the writers Carson
McCullers, Eudora Welty and Katherine Anne Porter, who had several
stays between them. Other artists at the artists colony during the
1940s included Langston Hughes, Flannery O'Connor, Robert Lowell,
Granville Hicks, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Eleanor Clark, Patricia
Highsmith, Theodore Roethke, Alfred Kazin and Marguerite Young.
</P>
<P>
   It was Capote's magnetic energy that permeated the lush parlors
and white pines of the sprawling Saratoga Springs estate, which to
this day provides a picturesque retreat for artists.
</P>
<P>
   He wove hilarious dining room tales, served martinis in his
Gothic tower room, broke house rules with abandon and had love
affairs with Newton Arvin and Howard Doughty. Doughty wanted their
tryst kept quiet, but Capote was nothing if not indiscreet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little one has been talking again,'' Doughty dryly
remarked.``He's responsible for turning the summer into a dance of
bees,'' Brinnin wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Guests plotted to share Capote's dinner table. Life magazine
featured the new author in a July issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air was thick with untellable romance, on a scale close to
legend, as to both grandeur and tragedy,'' Eleanor Clark wrote of
Yaddo.
</P>
<P>
   How could it have been otherwise?
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1843, Edgar Allan Poe is said to have penned ``The
Raven'' on this muse-infused property. Later, industrialist Spencer
Trask built a 55-room fin-de-siecle mansion for his poet wife
Katrina. After their four children died, Katrina had a vision of a
permanent artist's refuge. In 1926, four years after her death,
Yaddo opened to invited guests.
</P>
<P>
   Into this posh summer camp came great authors with great themes,
heavy symbolism and larger-than-life neuroses. They resided, free
of charge, for periods of six weeks to several months.
</P>
<P>
   At the helm, Executive Director Elizabeth Ames ran the colony
and selected the guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than Malcolm's (critic Malcolm Cowley) word and a few
published stories, I have little to recommend me,'' John Cheever
wrote to Ames in 1933. He became a frequent visitor, the captain of
Yaddo's Lake George motorboat and a member of the board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summer was long enough to get to know one another,'' wrote
Welty, who came at Porter's urging. ``Karnig Nalbandian and Colin
McPhee were installed in the same farmhouse where Katherine Anne
Porter and I were, so we had our own little neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some tensions. Porter disliked McCullers and
complained of her amateurish card shuffling in the game room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not see beginning or end to the commotion that
mysteriously possessed them,'' wrote Alfred Kazin of the writers at
Yaddo.
</P>
<P>
   At night, for kicks, the group played murder in the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the murderer,'' Lerman recalled in George Plimpton's
oral biography of Capote. ``I knew exactly what victim I wanted.
Truman. Everybody flew from room to room screeching, hiding here,
hiding there. Carson adored it. ... Finally, I lured Truman into my
closet. I strangled him. He screamed, `Oh, you, I'll get you for
this! I'll never trust you again!' It was absolutely thrilling; his
scream went up several octaves above and several octaves below: It
was the full rage of Truman. It was the manly Truman, the female
Truman, it was the works. I think the scream haunts Yaddo still.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, they managed to write chunks of their classic
works. Porter penned part of what would become ``Ship of Fools.''
Capote wrote much of his novel ``Other Voices, Other Rooms.''
McCullers wrote ``Member of the Wedding,'' which she dedicated to
Ames, Yaddo's director.
</P>
<P>
   Or they stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Porter put off several projects, including a preface to one of
Welty's books, and instead bought a dilapidated clapboard farmhouse
outside town and her first car, a Buick, which Welty helped her
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Welty had her own blocks. ``I couldn't work in Yaddo. Everybody
had a sign on their door saying, `Silence, writer at work.' I read
my proofs, but I couldn't write in there. Everything was so tense,
so exalted. So I walked into Saratoga, and to the races, and took
pictures in Saratoga. And I would bring home groceries for
Katherine Anne to cook with, and so we had a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Capote routinely got into hot water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I knew it was too good to last; I'm in trouble, and it's
all Leo's fault,'' he wrote his editor after a written scolding
from Yaddo director Ames for scaring Lerman with a snake.
</P>
<P>
   Of Ames, he wrote: ``She was always going around spying, seeing
who was working and not working and what everybody was up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Later years brought more writers, more romance, and more
prize-winning authorship.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Elizabeth Ames' stewardship was questioned in a nasty
public spat when Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Hardwick, Flannery
O'Connor and Edward Maisel accused Ames of being a communist
sympathizer and demanded her dismissal. At issue: Ames' friendship
with writer Agnes Smedley, an expert on Chinese communism and
frequent Yaddo guest. The Yaddo board rejected their claims but
stripped Ames of her power to select guests.
</P>
<P>
   Backing Ames were Cheever, Clark, Kazin, Kappo Phelan and
several others. They accused the Lowell-O'Connor group of hysterics
and anti-civil libertarianism.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, Yaddo memories were powerful and long-lived.
Patricia Highsmith, who spent just two months there in 1948, called
it the defining event of her professional life. She completed her
first published novel, ``Strangers on a Train,'' and later
bequeathed nearly $4 million to the retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``How I miss you-all at Yaddo! My stay there was most pleasant
and helpful to me,'' Langston Hughes wrote. `` And I am very happy
to have had the privilege of being there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The old Yaddo magic, some would say,'' wrote Clark, ``although
usually we just mean by that that we worked a little better, for a
little while, than we would have otherwise.''

U.S. SPINMEISTERS HELP ELECT ISRAEL'S NEW LEADER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, May 23) 
 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The television cameras were on, the videotape
machine was rolling and Adisu Massala, an Ethiopian immigrant to
Israel, was screaming into the microphone about the discrimination
he felt in the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Ehud Barak, then Labor's candidate for prime
minister, stood meekly by with an embarrassed half-grin frozen on
his face.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Barak has defeated incumbent Benjamin Netanyahu by 12
percentage points, in what for Israel amounted to a landslide
victory last Monday, Stanley Greenberg, one of Barak's U.S.
advisers, can joke about the incident. But when the incident
happened last fall during the Labor convention, he wasn't laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst thing I've ever seen in politics,'' Greenberg
recalled. ``I was sure that our numbers were going to plummet.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's polling numbers didn't go down. They were already low.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenberg and colleagues James Carville and Robert Shrum,
all veteran U.S. campaign managers, knew they had a challenge if
their Israeli client was going to win. They had to turn Barak, a
military man seemingly ill-at-ease in public and definitely not
good on camera, into a strong leader who would appeal to the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   They were up against not only Netanyahu, a past master of the
television soundbite, but also Netanyahu's adviser, American Arthur
Finkelstein, who engineered Netanyahu's 1996 come-from-behind
victory against Labor leader Shimon Peres with the slogan ``Peres
will divide Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   To put Barak more at ease in public, the Americans brought out
his wife, Nava, with whom friends say Barak is deeply in love, so
that Israelis could see the obvious affection he has for her. The
Americans also practiced with him in front of the camera. They
scheduled dozens of street appearances, so the voters could meet
him and realize his off-camera charm.
</P>
<P>
   And they pounded the message home through repeated campaign ads
that Barak was the most decorated military man in Israel's history,
the mastermind of multiple antiterrorist operations, including the
one that rescued passengers of a hijacked Sabena airlines flight in
the 1970s _ in short, someone to whom Israelis could entrust their
security.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the U.S. spinmeisters watched Barak's numbers climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a point where he did not continue to rise in
the polls,'' Greenberg said. ``The more exposure he had, the more
people warmed to him as somebody who could lead Israel. The more
they saw him, the more respect they had, the more they liked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Americans arrived, there has been some skepticism here
whether foreign campaign advisers _ even Americans who know Israel
fairly well _ are capable of understanding the intricacies of
Israel's political culture well enough to be effective. Any
Israeli, for instance, could have told Greenberg that loud public
diatribes like Massala's are par for the campaign course, blown up
in the media one day and forgotten the next.
</P>
<P>
   The Massala incident, in fact, wasn't the only one that
confounded the Americans. They were stumped again just two weeks
before the elections, when Tiki Dayan, a famous actress-singer,
called Israel's market vendors ``rabble'' at a left-wing rally that
Barak's handlers had urged him to skip.
</P>
<P>
   The incident raised a furor because Israelis interpreted the
comment as a slur against the country's Sephardic Jews _ most of
whom are blue-collar workers who hail from Middle Eastern countries
_ delivered by a member the European-descended elite, the Ashkenazi
Jews, who form the backbone of the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really delicate issue in Israel,'' said Tal
Silberstein, the Israeli point-man on the Barak campaign team.
``Labor has been known for years for being condescending toward the
Sephardic voters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard for American consultants to understand this
internal racism in Israel and the way it affects voting patterns,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Americans didn't understand the subtleties of
Israel's social divide or the checkered history behind the bumper
stickers that began to appear with the slogan, ``I am proud
rabble,`` they knew the answer: ``rapid response.`` Immediately,
they put Barak on television to denounce Dayan's words.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Carville and his associates maintain, a campaign _
any campaign _ is always won using the same basic formula: closely
monitoring of public opinion, crafting simple slogans that jibe
with the polls, and then hammering those slogans home, again and
again, until people remember them.
</P>
<P>
   The Barak campaign's polling, for instance, showed that the
Labor Party suffered from a perception among many Israelis that it
was made up of a group of elitists who looked down on the Sephardic
Jews and who were too willing to concede territory to Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   To distance himself from these images, Barak and his campaign
handlers decided to merge Labor with two other parties, one
Sephardic and one made up of religious moderates. They named the
new coalition One Israel.
</P>
<P>
   To make the break from the Labor Party complete, Barak set up a
separate headquarters for the coalition in another part of Tel Aviv
and kept veteran Laborites and peace architects Shimon Peres and
Yossi Beilin, whom Israeli's most associate with the left's
readiness to give up land, out of the campaign limelight. Barak had
a new image of a centrist leader who could unite the people.
</P>
<P>
   While those strategies undoubtedly helped sweep Barak into
office, he was aided in no small measure by Netanyahu's own
fumbles, both during the five-month campaign and the Likud leader's
three years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Likud Party officials acknowledged last week that many of their
own ad campaigns simply backfired. A television spot showing a
bombed-out bus and declaring that only Netanyahu could keep
Israelis secure, for instance, brought allegations of
``scare-mongering'' from the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ad campaign was very bad,'' admitted one Likud official
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They didn't convince anyone
to vote for us. The bus ad in particular was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans also found that Netanyahu's record in office would
help their man. In three years, the prime minister had managed to
alienate most of his political allies and anger many of his voters.
Greenberg's own polls showed that nearly one in three voters who
cast ballots for Barak voted not for the Labor leader, but against
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they've won, Barak's advisers say they knew all along
that some of Netanyahu tactics, like the bus ad, would backfire.
</P>
<P>
   Before the campaign moved into full swing, they spent a lot of
time and money producing ads they thought the other side would
make. Then they used them to test public reaction in so-called
``focus groups'' that represented pools of voters.
</P>
<P>
   When the Netanyahu campaign's bus ad aired on television,
Silberstein said, Barak's handlers were ``very happy.``
</P>
<P>
   ``Our findings suggested that the ad wouldn't work,'' he said.
``With Barak's record, it's almost impossible to allege that he
won't keep Israel's security.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time, the ``Barak bio,`` the ad that pounded his
impressive military record into voters' heads and the one his spin
advisers said was the most effective, had been running for days.
The ad was persuasive, polls showed, particularly among Russian
immigrants, who make up a large part of Israel's swing vote and who
tend to vote for right-wing candidates who emphasize issues of
security.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before the election, Greenberg recalled, he was given
the results of a poll that showed Barak ahead by 14 percentage
points. He called Shrum and told him he was assuming the poll was
wrong and was throwing it out.
</P>
<P>
   Then the next poll came in.
</P>
<P>
   It, too, showed Barak with the same 14-point lead. Soon,
Israel's press, responding to polls of its own, predicted victory
for a man who only months before they had derided as too stiff, too
shy and bumbling in public to ever beat Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Three days before Election Day, the U.S. consultants were so
confident of their success that Carville flew home to the United
States to see his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that we were going to win,'' Greenberg smiled. &QL;

A SENTIMENTAL FAREWELL FOR `MAD ABOUT YOU' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, May 24)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
MAD ABOUT YOU 
Starring: Paul Reiser, Helen Hunt 
On: NBC 
Time: Monday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, with the end of ``Seinfeld'' looming, NBC held on
tightly to ``Mad About You.'' The network didn't want to lose two
of its signature sitcoms at once, and so it agreed to pay stars
Helen Hunt and Paul Reiser $1 million per episode to keep the show
going.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC was in denial: ``Mad About You'' was already off most of
our screens, having lost its creative juice sometime around the
time Jamie and Paul Buchanan had a daughter, Mabel. Once a
delightfully nuanced comedy about a fast-paced urban relationship,
the comedy had deteriorated into a series of raucous gags,
far-fetched plot devices, and stunt cameos. Only the resilient
chemistry between Hunt and Reiser remained at all vital.
</P>
<P>
   After seven seasons, the series finally says farewell. The
hourlong finale is presented in the form of a documentary film made
in the future by the adult Mabel, played by Janeane Garofalo. Mabel
turns out to be a fairly abrasive woman who is quite critical of
her parents, and as she tells their story through to the end, she
deromanticizes all of their quirks. ``My mother the handful,'' she
moans when Jamie asks Paul to have a vasectomy, then undo it, then
do it again. Just as in the ``Seinfeld'' finale, which asked us to
see the characters' actions in a less-than-comic light, the ``Mad
About You'' closer sheds a bit of moral judgment on the Buchmans.
</P>
<P>
   But just a bit. By the end of the hour, the show gains a more
appropriate sentimental tone, and fans will feel a sense of
emotional closure. Mabel's film (called ``The Reason I'm Like
This'') also outlines the fate of all the regular supporting
characters, including Ira, Debbie, Nat, Ursula, and, last but not
least, Murray the dog.

TOUGH EARLY-ROUND MATCHES POSSIBLE AT ROLAND GARROS 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By KATHLEEN McELROY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The French Open draw has created a couple of intriguing _
potentially dangerous _ early matches for both the top-ranked men's
and women's players.
</P>
<P>
   The draw, which was conducted Friday in Paris, pits two former
champions at Roland Garros in the men's first round: top-seeded
Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the 1996 champion, against Michael Chang, the
winner 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Neither player is on a roll as the tournament begins Monday in
southwest Paris. Kafelnikov is ranked No. 1 but has been in a slump
since winning the Australian Open in January. On Friday he lost to
little-known Mariano Zabaleta of Argentina in the semifinals of an
Austrian event.
</P>
<P>
   Chang was 17 when he became the youngest male Grand Slam
champion with his French Open victory in 1989. But he has yet to
win another Grand Slam title and now is down to No. 50 in the ATP
computer ranking, having slipped since an injury-plagued season
last year. Kafelnikov leads their series by 3-0, but the two have
never met on clay.
</P>
<P>
   The most anticipated early-round match in the women's draw might
occur in the second round, where top-ranked Martina Hingis could
face Amelie Mauresmo, the French player she beat the Australian
Open final earlier this year. Hingis later came under fire for
making what were considered anti-gay remarks about Mauresmo. When
the two played indoors in Paris a month later, the French crowd
loudly cheered as their countrywoman defeated Hingis in three sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a soccer match; it could have been France against
Brazil,'' Hingis said after the loss. ``They were incredible, even
if they were against me.''
</P>
<P>
   The matchup at Roland Garros could provide similar sparks, but
first Hingis has to get past face Amanda Hopmans of the Netherlands
while Mauresmo opens against Tara Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   The top half of the women's draw has Hingis, the Williams
sisters, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, the defending champion, and Jana
Novotna. Second-seeded Lindsay Davenport, who is overcoming a
left-wrist injury, anchors the lower half, along with former
champions Steffi Graf and Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams, winner of the German and Italian Open titles on
clay, opens against Alexandra Fusai of France but could face
Natasha Zvereva, a French Open finalist in 1988, in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-seeded Sanchez-Vicario will open against Mirjana
Lucic of Croatia, who has been slowed by injuries all year. Monica
Seles, a three-time champion and last year's finalist, has a
first-round match against China's Fang Li. Steffi Graf, who has
five French Open titles, will face Maggie Maleeva.
</P>
<P>
   In other first-round matchups, fourth-seeded Carlos Moya, the
defending men's champion, will face Markus Hipfl, an Austrian
playing in his first Grand Slam event. Also in Moya's section of
the draw are Thomas Muster, who won the 1995 French Open, and Andre
Agassi, a two-time finalist. Agassi, who is suffering from a
shoulder injury, opens against 39th-ranked Franco Squillari, who
won earlier this month at Munich and upset Moya at Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Second-ranked Pete Sampras, in search of the one Grand Slam
title he has not won, starts against Juan Antonio Marin, a
88th-ranked Costa Rican. The two have never played.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is in the same half of the draw with Pat Rafter, who
defeated him, 6-3, 7-5, Friday at the World Team Cup in Dusseldorf,
Germany. Rafter opens against 17-year-old Roger Federer, the junior
world champion from Switzerland. Federer is ranked only 114th but
defeated Moya earlier this year.

`MELROSE PLACE': TIME TO MOVE ON

   ``Melrose Place'' earned its stripes back in 1994, when it
brought Kimberly Shaw Mancini back from the dead. This neat
resurrection was a godsend to those of us who couldn't get enough
of the show's camp, poolside villainy. Sure, Heather Locklear's
Amanda thrilled us with her wicked ways, issuing divisive commands
without mussing her perfectly blow-dried hair. But Kimberly wasn't
just your run-of-the-mill bitch icon: She was a deranged,
hallucinating sicko who once won early graduation from a No More
Victims camp after breaking the sergeant's arm. What ``Melrose''
fan can forget the ne plus ultra of Kimberly scenes, when she
pulled off her wig to reveal a shaved head lined with a gruesome
scar?
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days. By 1996, ``Melrose Place'' had passed its
peak, and its best bad moments revolved around Lisa Rinna's sloppy,
I've-just-been-smacked lip job. The cheesy magic was gone for good,
and the show proceeded into a late '90s blur of generic pretty
faces and repetitive plot contortions. Once operatic in its wacky
melodrama, ``Melrose Place'' aged into a chaotic and pedestrian
effort that lost the power to build suspense from week to week.
After years of shameless toying with conventional soap themes such
as incest, infertility, alcoholism, adoption, and amnesia, the
``Melrose'' writers seemed to have no gall left in them.
</P>
<P>
   And so ``Melrose Place'' leaves the air after seven seasons
without a chorus of grief, the sort of viewer mourning that greets
the cancellation of beloved shows such as ``Homicide.'' After all,
most of us know that ``Melrose'' has been on life support for too
long now, and that it deserves to find peace in the graveyard of
dead series.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the finale, which Fox has been promoting for months,
promises to be worth watching. Not because all those specific
questions will be answered: Did Amanda beat Kent to death, as Eve
pictured in her hypnosis? Will Jane tell Kyle that she's pregnant?
Is Ryan's daughter dead? Are Peter and Amanda going to end up
together? No, the real attraction of the finale is finding out
whether the writers will dare to go over the top for old time's
sake _ an earthquake, perhaps (wouldn't it be fun to watch those
stucco courtyard walls come tumbling down?) or maybe the return of
Kimberly (again).
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to forget that Aaron Spelling's series began its life
as a dud, a stiff, issue-oriented cousin to another Spelling
production, ``Beverly Hills 90210.'' The idea was to pit a group of
shiny, happy twentysomethings against demons such as unemployment
and dating, but when the show failed to generate ratings for Fox,
the social realism was dumped in favor of conscience-free glitz.
Midway through the first season, Spelling drafted ``Dynasty'' alum
Locklear to spearhead the new approach, and we never looked back.
Locklear's power-hungry Amanda brought everyone into the moral
gutter with her, dividing and conquering Alison and Billy and then
Jo and Jake, who traded in his integrity to become her paramour.
Dutiful husband Michael Mancini was remade into a randy, adulterous
blackmailer, and Jane Mancini became temperamental enough to throw
the wedding china at him.
</P>
<P>
   Even the cliffhangers got garish, with Alison fleeing her own
wedding and Kimberly donning a blond Jane wig to run over Michael
in Jane's car. And it no longer mattered that most of the actors
were limited, most notably Andrew Shue and Locklear herself, whose
B-level technique is amusingly mediocre. During its best phase, the
object of ``Melrose Place'' was pure back-stabbing, hair-pulling,
death-defying fun.

 &HT;    MORE AIRCRAFT, PILOTS GROUNDED FOR LACK OF PARTS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the latest sign of declining military readiness,
a spare parts shortage is grounding more Air Force planes, which
are then cannibalized for parts to keep other aircraft in flying
condition, says a new government audit.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force's disabled list for major aircraft climbed to 13.9
percent last year, more than double the 6.4 percent listed as ``not
mission capable'' in 1990, according to a study released this week
by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Grounded planes were, in turn, blamed for curtailing flight
training for pilots. Crews for B1-Bs and F-16s, for example,
reported they completed only 83 percent of training required to be
qualified as combat-ready last year.
</P>
<P>
   The review of more than a dozen Air Force installations provided
new details about a problem that has attracted growing attention on
Capitol Hill. Congress this week passed an emergency spending bill
for the Kosovo air war that includes $2.3 billion for spare parts,
maintenance and training.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO findings indicated that mismanagement was at the root of
the current repairs and maintenance problems. The report faulted
the Air Force for relying on efforts to streamline supply lines
that instead led to more logjams.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO also faults the Air Force Materiel Command at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, for delays in
fixing broken parts. ``Although component part shortages have been
a longstanding and well-documented problem, the Air Force Materiel
Command has not yet developed an effective plan to correct the
problem,'' said the study. It said the command suffered from
shortages of both maintenance personnel and materials.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the facility, Dave Levingston, said Friday that
there would be no immediate reaction because top officials were
``involved in meetings keeping supplies flowing to Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Pentagon's response, Under Secretary of Defense William
J. Lynn concurred with the findings and said that a new study of
the problem was under way. ``The Air Force is already taking action
to improve its supply parts availability, `` he wrote, citing plans
to increase funds for the effort starting next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major conclusions of the study, Air Force maintenance
personnel were found to waste thousands of hours removing parts
from one aircraft to use in another. In the case of the B1-B, for
example, the average number of such ``cannibalizations'' was 96 for
every 100 sorties the plane flew last year.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the labor-intensive practice equated to
about 43 people working eight hours a day, five days a week for two
years at two Air Force commands, Langley Air Force Base, Va., and
Scott Air Force Base, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The report also traced a slowdown in repairs to disruptions as
the work was transferred from the San Antonio Air Logistics Center
in Texas to the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center in Georgia.

REISER, HUNT LEAVING THE PARTY AFTER SEVEN SEASONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Runs with Sidebar slugged MADABOUT- FINALE ). 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Co-creator and co-star Paul Reiser pitched ``Mad
About You'' as having ``the feeling of ... a couple's car ride home
after a party, when you can finally say what you've been thinking
all night.'' It's been a long, strange trip from the show's debut
in 1992: The Buchmans have had fights, adventures and a baby. Now,
they're signing off after seven years on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we kept the show fresh was by keeping it fresh for us.
That, hopefully, keeps it exciting for the audience,'' Reiser said
in a phone interview to discuss the show's final episode, airing
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have complained that the show, once widely heralded
as inventive, has slid in quality during the past season. Reiser
and his co-star, Helen Hunt, defend the show. Reiser admitted that
being ``shuffled around'' in the NBC schedule probably has hurt the
show's ratings but insists that ``Mad'' has remained top-notch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both of us feel the shows this year have been as good
or better than we've ever done. The finale is one of the best
things we've done,'' Reiser said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt chimed in that she felt the show had stayed creative
through its entire run. ``I hear on other shows, there are almost
Talmudic discussions about everything, every week,'' Hunt said.
``They're constantly asking themselves, `Is it emotionally true, is
it funny, is it risky?' These things have been there from the
beginning, without a break, for us.''
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of sheer uniqueness, the show's finale is certainly
a success (see accompanying story). The episode was written by
Reiser, Hunt and co-executive producer (with Reiser) Victor Levin;
the story is told in flashback, with the pivotal character of the
Buchmans' grown-up daughter played by comedic actress Janeane
Garofalo, who has never been on the show.
</P>
<P>
   The episode was directed by Hunt, who says she wouldn't be
surprised if not all viewers will react positively to it. ``Our
final episode is bold, it's risky, it's not what people will expect
or will have seen,'' said Hunt, who has become an Academy
Award-winning movie actress while the series has been on
television. ``But by definition, anything artful or risky (is going
to get mixed reaction). It just means you're trying something
new.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Hunt and Reiser say they're looking forward to taking some
time off after seven years of TV work. ``I'd like to do a lot of
new stuff, but also do nothing for a while,'' Reiser said. ``I'm
looking forward to letting the creative well fill up a little bit
again. I'd like to write a couple of screenplays.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt says that after taking ``at least'' the summer off from
work, her long-term goal is to make films. ``I have a company
(Hunt-Tavel Productions, based at Sony) that's trying to make
movies that we love,'' Hunt said. ``I pray for good scripts to
direct, and for wonderful parts to come along.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress did get a great part in 1997's ``As Good as It
Gets,'' for which she won an Oscar as best actress. In fact, she
became the only woman to win both an Oscar and an Emmy in the same
year as best actress: She won the television award for best actress
in a comedy series in 1996, 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she says she'd also like to do some more directing as well
as acting _ though she's finding it harder than anticipated to find
the right projects. ``It's no easier trying to find a good script
you want to direct than it is to find good roles for women,'' Hunt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reiser, on the other hand, has no ambition to direct. ``Let me
tell you something about Paul,'' said Hunt, who has become close
friends with Reiser over the years. ``On one of our first days on
the set, Paul watched our director running around and said, `I
never want to do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've remained true to that conviction,'' cracked Reiser.
</P>
<P>
   Both say they'll miss the show. The people working on ``Mad''
have become ``like a family,'' said Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk to any guest actor who's been on our show, they
would say, `Where's the yelling?'' said Hunt, describing the
production's collegial atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word got around that it was fun to work on our show,'' added
Reiser. ``I don't think people like Jerry Lewis and Yoko Ono had
done TV comedies before ... we got to work with incredible people.
I think everyone we needed and who's been on the show wanted to be
part of the finale.''
</P>
<P>
   Those stars include Carol Burnett, Tim Conway and Lyle Lovett,
who all returned for the show's final episode. Hunt describes the
last day on the set as sad, yet proud. ``We took time on the last
day to sob a lot and talk about what a great experience it's
been,'' Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Both she and Reiser say they had a sense that they were ending
the show at the right time, after deciding last year to stay with
the show one more season. ``There's really no show we feel we
didn't get to do,'' Reiser said. ``You can't ask for more than
that. That's how you know it's time to close up shop.'' &UR;  &QL;

WILL AUDIENCE BE MAD ABOUT FINAL EPISODE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ How do you write about an episode that's one big
surprise, that the stars say they haven't even told their families
the plot of?
</P>
<P>
   This much we can tell you: Janeane Garofalo plays the Buchmans'
daughter, Mabel, all grown up. She has followed in her father's
footsteps, becoming a filmmaker. She has issues with her upbringing
_ big, thorny issues.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you like ``Mad About You's'' final episode or not may
hinge largely on how much you like the caustic humor of Garofalo,
who has starred in such films as ``The Truth About Cats and Dogs''
and was a frequent guest on HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show.'' She
comes across as grating for most of the hourlong episode, though in
the end, she and the story may win you over.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told in flashback, with several surprise
revelations of events that occurred in the lives of the characters
between the last regular episode and the 21st-century setting of
this show. Most of the scenes are very funny; a few fall flat.
</P>
<P>
   The final installment of the Buchman saga at least gives more of
a sense of completion than many final episodes, which have left the
future of their characters hanging. If you care about these
characters, it should leave you with a nice feeling. If you don't,
you may be left with the sense that the writers of the show tried
to throw a little bit of everything into the finale, resulting in
an episode that's a little too disjointed and an ending that's a
bit too pat. &QL;

   ORANGE, N.J. _ Inside Home Dairy, a sliver of a store that sells
candy, cigarettes and newspapers, people mill around all day
searching for phantom riches: writing down numbers and scratching
tickets in a nonstop frenzy that amounts to $14,400 in average
weekly lottery sales.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the store's name, only a few cartons of milk are sold
each day. More customers come looking for ``dream books,'' which
sell for $3 to $5 and offer advice on what lottery numbers should
be associated with a dream or daily occurrence. If a person dreams
about a cat, one book advises, the number to play is 114. If the
cat is black, the number is 244. And if a person buys a hat, the
book recommends 815 or 816.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the store one evening, Dennis Dutton, a 36-year-old
custodian who bets on numbers every day, explained how important a
lottery jackpot was to his financial planning. Throughout the
month, Dutton said, he intended to bet $15 each day on the number
898. At the time, his telephone was disconnected and he was hoping
that hitting the number _ for winnings of about $2,750 _ would help
pay his bills. ``I wish that 898 would come out,`` he said,
``because it would solve all my problems.'' (It did not.)
</P>
<P>
   In this working-class neighborhood, 18 miles west of Manhattan,
as in similar areas across the country, the state-sponsored daily
lottery is becoming so deeply woven into so many lives that it is a
part of the social fabric. It is a ritual as routine as watching
the nightly news, a practice far more common than voting.
</P>
<P>
   With lottery machines as prevalent as cash registers in the 38
states with lotteries, instant-win tickets hanging behind store
counters everywhere, and $35 billion bet each year across the
country, the most prevalent purveyor of betting games in America is
no longer the street corner sports bookmaker or the Las Vegas
casino operator.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is the state governments _ the same entities that
for years outlawed gambling _ that are now leading the way in
building widespread acceptance of gambling across the country. The
impact that state lotteries are having on communities around the
country has also been a major focus of the National Gambling Impact
Study Commission, which was appointed in 1996 by President Clinton
and Congress to examine the social and economic consequences of
legalized gambling in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which in June is scheduled to release a report
of its two-year-long study, is expected to recommend that state
lotteries curtail their advertising in economically distressed
communities and that they be required to contribute some of their
revenues to research and treatment for problem gambling.
</P>
<P>
   It is in communities like Orange where the lottery is a dominant
force and many poor and modest wage earners are devoted to an
endless search for winning numbers and an unswerving belief that a
jackpot waits for them.
</P>
<P>
   The Players: The Best Customers Can Least Afford It
</P>
<P>
   A close look at Orange, and a New York Times computer analysis
of lottery playing in New Jersey, provide a compelling picture of
just how vital the people who live and work in neighborhoods like
this one are to the lottery business.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than previously known, modest-wage earners, the poor
and less educated people spend a greater percentage of their income
on the lottery than do wealthier residents of the state, the Times
analysis found.
</P>
<P>
   Using 1998 New Jersey lottery data, the analysis found that in
the zip codes where people with the lowest incomes live, the amount
spent per $10,000 of income on lottery tickets was more than five
times the amount spent on tickets by people who live in wealthier
zip codes. The analysis was calculated from information on 48,875
lottery winners and estimates based on census data.
</P>
<P>
   It found that for a chance to cash in on an instant-win scratch
ticket, people living in the 100 lowest average-income zip codes in
New Jersey spent $53 per $10,000 of their earnings. But in the 100
zip codes with the highest-average income, spending on instant-win
tickets was just $12 per $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   And for the Pick 4 game, which can pay as much as $2,788 for a
50-cent bet on the correct four numbers, and is one of the state's
most popular games, people in the 100 lowest-income zip codes spent
$29 per $10,000 income, compared with $5 per $10,000 income in the
100 highest-income zip codes, according to the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, people who are less educated also spend far more
money playing the lottery. In the zip codes with the lowest
percentage of people with college educations, people spent more
than five times as much per $10,000 of income than those in areas
with the highest proportion of college-educated population.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis is consistent with those in other states that have
shown that as a percentage of household income, poorer people in
cities and rural areas alike, spend much more on the lottery than
do people in high-income brackets. Caught in a perpetual state of
living from paycheck to paycheck, they are easily captured by the
notion that the lottery can fulfill their basic financial goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Justification: Little Return Seen in Education Funds
</P>
<P>
   ``The lottery's best customers,'' said Scott Harshbarger, former
attorney general of Massachusetts and a critic of state lotteries,
``are those who can least afford to throw their money away.''
</P>
<P>
   And while these customers put far more money into the lottery,
there is little evidence that they get more back.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of the lottery across the country was propelled
largely by the politically palatable promise to use the proceeds to
help finance education. People might lose their money, the
reasoning went, but they can feel all right about it knowing that
its going to a good cause.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, as in many states, however, the proceeds from the
lottery go to the state treasurer. Although those lottery dollars
are indeed used to augment educational spending, studies have shown
that lotteries have not increased the net amount spent on education
but have only given the states a larger pool from which to allocate
those funds. And areas of the state where large percentages of
lottery revenues are generated do not receive a proportional amount
of state aid in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the money we spend on the lottery,'' said Orange's
mayor, Mimms Hackett, Jr., ``I think we would be in much better
shape if it was equated with the amount we get from the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lou Murphy, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of
Taxation, said that although the games may take a larger proportion
of income from poorer people, playing is voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state does not ursurp rights and privileges based on
economic status,'' Ms. Murphy said. ``Their chances of winning may
not be very good, but it's an exciting thing.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Numbers: So Many Chances, So Many Ways
</P>
<P>
   The statistics come to life here in Orange, where up and down
Main Street and all along the thoroughfares that intersect the
city's thriving business district, the state lottery's familiar
green and yellow four-leaf clover logo is pasted on windows.
</P>
<P>
   On some days, a local storefront psychic adviser hangs a sign
out offering ``lucky numbers.'' And each day inside a check-cashing
store, customers line up in front of one teller to cash their
payroll and Social Security checks, then move a few steps to
another teller to buy instant scratch tickets and daily lottery
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   With its ubiquitous advertisements and tickets on sale all
around them, the lottery is always right there _ whispering in
their ears, reminding them that it only takes one lucky drawing to
finance their retirement, cover college expenses for their
children, or buy the house they have always wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You notice in urban areas, there are a lot of people who have
not made it to the top by a certain age,'' Mayor Hackett said.
``The lottery becomes the only outlet for that dream. Success for a
lot of people is predicated on hitting the number.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers underscore the significant role that the lottery
plays in Orange. Throughout New Jersey, where the median household
income is $55,209, there are 8.1 million residents and 6,000
lottery outlets _ about one lottery machine for every 1,350
residents.
</P>
<P>
   But in Orange, where the median household income is $37,529,
there are 30,000 residents and 33 stores selling lottery tickets,
or about one machine for every 909 residents. And while weekly per
capita lottery sales are $3.92 statewide, they are $6.87 in Orange.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of about 30,000 that is 70 percent black, 20
percent white and 10 percent Hispanic, the City of Orange Township,
as this urban-suburban municipality is formally named, has homes
that range from old, well-kept mansions to aging two-family frame
houses and daunting public housing complexes. Bus drivers, office
workers, nurses, police officers and janitors are among those who
regularly line up for lottery tickets here.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the nightly three-digit and four-digit drawings
that are held seven days a week, residents buy tickets for a
five-digit drawing that is held three days a week, a six-digit
drawing held twice a week, and a once-weekly matching game with 21
sets of four numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But even more popular are the dozens of types of colorful
instant lottery tickets, which sell so briskly that lottery
officials have begun placing them in automatic vending machines,
and marketing them as special occasion gifts _ with names like
``Happy Birthday'' and ``Merry Money'' _ and decorative envelopes.
</P>
<P>
   At the Majestic Barber Shop, where the haircuts cost $10, all
three barbers play the numbers every day. In between customers,
Hilliard Kelly runs down to the corner deli to buy instant tickets.
At $1 to $2 each, Kelly buys about four instant tickets a day and
spends about $10 on the daily number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come out behind,'' he said, sitting in his barber chair,
using a coin to scratch a ticket called ``50 Grand.'' (It was a
loser.) ``But I keep going back. Once you get used to playing those
rub-offs, it's hard to walk in a store with money in your pocket
and not buy one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Players: A Way of Life For One Couple
</P>
<P>
   Among the many people who play every day are Emmett and Mary
Newsome. A full-time local bus driver by night, Mrs. Newsome spends
her days operating the Top Chef restaurant, serving takeout soul
food like pork chops smothered in gravy, collard greens and peach
cobbler and sweet potato pie.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Newsome has played the lottery for more than 20 years,
spending about $12 a day all week to play numbers that correspond
with family members' birthdays, home addresses or whatever might
catch her attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play the lottery all the time,'' she said, standing behind
the counter of the sparsely adorned restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has never tallied her total losses against her
winnings, she said she believed she had come out ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like the lottery,'' she said proudly. ``You
can always make a little money from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Newsome is now seeking something that she is certain will
increase her business: a lottery machine. She has applied to the
state to become a ticket agent, and her application is pending.
Agents receive 5 percent of their ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get my own lottery machine,'' she said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Newsome, who works at a nearby powder-coating plant, applying
protective coatings to metal products, has developed his own system
of tracking past winning numbers to determine patterns. In a ritual
that is performed in the family's house each morning, Newsome rises
at 4:30 a.m., puts on his robe and walks downstairs to the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   After turning on a pot of water for his instant coffee, he sits
at the table and in front of him he places several memo pads and
worn file cards that have hundreds of three-digit numbers written
on them.
</P>
<P>
   Painstakingly, Newsome creates charts based on factors like
which lottery hostess on television picks the numbers on which day
of the week. (A lottery drawing is held every day except Christmas
in New Jersey.) Although the drawing is totally random, Newsome is
convinced that there is a pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see here that 994 has come out three times on Sunday,'' he
said as he sat down to make his selections one recent Sunday
morning. Lighting up a Marlboro 100 and scooping four heaping
tablespoons of sugar into a large mug of coffee, he predicted, ``I
think that 994 is going to come back today.'' (It did not.) Based
on the information Newsome compiles each morning, he writes down
his 20 favorite numbers for the day, and leaves a copy on the table
for his wife. She decides which ones she will play.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tally how much the Newsomes spend or win, because
in addition to the game itself, there is a little gamesmanship
between the two. A couple of months ago, Mrs. Newsome played one of
the numbers her husband had suggested and she won more than $300.
When Newsome asked her whether she had played it, she told him she
had not. ``I know he's hitting a lot of times and ain't saying
nothing to me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, according to Newsome's day planner, the couple won on
four consecutive days, for a total of more than $1,000. ``That was
a good week,'' Newsome said. But throughout most of two months
early this year, the Newsomes were playing every day and were not
having any luck.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of one month, Newsome was growing anxious. ``We
could sure use the money,'' he said one evening as he walked up to
the counter at Home Dairy and played 172, 578, 198, and 574. (They
were all losers; the winning three-digit number that evening was
416.)

   The Suspicions: Black Winners, White Winners
</P>
<P>
   Despite their daily devotion to the lottery, a large number of
the people who play numbers in this city say they believe that the
state lottery is rigged. While they have no proof, they constantly
complain that most winners of big Pick 6 Lotto jackpots come from
areas of the state that are predominantly white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time when I win on rub-offs,'' said Kelly, the
barber, ``I bought my ticket from a white neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia E. Haines, executive director of the New Jersey state
lottery, sighs with frustration when she hears of such suspicions.
Everywhere Ms. Haines goes in the state, she said in an interview
at her Trenton office, people complain that the big winners never
come from their own region.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, statistics show that the number of big winners from a
particular region is commensurate with the number of tickets sold
in that region. For example, Essex and Hudson counties are among
the those with the highest amount of lottery sales in the state.
And since 1996, the two counties are tied for the most of Pick 6
Lotto winners, at 14 each.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Ms. Haines said, the Lotto numbers are selected
randomly, and the instant tickets are dispersed in a manner
assuring that the winning tickets are randomly distributed. Still,
even among the most experienced lottery players, the criticism
persists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't put the Lotto winners in the black areas and they
can't convince me otherwise,'' Myra Russell asserted, speaking of
the ``quick picks,'' in which a player lets a computer select the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ms. Russell, who lives in Orange, has played the
New Jersey lottery since it became computerized in 1975. Back then,
she worked at an Orange liquor store, operating the lottery machine
every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started with them and I know,'' she said as she bought her
daily tickets inside a local check-cashing store. ``To me, the New
Jersey lottery is a big joke,'' she snapped _ all the while
stuffing her tickets into her pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Although modern-day lotteries have been legal in New Jersey for
just 29 years, people in and around Orange were betting on illegal
lotteries long before that. As in many poor and working-class
cities around the country, the illegal numbers, which were known as
policy, had flourished for decades. People could play for pennies
and the daily three-digit number was determined by the total amount
of money bet at a specified horse racetrack that day.
</P>
<P>
   Until white residents began moving out in the 1970s, Orange was
largely populated by working-class people of Italian and Irish
descent, and John J. Kunz, a native of Orange and the general
manager of Town Check Cashing, said, ``Everybody played the
number.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jackpot: One City Awaits A Big Winner
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lou Williams, who operates the lottery machine at Town
Check Cashing and formerly owned Home Dairy, said many of her
customers had been buying lottery tickets from her for more than
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have a lot of fun selling tickets,'' Ms. Williams
said. ``Now it's much more serious. People are determined they're
going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams does not make as much money from lottery sales as
she once did because there are too many ticket outlets in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays I'm like a spider in a web,'' she said. ``There's one
on every corner.''
</P>
<P>
   While there may be plenty of places to play the lottery in this
city, finding someone who has actually won a big jackpot is not as
easy. When asked whether they could provide any big winners from
Orange, lottery officials said they had winners in surrounding
areas, but none who had actually bought their tickets in Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Photocopies of winning tickets are prominently displayed above
the counter at Home Dairy, but based on the serial numbers on the
winning tickets, they were sold at stores elsewhere in the state.
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening, Stanley Micheaux, 69, who uses part of his
twice-monthly disability payments to play the numbers each day,
gazed skeptically at the winners pasted up inside Home Dairy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, how long have those things been up there?'' Micheaux
asked. ``They make us think we're going to win, but we ain't going
to win a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hopes: A Possible Jackpot Is Always Present
</P>
<P>
   When Emmett Newsome pulls his number-covered file cards from his
wallet, the first thing a person notices is the dirt on the cards,
and then his hands. The skin is dry and cracked, his fingertips are
covered with a greasy film.
</P>
<P>
   They are the hands of a man who labors for a living, and
Newsome, who is 54, hopes that one day he will win a big lottery
jackpot and be able to wash his hands of the more than 20 years he
has worked at metal-coating plants.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in the tough Howard Street area of Newark, he has been
involved in the daily numbers since he was a young boy working as a
``runner,'' picking up betting slips for his ``Uncle Soldier,'' who
ran an illegal numbers racket.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Newsome, 51, has been a bus driver for New Jersey Transit
for 20 years, and whether the couple win a big lottery prize or
not, she plans for them eventually to retire from their jobs, sell
the restaurant and move to her native South Carolina. Her only
misgiving about returning to South Carolina is that the state has
no lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame they don't have a lottery because people need to
have some way to try to make a little extra money,'' Mrs. Newsome
said.
</P>
<P>
   [On April 7, however, legislation in South Carolina moved a step
closer to allowing voters to decide in 2000 on whether to establish
a lottery.)
</P>
<P>
   The couple's 15-year-old daughter, Monique, struggles to
understand her parents' obsession with the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I know that sometimes you win, but you also lose,''
she said.  &QL;

<P>
   ORANGE, N.J. _ Inside Home Dairy, a sliver of a store that sells
candy, cigarettes and newspapers, people mill around all day
searching for phantom riches: writing down numbers and scratching
tickets in a nonstop frenzy that amounts to $14,400 in average
weekly lottery sales.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the store's name, only a few cartons of milk are sold
each day. More customers come looking for ``dream books,'' which
sell for $3 to $5 and offer advice on what lottery numbers should
be associated with a dream or daily occurrence. If a person dreams
about a cat, one book advises, the number to play is 114. If the
cat is black, the number is 244. And if a person buys a hat, the
book recommends 815 or 816.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the store one evening, Dennis Dutton, a 36-year-old
custodian who bets on numbers every day, explained how important a
lottery jackpot was to his financial planning. Throughout the
month, Dutton said, he intended to bet $15 each day on the number
898. At the time, his telephone was disconnected and he was hoping
that hitting the number _ for winnings of about $2,750 _ would help
pay his bills. ``I wish that 898 would come out,`` he said,
``because it would solve all my problems.'' (It did not.)
</P>
<P>
   In this working-class neighborhood, 18 miles west of Manhattan,
as in similar areas across the country, the state-sponsored daily
lottery is becoming so deeply woven into so many lives that it is a
part of the social fabric. It is a ritual as routine as watching
the nightly news, a practice far more common than voting.
</P>
<P>
   With lottery machines as prevalent as cash registers in the 38
states with lotteries, instant-win tickets hanging behind store
counters everywhere, and $35 billion bet each year across the
country, the most prevalent purveyor of betting games in America is
no longer the street corner sports bookmaker or the Las Vegas
casino operator.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is the state governments _ the same entities that
for years outlawed gambling _ that are now leading the way in
building widespread acceptance of gambling across the country. The
impact that state lotteries are having on communities around the
country has also been a major focus of the National Gambling Impact
Study Commission, which was appointed in 1996 by President Clinton
and Congress to examine the social and economic consequences of
legalized gambling in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which in June is scheduled to release a report
of its two-year-long study, is expected to recommend that state
lotteries curtail their advertising in economically distressed
communities and that they be required to contribute some of their
revenues to research and treatment for problem gambling.
</P>
<P>
   It is in communities like Orange where the lottery is a dominant
force and many poor and modest wage earners are devoted to an
endless search for winning numbers and an unswerving belief that a
jackpot waits for them.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, people who are less educated also spend far more
money playing the lottery. In the zip codes with the lowest
percentage of people with college educations, people spent more
than five times as much per $10,000 of income than those in areas
with the highest proportion of college-educated population.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis is consistent with those in other states that have
shown that as a percentage of household income, poorer people in
cities and rural areas alike, spend much more on the lottery than
do people in high-income brackets. Caught in a perpetual state of
living from paycheck to paycheck, they are easily captured by the
notion that the lottery can fulfill their basic financial goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lottery's best customers,'' said Scott Harshbarger, former
attorney general of Massachusetts and a critic of state lotteries,
``are those who can least afford to throw their money away.''
</P>
<P>
   And while these customers put far more money into the lottery,

MEET KARA AND LYNN `MAINSTREAM COOL TEENS'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PENELOPE GREEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kara Hamilton, 18, and Lynn Liran, 17, look pretty
much like teen-agers do across the country. On a recent sunny
Monday afternoon, Kara had on scuffed white Nikes, faded Levis and
a cream-colored, knitted Gap shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn wore a lavender tank top of indeterminate provenance, brown
boot-cut Gap jeans, worn brown boots and green eye shadow. The two
best friends, seniors at the Spence School in Manhattan, had their
backs turned resolutely on Madison Avenue and seemed eager to munch
on apple crumb pie at Sarabeth's restaurant and to patiently
discuss subjects both dear and foreign to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really mind being a specimen,'' Kara said graciously.
``That's not necessarily an unpowerful thing to be, and anyway, I
understand that adults are puzzled.''
</P>
<P>
   Kara and Lynn have grown used to expounding on this and that for
grown-ups carrying notebooks and video cameras, and the girls exude
a sort of resigned politeness no matter what you ask them. In 1997,
they were hired by the DuPont Co. to contribute to a panel of
teen-agers the company had assembled as part of a $30 million
promotion of its Lycra fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for new and improved ways to separate teen-agers from
their money, DuPont has moved beyond the typical practice of buying
information on teen-agers' brand, celebrity and sitcom preferences
culled by marketing companies specializing in teen-agers. Like a
growing number of companies, including Levis and M&AMP;M/Mars, DuPont
is hiring teen-agers as consultants.
</P>
<P>
   For manufacturers like DuPont, the stakes are high. Teen
Research Unlimited, a marketing company, estimates that teen-agers
spent $141 billion last year on themselves, plus another $49
billion of their parents' money on groceries. ``We Are Entering the
Age of the Teen Superconsumer!'' is a gleeful headline in a DuPont
handout, The Lycra Teens Research Report.
</P>
<P>
   Kara and Lynn, who just completed their participation on the
panel, were paid $50 for a three-hour session and met about once a
month for a year. ``It was good money just to sit around and
discuss stuff,'' Lynn said. (Like members of Ricky Martin's old
band, Menudo, members of the Lycra panel have a built-in expiration
date _ their 18th birthday.)
</P>
<P>
   And so the girls talked and talked. And they went on shopping
trips, learned fun facts about Lycra _ stretch and recovery! _
talked about their underwear _ wedgies, straps. They also analyzed
a huge number of advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein did not fare well; Kate Moss was deemed too white
and too thin to be appealing. They didn't like an ad for Arizona
Jeans, which, the girls said, blatantly pandered to teen-agers with
copy that reads in part, ``Don't talk down to me.'' Gap was loved
by all.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lycra is an ingredient, not a brand, DuPont can use this
information to court brands the teen-agers did like, including J.C.
Penney, Rampage and Tommy Hilfiger. In essence, DuPont was saying,
``Hey, we can help you with your ads and promotions because we know
what works with these kids, and by the way, use our product because
we've trained these kids to be aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   DuPont is interested in girls like Lynn and Kara because they
are considered to be, in Teen Research Unlimited's parlance,
influencers, said Michael Wood, a director of the research company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Influencers are the top of the hierarchy,'' Wood said.
``They're the mainstream cool teens, picking up on the trends from
the `edge' teens, the fringe teens like Goths or Skaters, and
broadcasting them.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do average American teen-age influencers like Kara and
Lynn think? Neither really likes shopping or cares about brands.
They are distinguished among their classmates at Spence for a
number of things: they do not diet, or buy DKNY, or live on the
Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   I had brought them magazines, like Mademoiselle, Glamour and
Cosmopolitan. ``Moregasmic?'' Kara said, flicking a Glamour cover
line with her finger. ``Whatever, whatever, I don't concern myself
with these magazines. I don't even buy magazines, though I will
read Lynn's Teen People.''
</P>
<P>
   Kara said she doesn't have a boyfriend because she doesn't
believe that any guy her age can give her what she needs. She uses
the word ``deliberate'' a lot, as in, ``I am deliberate about what
I eat,'' or, ``I am deliberate with my money.'' Kara's favorite
book: ``I Kiss Dating Goodbye,'' by Joshua Harris, a young priest.
Lynn's favorite: ``Crime and Punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lynn's mother and stepfather work in media relations. Kara's
mother is a nurse, and her father works for the New York City
Housing Authority. Kara's favorite television program: anything on
cooking or travel. She is, admittedly, sort of an odd duck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like Jacques Pepin,'' she said. Lynn's favorite
program: every one, including ``Sally Jesse Raphael'' and
``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   I also brought them a copy of Rolling Stone _ ``The New Teen
Spirit'' _ which did not tempt them, and a marketing treatise, the
paperback ``Street Trends'' (Harper Perennial, 1998), by the
principals of a marketing company for teen-agers, Sputnik.
</P>
<P>
   This is a thoroughly depressing book, in that Sputnik's authors
describe ``movements'' characterized by a turning away from a large
corporate culture, all for the benefit of exploitation by a large
corporate culture.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you market to these groups? Be like Sprite, Sputnik
says, because Sprite ads rely on the anti-sell: ``Image is nothing.
Thirst is everything. Obey your thirst.'' The girls loved this ad.
</P>
<P>
   They also liked their consulting gig. ``All these adults are
looking to us for knowledge,'' Lynn said. ``It's a reversal of
roles. And it feels good that they think we have some knowledge to
impart.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's some of that knowledge: Jordan Knight, a pop star, is
O.K., but his videos are too sexual. The Backstreet Boys are more
than O.K. So is Erykah Badu, a soul singer. Neither girl thinks she
has a place in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn isn't sure about God, but Kara definitely is. ``Baywatch''
is funny, but too white and too ``Barbie.'' Fashion magazines
aren't interesting at all, but Teen People is.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie McLean, editor of Stay Free!, a magazine dedicated to an
ad-free world, isn't a fan of the focus group. ``I'm sure
teen-agers are flattered,'' she said. ``It probably makes them feel
more important than selling fast food. But these companies are
basically commodifying these kids' relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McLean's spiritual kin is Kalle Lasn, author of ``Culture
Jam: The Uncooling of America,'' to be published this fall by
William Morrow. Lasn said he gets queasy at the idea that ``cool''
now comes from a company. ``Big companies have also gotten very
good at branding, and I think that this branding amounts to a
creation of cool which the teen-agers seem to be unable to live
without,'' he said. ``In the past we used to create our own cool,
but now the companies are spoon-feeding our culture to us from
above.''
</P>
<P>
   Working for DuPont, however, appears to have nurtured the
nascent ethicist in each girl. ``I'm not buying more stuff than
before,'' Lynn said. ``It's just that I am aware of being marketed
to.'' Kara said: ``I never thought that companies cared so much for
my opinion. The Lycra thing made me think hard about businesses
focused on us, and whether I liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, all the girls attended a trade conference, where
apparel manufacturers were invited to hear what they had to say on
a variety of topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them,'' Kara said dryly, ``that they were welcome to
compete for my limited dollars.''

 By DAVID COLMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What was the woman in the lime-green and gray suit,
with shoulders sharp enough to poke an eye out, doing in the middle
of Orchard Street?
</P>
<P>
   The suit came from Marcesa, one of the traditional ``I can get
it for you wholesale'' stores on Orchard. But what about the 1,000
Lower East Side young people, in leather, creative facial hair and
tinted sunglasses, who were hooting and hollering at the woman, who
looked like a long-lost daughter of the Carringtons from
``Dynasty''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, she was a fashion model; Orchard Street had been
temporarily fitted with an elevated catwalk, and the garish green
power suit was the tartly affectionate statement of Ben Sturgill, a
participant in the Orchard Street Style Slam last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He and five other stylists who work for avant-garde fashion
magazines like Purple, Surface and Nylon had been challenged to
pick clothes from Orchard Street shops _ both traditional
discounters like Ja-Mil Uniform and Colette Fashion and hip
newcomers _ and to show their looks in the street, before a crowd
responding in the boisterous style of a poetry slam. The unusual
fashion show was the brainchild of Erica Lively, whose Timtoum
store on Orchard, opened in 1997, sells skateboard clothes and
vinyl records. Her goal was to raise awareness of Orchard Street as
a shopping district.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense that the neighborhood is picking itself up by
its bootstraps,'' said Matthew Bauer, the executive director of the
Lower East Side Business Improvement District. ``There's a whole
smorgasbord of shops down here, and I'll tell you, each business
feeds into the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lively, a member of the business improvement district, whose
store is between the older vendors south of Stanton Street and the
modish invaders to the north as far as Houston Street, is a kind of
den mother to the newcomers. They, for their part, have given the
neighborhood a tourist-friendly name in the style of SoHo and
TriBeCa: LuStO, for Ludlow, Stanton and Orchard Streets. Beyond the
racks of T-shirts, baseball hats, fake Prada handbags and leather
coats crowding the sidewalks on Sundays, Orchard Street is now home
to more than a dozen stores showcasing the work of young designers
and vintage clothes at one-third of what such things cost in SoHo.
Xuly Bet, an outpost of a French company, sells shredded Goth
clothing; Cherry specializes in vintage mod wear; Shine has
beautiful vintage evening clothes, and TG-170 has crocheted tops,
straw bags and other must-haves for the Pier 40-meets-Aruba look.
</P>
<P>
   The Style Slam, presented for the second year, was right on top
of a current wave in fashion, the flirtation with notions of value
and cheapness, with polyester fabrics, thrift-shop styles and plain
uniform motifs, all of which have shown up on high-fashion runways.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the 40 stores participating were traditional
neighborhood merchants, which have been bargain hunters'
destinations for years, including Ben Freedman Men's Wear and
Beckenstein's Fabrics. The organizers persuaded them to lend
clothes of the stylists' choosing, though this wasn't always easy.
``It was pretty hard explaining to them what a stylist is,'' said
Karen Levitt, a slam organizer and one of the stylists.
</P>
<P>
   Stylists, for the record, are fashion's foot soldiers, who pull
together accessories, props and the clothes for a magazine shoot or
a designer's runway show. ``They really don't get enough credit for
what they do,'' Ms. Lively said. ``If they want to do blue lips on
a shoot, and the shoot's not about that, then it's no blue lips.''
</P>
<P>
   But last Sunday, stylists' day out, the lips were any color you
like. There were skirts worn as ponchos and wedding dresses made
from the pages of a journal. Diana Oberlander, who showed this
look, explained that her journal pages represented ``the expression
of self,'' and the paper represented ``the temporality of trends.''
The crowd was unimpressed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   It was far more vocal for Sturgill, responding with wolf calls
to an elaborate black, lacy top from Marcesa, worn with the
shortest of jean cutoffs. ``Daisy Duke chic,'' the stylist called
it.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Sturgill's inventive creations was a billowy mauve
flower-print top inspired by a hair scrunchy, one of those
elasticized bands for holding a pony tail, which he bought from a
local discounter.
</P>
<P>
   Sturgill turned out to be one of only two stylists who married
clothes from the old and new Orchard Street shops. Most of the
others simply picked through the newer emporiums, with results that
predictably failed to arouse the crowd, many of whom outshone the
models as sharp dressers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levitt did not use much clothing from the older stores, but
her cunningly contrived, Halston-meets-``Phantom Menace'' looks
were sensuous and dark. Ryan Colby, who showed a series of bland
shirt-and-pants men's wear from the new stores, made it seem as if
he had simply popped into Club Monaco for some trendy basics on his
way to the Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not very creative at all,'' sniffed Francoise
Stevelinck, a Belgian tourist, watching the show with her husband.
She added diplomatically, ``Men's wear is so much harder than
women's.''
</P>
<P>
   The Style Slam was not supposed to be a competition, with a
winner crowned by the crowd's applause. But had it been, there's no
doubt that first prize would have gone to Lisa Von Weise, the last
stylist to show. Her models came out prancing, not stalking or
sauntering, to the energetic, electronic beat of a friend's band,
Fischer Spooner.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes were comically ghoulish, in a nod to ``The Rocky
Horror Picture Show.'' The star was the band's lead singer, Casey
Spooner, his dark pants hanging off his hips, the better to see his
red vinyl briefs.
</P>
<P>
   The audience was united in catcalls and enthusiastic applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to be competitive,'' Ms. Von Weise said later.
``I'm glad people seemed to like it. I just knew when they asked me
to do it that the only way was to make it like performance art.
Otherwise it would just be boring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the last one,'' said an audience member in a recycled
mink tank top, who would identify himself only as KAI. ``It was
cool, strong, exciting, scary and fun. The rest bored me.'' KAI,
who had participated as a stylist in the event last year, described
his profession as ``fashionista.'' Asked to elaborate, he said, ``I
am a stylist, a designer and an architect.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the more conventionally employed denizens of Orchard
Street, most said they were glad to see the crowd in the
neighborhood and hoped it would lead to more sales. They were
careful in their assessment of the fashions presented.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Chen, who watched the event from the doorway of her store,
Fashion and Fashion, which sells the sort of pastel women's wear
that would be irreproachable at a Parent-Teacher Association
meeting, said: ``It was OK The clothes were ...'' Her voice trailed
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interesting,'' she added, breaking into a broad smile. ``And
fashion is what I do.''

AS A GAUGE OF SOCIAL CHANGE, BEHOLD: THE BREAST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One way of looking at breasts _ other than head on, from
underneath or in profile _ is to see them as public property. They
never fully belong to the women who live with them. They arrive as
uninvited buds and slowly blossom into a social concern.
</P>
<P>
   As Francine Prose points out in the book ``Master Breasts,''
they are ``a body part that we didn't start out with ... whole new
organs, two of them, tricky to hide or eradicate, attached for all
the world to see ... twin messengers announcing our lack of
control, announcing that Nature has plans for us about which we
were not consulted.''
</P>
<P>
   As if the breast has not had its share of shelf space, two new
breast books have arrived. ``Master Breasts'' presents breast
photographs with text by Ms. Prose, Karen Finley, Dario Fo and
Charles Simic. ``At the Breast'' by Linda M. Blum, a sociologist,
is about the history and ideology of American breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the maternal breast can be viewed as a
long-running property dispute. Who has a stake? It's not just women
and children.
</P>
<P>
   When the country was founded, American breasts worked for the
new nation. Breast-feeding, Ms. Blum writes, ``became almost an
emblem of new democratic ideals, as images of `nature' were linked
with equality, the rejection of decadent, aristocratic `culture.'
'' While European mothers often used wet nurses, American mothers
were encouraged to breast-feed their own.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, slavery altered the picture. About 20
percent of white plantation mothers used black wet nurses, who were
seen as ``naturally'' nurturing. By the early 20th century, though,
maternal breasts had become ``the conduit to national strength and
global power,'' Ms. Blum writes. The federal government, seeking to
promote the ``purity'' of the largely Anglo-Saxon population,
encouraged women (especially white women) to stay home with their
children and put their breasts to work.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, science stepped in. Doctors advised mothers to
weigh their babies before and after nursing to see how well their
breasts performed. Pediatric research, ``funded by formula
producers,'' Ms. Blum writes, indicated that breast milk was
insufficiently nutritious and that formula was a necessary
supplement.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-century, as breast-feeding declined, psychiatrists staked
a claim. John Bowlby, the founder of attachment theory, said that
``any separation of the young child from its mother would result in
psychic damage,'' Ms. Blum says. D.W. Winnicott, a psychoanalyst,
said breast-feeding was important to the baby's sense of
``omnipotence'' over reality and the mother. Dr. Benjamin Spock
recommended breast-feeding, too.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, seven white Roman Catholic mothers formed La Leche
League, a ``mother-to-mother'' breast-feeding network. Their motto
was, ``We speak for the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   But breast-feeding continued to decline in the 1950s and 60s. It
seems that babies' claims conflicted with those of men.
Breast-feeding ``seemed to violate husbands' ownership of their
wives breasts,'' Ms. Blum writes. Spock wrote about unshapely
breasts and husbands jealous of their suckling babies. Penelope
Leach wrote more pointedly: ``Your body is ready and waiting for
him. Your skin thrills to his.'' By him, Ms. Blum observes, Ms.
Leach meant ``the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The tide did not turn until the 1970s, when hippies initiated a
``back-to-the-breast movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the 1980s and '90s, as the immunological advantages
of breast milk were demonstrated, breasts became part of the
humming economy. Many mothers returned to work with the guilty
realization that they owed their children their breast milk, even
if they couldn't dispense it directly. Breast pumps proliferated.
Ads showed mothers cradling their pumps like babies. Breast milk
became, as the psychoanalyst Michelle Friedman observed, a
``fetish.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happens to the public breast, drained of milk and
sentiment? ``Master Breasts'' is a partial answer. The book is full
of photographs of breasts loaded with irony: Ralph Bartholomew's
Playtex woman ascending a staircase; Annie Sprinkle's ``Bosom
Ballet''; Duane Michals' portrait of Louise Bourgeois in a dress of
breasts and phalluses; Sally Mann's daughter sporting small plastic
dolls as breasts.
</P>
<P>
   In a poem in ``Master Breasts,'' Ms. Finley imagines James
Bond's testicles squeezed together and wrapped in lacy cups. But
she's too late. The reverse has already occurred. Breasts today are
what phalluses were for the Greeks: strange fruits ripe for parody.

(DW) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I know being fabulous is a full-time occupation,''
Gregory Crewdson, an artist, said recently. ``But what exactly does
she do?''
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the $100,000 question whenever Kim Heirston's
name is mentioned. Neither a collector nor a dealer, neither a
curator nor a gallery owner, Ms. Heirston, 35, is an art adviser,
coaching the rich on how to spend their fortunes on fine art.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heirston seems well suited to a career that is equal parts
socializing and commerce. At 6 feet tall, she cut a striking figure
as she glided into the contemporary art sale at Sotheby's last
Tuesday evening, with dark flipped hair styled after Jackie Kennedy
and the antennae of Mary Boone.
</P>
<P>
   She scanned the crowd and navigated over to David Maupin, an art
dealer. Pressing her lips against his ear, she uttered something
inaudible and started to laugh, covering her mouth with her hand.
She gave a girlish hug to a tan, bleached-blond Venezuelan
collector who, in turn, cooed over Ms. Heirston's outfit, a pale
gray, Empire-waist shift dress by Marc Jacobs and a charcoal
pashmina shawl draped around her shoulders. A museum owner from
Munich waited expectantly on the impromptu receiving line forming
behind Ms. Heirston. She scheduled tea times, coffee hours and
cocktails _ the liquid dates that may explain her svelte figure _
without ever pulling her Palm Pilot from her pink sequined Fendi
baguette.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Heirston has the bearing and manner of the country
club set, she does not come from a blue-blood background. She was
raised in Huntington, N.Y., by her single mother, a buyer of parts
for Grumman Aerospace. After attending Yale University, she made
her way up in the art world by working at 57th Street and SoHo
galleries like Pace and Stux.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ms. Heirston holds a prominent seat at Sotheby's with the
moneyed forces of the C &AMP; M Art Gallery in front of her and a row
of German collectors behind her, poised at the edge of her chair, a
catalog on her lap. She became uncharacteristically flustered,
dropping her paddle on the floor, just before the bidding began on
a photograph by Cindy Sherman, a work Ms. Heirston was expressly
interested in. She had come to buy it for a London-based
businessman who had never seen it but trusted her advice that the
artist had changed the history of photography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people don't like the auction room,'' she said coolly.
``They don't want people to know their business, or they're afraid
they'll go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   As the price for the photograph started to climb beyond its low
estimate of $90,000, Ms. Heirston kept her paddle high in the air,
bidding against others in the room and on the phone. When the
hammer came down at $110,000 _ $10,000 shy of her ceiling _ Ms.
Heirston seemed stunned that she had actually got the piece. Her
doe eyes were wide and her hand trembled ever so slightly as she
scribbled the price across the page in her catalog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still get nervous,'' she confessed with a sigh, before
ducking into a Town Car. Ms. Heirston, who last fall was dubbed by
Harper's Bazaar one of New York's most sought-after guests,
receives no fewer than four invitations a night. Her next stop was
the River Cafe in Brooklyn for a dinner given by Creative Time, a
nonprofit public art organization, promoting an exhibit at the
Anchorage of installations by avant-garde fashion designers like
Viktor &AMP; Rolf and Susan Cianciolo.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for her table seating, she ran into David Byrne and
offered him both cheeks to kiss. ``We were in Tokyo together for an
opening,'' she purred. A head above everyone else, she surveyed the
room filled with twinkling lights and gardenias. A collector who
looked like Richard Serra waved her over; en route, she paused to
make a lunch date with a museum trustee and embrace the art dealer
Andrea Rosen. Business as usual.

HISTORIAN SIMON SCHAMA WILL PUBLISH `BRITTANIA' WITH TALK MIRAMAX
BOOKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The historian Simon Schama has signed a deal to publish his next
work of nonfiction with Talk Miramax Books, a division of Talk
Media, which is owned by Miramax Films. The book, titled
``Brittania,'' will be a history of Britain from the time before
the Roman invasion to the year 2000, and it will accompany a
12-part BBC series, directed by Schama, that ABC will broadcast in
the fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Talk Media is the publishing group founded by Tina Brown, the
former editor of The New Yorker magazine; the group, in partnership
with Hearst Magazines, will also publish Talk Magazine. The first
issue of the magazine is scheduled to appear on newsstands in
August of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of the book and its publication in conjunction
with an ABC series _ as well as being excerpted in the pages of the
magazine _ point to the ways that collaboration might take place
among the various arms of the Walt Disney Co., which owns both ABC
and Miramax Films.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Burnham, the editor in chief of Talk Miramax Books, has
acquired four book projects to date, including two novels by
Christopher Rice, the son of the novelist Anne Rice, and a book of
photographs and memoirs acquired from the estate of Charlie
Chaplin.
</P>
<P>
   Schama, a professor at Columbia University, is the author of
``The Embarrassment of Riches,'' ``Citizens'' and ``Landscape and
Memory.'' His biography of Rembrandt will be published by Knopf
this fall.

IN COMPUTER AGE, STATES STICK WITH PAPER TRAIL ON CAMPAIGN
SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk)

 N.Y. Times Regional Newspaper Group   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With campaign finance reform stalled on Capitol
Hill, one respected watchdog group is pushing states to bring their
own disclosure requirements into the electronic age.
</P>
<P>
   They have a way to go. A report by the Center For Responsive
Politics found that only a handful of states have comprehensive
online campaign finance information available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians of all ideologies pay lip service to the idea of
disclosure,'' said Paul Hendrie, a spokesman for the group. ``The
key to disclosure is timeliness and accessibility to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   If federal lawmakers aren't going to set limits on campaign
spending, Hendrie said it's even more important for states to step
up and help the public understand the political money chase. The
center wants candidates to file campaign information electronically
and then have states post that data on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens can already look at paper campaign reports for
statewide candidates at individual election offices in each state.
But Hendrie said that process is time-consuming and can be
intimidating. Some states, including Florida, require state
candidates to file campaign reports electronically and that
information is then available to the public on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida's been a real pioneer in this area,'' Hendrie.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana also has an electronic filing system, but it is not as
comprehensive. Alabama, South Carolina and Georgia are among dozens
of others lacking any sort of electronic filing system for
candidates. North Carolina is about to implement such a system this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal candidates for Congress file their reports with
the Federal Election Commission in Washington, Hendrie encouraged
state election offices to make that information available on their
own Web sites as well. He noted that the lines are increasingly
blurred between federal and state spending.
</P>
<P>
   GORING GORE
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it seems, Republicans have discovered Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   GOP lawmakers in Congress have become increasingly critical of
the vice president, setting their sights on the Democrats' leading
candidate for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rep. Jim DeMint, a freshman Republican from South
Carolina, felt compelled to comment on Gore's recent speech in
Iowa, one where the vice president talked about the importance of
parental involvement, discipline and character in schools.
</P>
<P>
   While the lawmaker applauded some of what Gore said, DeMint
complained the vice president was trying to manage local schools
from Washington. ``His speech used the word `require' four times
more than the word `local,''' DeMint complained.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also ridiculed Gore for his efforts to spend $30
million on a NASA program to take continuous pictures of the earth
and post them on the Internet. They killed that proposal in a
recent vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can already turn on my television and see pictures of earth
from space for free,'' said Texas Rep. Dick Armey, who delighted in
mocking Gore's idea.
</P>
<P>
   GUNS AND POSES
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the Senate were running around in circles over a
series of votes on gun control, reversing themselves at times and
bungling efforts to cast Democrats as zealots.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Southerners in that body, however, showed a remarkable
consistency, rejecting gun-control amendments despite the growing
alarm over gun shootings in schools.
</P>
<P>
   With rare exception, Southern Republicans opposed locks on
handguns. Supporters, who included Republican Strom Thurmond of
South Carolina, described that amendment as a win for child safety.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond joined his Dixie brethren, however, in rejecting
background checks for all firearms transactions at gun shows and
pawn shops, an amendment that ultimately passed with the dramatic
tiebreaking vote of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., spoke for many of his colleagues
when he denounced the amendment as ``an attempt to discourage
law-abiding Americans from owning and purchasing firearms.'' He
called on Congress to crack down on criminals instead.
</P>
<P>
   BLUE'S CLUES
</P>
<P>
   Those blue paws on the World Wide Web don't necessarily belong
to the dog from the popular children's television show; they also
symbolize the Blue Dog coalition, the group of centrist and
conservative Democrats trying to influence congressional policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Dogs just went light speed, launching a Web site to
promote their ideas and let voters get a look at their proposals on
such issues as the budget and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blue Dogs are in a very influential position this year
because of the narrow margin between the parties in the House and
we see this Web site as an important tool in helping shape the
agenda,'' said Rep. Bud Cramer, D-Ala., a leader of the group that
counts many Southern Democrats among its members.
</P>
<P>
   The Web address is www.house.gov/john/bluedog for those who want
to visit the electronic dog house.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the beginning, God created the heaven and the
earth, and the earth was without form ...
</P>
<P>
   To which certain Hamptonites are taking the attitude, ``No
problem!''
</P>
<P>
   All over the South Fork, they are preparing for the summer
season by marshalling an army of front-end loaders, bulldozers and
dump trucks. They're pursuing the area's latest trend: transforming
the area's generally flat topography into rolling hills, ridges and
ponds, in some cases landscapes more typical of an estate in
Greenwich, Conn. or New Jersey hunt country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year it's all about moving the earth,'' said Edwina von
Gal, a landscape designer who is working on more than 15 projects
in the Hamptons that involve sculpturing lawns, heaping up hillocks
and creating levels of terraces on previously flat properties.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the designer Helmut Lang closed on a $15.5
million property on the ocean in East Hampton (outbidding Jerry
Seinfeld, who also wanted it), and within 72 hours the earth movers
were on the site, transforming a flat yard into hillocks meant to
resemble sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is a concept of continuing the dunescape into
the landscape,'' said Lang's landscaper, David Seeler, the owner of
Bayberry Nursery in Amagansett. ``Which means taking what you see
in the natural dune area and bringing it forward into the landscape
of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   The sand dunes that lead from the beach to Lang's door are
covered with rose hips, beach grass and other natural flora. The
dunelike hills he is creating in his back yard will be covered with
sod.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the beach, Christopher H. Browne, the president of the
Tweedy, Browne, the mutual-fund company, recently bought 18 acres
of virgin woodland and began mapping out locations for manmade
hills and ponds. He did this even before beginning the design of
the buildings he plans, which include a main house, pool house and
guest cottage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to stick a house in the middle of a flat field,''
Browne said. ``I want elevation. I want some sort of life in that
flat field.''
</P>
<P>
   Browne, who grew up near Far Hills, N.J., said he loved the
rolling contour of the landscape in the Jersey hunt country, and
wanted to duplicate it on Long Island, which was rendered mostly
flat by glaciers in the last Ice Age about 11,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Browne's new property is not his first venture into
earth-sculpuring. In 1989, he bought eight and a half acres of flat
field from Jann Wenner, the founder of Rolling Stone, on Middle
Lane in East Hampton, and slowly turned it into a wooded, hilly
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Today the property has two man-made ponds, hundreds of mature
specimen trees, including weeping willows, dawn redwoods and cherry
trees and, and an assortment of gently sloping hills and grades. It
is a far cry from the potato fields with their long rows of humble
green plants that typify the native Hamptons landscape, long in
retreat before development.
</P>
<P>
   Although Browne spent half a dozen years developing his acreage,
his house _ a sand-yellow stucco manor in a pre-World War II style
_ was built only three years ago. He plans to sell the property
once his current estate is complete and he moves into the more
desirable, beachfront location.
</P>
<P>
   The architect Richard Meier, assisted by Ms. von Gal, turned the
flat overgrown lawn around his East Hampton house into a sea of
grass-covered hillocks. Influenced by the work of Arthur Edwin Bye
Jr. a landscape architect known for contouring hills to enhance the
play of sun and shadow, Meier did most of the earth moving himself
on a bulldozer.
</P>
<P>
   Best known as the architect of the Getty Center in Los Angeles,
he shaped his lawn a few years back, and so was ahead of the
current trend.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more recent converts are not as hands-on as he _ nor
as patient. ``They come out here, they buy a two-acre potato field
for a couple of million dollars, and within two weeks they want
rolling hills, contoured land and maybe a pond,'' said Seeler, who
has been in the landscape business for 36 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they write the check, it's the Hamptons, it can be done,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Modest earth-rearranging plus a small pond on that hypothetical
two-acre parcel will cost about $200,000, Seeler said. Without the
pond, it can be done for $175,000. More ambitious projects, like
Lang's, cost over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the newcomers want rolling hills and they want them by
Memorial Day,'' said Seeler, who had 100 of his workers swarming
over Lang's property on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Frank Newbold, a vice president of Sotheby's International
Realty, who manages the East Hampton office, said that with so many
of the South Fork's most desirable properties with mature plantings
and ocean views already gone, newcomers are buying farmland and
reshaping it to their wills overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instant gratification is certainly a big part of the story out
here,'' he said. ``They don't want to wait to see the small twig
grow. They would rather write the big check and live out their
fantasy of living in the rolling hills of Tuscany.''
</P>
<P>
   The most popular earthworks are long rectangular berms, hillocks
rising six to eight feet, and ponds, sometimes stocked with $300
Japanese koi (much to the delight of Hamptsons seagulls).
</P>
<P>
   On the sloping Sag Harbor property of Lewis B. Cullman, a
philanthropist, Seeler's crews are creating terraces 15 to 20 feet
long at various elevations. ``Imagine a hillside,'' Seeler said.
``We are creating viewpoints on the hillside so you can overlook
the grounds from the points.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Randy Lerner, a securities analyst, was seated atop
a tractor on the 15-acre parcel he bought last fall in Amagansett
next to Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger. ``My theory was, there are
not a lot of good-sized pieces of property left that represent a
combination of good lands with good elevations so you can see the
ocean,'' Lerner said in a tractor-top cell-phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   After he bought the property, he tore down the main house,
removed a formal circular driveway and moved a two-bedroom cottage
into the center of the land. He likes to do his own earth-moving.
``There was a pond in the back,'' he said. ``It wasn't spring fed.
I pushed the dirt over it. There were big ridges on the side of it
and I filled that back in and it sort of started to look like a
meadow.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Hamptonites, Lerner's earthworks-in-progress are
aimed at returning residential property to agriculture _ at least
partly. He is thinking of planting cranberries or oats on his front
six.
</P>
<P>
   But Lerner is the exception to the far more popular trend of
adding topography where nature made none. It is a trend that
offends some residents, even those long used to the hubris of the
hyper-privileged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows it's flat out here,'' said Molly Ferrer, a real
estate broker in Sotheby's Southampton office. ``It's expensive to
create hills and it's not a gift from God. You've got to pay for
topography. It's a way of showing you have lots of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert DeLuca, president of the Group for the South Fork, an
organization dedicated to protecting the environment and the rural
character of the area, said: ``The place looks like a cartoon of
what people think a country setting on Eastern Long Island should
be like. The natural landscape is being replaced with the built
landscape at a pace and scale we've never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Vikki Hilles, an environmental educator for the Group for the
South Fork, said that reshaping the earth was not in itself harmful
to natural resources. It's what people are applying to their lawns
that pose a danger, she said; ``The pesticides, the herbicides and
the fungicides affect the quality of your drinking water.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving around the Hamptons last week, Newbold, who has been
selling real estate locally for over 20 years, and Steven Gaines,
the author of ``Philistines at the Hedgerow,'' (Little, Brown,
1998) a social history of the East End, discussed the changing
status symbols in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '60s it was having an outdoor barbecue pit,'' Gaines
said. ``In the '70s it was a swimming pool. In the '80s it was a
must-have tennis court. In the early '90s, it was a full-size
basketball court and this year, for the aughts'' _ his word for the
post-millenium decade _ ``it's changing the topography.''
</P>
<P>
   Newbold parked his Mercedes at Meier's property. ``Oh, and don't
forget the sunken tennis courts,'' he said, leading a tour of the
grounds. Hamptons tennis courts these days are being built six feet
below ground level. ``People don't want to hear the bounce,''
Newbold said.

MODERN ORTHODOX JEWS HAVE A HERO BUT NOT ALL HIS WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When nearly 1,500 modern Orthodox Jews gathered
several months ago for their inaugural conference, the figure who
dominated the proceedings was nowhere to be found among the rosters
of speakers or panelists or people there. Rabbi Joseph Dov
Soloveitchik had died six years earlier and had ceased most public
activity nearly a decade before that.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the convention of the group, Edah, featured no less than
three sessions devoted to the life and work of the Rav _ the
teacher, as Soloveitchik was reverently known. Four of his books
were being sold. Even in a conclave thick with prominent rabbis and
religious scholars, it was Soloveitchik whom one saluted as the
gadol, or great rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that modern Orthodoxy was in effect celebrating
Soloveitchik's legacy, however, his only son, himself a rabbi and
Jewish historian, was contending that much of this legacy remains
mysteriously missing. Inside and outside of court, Haym
Soloveitchik has pursued recordings of what he estimates are 1,800
lectures on the Talmud and the religious law called halakha that
his father delivered over a period of 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The case of his father's tapes is suffused with controversy over
religious legitimacy, legal authority and intellectual property.
The story stretches from the classrooms and synagogues where the
tapes were made to the flood-prone basement where they were stored
to the courthouse where their location has been investigated. ``The
tapes,'' says Jack Wertheimer, a historian who is provost of Jewish
Theological Seminary, ``have become a political football.''
</P>
<P>
   Soloveitchik's efforts carry great import in the Jewish world
because while his father wrote several influential essays and
books, he expressed his ideology primarily through the lectures
called shiurim. Moreover, the modern Orthodox movement now lacks a
leader of Soloveitchik's stature as it faces attacks from the
theological right wing for its belief in dynamic engagement with
contemporary society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lectures were intellectually transformative, the epitome
of the encounter between Jewish learning and modern intellect,''
says Samuel Heilman, a professor at City University of New York who
is an expert on Orthodoxy Jewry. ``People who've never heard that
encounter _ and these days you don't hear it often _ think the
great voices of Orthodoxy are wearing black hats and speaking that
kind of language. They don't know what committed modern Orthodoxy
sounds like. The Rav represents a model of what's missing today.''
</P>
<P>
   Even within modern Orthodoxy and in the Soloveitchik family
itself, the search for the tapes has provoked discord. Soloveitchik
has turned his scrutiny largely on Julius Berman, a major communal
leader and the lawyer to whom his father entrusted the safekeeping
of his tapes during his last illness. The only other children of
Joseph Soloveitchik, his daughters Tova Lichtenstein and Atarah
Twersky, both have long associations with Berman and have not
helped their brother find the recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish to fix my father's place in history,'' Soloveitchik
says. ``The record of what he said in his prime is contained in the
tapes. That's his intellectual legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In his life as well as his work, Soloveitchik embodied the
modern Orthodox concept of Torah Umaddah, religious scholarship and
worldly knowledge. Born in 1903 in what is now Belarus, the son and
grandson of Talmudic masters, he entered the University of Berlin
at 22 to study philosophy, ultimately writing his doctoral
dissertation on epistemology and metaphysics. In later years he
wrote and lectured on philosophy, referring to Western thinkers
from Plato to Hegel.
</P>
<P>
   Soloveitchik took stances that were progressive within the
context of Orthodoxy in providing religious education to women. The
Maimonides School in Brookline, Mass., which he founded soon after
immigrating to the United States in 1932, gave Torah and Talmud
classes to girls. Years later he delivered the first lecture on
Talmud at Stern College, the women's division of Yeshiva
University.
</P>
<P>
   During 43 years of teaching at Yeshiva University's seminary,
beginning in 1941, Soloveitchik ordained more than 2,000 rabbis.
After cancer surgery in 1960 &UR; , &LR;  he stopped giving courses in
philosophy to concentrate solely on the Talmud. In addition to his
three Yeshiva classes each week, some of which lasted five hours,
he lectured regularly at the Maimonides School and at Congregation
Moriah, a second-story synagogue on the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the activity, he left a relatively small body of
written work, partly because of his perfectionist bent. For
example, his seminal essay ``Halakhic Man,'' published in Hebrew in
1944, was not translated into English for 39 years.
</P>
<P>
   With his lectures, though, Soloveitchik was mindful of
posterity. He had his Talmud classes at Yeshiva and elsewhere
taped, beginning in 1954, storing hundreds of cassettes and reels
in his campus apartment and Brookline residence. As Parkinson's
disease was forcing him from the classroom in 1984, he instructed
Berman in a letter to ``take custody of the tapes and lectures'' to
``arrange for their preservation and reproduction.''
</P>
<P>
   A self-declared disciple of the rabbi, Berman had been chairman
of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations. But even while Soloveitchik was alive, his lawyer
and his son were feuding over the quality of Berman's
representation of him in several publishing ventures.
</P>
<P>
   After Soloveitchik's death in 1993, his son asked Berman on
behalf of the estate to return all the tapes. Under varying degrees
of pressure from Soloveitchik, Berman and colleagues turned over
tapes of about 300 lectures. In a 1997 deposition, he not only
insisted that those were the only tape recordings he had ever
possessed but also ridiculed the notion ``that I, of all people,
had copies of these missing tapes and for some reason that I either
burnt it or secreted it or kept it in a vault in Switzerland.''
Berman declined to be interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, Soloveitchik remained convinced that nearly 2,000 of his
father's classes, primarily from 1969 to 1984, were missing. He
took the dispute into the legal arena in 1997, when he sought and
won designation from New York state Surrogate's Court as the
executor of the estate's missing assets. Since then he has searched
for the tapes, deposing those involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Berman's testimony did not resolve the mystery, but it did offer
some disquieting details about his stewardship of the tapes. He
admitted having stored them in his basement, about 6 feet from a
toilet that sporadically backed up and flooded. He admitted
allowing Rabbi Emanuel Holzer, whom he hired to reproduce the
recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, to keep duplicates
for himself despite Berman's own written direction that no
duplicates were to be produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be blunt about it,'' Berman explained in the deposition,
``it is like putting a little kid on a candy pile and saying,
`Don't eat the candy.' It just won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Holzer acknowledged in a 1998 deposition having taped many of
the Rabbi Soloveitchik's lectures at Congregation Moriah and said
that he had thousands of recordings of him, ``the biggest
collection of the world.'' He declined to be interviewed for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, yet another rabbi, Milton Nordlicht of the Bronx, has
a Web site that sells upward of 100 lectures by Soloveitchik.
Already subpoenaed though not yet deposed, Nordlicht said in a
brief telephone interview that he got the tapes ``from a number of
private individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   In collecting and ultimately releasing his father's lectures,
Soloveitchik will fill a vacuum in Orthodox discourse. Within weeks
of Soloveitchik's death, Norman Lamm, president of Yeshiva
University, warned in a eulogy, ``Certain burgeoning revisionisms
may well attempt to disguise and distort the Rav's uniqueness by
trivializing one or another aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the six years since his death a variety of Orthodox
scholars have offered markedly different analyses of Soloveitchik's
views on such volatile issues as interfaith dialogue, Zionism,
women's prayer groups and the status of secular learning.
</P>
<P>
   Haym Soloveitchik himself has written critically of the
rightward drift of American Orthodoxy. And he says, ``With the
tapes, you would get my father's involvement in the secular world,
in secular thought.'' Still, he says his overriding concern is not
to wield the tapes as ideological or theological cudgels but rather
to let his father speak for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many conflicting reports of what my father did
say or didn't say,'' Soloveitchik says. ``There's such a flood of
quotes or misquotes, whether made sincerely or insincerely. They
must be stopped. Or at least they must be made to answer what is
available on the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel G. Freedman, a professor of journalism at Columbia, is
writing a book about the conflicts among modern American Jews.

   KOSOVO-POLICY (Washington) _ Between the two options that
President Clinton has declared unacceptable _ doing nothing or
all-out war _ the White House has devised a new kind of warfare for
Yugoslavia. It is a calibrated war, enabled by high-tech weaponry,

fear that a few American combat deaths could turn the public
against any military intervention in an obscure place called
Kosovo. By Blaine Harden and John Broder.

   LOTTERY-IMPACT (Orange, N.J.) _ With lottery machines as

governments _ the same entities that for years outlawed gambling.
The impact that state lotteries are having on communities around
the country has been a major focus of the National Gambling Impact

 By PENELOPE GREEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kara Hamilton, 18, and Lynn Liran, 17, look pretty
much like teen-agers do across the country. On a recent sunny
Monday afternoon, Kara had on scuffed white Nikes, faded Levis and
a cream-colored, knitted Gap shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn wore a lavender tank top of indeterminate provenance, brown
boot-cut Gap jeans, worn brown boots and green eye shadow. The two
best friends, seniors at the Spence School in Manhattan, had their
backs turned resolutely on Madison Avenue and seemed eager to munch
on apple crumb pie at Sarabeth's restaurant and to patiently
discuss subjects both dear and foreign to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really mind being a specimen,'' Kara said graciously.
``That's not necessarily an unpowerful thing to be, and anyway, I
understand that adults are puzzled.''
</P>
<P>
   Kara and Lynn have grown used to expounding on this and that for
grown-ups carrying notebooks and video cameras, and the girls exude
a sort of resigned politeness no matter what you ask them. In 1997,
they were hired by the DuPont Co. to contribute to a panel of
teen-agers the company had assembled as part of a $30 million
promotion of its Lycra fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for new and improved ways to separate teen-agers from
their money, DuPont has moved beyond the typical practice of buying
information on teen-agers' brand, celebrity and sitcom preferences
culled by marketing companies specializing in teen-agers. Like a
growing number of companies, including Levis and M&AMP;M/Mars, DuPont
is hiring teen-agers as consultants.
</P>
<P>
   For manufacturers like DuPont, the stakes are high. Teen
Research Unlimited, a marketing company, estimates that teen-agers
spent $141 billion last year on themselves, plus another $49
billion of their parents' money on groceries. ``We Are Entering the
Age of the Teen Superconsumer!'' is a gleeful headline in a DuPont
handout, The Lycra Teens Research Report.
</P>
<P>
   Kara and Lynn, who just completed their participation on the
panel, were paid $50 for a three-hour session and met about once a
month for a year. ``It was good money just to sit around and
discuss stuff,'' Lynn said. (Like members of Ricky Martin's old
band, Menudo, members of the Lycra panel have a built-in expiration
date _ their 18th birthday.)
</P>
<P>
   And so the girls talked and talked. And they went on shopping
trips, learned fun facts about Lycra _ stretch and recovery! _
talked about their underwear _ wedgies, straps. They also analyzed
a huge number of advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein did not fare well; Kate Moss was deemed too white
and too thin to be appealing. They didn't like an ad for Arizona
Jeans, which, the girls said, blatantly pandered to teen-agers with
copy that reads in part, ``Don't talk down to me.'' Gap was loved
by all.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lycra is an ingredient, not a brand, DuPont can use this
information to court brands the teen-agers did like, including J.C.
Penney, Rampage and Tommy Hilfiger. In essence, DuPont was saying,
``Hey, we can help you with your ads and promotions because we know
what works with these kids, and by the way, use our product because
we've trained these kids to be aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   DuPont is interested in girls like Lynn and Kara because they
are considered to be, in Teen Research Unlimited's parlance,
influencers, said Michael Wood, a director of the research company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Influencers are the top of the hierarchy,'' Wood said.
``They're the mainstream cool teens, picking up on the trends from
the `edge' teens, the fringe teens like Goths or Skaters, and
broadcasting them.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do average American teen-age influencers like Kara and
Lynn think? Neither really likes shopping or cares about brands.
They are distinguished among their classmates at Spence for a
number of things: they do not diet, or buy DKNY, or live on the
Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   I had brought them magazines, like Mademoiselle, Glamour and
Cosmopolitan. ``Moregasmic?'' Kara said, flicking a Glamour cover
line with her finger. ``Whatever, whatever, I don't concern myself
with these magazines. I don't even buy magazines, though I will
read Lynn's Teen People.''
</P>
<P>
   Kara said she doesn't have a boyfriend because she doesn't
believe that any guy her age can give her what she needs. She uses
the word ``deliberate'' a lot, as in, ``I am deliberate about what
I eat,'' or, ``I am deliberate with my money.'' Kara's favorite
book: ``I Kiss Dating Goodbye,'' by Joshua Harris, a young priest.
Lynn's favorite: ``Crime and Punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lynn's mother and stepfather work in media relations. Kara's
mother is a nurse, and her father works for the New York City
Housing Authority. Kara's favorite television program: anything on
cooking or travel. She is, admittedly, sort of an odd duck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like Jacques Pepin,'' she said. Lynn's favorite
program: every one, including ``Sally Jesse Raphael'' and
``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   I also brought them a copy of Rolling Stone _ ``The New Teen
Spirit'' _ which did not tempt them, and a marketing treatise, the
paperback ``Street Trends'' (Harper Perennial, 1998), by the
principals of a marketing company for teen-agers, Sputnik.
</P>
<P>
   This is a thoroughly depressing book, in that Sputnik's authors
describe ``movements'' characterized by a turning away from a large
corporate culture, all for the benefit of exploitation by a large
corporate culture.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you market to these groups? Be like Sprite, Sputnik
says, because Sprite ads rely on the anti-sell: ``Image is nothing.
Thirst is everything. Obey your thirst.'' The girls loved this ad.
</P>
<P>
   They also liked their consulting gig. ``All these adults are
looking to us for knowledge,'' Lynn said. ``It's a reversal of
roles. And it feels good that they think we have some knowledge to
impart.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's some of that knowledge: Jordan Knight, a pop star, is
O.K., but his videos are too sexual. The Backstreet Boys are more
than O.K. So is Erykah Badu, a soul singer. Neither girl thinks she
has a place in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn isn't sure about God, but Kara definitely is. ``Baywatch''
is funny, but too white and too ``Barbie.'' Fashion magazines
aren't interesting at all, but Teen People is.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie McLean, editor of Stay Free!, a magazine dedicated to an
ad-free world, isn't a fan of the focus group. ``I'm sure
teen-agers are flattered,'' she said. ``It probably makes them feel
more important than selling fast food. But these companies are
basically commodifying these kids' relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McLean's spiritual kin is Kalle Lasn, author of ``Culture
Jam: The Uncooling of America,'' to be published this fall by
William Morrow. Lasn said he gets queasy at the idea that ``cool''
now comes from a company. ``Big companies have also gotten very
good at branding, and I think that this branding amounts to a
creation of cool which the teen-agers seem to be unable to live
without,'' he said. ``In the past we used to create our own cool,
but now the companies are spoon-feeding our culture to us from
above.''
</P>
<P>
   Working for DuPont, however, appears to have nurtured the
nascent ethicist in each girl. ``I'm not buying more stuff than
before,'' Lynn said. ``It's just that I am aware of being marketed
to.'' Kara said: ``I never thought that companies cared so much for
my opinion. The Lycra thing made me think hard about businesses
focused on us, and whether I liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, all the girls attended a trade conference, where
apparel manufacturers were invited to hear what they had to say on
a variety of topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them,'' Kara said dryly, ``that they were welcome to
compete for my limited dollars.''

 CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: AT CANNES, SIMPLICITY AND IDEAS ABOUT FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France _ David (``Blue Velvet'') Lynch floored audiences
at the Cannes International Film Festival on Friday with an
eloquently simple, deeply emotional G-rated movie, ``The Straight
Story,'' whose unassuming 79-year-old star gives the best leading
performance to be seen here. And that was only the second-biggest
surprise of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The first involved Harvey Weinstein of Miramax, who is usually
happily orchestrating Cannes brouhaha but has stayed
uncharacteristically far from the spotlight this year. After Kevin
Smith's potentially controversial ``Dogma'' was unveiled Friday
morning, Weinstein found himself in an alley outside the theater,
doing something that is unheard of here: taking part in an
impromptu news conference without benefit of spin.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Not even Weinstein knows what ``Dogma'' is up
against. All that seems certain about what press notes call Smith's
``comic fantasia'' is that it won't be getting any closer than the
word ``fantasia'' to Miramax's corporate parent.
</P>
<P>
   When Walt Disney Co. discreetly indicated that it did not want
to be fielding anti-``Dogma'' pickets at theme parks, Weinstein and
his brother Bob dropped ``Dogma'' from Miramax's roster, and then
agreed to buy the $14 million film back personally and make other
distribution plans.
</P>
<P>
   Where does it go from here?
</P>
<P>
   Into calmer waters, let us hope. Because Smith's ``Dogma'' is as
smart and articulate as it is wildly irreverent, with characters
who try to make sense of faith just as his ``Chasing Amy''
characters tried to sort out love and sexual identity.
</P>
<P>
   And Smith's fusion of off-the-wall humor with serious debate
never leaves the strength of his religious conviction in question.
``Dogma'' has an outlook best summed up by a character in Smith's
sharp-edged screenplay: ``I have issues with anyone who treats God
like a burden instead of a blessing.'' Even if this is a film that
enlists a silent Alanis Morissette to play God.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Dogma'' winds up offending those who haven't seen it, it
isn't likely to have that effect at closer range. Actually, it's
the rare pop entertainment with a lot on its mind, even if a
meandering second half and a few gratuitous gross-outs dilute its
effect. (Smith, whose cast includes Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Linda
Fiorentino, Chris Rock and George Carlin, is a much better director
of hilariously stubborn arguments than of action scenes.)
</P>
<P>
   Calling ``Dogma'' anti-Catholic, Smith said Friday afternoon,
``is like calling me anti-New Jersey.'' And he is so fond of his
home state that in ``Dogma'' he shows two travelers who are unable
to buy bus tickets to New Jersey because of high demand.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch's film is also a religious experience in its own way. It
tells the true story of a man named Alvin Straight who rode a lawn
mower from Laurens, Iowa, to Mount Zion, Wis., a considerable
distance, in hopes of visiting a brother from whom he had become
estranged.
</P>
<P>
   The traveler's role is played with immense dignity by Richard
Farnsworth, whose movie roles have been infrequent and never on a
par with this one. Once a stunt extra, Farnsworth drove a chariot
in ``The Ten Commandments'' and carried a sword in ``Spartacus.''
He still lives on a ranch in New Mexico, and looked perfectly at
home in a cowboy hat at the casino in the Carlton Hotel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' was shot in towns Straight had really
passed through and it has the kind of forthright verisimilitude
that is attained only through careful effort. (Jack Fisk's clean,
unobtrusive production design and Angelo Badalamenti's
uncharacteristically lilting, rustic music heighten the effect.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it may be my most experimental film,'' said Lynch.
This was not an implausible thought. ``Tenderness can be just as
abstract as insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch lives with Mary Sweeney, who with John Roach wrote a
screenplay that artfully defines a sense of life's meaning through
the stages of Alvin's journey. That's why the director knew about
this story, but not why he chose to film it.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned David Mamet (``The Winslow Boy'') and Pedro
Almodovar (``All About My Mother'') among filmmakers whose Cannes
entries are uncharacteristically gentle. Some of that, he said, may
be because violence and obscene language on screen ``have been
pushed to an absurd extreme, to the point where you don't feel it
any more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really explain it, but I feel a change,'' he added.
``I feel something different in the air.''

`A LESSON BEFORE DYING:' REVELATIONS AND TEARS IN SOUTHERN
PARABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(DW) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Cheadle has shown film and television audiences his range as
an actor. Among other roles, he has been memorably believable as
the earnest young prosecutor in the series ``Picket Fences,'' as
the volatile psychopath Mouse in the film ``Devil in a Blue Dress''
and as the self-deprecating Sammy Davis Jr. in the television movie
``The Rat Pack.'' Now, in ``A Lesson Before Dying,'' Saturday night
on HBO, he faces the challenge of transforming himself within a
single performance. He succeeds, helping to elevate a tear-stained
parable into an exploration of the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Leading a strong ensemble cast, Cheadle plays Grant Wiggins, a
schoolteacher in rural Louisiana in the late 1940s. Grant, the
first person from his town's black quarter to attend a university,
has chosen to return home as a graduate to preside over the
ramshackle, all-black one-room schoolhouse he attended. In doing so
he is honoring his origins and especially his Tante Lou (Cicely
Tyson), who sacrificed for his education. But he is also forcing
himself to live within a feudal world where he is defined by his
color.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, with more than a trace of self-pity, thinks this is
burden enough. But Lou has another assignment for him. She tells
him he must give private lessons, in a death-row cell, to a young
man named Jefferson (Mekhi Phifer), the godson of Lou's friend Miss
Emma (Irma P. Hall). Jefferson had the fatally bad luck to witness
a shootout involving a white man and two blacks, all of whom died.
The system demands revenge for the white man's death. Jefferson has
been condemned to death for murder despite the public defender's
attempt to save his life by describing him to the all-white jury as
not worth the trouble of executing, ``a fool perhaps . . . not a
man . . . just a poor, darn hog.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant's assignment is to help Jefferson learn, in the short time
he has to live, that he is not a hog, that he is a person of value.
</P>
<P>
   ``How'm I supposed to tell him how a man should die?'' Grant
demands of his girlfriend, Vivian (Lisa Arrindell Anderson), a
teacher in another school. ``I'm still trying to figure out how a
man should live.''
</P>
<P>
   But she won't let him off the hook. ``This isn't about you,''
she tells him sharply. ``You run away from this, you're running
away from your people and from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant does not run away, even though Jefferson at first spurns
the attempts to reach him. What happens from there on transforms
the lives of all the people on the screen. It may also offer some
catharsis to people in the audience, even as they acknowledge that
the fundamental issue of equal justice remains unresolved today.
</P>
<P>
   The film is an adaptation of the 1993 novel by Ernest J. Gaines,
author of ``A Gathering of Old Men'' and ``The Autobiography of
Miss Jane Pittman.'' As the book did, the script by Ann Peacock
explores the many gradations of racism, including prejudice among
blacks toward those with lighter and darker skin, while it grants
its white characters a measure of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Joseph Sargent (``Miss Evers' Boys''), has coaxed
subtle performances from nearly all the players, including Ms.
Anderson; Phifer; Dana Ivey, as the woman in whose home Lou and
Emma were once servants, and the most beautiful collection of
children ever to fill a make-believe classroom. Ms. Tyson, whose
career was propelled by her portrayal of Gaines' Jane Pittman, has
scant chance to excel here in a role that calls for little more
than hectoring. Ms. Hall, however, brings a majestic strength to
the tired old woman who knows she cannot save her beloved
Jefferson's life but won't give up on his soul.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisiana locations add to the film's authentic feel, as
does the sound of the French-tinged Louisiana accents. Jefferson
refers to Emma as his Nana (pronounced nah-NAH), and everyone
agrees on the benefits of hard ``woik.'' The authenticity, however,
is not served by all the onscreen shedding of tears. Sargent, right
about so much here, should have trusted his audience to know when
to cry.
</P>
<P>
   He does trust Cheadle to tie the film together. When Grant tells
Jefferson, ``No matter how bad off we are, we still owe something
to those who love us,'' Cheadle makes these unsurprising words
sound like a revelation.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Strong thunderstorms should affect the northern Ohio Valley and
west slopes of the Appalachians Saturday as a small but powerful
low pressure system pushes through the region. Warm and humid air
from the south, preceding a cold front, combined with cooler air at
18,000 feet will promote these thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Winds from the south in the Ohio Valley are the result of a
strong high pressure system which is anchored just off of the
Southeast coast. This high will provide mostly sunny skies, warm
temperature readings, and higher humidities both on the Northeast
coast and from the Carolinas to northern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front that marks the leading edge of much cooler air will
sweep across the northern Plains and the Great Lakes during the
day. Ahead of this front, showers and thundershowers will develop
from the eastern Great Lakes to the northern Mississippi Valley,
while clouds associated with this front will be extensive over the
northern Mississippi and Red River Valleys. In the wake of low
pressure in the Dakotas, there will be scattered showers in the
Northern Rockies, especially over the higher terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Merging sea-breezes will trigger thunderstorms on both the
eastern and western coasts of Florida once again, some of which
could be rather strong. Onshore flow will persist in Southern
California allowing low clouds and fog to stay inland all day.

   Focus: Remarkable Rainfall
</P>
<P>
   A deluge struck Riverton, Nebraska on Thursday. The storm dumped
2.74 inches of rain on the town, which amounts to 70 percent of a
typical May's rainfall. The remarkable aspect of the torrent was
its length. It took only twenty minutes to accumulate nearly three
inches of rain. This was a truly rare downpour since the rate of
rain that fell equaled over seven inches per hour. The world record
for hourly rainfall is 12 inches recorded in Holt, Missouri. While
Riverton's drenching was not a world record, it produced a terrific
flood which washed out numerous roads and railway beds.

<P>
   DULL-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ If America wants for bland,
Al Gore is the man. He is considerably less colorful than the man
he hopes to succeed. But many of the hottest politicians these days
are the coldest, perhaps because `boring' can be interpreted as
`reliable' and `no surprises.' California Gov. Gray Davis, New York
Gov. George Pataki and even Texas Gov. George W. Bush are among
successful politicians noted for their blandness. By Richard L.
Berke. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-POLITICS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ The assassination of
Yitzhak Rabin was an undigested trauma for many Israelis, and that
Ehud Barak's victory allowed a kind of public catharsis of
repressed grief over a national martyr whose death at the hands of
an extremist Jew changed the way many Israelis felt about being
Israeli. Now Ehud must depart from the model of his mentor and try
to learn from his mistakes. By Deborah Sontag. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-SHIFT-REVIEW (Washington) _ In constitutional law, as in
geology, things can look stable on the surface _ until the tectonic
plates shift underneath. In its decision voiding California's
reduced welfare aid for newcomers to the state, the Supreme Court
used a portion of the 14th Amendment barring states from
restricting `privileges or immunities' of citizens. The sudden
resurrection of this long-neglected clause was one of the most
surprising and most consequential constitutional developments in
years. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   TV-NEWSHOWS-REVIEW (New York) _ Unveiling next season's network
lineups: what made the annual rite of spring so bleak was the
degree of cynicism and self-satisfaction among TV executives and
writer-producers who proudly showed off their newest sitcoms and
seemed in denial over just how terrible they were. The faint scent
of doom in the air _ that of the networks watching their audiences
erode with the growth of the Internet and cable _ failed to dampen
the strange euphoria. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-YEARBOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Excerpts from the Class of '99
yearbook at Columbine High School, where the shooting masacre took
place in April. Students write that their lives had been profoundly
and irreversibly changed.

one. By David E. Rosenbaum. (details to come)

with the revival of whaling by Indians in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   ESPIONAGE-REVIEW (Undated) _ There seems little doubt doubt that
China's theft of secrets from U.S. nuclear weapons labs had led to
spectacular gains by China in creating a modern thermonuclear
arsenal. Yet no one has been charged with espionage or any other
crime. Veterans of espionage investigations offer a variety of
explanations for the government's inability to proceed in the case.
They say that espionage cases have always been among the most
difficult because of the highly covert nature of the crime. By
David Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBALIZE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Globalization is thought to be a
new and powerful force that is erasing national borders and linking
the world in an unprecedented web of trade and investments. But
perhaps the greatest myth about globalization is that it is new. By
some measures, its peak occurred a century ago, making the 20th
century memorable in economic history mostly for its retreat from
globalization. In some respects, only now is the world economy
becoming roughly as interlinked as it was more than a century ago.
By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-BLAIR-REVIEW (London) _ British Prime Minister Tony
Blair's foreign policies have provoked strong opinions and raised
questions about what is becoming of Britain. Views range from
approval of resurgent British brawn and influence to outright
condemnation of policies seen as fatuous and foolhardy for a
country that no longer has the station or resources to act on its
own and expect others to follow. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-HONGKONG-REVIEW (Hong Kong) _ China's newest city is
crowded, expensive, polluted and mired in recession. And yet to
listen to Hong Kong's leaders, every person in mainland China with
the slightest claim to live here would scramble across the border
if the gates were opened. Hong Kong is in a lather over the
prospect that it is about to be inundated by migrants from mainland
China. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-OUTLOOK-REVIEW (Rio de Janeiro) _ The Brazilian financial
crisis seems to have passed, and investors and foreign leaders are
regaining confidence. Still unaddressed, however, is a more
fundamental issue: to what extent did the crisis reflect real
deficiencies in the Brazilian economy and to what degree was it a
self-fulfilling prophecy, brought on by panic and myopia in the
global capital market itself? By Larry Rohter.

NATO PLANNING UNDER WAY FOR POSSIBLE INVASION, PEACEKEEPING FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although NATO has all but ruled out a ground
invasion of Kosovo, the alliance's top commander has told senior
Pentagon officials that planning is nearing completion for a
possible invasion, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, told Defense
Secretary William Cohen and U.S. military leaders in a series of
private meetings Thursday that because there is no guarantee the
air war will achieve North Atlantic Treaty Organization goals by
autumn, ``you have to be open to the possibility of looking at
other options,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   The air war against Yugoslavia is nearing the two-month mark
without having achieved the alliance's stated aims of dislodging
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces and returning ethnic
Albanian refugees to their villages in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, facing divisions within alliance over the air
campaign, on Thursday insisted that NATO's bombardment was working
and has said troops would not enter Kosovo without a peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials last summer conducted an assessment of how many
troops would be needed to invade Kosovo and repel the Yugoslav
army. The figure then was around 200,000 troops and is likely to
increase in the new assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO leadership about a month ago asked Clark to update
those invasion plans, which are nearing completion, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment ``will give NATO a better appreciation of the
options it could face,'' said Bacon, adding that Clark is not
advocating an invasion at this point. ``We think that the air
campaign is working extremely well, but you have to be open to
other possibilities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The invasion blueprint is separate from NATO planning under way
to dispatch a 50,000-troop peacekeeping force to Macedonia ``as
quickly as possible,'' said Bacon, in the event of a political
settlement with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the outbreak of conflict March 24, NATO anticipated
sending 28,000 soldiers to enforce a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the largest republic in
Yugoslavia. More than 800,000 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have
poured into to neighboring Macedonia and Albania to flee the
Serb-dominated Yugoslav army and police force.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's senior political body, the North Atlantic Council, is
likely to discuss a plan early next week for an enlarged
peacekeeping force of which the United States is likely to
contribute 7,000 to 8,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The rash of new planning is in large part a function of the
calendar. In the fall, cold, wet weather will begin to settle over
the Balkans, slowing the air campaign, should it drag on so long,
and confounding efforts to shelter the refugees.

 &HT;    Margarine-mimicking spreads lower `bad' cholesterol levels
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The people in white lab coats have pulled another fast
one on nature, by creating margarinelike spreads that actually
lower cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   Two brands of cholesterol-reducing spreads have been approved by
federal officials within the past month. On Monday the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration approved Benecol, manufactured by McNeil
Consumer Healthcare, a division of Johnson &AMP; Johnson. Three weeks
ago, the FDA signed off on Take Control, made by Lipton. Both are
due to appear soon on store shelves in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Both brands are made with plant derivatives that reduce
cholesterol levels in humans by inhibiting the absorption of
cholesterol in the digestive tract.
</P>
<P>
   Benecol spreads are made with plant stanol ester, which comes
from wood pulp extract. Take Control uses sterol esters, made from
soybean oil extract. While Benecol can be used in baking and
frying, Take Control isn't recommended for cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA says it supports the manufacturers' claims that these
products are completely safe, with no adverse side effects
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do have a basis for marketing the product as a safe
product,'' said Dr. Alan Rulis, director of the FDA's office of
pre-market approval.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have shown that Benecol reduces total
cholesterol by up to 10 percent in people who daily eat three
servings of the spread. In addition, in studies the product reduced
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol _ considered the ``bad''
cholesterol _ by an average of 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Take Control lowers cholesterol levels by an average
of 7 percent to 10 percent when consumed daily.
</P>
<P>
   Adults should have cholesterol readings of no more than 200
milligrams per decaliter of blood, but more than half of all
American adults exceed this recommended limit, according to the
American Heart Association's 1999 Heart and Stroke Statistical
Update.
</P>
<P>
   Regular and light versions of Benecol spread are due to appear
in stores beginning Wednesday, with other, undisclosed Benecol food
products to follow, said McNeil spokesman Ron Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a whole line of products,'' Schmid said. ``We
want to make it easy for all those 100 million
cholesterol-concerned Americans to be using Benecol.''
</P>
<P>
   The spreads have been popular in Finland, where they have been
on the market since 1995, and were introduced in Britain in March.
</P>
<P>
   A 1 1/2-teaspoon serving of regular Benecol spread has 45
calories and 5 fat grams, of which 0.5 grams are saturated fat. The
same serving of light Benecol contains 30 calories and 3 fat grams,
with no saturated fat. The spreads are cholesterol-free.
</P>
<P>
   A tablespoon of Take Control, due to arrive in supermarkets in
June, has 50 calories and 6 fat grams, of which 0.5 grams are
saturated fat.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other margarine-type products that come in tubs, both
Benecol and Take Control are packaged in individual pats. Take
Control also will be available in 10-ounce tubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this would be the easiest way in the beginning for
consumers to be getting the appropriate amount of the product,''
Schmid said.
</P>
<P>
   How do the products taste? They're similar to the other
margarine-type spreads _ in everything but price. Benecol has a
suggested retail of $4.99 for a 21-pat package _ a week's supply
for one person, according to the recommendation of three daily
servings. Take Control's suggested price is $3.79 for both a
10-ounce tub and a 16-portion package.

 &HT;    Greek Orthodox Christians celebrating enthronement
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metro Atlanta's Greek Orthodox Christians are
celebrating the enthronement of Bishop Alexios at the Cathedral of
the Annunciation today.
</P>
<P>
   Alexios, who was born on Christmas Day 1943 in Patras, Greece,
has served as archiepiscopal vicar, or temporary head, of the
Diocese of Atlanta since Jan. 1, 1997. The diocese had been vacant
since the death of Bishop Philip of Atlanta on Dec. 28, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 Greek Orthodox Christians are registered in the 65
parishes, four missions and four monasteries of the seven
Southeastern states in the Diocese of Atlanta. Many more people of
Greek Orthodox heritage are not officially members of parishes, the
bishop said, and the Greek Orthodox community is growing in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   During his two years of temporary office in Atlanta, Bishop
Alexios has started three missions. One of them already has grown
to full parish status.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are coming from the North, from New York, from Canada,
retired people,'' he said. ``Also, many people are coming for
business. We have also had some converts through marriage, and some
by choice from different denominations.''
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Christianity, which claims roots with Jesus' apostles,
takes its name from the Greek words meaning ``correct belief.'' For
the first thousand years after Jesus' birth, his followers were
loosely united, but by the ninth century differences started to
grow. By 1054, relations had deteriorated to the point that the
head of the church of Constantinople and the head of the church of
Rome issued anathemas, or formal orders of excommunication, against
each other. That began the branches of Christianity now known as
Catholicism and Orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Pope Paul VI and Patriarch of Constantinople
Athenagoras I finally canceled the anathemas, but the churches
remain separate.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Alexios says he has the ``same goals the holy apostles
had'' for his tenure in Atlanta, ``to evangelize the people, to
preach to them.''
</P>
<P>
   As bishop of Atlanta, he says, he hopes to build ties with other
Christian leaders. ``I believe there are so many things we can do
together _ like charity,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He also is visiting all the communities in his diocese,
sometimes several within a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to use what the church is offering to people _
love, understanding and patience,'' the bishop says. ``If you do
this, you are going to serve the people. I believe the bishop is
shepherd. He should be with his flock, not with his desk.''

THE DANGERS OF LETTING A PRESIDENT READ 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
(lb) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do books influence public policy, or more specifically, how
do some books come to be read by policy-makers while others are
not?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of President Clinton and Robert D. Kaplan's
``Balkan Ghosts,'' a book that the writers Richard Reeves and
Elizabeth Drew say profoundly shaped the president's thinking on
the limitations of intervention in a part of the world where ethnic
feuds have deep roots.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the author's intentions were, the president reportedly
inferred from the book that the peoples of the region had never
coexisted peacefully for very long. Moreover, by some accounts,
after reading Kaplan's book he shied away from his earlier
inclination toward a proposed policy of ``lift and strike,''
meaning lifting an arms embargo to supply Bosnian Muslim forces
while launching an air attack on Serbian supply lines.
</P>
<P>
   In his book about Clinton's presidency, ``Running in Place,''
Reeves writes that the message Clinton and his wife ``took from the
book was that these people had been killing each other for 10
centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent books, notably ``Origins of a Catastrophe: Yugoslavia
and Its Destroyers'' by Warren Zimmermann, the U.S. ambassador to
Yugoslavia from 1989 to 1992, took direct aim at what has become
known in sound-bite style as the ancient hatreds position.
</P>
<P>
   In ``On the Edge,'' Miss Drew recounts how Clinton told Les
Aspin, then the secretary of defense, that after reading Kaplan's
book he was struck by the deep historical roots of the Bosnian
conflict. The reference was enough for Aspin to call Anthony Lake,
then the president's national security adviser, and others warning
them that Clinton was ``not on board'' in terms of lift and strike.
</P>
<P>
   To what degree Clinton's reading of Kaplan's book may have led
to presidential reservations on bolder involvement and inspired
fears of a Balkan quagmire is certainly a matter of conjecture.
After all, Bismarck's well-known observation that the Balkans are
``not worth the healthy bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier''
long predated the ``ancient hatreds'' thesis. (With Pomerania
having been ceded to Poland, and Poland now in NATO, some
descendant of Bismarck's grenadier may yet be called to Balkan
duty.)
</P>
<P>
   In any case, ``Balkan Ghosts'' could end up being the best-known
volume associated with the Clinton presidency, much the way ``The
Other America'' by Michael Harrington was the book that had the
greatest influence on the Kennedy and Johnson administrations,
leading to the policies of the Great Society, or similar to the
impact that George Gilder's ``Wealth and Poverty'' had on President
Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   But are such comparisons really useful? For one thing, Clinton
reads much more than most other recent presidents. His staff has
always scheduled three hours each afternoon for phone calls and
reading.
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly receives all sorts of reading suggestions from a
range of people inside and outside government, among them former
Labor Secretary Robert Reich, Vice President Al Gore, Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the author Taylor Branch and
Stephen L. Carter, the Yale professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to read at least 30 minutes a day,'' Clinton said in an
interview in 1996. ``And then sometimes on weekends or a long plane
ride, I'll read for a couple of hours at a time.'' He added: ``I
read a lot _ magazines, all kinds of books; books about politics,
books about history, mysteries. I love mysteries. I'm an addict;
that's one of my little cheap thrills outlet. I'm always reading
mysteries.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said the best book he had read that year was E.J. Dionne
Jr.'s book about the Democrats, ``They Only Look Dead.'' He read
Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ``Love in the Time of Cholera'' several
times. He mentioned Walter Mosely, Sue Grafton and Jonathan
Kellerman as among his favorite mystery writers and noted that he
had recently read a mystery by a British writer, Gerald Seymour,
that was set in Bosnia and Croatia. He said he was introduced to
books by old friends and new ones as well as through reviews.
</P>
<P>
   In his own book, ``All Too Human,'' George Stephanopoulos, the
former Clinton adviser, records that on a shuttle to New York he
found himself sitting next to R.W. Apple Jr. of The New York Times,
who praised Dean Acheson's 1987 memoir, ``Present at the
Creation.'' The next day Stephanopoulos took the book out of the
library and left it on his desk, where Clinton eventually picked it
up.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, during a low period in Clinton's tenure as
impeachment loomed, the president was reading James Chace's
biography ``Acheson,'' reportedly at the urging of Sidney
Blumenthal, who is a friend of both Clinton and Chace.
</P>
<P>
   Several people familiar with the president's reading habits
commented on how purposeful he is. Unlike Churchill, Roosevelt,
Truman and Acheson, who kept reading the likes of Herodotus,
Thucydides and Gibbon, Clinton appears to share the widespread view
that contemporary problems require up-to-the-minute nostrums.
</P>
<P>
   For such a wide-ranging reader, can one book be so profoundly
influential? Mark Danner, who has reviewed several books on the
Balkans, says he has a bookcase containing 160 such volumes that
have appeared just in English in the last four years. Had the
president read all of them, would the choices he made have been
better?
</P>
<P>
   More realistically, had he read some of the others, say
Zimmermann's, which focuses more narrowly on the destructive
intentions of Serbia's leader, Slobodan Milosevic, instead of
Kaplan's book (or at least before it), would U.S. and NATO policies
on the Balkans be different?
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises an interesting question,'' Stephanopoulos said
with just a touch of sarcasm. ``Is a man or a president who reads
more likely to be influenced by the alleged bias of a particular
book than a man or a president who doesn't?''

BRIDGES TO THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 23, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much has changed in the lives of those born after 1950, but no
difference is more fundamental than the lengthening of the time
they may expect to live.
</P>
<P>
   For their parents, the Biblical three score and ten served as a
realistic statistical goal line. For the current generation, those
who retire at, say, 65, may quite realistically hope to live
another 15 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   And life expectancy is gradually rising.
</P>
<P>
   One result: an enormous amount of crisis-mongering about
unfunded entitlements, of which Peter G. Peterson's ``Gray Dawn''
is perhaps the most apocalyptic. ``There's an iceberg dead ahead,''
writes the 72-year-old investment banker. ``It's called global
aging, and it threatens to bankrupt the great powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another result: individual retirement patterns are quietly
changing in unexpected ways. Already they are far more varied than
the streotypical one-step view of retirement suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The latest development is the emergence of an important category
of ``bridge jobs'' between full-time employment and complete
retirement. Estimates suggest that between a third and a half of
older Americans will work at a bridge job before leaving the labor
force altogether.
</P>
<P>
   That's the conclusion of Joseph F. Quinn of Boston College, one
of the nation's leading experts on retirement behavior. He says
that public policy is changing in ways that make continued work in
life still more likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If employers are willing to provide flexible job opportunities
to meet the needs of these potential employees, then society can
tap a growing pool of older, experienced, and willing workers for
years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The bridge phenomenon is a recent and surprising development.
For more than a century, American men had been leaving the labor
force at earlier and earlier ages _ until the mid 1980s. The trend
abruptly ended then, and now probably has reversed. Older women's
participation rates have increased significantly, too.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, who sifts through mounds of data as a fellow of the
Employee Benefits Research Institute, was among the first to
discern the trend and recognize its significance. Since the
mid-1990s, he and a relative handful of other experts have been
working overtime trying to figure out what it means.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened? There are two basic explanations. The first
is that the undisputed reversal in male labor force participation
rates may be nothing more complicated than the business cycle.
Perhaps an unusually long expansion has created jobs for those who
want to keep working.
</P>
<P>
   Something like that happened in the late 1960s, this hypothesis
holds, when the Vietnam War kept unemployment rates below 4 percent
for four years in a row. When the boom ended in the 1970s, elderly
male participation rates plummeted. There was no permanent change
in the taste for leisure.
</P>
<P>
   The other explanation _ the one favored by Quinn _ emphasizes a
number of changes in the retirement environment that ecourage
additional work by older Americans. Congress three times has raised
the age at which manadatory retirement could be required by firms:
to 65 in 1967, then to 70 in 1978, and finally, for firms with more
than 20 employees, to no mandatory retirement in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Social Security rules continue to change in order to
make work late in life more attractive. The normal Social Security
retirement age will rise to 67 for those reaching 62 in the year
2022, for one thing, reflecting widespread agreement that longer
life makes longer work desirable.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the amount of income a Social Security recipient
may earn without losing any benefits is increasing rapidly. Quinn
says that by 2002, recipients will be able to earn $30,000 a year,
without any loss of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Private pension plans have been changing, too, in ways that
encourage working longer. Most defined-benefit plans discouraged
working past a certain age by imposing penalties in the presence of
other work income. The defined-contribution plans that started to
take over in the 1980s contain no such disincentives to work.
</P>
<P>
   The common assumption is that people will not continue to work
unless confronted with dire necessity. Maybe not, says Quinn. The
1998 Retirement Confidence Survey by the Employee Benefit Research
Institute found, however, that 61 percent of current workers expect
that they will work for pay after retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the survey found that for most of those planning to go
on working, financial need was not the chief concern. Only a third
cited the need to make ends meet, and well over half mentioned
``quality of life.'' It long has been an adage that old lawyers die
only when they stop going into their office every day. And there is
evidence that a good proportion of older workers simply trade wage
and salary work for self-employment in some related field.
</P>
<P>
   What about those who choose a new line of work altogether? Is it
degrading to start running a register at McDonald's, say, or
teaching in a day-care center after a lifetime of, say, selling
steel? Like any job, it probably depends on the circumstances. Some
people will enjoy their bridge jobs; others will not.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon discerned by Quinn and others is far too new and
unfamiliar to submit to easy generalizations. The only thing that
seems clear is that changing attitudes towards work are a big part
of it.
</P>
<P>
   The US economy, which over the last 50 years has accommodated
women and teen-agers with surprising ease, now seems ready to make
room for another new group of workers, too.

GERMANY MAKES IT EASIER FOR FOREIGN RESIDENTS TO BECOME CITIZENS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Acknowledging what a mixed society it has become,
Germany Friday adopted a new immigration law that will make it
easier for many of the country's 7 million residents of foreign
origin to become citizens.
</P>
<P>
   After a tortuous and fiercely contested passage through
Parliament, the new legislation was approved by the upper house. It
goes into effect on Jan. 1 and represents a significant shift in
the country's view of itself.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having more foreigners on its soil than any other
European country, Germany had long clung to a view of nationality
based principally on blood lines rather than a liberal, republican
view of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The new law, drafted by the center-left coalition of Social
Democrats and Greens that took office last year, breaks that
tradition. It will enable any child born in Germany who has at
least one parent who has been in the country for eight years to
gain automatic German citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The child will be granted dual nationality until the age of 23,
then must decide which passport to keep. Only in exceptional cases,
such as when ``unreasonable conditions'' are imposed for giving up
a foreign passport, will dual citizenship be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier draft of the law would have allowed dual citizenship
as a general rule for foreigners' children born here. But after the
opposition Christian Democrats, backed by some far-right groups,
gathered 5 million signatures on a petition against the plan, the
government was forced to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning on the issue, the Christian Democrats took the state
of Hesse in an election in February and so denied the coalition of
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder a majority in the federal upper house.
Only by changing the draft to include an age limit for dual
citizenship was the passage of the legislation Friday assured.
</P>
<P>
   The law also says foreigners who have lived in Germany for 8
years _ rather than the present 15 years _ are eligible for
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   It is Germany's large Turkish community, numbering about 2.2
million, that will benefit most from the new law. The Turks, like
other large groups of immigrants, began to pour into Germany in the
1960s during the country's postwar economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Cem Ozdemir, a Green Party member of Parliament and a German of
Turkish origin, said the decision amounted to a historic step. ``We
have now signaled that those who have lived here for a long time
belong to us and are part of German society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice the prejudices and misunderstandings that have
tended to hinder the integration of large Turkish communities in
cities like Berlin appear likely to persist for some time.
</P>
<P>
   With its efforts to revive the German economy stalled, and
proposed tax laws making little headway, the passing of the new
immigration law amounts to one of the first significant domestic
achievements of Schroeder's coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Kosovo has helped the chancellor's standing and has
tended to distract attention from domestic problems. But the
problems of his coalition _ especially repeated squabbling and an
inability to unite around a policy decision _ have not been
eliminated.

IN `TRUTH,' MOORE THEN MEETS THE EYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE AWFUL TRUTH 
Produced and directed by: Michael Moore 
On: Bravo 
Date: Sunday at 9 p.m. 
Rating: TV-PG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Moore, the activist gadfly who made the movies ``Roger &AMP;
Me'' and ``The Big One'' and wrote ``Downsize This,'' just won't go
away.
</P>
<P>
   His defunct ``TV Nation'' series first ran on NBC, then the Fox
Network, and now he has another, down the broadcast food chain, on
cable. In midseason on Bravo, it's called ``The Awful Truth'' and
features Moore continuing to provoke the powers that be, gleefully
challenging corporate entitlement to runaway profits and pressing
government to improve its behavior, too. His modus operandi, as
always, is to play a comically rumpled David and ambush and
confront one or another business or government Goliath with
poison-tipped questions.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Roger &AMP; Me,'' you might recall, the filmmaker relentlessly
pursued General Motors Corp. chairman Roger Smith to rake the
automaker over the coals for pulling out of Flint, Mich., and
destroying the fabric of life there. In ``The Big One,'' another
documentary with Moore's distinctive home-made flavor, he collars
Nike boss Phil Knight on camera. He cheerfully reams him out for
refusing to make shoes in the United States and exploiting teenage
Asian workers for peanut pay.
</P>
<P>
   The half-hour ``The Awful Truth,'' airing at 9 p.m. on Sundays,
is more of the same _ and God knows we need it. Moore is one of the
few genuine voices of dissent with a toehold in mainstream media.
Perhaps he gets away with his strong anticorporate and pro-union
politics because he's a jokey fat guy with Woody Allen-ish wardrobe
and demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, given its format, ``The Awful Truth'' is
hit-or-miss. The first few minutes of this week's show, devoted to
ridiculing Secretary of Defense William Cohen for his mawkish
poetry and sensitive-guy persona, seem pointless until the polemic
payoff. But even so, there's something tonic in Moore's sophomoric
high jinks in sight of the Pentagon. They remind us, by contrast,
of how stuffy, prepackaged, and edgeless most American TV news
commentary is.
</P>
<P>
   The meat of the program is a humorously crafted but
deadeyedassault on Manpower International. The worldwide temporary
agency, is, we are told, the single largest employer in the United
States _ robust testament to years of corporate downsizing. By
previously embarrassing Manpower in ``The Big One,'' Moore became
the subject of a widely distributed company memo indicating how to
neutralize him should he reappear at any of the company's offices.
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, he and his film crew visit several Manpower
locations to evaluate how well its workers execute the starchy
five-point memorandum. All of this Moore packages as a punchy game
show that he screens, along with other filmed segments, for the
large live audience of ``The Awful Truth'' _ a group he also
entertains with stand-up chatter and comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Moore is not only a skillful guerrilla filmmaker, but also a
deceptively good stage comedian. He may be our sharpest political
comic because of the way he's able to domesticate his message.
Given his klutzy, good-natured beer-bellied image , his tough
left-wing agenda emerges as amusing common sense. In his film work,
sometimes even his victims giggle as he twists the dagger.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are moments when Moore's wit dims and his jovial
persona wears thin. But there he is. Michael Moore just won't leave
us alone, and it's a darned good thing.

BIG JAPANESE BANKS REPORT BIG ANNUAL LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Underscoring the challenges they face in recovering
their health, Japan's biggest banks reported steep fiscal-year
losses Friday and most were records.
</P>
<P>
   The poor performance largely reflected the banks' efforts to
clean their books by writing off bad loans, but the losses, for the
second straight year, were still larger than expected. The main
reason is that the banks must follow stricter rules for evaluating
bad loans and creating a deeper cushion of money in the event that
good loans go bad.
</P>
<P>
   The eight big banks that announced results Friday, in addition
to Sanwa Bank, which reported Thursday, said they expected to make
money in the present fiscal year, which ends next March 31. But
banks had made similar predictions last year, only to reverse their
forecasts because of stiffer regulatory rules and a persistently
recessionary economy.
</P>
<P>
   For the year ending March 31, 1999, only the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, the nation's biggest bank, reported a narrower
net loss than the previous year, registering a negative 86.9
billion yen, or $700 million, six times smaller than the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   Red ink flowed the greatest at Sumitomo Bank, which reported a
consolidated net loss of 568.9 billion yen, or $4.6 billion. The
bank spent one trillion yen, or $8.9 billion, to dispose of bad
loans and build protection against loans that sour.
</P>
<P>
   The other banks that reported Friday _ Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank,
Sakura Bank, Tokai Bank, Asahi Bank, Fuji Bank and Bank of Yokohama
_ announced similar results.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's banks have made significant strides to wipe
unrecoverable loans off their books. And because there is a greater
feeling that the banking system no longer faces a sudden crisis or
a collapse, investors have been buying bank stocks, sending the
benchmark Topix bank index up 30 percent so far this year. Even
Friday, as earnings results trickled out, the bank index edged up.
</P>
<P>
   But the challenges the banks face before they can restore
themselves to health are enormous. Even now, many economists and
analysts say that Japan's banking system, which is critical to any
economic recovery, is not functioning properly.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge remains the recession. Even if the banks
make no more new loans, their portfolio of bad loans would probably
still expand, simply from financial troubles brought on by the weak
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The number of bankruptcies has fallen recently, particularly as
the government has offered credit support to small businesses. But
economists expect unemployment to rise in the coming months, which
would put further strains on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Japan's large and small companies alike have
drastically cut their spending on plants and other projects so that
demand for loans has weakened.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, new lending has been dipping for months. Lending
still fell in April, though at a smaller rate, even as banks
received a windfall of cash from taxpayers as part of the
government's effort to strengthen the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are scattered reports of banks scouting around for
lending opportunities, the banks seem mostly to have plunked large
sums of their new money into government bonds. This has helped
create a boom in the bond market, bringing down bond prices from
their worrisome highs in February.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal to receive public money, the banks agreed to
restructure themselves and try to increase lending. But some
central bank officials and analysts worry that instead of making
new loans to companies, banks may simply sink their money into
corporate bonds or commercial paper, which the banks consider less
risky because these securities can be easily sold.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts are also still concerned about the true state of
the banks' bad assets. A few borrowers, which the banks had
classified as healthy, have suddenly gone belly up, leaving the
banks with unexpected bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, after the Financial Supervisory Agency, Japan's
banking regulator, inspected the portfolio of Long-Term Credit
Bank, which was nationalized last fall, it discovered that the
level of problem assets was nearly twice as bad as the bank had
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators discovered that Long-Term Credit had disguised some
bad loans, with the purported help of foreign financial
institutions, by using complex derivatives to move the bad loans to
an offshore entity _ usually affiliated with a foreign financial
institution. Analysts worry about similar arrangements at other
banks.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic
daily, reported that under the new standard for reporting, the
total amount of bad loans rose 45 percent to 20 trillion yen, or
$160 billion. That is an estimated eight times the amount of
operating profits the banks earned this year, according to James
Fiorillo, a banking analyst at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd.

PULL THE PLUG: THESE SHOWS DESERVE A GRACEFUL EXIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was time, really. NBC's ``Homicide: Life on the Street,''
which has been chasing its creative tail this year following the
departure of two key cast members at the end of last season,
finally got the ax. The consistently low-rated, high-quality drama
aired its last original episode Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was time, too, for ``NewsRadio,'' a once-terrific sitcom that
lost its way when it lost Phil Hartman at the end of last season.
Skeptics said neither ``Homicide'' nor ``NewsRadio'' would recover
from the cast changes, but that seemed pessimistic: Good writers
can always make up for the loss of good characters by creating good
new characters. Worked for ``Cheers.'' Didn't work for either of
these shows.
</P>
<P>
   For TV fans, it's sad to watch a good show deteriorate. But few
shows know when to quit. ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' is one of
the few examples of quality remaining consistently high until the
plug is pulled. Most linger till they become irrelevant, like this
year's ``Home Improvement'' and ``Mad About You,'' or all but
creatively bankrupt, like last year's seasons of ``Seinfeld,''
``Roseanne'' and ``Ellen.'' Of this year's veterans, only
``Friends'' has had a consistently strong season; ``The X-Files''
and ``NYPD Blue'' both got off to a great start and finished with a
flourish, but their midseason episodes have been merely treading
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Files'' creator Chris Carter has said next season will be
``Files''' last, although we've heard that kind of talk before.
``NYPD Blue'' will come back next year, but it doesn't seem like
it'll withstand another season of Dennis Franz's blustery
interrogations, and the rest of the cast _ even highly touted new
arrival Rick Schroder _ has been left in the dust most of this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Even with its late-season surge, the series is showing more than
a few signs of running out of gas. Although it's a likely candidate
for renewal, someone should step up and decide that after next
season, it will bow out gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   The same should be done for these shows:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Simpsons'': Even at its worst, this is the funniest show
on TV, and its season-closing episodes were among the best TV this
year. But during the past few years, ``The Simpsons'' has been
about one-third as funny as it used to be, usually reserving its
best jokes for only one of its three acts. In December, the
half-hour series will turn 10 years old. Sign off then, and it'll
upstage ``Seinfeld'' as the show of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly Susan'': Never all that great in the first place,
``Susan'' and similar single-woman sitcoms have been left in the
dust by the more outrageous ``Ally McBeal'' (a show whose
inventiveness is also showing signs of flagging, even as creator
David Kelley pushes for a half-hour sitcom version, the first show
to spin off of itself). ``Susan'' now lives a quiet existence on
Monday night, also known as the Island of Misfit NBC Sitcoms That
Once Followed ``Friends.'' It never should have been moved; it
should have been banished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier'': Once thought of as the most sophisticated comedy on
network TV, the show has reached a point where it's going in
circles: How far will Frasier and Niles take their sibling rivalry?
How will Frasier screw up his latest romance? Will Niles ever win
Daphne's heart? Unless ``Frasier'' pulls a comeback like Kelsey
Grammer's last series, ``Cheers,'' it's time to get off the couch
and turn off this shrink sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beverly Hills, 90210'': Reportedly, the show will drop its
original cast and pick up a new one. On MTV, they call that ``The
Real World.'' And look how good that show is! Pack it up and move
to a new ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   ``Veronica's Closet'': Unlike the other NBC shows on this list,
even ``Suddenly Susan,'' it's impossible to understand how this
poorly written show ever stuck around. NBC just announced that the
show would move to Monday nights. The network should have closed
the closet door.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER'': Signs that this medical show is on life support include
the desperate near-fling of Dr. John Carter (Noah Wylie) and his
medical student, Lucy Knight (Kellie Martin), and the burgeoning
relationship between Drs. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards) and
Elizabeth Corday (Alex Kingston). Eventually, this show's doctors
will bat the romantic cycle, ``Melrose Place''-style, unless
somebody stops them. It's got one good year left, then it needs a
do-not-resuscitate order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago Hope'': ``ER's'' main rival once offered a thoughtful
alternative to the NBC show's fast pace. CBS, however, has never
known what to do with the show, moving it from time slot to time
slot so often that it was never able to develop much viewer
loyalty. The network just announced it's moving ``Hope'' to
``another'' time slot (8 p.m. Thursdays) next year. This may be a
true case of asking for a show to be mercy-killed; its network is
torturing it to death.

`FELICITY' STAR CLOSES THE BOOK ON FRESHMAN SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This is the last interview Keri Russell is going
to do _ at least until August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basically a loner,'' the 23-year-old actress says with a
laugh, ``so the last nine months have been a little surreal for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The last nine months have seen Russell transformed from a
promising unknown to a Golden Globe winner and one of People
magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People in the World. This all comes
courtesy of her starring role on ``Felicity,'' the engaging
coming-of-age drama on the WB that stands out from other teen fare
because of its consistent quality. ``Clueless'' this isn't.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which depicts the life of a young woman who
impulsively followed her high-school crush to college in New York,
also distinguishes itself with its (relative) realism. Unlike, say,
``Dawson's Creek,'' where teens talk as if they've swallowed a
thesaurus, the young people on ``Felicity'' often fumble with the
English language, trying to articulate feelings they're only
beginning to understand.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they're believable _ if impossibly attractive _
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers _ at least young women, the demographic core courted by
the network _ have responded, making ``Felicity'' one of the few
hit shows of this past season. (It's ranked in the top 10 with
female teens.) And Russell, playing the impetuous, endearing,
navel-gazing title character, has become a star more or less
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Russell wasn't exactly the girl-next-door type that the show's
creators wanted for the role. She tried to oblige, dressing down
the day of the audition by wearing jeans, a baggy sweater and her
curly hair in a plain bun. Didn't work. They still thought she was
too pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character was originally intended to be played by someone
who was plain-looking,'' says executive producer J.J. Abrams, who
created the show with Matt Reeves. ``Keri is gorgeous. She was too
attractive to play Felicity, yet she couldn't have been more right.
She is so natural, funny and engaging.''
</P>
<P>
   And tired. That's why she's taking a break this summer. We
recently talked to the personable Russell about her sudden fame,
her show's success and why her emerald green eyes are still smiling
over Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're not making a movie this summer. Was there any pressure
to keep the career momentum going?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is a peripheral pressure, but it's not something I
really, truly feel the need to do. To me, quality of life is so
much more important than making some bad movie. And if I honestly
felt that I had to do a movie this summer or my career would be
over, it would just be a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's not as if the past year has been a waste.
</P>
<P>
   Russell: Right! Things have gone so well. I just need to take a
little time to enjoy a little bit of it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What have you been doing since ``Felicity'' finished last
month?
</P>
<P>
   Russell: Just traveling. I went to Ireland, where I made a movie
last summer (``Mad About Mambo,'' due in October) and I just had to
go back and see all the things I couldn't see when I was there. The
people are so cool, so spunky and full of life. It's an amazing
country.
</P>
<P>
   And I just got back from Hawaii. Basically, I've been visiting
all the people I love who I couldn't see during the season.
Yosemite is next. And I'm going to get as many massages as humanly
possible and eat all the great food I can.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With the show's success, you must have been offered a lot of
scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Russell: A lot, yes. And that's a big part of the problem.
What's out there right now is kind of discouraging, especially
after being spoiled with something as creative and amazing as
``Felicity.'' It's hard to read scripts now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are you seeing?
</P>
<P>
   Russell: Well, last year, I got offered horror movies. This
year, they're moving more toward high-school, bad-taste humor.
Cheap stuff. Bad versions of ``Heathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what would you like to see?
</P>
<P>
   Russell: I love a good story. The best movie I've seen in the
past two years was ``A Walk on the Moon.'' It's a story with real
people, something that makes you feel like you want to be a better
person.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think you'll ever find something like that?
</P>
<P>
   Russell: I hope so. But who knows? I don't even know if I'll
remain an actor. I want to have kids. I want to keep traveling.
There's so many things I haven't seen yet ... a million things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has ``Felicity'' made you a better person? Certainly, it must
have made you a different person.
</P>
<P>
   Russell: I don't have a new fancy car or a big house. (Russell
shares a Westside apartment with her long-time boyfriend, Tony
Lucca, who she met on the Disney Channel's ``Mickey Mouse Club.'')
I still have the same best friends, the same boyfriend and my
family still likes me.
</P>
<P>
   I guess the biggest change is my accessibility to people. I have
to be open and accepting of people all the time no matter who they
are or if they're not so great. Something I'm learning is patience
and tolerance of people ... strange people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Russell: (Laughs) Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The night you won the Golden Globe you looked a little
worn-out backstage.
</P>
<P>
   Russell: I don't remember much about that night. It was so
surreal to have all that attention focused on me. I was so
emotionally spent from all the attention and the flashbulbs. It's
just really numbing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't you celebrate at all?
</P>
<P>
   Russell: I went to the Miramax party for a few glasses of
champagne and I was in bed by 11. I had to be at work the next
morning at 6. So I didn't think I was that special, you know. I
still had to wake up at the crack of dawn the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A lot has happened to Felicity this year. Do the writers ever
consult with you about the character?
</P>
<P>
   Russell: J.J. and Matt tell me when they're deciding on a big
story. Like, they told me when they were going to have Felicity
lose her virginity before they wrote the script. They were like,
``What do you think about that?'' And I'm like, ``I think that's
 &UR; !ital! &LR; awesome!''
</P>
<P>
   But you know what? If I said I didn't like it, I don't think
they would have changed it. These guys know what they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know what they have in store for Felicity's sophomore
year?
</P>
<P>
   Russell: Not a clue. They're working as we speak. The only rumor
I've heard is that I might be an R.A. (a resident adviser at the
dorm).
</P>
<P>
   Q: And how do you feel about the last episode? Felicity has to
make a pretty tough choice between the two guys in her life.
</P>
<P>
   Russell: It's a real shocker. That's all I'm going to say. When
we were doing the read-through for it, we were like, ``What! Oh my
gosh!''
</P>
<P>
   Q: But not shocking in, say, a ``Melrose Place'' sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   Russell: No. We have a ways to go before we get there. But this
being a network television series, nothing would really surprise
me. It's just kind of the nature of the thing. I tell everyone not
to get too attached to any character or relationship. You just
never know. &QL;

CLINTON PRESSES FOR PASSAGE OF GUN-CONTROL ISSUES 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to seize the momentum for gun control,
President Clinton urged House Democrats on Friday to press for
passage of the issue before Congress adjourns for Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats insisted they will push for a vote next week on the
House floor and try to thwart Republican plans to hold committee
hearings next week and vote in June.
</P>
<P>
   The murder of 13 people by two Littleton, Colo., teens in April
and the shooting of six Georgia high school students Thursday has
radically altered the debate over gun control and put gun-control
opponents, especially the National Rifle Association, on the
defensive. The shootings were the latest in a series of school
shootings by disgruntled youths.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also sense a burgeoning political issue.
</P>
<P>
   The school violence prompted the Republican-led Senate to
reverse course this week and adopt a Democratic plan that would
require background checks at gun shows and pawnshops before
handguns could be purchased or redeemed. The provision was part of
a larger juvenile justice bill, later adopted 73-25, that would
make it easier to prosecute youths as adults for serious crimes. It
also would require child safety locks be sold with new handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is demanding action. We can't let the NRA write our
gun laws,'' said Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., one of 15 to 20 House
Democrats who met with Clinton in the White House's West Wing.
</P>
<P>
   The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton flew
Thursday to Colorado to console the victims of the Columbine High
School shootings. The Senate opened debate on the Democratic
proposal just minutes after word of the Georgia shootings reached
the floor and Vice President Al Gore cast the tie-breaking vote to
adopt the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president said very clearly that he wants a memorial for
those victims of Littleton and every other shooting that we've seen
in the schools and houses across the country, and he wants that
memorial to those kids before we go on Memorial Day recess,'' said
Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Senate, the House rules prevent members from offering
nongermaine amendments and advocates of gun control may have little
opportunity to force a floor vote. They may try to hold up Memorial
Day adjournment. Congress planned to leave late next week and
return June 7.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, however, maintained that Democratic leaders
agreed to a timetable and now have reneged. House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, said House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., agreed with GOP plans to hold judiciary committee hearings
next week and hold a floor vote in June. Democrats dispute the
contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all quite surprised that Mr. Gephardt did not stick to
our agreement and, without telling anyone, went to the House floor
to demand an immediate vote,'' DeLay said. ``To address this issue
in a haphazard fashion does not do justice to the victims of
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican aide said House leaders attempted to accommodate
Democrats by excelerating consideration of a gun-control measure to
the second week in June. The aide also noted there are 30 Democrats
who receive high ratings from the NRA who are unlikely to support
their leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to turn this into a partisan issue, and it
isn't,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., already has endorsed
several gun-control issues, such as raising the age for purchasing
a handgun from 18 to 21.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats contended there have been enough hearings on the issue
of gun control and another is not needed.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., suggested of a delayed vote: ``Perhaps
it's political.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people speculate a delay would give opponents a chance to
regroup and allow some of the public emotion surrounding the school
shootings to lessen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that I can't see anyone who will benefit from
delay except the people like the NRA and those who have opposed
these measures every step of the way,'' said White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart.

L.L. BEAN TO OPEN FULL-PRICE STORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As part of a strategy to reenergize its legend, L.L. Bean Inc.
said Friday it plans to open its first full-price store outside of
Maine next year in suburban Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to boost flat sales, Bean previously disclosed plans to
open four or five stores, some similar to its flagship retail space
in Freeport, Maine, but it had not specified locations for new
stores other than to say they would be outside New England.
</P>
<P>
   Set to open in the summer of 2000, the 75,000-square-foot store
will be an anchor in Tysons Corner Center, a mall in McLean, Va.
Roughly 1.4 million of Bean's catalog customers live within the
trade area of the new store, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem odd for a catalog company to be opening stores at
a time when the retail industry is abuzz about e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But some observers think stores may be an integral part of an
Internet strategy. Many consumers balk at buying expensive items
sight unseen from a Web site operated by a strange retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who have visited a retailer's store are far more
likely to make future purchases from that retailer's Web site, said
Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report.
</P>
<P>
   As much as a place to sell windbreakers and its famous duck
boots, the new stores will also be a shrine to the Bean brand and
personality, a place where new customers can become as familiar
with the Bean mystique as New Englanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our store will be the catalog come to life,'' said Leon
Gorman, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   Opening stores may have another benefit. Catalog sales spike
around the holidays. Stores see steadier traffic year-round.
</P>
<P>
   New stores should not be confused with Bean's roughly 10 outlet
stores, which the company operates around the country to liquidate
unpopular merchandise. Last year, sales at privately owned Bean
dipped slightly to $1.03 billion; the lion's share of revenues came
from catalog sales.
</P>
<P>
   Opening stores is part of strategy to regain the double-digit
growth Bean enjoyed for most of the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   A second part of this growth strategy involves a new catalog
called Freeport Studio, a woman's career-wear line that is more
fashionable than the clothing Bean is known for.
</P>
<P>
   Based on early results, Gorman said he projects Freeport Studio
sales of $65 million to $70 million for its first year.

IN KOSOVO, CLINTON TRIES TO FIGHT A NEW WAR WITHOUT RISK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN and JOHN BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Between the two options that President Clinton has
declared unacceptable _ doing nothing or all-out war _ the White
House has devised a new kind of warfare for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   It is a calibrated war, enabled by high-tech weaponry, guided by
the flickering light of opinion polls and shackled by fear that a
few American combat deaths could turn the public against any
military intervention in an obscure placed called Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The calibrated war is being fought in a kind of policy bunker,
wedged between a Congress where half the members have publicly
declared Clinton unfit for office and a 19-member NATO alliance
bickering over the use of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say the president is waging a pragmatic
and moral kind of warfare that pushes military action as far as it
can go, given the hard limits of American public opinion,
congressional dissent and alliance discord.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ``anti-Powell doctrine,'' said one White House
official. He described the new approach as giving the United States
far more flexibility in defending American values than the
all-or-nothing precepts of retired Gen. Colin Powell, the
strategist of the Gulf War who said troops should not be committed
without clear objectives and the military means to achieve them.
</P>
<P>
   A decade that began with Powell's doctrine of going to war only
when victory is guaranteed by overwhelming force is ending with a
protean policy that administration officials call ``coercive
diplomacy.'' The first was designed to crush a foreign enemy; the
second hopes to achieve military and political goals overseas
without losing votes at home.
</P>
<P>
   The president's pollster, Mark Penn, conducts weekly polls for
the Democratic National Committee that periodically sound out
public perceptions of the war, according to Joe Lockhart, the White
House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Limits on action are everywhere, Lockhart said: ``We are
constrained by our allies. Will the public support this? Will the
European publics support this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the war is calibrated, but the rhetoric is
calibrated,'' he said. ``It's a constant challenge to articulate
what the U.S. interest is, why we're doing this, both in terms of
NATO allies and simple right and wrong questions. We look at this
on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The military calibration goes on behind closed doors in the
Pentagon and in the White House, but the president's day-to-day
hunt for a middle ground between risky action and humiliating
paralysis can be heard in his own language.
</P>
<P>
   One day, he compares ethnic cleansing in Kosovo to the Holocaust
and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to Hitler. The next, in
almost apologetic tones, he distances himself from the conduct of
the war and makes clear he does not relish commanding troops in
combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people question what I have done and how I
have done it in Kosovo,'' the president said on Wednesday. ``All I
can tell you is I'm convinced that I've done the right thing in the
best available way.''
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, American and NATO war planners assess the
physical and political damage of the previous night's bombing and
adjust their targeting accordingly. After mistakenly blowing up the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade, allied warplanes avoided all targets
in the Yugoslav capital for four days. After hitting a refugee
convoy three weeks ago, U.S. pilots now have to radio for
authorization to strike if there is any doubt about the target.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the assault on Yugoslavia is driven in large part
by the availability of a new generation of precision weaponry which
allows military planners to select targets with previously
unimaginable accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   These weapons encouraged Clinton to embrace what critics contend
is a fantasy _ long-distance, antiseptic warfare that puts few
American pilots at risk and does not require the use of ground
troops to achieve military objectives.
</P>
<P>
   But Powell asserted in an interview that such one-dimensional
war leaves the initiative in Milosevic's hands. ``He decides
whether it is working or not; he decides when he's had enough,''
the general said.
</P>
<P>
   Why have the president and his advisers chosen a course which
does not ensure victory?
</P>
<P>
   White House advisers say they see a substantial chance of
success and they reject the Powell doctrine as offering what one
termed the ``false choice'' of ground war or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   All presidents, a senior foreign policy aide said, deal with
constraints and must take public opinion and international
realities into account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each challenge presents unique interests and factors,'' he
said, citing the need to maintain NATO cohesion while not
alienating Russia. ``You have to find the best strategy within
those boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell pointed to a simpler explanation: ``I just don't think
Bill Clinton wanted to have a major ground war on his watch,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, if the Clinton administration had slavishly
followed the Powell doctrine in the 1990s, the United States would
never have approved the limited bombing which, when combined with a
Croatian ground offensive, brought an end to the war in Bosnia.
There were no American combat fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   When he ruled out a ground war at the outset and chose to rely
on air power alone in Kosovo, Clinton was being lured down a path
that has tempted nearly every president since before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air power is very seductive to American leaders because it
combines our love of technology with our distaste for the bestial
aspects of land warfare,'' said Rich Dunn, a defense analyst at the
Center for National Security Issues in Virginia and a retired Army
colonel. ``You do it nice and cleanly. Nobody gets their feet
muddy. A pilot flies over at 15,000 feet, kills only those people
that need to be killed, flies homes and has a cold beer with a
beautiful young lady. This is not a new concept.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The notion of winning World War II from the air seduced
President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Gen. George C. Marshall, the Army
chief-of-staff, struggled to convince Roosevelt to balance air,
land and sea forces. Marshall was proved right, as 1940s technology
failed miserably in producing a risk-free war in Europe. More than
34,000 Allied flyers were killed and German industrial production
climbed during the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the bombing of North Vietnam proved ineffective as a
club to coerce the North Vietnamese into abandoning their invasion
of the south. In the Gulf War, ground troops were needed at the end
of weeks of bombing to force Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as the technology of air power advances, so does its
allure. The B-2 Stealth bomber, which is being used for the first
time in combat in Yugoslavia, may well be the most politically
irresistible weapon in American history. The Air Force says a
single B-2 can do what used to take 32 heavy bombers, 16 escort
fighters, four ground-fire suppression aircraft and 15 tanker
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   From an air force base in Missouri, B-2 pilots have been flying
off to Yugoslavia to drop precision-guided bombs through the
clouds. While the bombers stay well clear of enemy fire, their
bombs use satellite guidance to find programmed targets. At the end
of their missions, the B-2's return to Missouri and pilots go home
to their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a different realm now,'' said Air Force Col. Phillip
Meilinger, a professor of strategy at the Naval War College and an
expert on air doctrine. ``We can fight this type of war and we so
totally outclass the enemy. It is astonishing to be fighting for
eight weeks and suffer no casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The only Americans deaths have been two helicopter pilots killed
in Albania in a training accident. After more than 20,000 sorties,
just two planes have gone down in combat and no pilots have been
captured. The scorecard is much more impressive than in the Gulf
War, when 38 coalition aircraft were lost in five weeks of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The wondrous technology, however, has not delivered on America's
primary objective in Kosovo. As Clinton said on the day the bombing
began, the air strikes were supposed to ``protect thousands of
innocent people in Kosovo from a mounting military offensive'' by
Yugoslav army and police units.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the bombing coincided with a massive acceleration of
the Serb offensive. In an explosion of ethnic cleansing that a
former White House official said ``shocked'' the Clinton
administration, more than 750,000 Kosovo Albanians have been pushed
out of the province. Another 600,000 have been driven from their
homes and are living precariously inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In planning the air strikes last year, the White House assumed
that Milosevic would respond to bombing in Kosovo as he responded
in 1995 in Bosnia. Then, a few days of bombing pushed the Serb
leader into peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the analysts felt that Milosevic was unpredictable but
faced with hard resolve he would cut a deal very similar to the
deal he made in Bosnia,'' said Nick Dowling, who until December
worked on Balkan issues in the White House and is now a senior
fellow at the Institute for National Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The general who commanded NATO forces in 1995 argues that the
Clinton administration allowed itself to learn the wrong lesson
from Bosnia, in part because of the political appeal of high-tech
weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have been seduced a little bit by technology rather
than by good professional judgment of what is necessary to win a
war,'' said retired Gen. George Joulwan, who was Gen. Wesley
Clark's predecessor as supreme commander of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Joulwan said bombing was effective in Bosnia because, when it
began, there were 35,000 British and French troops on the ground,
spotting targets and firing artillery. The general said NATO also
was helped by 100,000 Croatian ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the Clinton administration's bombing strategy was not
designed to protect Kosovo Albanians or drive Serb forces out of
the province, said Dowling, the former White House official.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, it was an indirect strategy, based on the
assumption that Milosevic would surrender Kosovo rather than watch
as NATO bombs destroyed his military. As White House spokesman
Lockhart put it, ``We would continue to degrade what is most dear
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``Say Uncle'' strategy leaves it to Milosevic to decide
when he has had enough. Milosevic has responded in two ways. First,
he directed small, widely dispersed units of Serbian forces to
drive hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanians from their homes.
Second, he ordered those forces to lay mines, dig in and fortify
their positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good technology is not a substitute for good judgment,'' said
Sen. Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat who has been critical
of the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing several weeks ago for Democratic senators,
Torricelli recalled asking National Security advisor Sandy Berger,
``Have you ever met a Serb? Do you understand anything about
Serbian history? You think you are going to bomb these people for
two or three weeks and achieve a political result?''
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey senator said Berger had no answer beyond another
plea for more patience to allow air power to work.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration lost faith in the utility of ground
troops in 1993, after 18 soldiers were killed in a failed raid in
Mogadishu, said Ivo Daalder, who served in the White House in the
mid-1990s as a specialist on Bosnia and is now at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe that Somalia demonstrates conclusively that you
cannot have any casualties,'' said Daalder. ``They take this as a
matter of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   In running NATO's war in Bosnia, Joulwan said he constantly had
to fight Clinton's assumption that a majority of the American
public demanded a zero-casualty war. ``The problem with the White
House is that rather than say why did casualties occur, they just
said we can't take casualties anymore,'' Joulwan said.
</P>
<P>
   Polling data going back to the Korean War suggest the White
House is right to worry about the political costs of casualties,
especially if there are lots of them in an obscure, faraway place.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls on Kosovo show a softening of support for the
bombing campaign and an increased desire for negotiations with
Milosevic to end the war. Given this equivocation, Clinton should
be worried about risking ground troops, said Andrew Kohut, director
of the Pew Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lockhart, the White House spokesman, the findings
of the president's pollster ``are not radically different from what
you see in the public polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohut said that the president, in his equivocation on ground
forces, seems to have found a seat squarely in the middle of public
opinion. ``Clinton is in a quandary, but he has got 200 million
people there with him,'' Kohut said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was advising Clinton, I would be very leery that the
public will follow along in case of casualties,'' said Kohut.
``Without that support, you will have a real nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's quandary is doubly difficult for Vice President Al
Gore, who was one of the administration's most vocal hawks on
Bosnia but whose advisers say he dreads a presidential campaign
while American forces are bogged down in a Balkan quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has opposed the introduction of ground troops and delivered
the administration's strongest public statement opposing their use
in the first days after the aerial assault began.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's critics say the president has the rhetorical gifts to
rally public opinion behind a war in which American soldiers might
die.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, his eloquent speeches on Kosovo have made a
compelling case for the kind of sacrifice Americans made in World
War II, but the president seems unwilling to follow the logic of
his own soaring language.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been telling the story of an American Indian leader
who visited the White House earlier this month. The man said his
great-great-grandfather had been killed by the 7th Cavalry at
Wounded Knee and his two uncles had fought in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have only one son and he means more to me than anything,''
the president said the man told him. ``I would be proud for him to
go and fight against ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. We know what is
right now.''

AMY'S FRIENDS HELPS STRIPPERS ESCAPE THEIR PAST, COME BACK TO
CHURCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Amy Dupree suffered from low self-esteem. She
felt ostracized from the popular kids at her Texas high school.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, she turned to topless dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me feel beautiful and famous,'' said Dupree, 31, who
said she earned as much as $500 a night in tips dancing semi-nude
in bars around Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   After a time, though, Dupree said she felt even more worthless.
When she tried to escape the sex entertainment business, she turned
to an unusual source for help: the Preston Road Church of Christ in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of other women at the church, she has founded
Amy's Friends, a year-old organization that has helped more than a
dozen women leave topless dancing and other adult entertainment
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Strippers, topless dancers and nude models have been among those
who have called the Amy's Friends crisis line, (972) 520-3400.
Callers are invited to attend weekly support-group meetings at the
homes of church members.
</P>
<P>
   Women who ask for help can receive assistance with rent,
utilities and child care. They also are assisted in finding
different jobs. After three months, the progress of each woman is
evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Towell, a 61-year-old grandmother who spearheaded the
church's effort to begin Amy's Friends, said the project has
mushroomed. A second support group has been established in Euless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been kind of exciting and a little scary, too,'' Towell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Towell said women say they want to leave the business because
it's degrading. ``It's like a big party at first,'' she said, but
then ``it starts to wear on them.''
</P>
<P>
   During support-group meetings, women share their problems and
study Twelve Steps for Christians, a Bible-based program patterned
after the successful 12-step recovery program that originated with
Alcoholics Anonymous. One of the 12 steps of the program requires
members to ``make a searching and fearless moral inventory'' of
themselves. Then it demands that they admit they are powerless to
change. Finally, they humbly ask God to remove their shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Not all who attempt to change are successful.
</P>
<P>
   Dupree, who is married now and is a representative for a company
that supplies pagers to medical personal, said she could never have
left dancing without the church's help.
</P>
<P>
   ``They welcomed me with open arms,'' she said. ``I was so
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Dupree said that during her topless-dancing days, she also
became addicted to drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Although she gave up the drugs and alcohol after going through a
rehabilitation program, Dupree found it hard to leave topless
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried it,'' she said. ``I left for a while and worked at
office jobs, but didn't make much money. I got sick and became
financially strapped.''
</P>
<P>
   She says a friend suggested she go back to topless dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like riding a bicycle,'' she said. ``I went back to
dancing, and I set money quotas for myself. Also, I didn't drink or
do drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was very unhappy. After a year, she tried to get out but
found she was reluctant to give up the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I said, `OK, God, this is enough. If you will help me
get out of this, I will try to help others get out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her fiancee suggested she try going to church to support her
desire to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt either God could help us or no one could,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although apprehensive, they decided to attend the Preston Road
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked in, this little old lady came up to me and told
me, `You are so beautiful. I'm glad you are here,' '' Dupree said.
``She had no idea who I was. I've never felt such unconditional
love.''
</P>
<P>
   Dupree said the church experience was a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought dancing was my whole life,'' she said. ``But it
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   She began attending a class on changing relationships. Although
she was still dancing at the time, she says no one mentioned it at
the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did what Jesus would do,'' she said. ``They loved me
until I could love myself.''

YUGOSLAVIA WANTS TO WORK WITH U.N. IN ENDING WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Yugoslavia insisted Friday that it must
play a central role in negotiations within the United Nations to
end the war and bring a political settlement to Kosovo, and that
Belgrade would not simply let NATO dictate a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read my lips,'' the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nebojsa
Vujovic, said in English. ``It's not about NATO. It's about the
U.N.''
</P>
<P>
   Vujovic, who is an assistant foreign minister, said Yugoslavia
was eager for a political agreement that would grant Kosovo ``wide
autonomy and self-government, based on the principle of equal
status for all communities,'' including the province's minority
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said Belgrade must play a role in carrying out a
settlement, which he said must respect the sovereignty of both
Yugoslavia and Serbia over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Vujovic praised the efforts of the Russian special envoy, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, who in difficult talks with Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott has been trying to find a balance between Belgrade's
demands and those of the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Among Chernomyrdin's great virtues, Vujovic said, is his effort
to ``reaffirm the vital state interests of Yugoslavia in bringing
this crisis to an end,'' including respect for its ``sovereignty
and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the difficulties in those talks, Yugoslav and U.S.
officials say, are Belgrade's desire to be an active negotiating
partner and its desire to keep more than a symbolic number of
troops and policemen inside Kosovo, along its borders with
Macedonia and Albania, and on guard at Serbian holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Yugoslav officials have said President Slobodan Milosevic
is ready for a settlement in Kosovo and will meet most of NATO's
requirements, including the presence of some NATO troops in any
U.N. force. But the officials emphasize that he needs to be seen as
a serious negotiator from a sovereign country rather than as a
vanquished foe capitulating to NATO demands.
</P>
<P>
   Vujovic insisted Friday, for example, that while Belgrade was
ready to accept a U.N. mission in Kosovo as part of a settlement, a
decision on who participates in that mission, and ``its mandate,
modalities and volume,'' should be negotiated in ``direct
dialogue'' between U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the
Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a political solution that can fly and can be
operable,'' he said. ``It's about a global solution to be discussed
within the U.N. Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO went to war in Yugoslavia without a U.N. Security Council
resolution, insisting instead that the war was legally founded in
the right of ``humanitarian intervention.'' But NATO officials also
knew that they could not get such a Security Council resolution
authorizing this war, because Russia and China said they would veto
one. So the Germans, French and Italians, which were unhappy about
the lack of U.N. authorization, went along.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade has said that it is fighting to preserve international
law and the postwar order as well as its sovereignty, and has
demanded that any political solution be cast in a U.N. Security
Council resolution and that any international force put into Kosovo
be under a U.N. flag.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the Group of Eight industrialized countries, which
include Russia, did issue a joint statement calling for a Security
Council resolution. But NATO is also reluctant to get into any
direct negotiations with Milosevic, instead using the Russians as a
go-between. Fearing that even Moscow is too close to Belgrade, NATO
has now deputized the Finnish president, Martti Ahtisaari, to act
on its behalf alongside Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin spent nearly seven hours in talks with Milosevic
this week, and then flew back to Moscow for further talks with
Talbott and Ahtisaari, which were inclusive. But Talbott said they
were making progress and would continue next week in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not clear whether Chernomyrdin will return here for
more talks with Milosevic on Monday or Tuesday, as both men
originally announced.
</P>
<P>
   Vujovic on Friday emphasized the positive, saying: ``We are open
to a peaceful solution, open to diplomatic negotiations. We are
open to playing a constructive role in reaching a political
solution on Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But NATO wants nearly all Serb forces to be withdrawn from
Kosovo, and Belgrade's authority to be supplanted in Kosovo by an
international authority until new elections can be organized. So
there is much left to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, senior Yugoslav officials say they believe a settlement
now is inevitable unless NATO countries _ Britain in particular _
balk and harden the alliance's demands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vujovic also repeated Belgrade's demands for a bombing halt and
a withdrawal of NATO forces from Yugoslavia's borders as a
precondition for any political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, NATO airstrikes hit a fuel depot in Belgrade,
shattering the windows of the Swiss ambassador's residence as he
was hosting a National Day reception.
</P>
<P>
   Among the guests was the Swedish ambassador, whose own residence
had its doors and windows blown out the previous night when an
errant bomb hit a hospital, killing three patients and a security
guard. The residences of the Norwegian, Spanish, Indian and
Hungarian ambassadors were also damaged, as was the Libyan embassy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, Swedish
Ambassador Mats Staffansson said: ``We had just come to dessert
when a crash came. Four cruise missiles came down on a fuel depot
only 300 yards from the Swiss residence. An enormous pressure-wave
broke a very large picture window in the dining room. I, the Slovak
ambassador and the Vatican ambassador threw ourselves under the
dining-room table to get out of the way of the flying glass.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bern, Switzerland, the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland,
Madeleine Kunin, apologized. Switzerland represents U.S. interests
in Belgrade. The German and Canadian governments both urged NATO to
use more care to avoid civilian targets.

   Now You See a Pension. Now Maybe You Don't. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 96 percent cut in a pension check would meet almost anyone's
definition of a retirement nightmare. So Hope Walden, who spent 28
years with Pan American World Airways as a flight attendant and
manager, was predictably unhappy to be told recently that it might
come true.
</P>
<P>
   To compound the insult, the news came from the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp., the federal agency that is supposed to be
protecting private pensions.
</P>
<P>
   This month, eight years after the collapse of Pan Am, the agency
said it had finally issued most of the 45,000 letters telling the
airline's former workers how much their pensions would be. But some
workers say their notices were not only late, but also wildly
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   The agency told Mrs. Walden, who lives in Cliffside Park, N.J.,
that the $1,265 she has been receiving monthly since she retired in
1991 would be cut in August by 75 percent, to $316, and cut again,
when she turns 65 in a few years and draws Social Security, to just
$44.18.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Welles, a spokeswoman for the agency, said poor records
and mistakes by managers of failed pension plans make it difficult
to determine benefits accurately for such pension plans, which were
taken over because they could not pay all the benefits owed.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Walden's lawyer, Harvey M. Katz of Berlack, Israels &AMP;
Liberman in New York, says that even if the pension agency
calculated correctly (he argues that it was far off the mark), the
delays in sending the letters are harmful. ``If you retire on one
amount, how are you supposed to adjust years later to getting just
a quarter of that?'' he asked.

   With a big ``if,'' consumers would rather buy from a company
that is involved in a social or charitable cause, a survey of 2,000
adults suggests. Roper Starch Worldwide in New York did the study
for Cone Inc. in Boston, which does so-called cause marketing,
linking companies to good works.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-six percent of the respondents said they would switch to
products of a company connected with a cause _ like Ford Motor,
which sponsors breast-cancer research, or Home Depot, which helps
with affordable housing _ if the price and quality were equal to
those of rivals.
</P>
<P>
   It may take another study to show how good works rank when a
higher price is also involved, but 61 percent of respondents
thought that involvement in some socially useful activity should be
standard business practice.

WHERE STRATEGY MEANS KEEPING UP WITH THE KIDS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Texas, Calif., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE LEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Cabell Jr. likes to tag along when his daughter, Elizabeth,
14, heads to the mall. That is because Cabell, as co-manager of the
$930 million USAA Aggressive Growth fund, is hungry for insight
into what the under-21 crowd is buying.
</P>
<P>
   Between 3 percent and 4 percent of the fund's portfolio is
invested in companies that focus on Generation Y _ which by its
broadest definition encompasses 60 million Americans ages 4 to 21.
</P>
<P>
   It is an attractive group: Teenage Research Unlimited of
Northbrook, Ill., estimates that the 31 million Americans between
12 and 19 spent $141 billion last year, up from $122 billion in
1997. And the teen-age population is expected to peak at 35 million
in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   But because teen-agers are fickle, Gen Y companies can falter
quickly, and investors can be left reeling. ``This is such a niche
and it's so volatile that it makes Internet companies look like
IBM,'' said Cabell, who is 45. Wall Street is the follower here, he
added, and ``it's the kids who are setting the trends.''
</P>
<P>
   A one-time Wall Street darling, the retailer Gadzooks Inc. of
Carrollton, Texas, is a case in point. Its stock price fell more
than 80 percent from a 52-week high of $29.25 last June, as
teen-agers shunned the private-label clothes it was introducing.
The shares have only begun to recover, and are now trading at
$9.625.
</P>
<P>
   Two other fashion victims were Pacific Sunwear Ltd., a
beach-oriented company in Anaheim, Calif., and Hot Topic Inc. of
Pomona, Calif., which cultivates a bad-boy image. Their stocks fell
55.3 percent and 61.5 percent, respectively, in the fourth quarter
amid disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the culprit in both cases was teen-agers' changing
tastes: Young buyers were cool to Sunwear's wide-leg jeans and Hot
Topic's gift offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen public companies _ most of them retailers _ focus
on Gen Y. Others, notably Skechers USA, a shoe retailer with a
streetwise urban look, and Limited Too, a subsidiary of The
Limited, are expected to go public this summer. Gen Y retailers
tend to operate in malls, sell products over the Internet and
market to both boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Gen Y companies don't make fashion missteps, they can
experience the volatility characteristic of Internet marketers.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of Delia's of New York, a catalogue clothing retailer
that controls 95 percent of Iturf, an on-line sibling, climbed
nearly tenfold between October and April in anticipation of Iturf's
initial offering, hitting a high of $40. But since then, Delia's
has tumbled more than 50 percent. (Iturf closed at $66 on its first
day of trading on April 9, up from the initial price of $22. It now
trades at $25.50.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``there's significant money to be made from this
demographic segment,'' said Joe Grillo, an analyst at BT Alex Brown
in San Francisco. The trick for investors is to figure out which
Gen Y companies have management that understands fashion and reacts
quickly to change.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Sunwear was able to turn around quickly, offering a
Hawaiian look that has become popular. The stock now trades at
$38.625, well above its low in December of $12.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very nimble, very flexible company,'' said Janet
Kloppenburg, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens, who
says the stock could hit $46 in 12 months. She also says Hot Topic
has already put its line of gift products in order; traditional
retailers might have taken eight months to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed on Friday at $25.0625, more than double its
52-week low of $9.875. She says it could hit $33 in 12 months.

 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What makes for successful stock-picking? Simple
number-crunching, or the evaluation of more qualitative matters,
like management talent?
</P>
<P>
   Joseph E. Stocke, portfolio manager of the $100.1 million
Evergreen Select Special Equity fund, says he has one foot in each
camp. He starts with a numbers-driven computer model, then uses
more traditional, ``kick the tires'' qualitative analysis to
whittle down his list, which mostly includes small- capitalization
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quantitative approach is very disciplined and the
qualitative is like an art form, so we think it's a very balanced
process,'' he said from his office in Malvern, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Stocke (pronounced STAHK-ee) says the balanced approach has
helped the fund as small-capitalization stocks have sputtered.
Evergreen Select returned 20.1 percent, annualized, for the three
years ending May 14, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago
financial publisher, versus an average of 8.5 for its category of
small blend funds, which own stocks with both value and growth
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Stocke, who bench-presses 165 pounds when he is not picking
stocks, joined Meridian Bank of Reading, Pa., in 1983, and
eventually began managing an institutional fund that was the
predecessor to Evergreen Select. Meridian was bought in 1996 by
Corestates Financial, which in turn was bought in 1998 by the First
Union Corp., owner of the Evergreen Funds.
</P>
<P>
   His starting point is the roughly 5,000 publicly traded American
companies with market capitalizations of less than $2 billion. Then
Stocke, 39, skims off 10 percent of them, using a computer model
that combines elements of growth, value and even momentum
investing. The model seeks out stocks with high earnings growth
rates, low price-to-earnings ratios, high dividend yields, upward
changes in analyst earnings estimates, heavy insider buying and
positive price momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The computer finds those that are reasonably appealing by all
six measures, or those that are very attractive on at least two of
them, ending up with 450 to 500 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Stocke and the six analysts who work on the fund then divide the
list among themselves, by industry. (He takes consumer cyclicals
and health care stocks.)
</P>
<P>
   They review each company, looking at its management, new
products, industry position, research and development and
sensitivity to economic trends. For example, Stocke's team wants
management that owns company stock or whose pay is tied to
performance, and that has a track record in various market and
economic environments. ``We look at anything that would add
value,'' Stocke said.
</P>
<P>
   That allows him to make the final cut, to the 100 or so stocks
that he holds in the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he added to the fund's position in Electronics
Boutique Holdings, a retailer of computer games that he bought for
$14 a share last July, at its initial offering.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in West Chester, Pa., has 528 outlets, mostly
on the East Coast, and plans to open stores in the rest of the
country, he said. It began selling games over the Internet last
month and could profit from demand for computer games tied to the
``Star Wars: Episode I _ the Phantom Menace,'' which opened on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates the company's five-year earnings growth rate at 20
percent. The stock, which now trades at $16, sells for less than 11
times his earnings estimate of $1.50 to $1.55 a share for next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Stocke recently added to his stake in Williams-Sonoma, the
kitchenware marketer that also sells furniture and tableware under
the Pottery Barn name. The company should benefit from strong sales
of new and existing homes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Sonoma shares are selling for less than 20 times his
2000 earnings estimate of $1.50 a share. He attributed that ratio
to the company's increased spending over the last few quarters to
upgrade distribution and computer systems, which hurt earnings and
dampened the share price.
</P>
<P>
   But Stocke expects annual earnings growth of more than 25
percent over the next three years. He bought shares last fall at
$22; they closed on Friday at $31.875. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is Gildan Activewear, a Montreal manufacturer
of inexpensive T-shirts and other sportswear. The company has begun
making golf shirts to benefit from the trend toward more casual
wear in offices, Stocke said. ``It's a family-owned business, and
the owners put their heart and soul into the business,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He expects earnings to grow 20 percent annually over the next
five years. The fund began buying the stock at $7 in June 1998; it
closed on Friday at $16.0625, eight times his earnings estimate of
$2 a share for next year.

UNIVERSAL READY TO OPEN A NEW FLORIDA THEME PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also ISLANDS-SEUSS)  (lh) 
 By BILL DEAN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Where can you plummet 400 feet in a Spider-Man
cartoon, pet a triceratops getting a veterinary exam, and snack on
green-eggs-and-ham sandwiches?
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds like something out of this world, then the creators
of Orlando's newest theme park couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   Islands of Adventure is the name, and one-of-a-kind thrills is
the game at this new 110-acre wonderland. Cutting-edge technology
combines with beloved characters like the Cat in the Hat to
entrance visitors as they haven't been before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really amazed,'' said Jack Reape, 37, of New Orleans,
who visits different theme parks each year with his wife and three
young children. ``The things here are really new and different.
It's very impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Officially opening May 28 as Universal Studios' second theme
park in Florida, Islands of Adventure divides the fun into five
islands with separate themes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Seuss Landing, where the world of Dr. Seuss comes to life in
the first theme park attraction to feature characters and rides
based on children's books by Dr. Seuss.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Lost Continent, which envelops guests in a mythological
fantasy world, including the Dueling Dragons _ the world's first
inverted, dueling roller coasters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jurassic Park lures visitors through its gates to such
attractions as the Jurassic Park River Adventure, a river-raft
style ride that glides past peaceful dinosaurs before ending in an
85-foot plunge past a tyrannosaurus rex.
</P>
<P>
   _ Toon Lagoon, where cartoon favorites such as Bullwinkle,
Popeye and Dudley Do-Right come to life through such adventures as
a log-flume and white-water raft rife.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marvel Super Hero Island, which contains the park's most
amazing and technologically advanced attractions, the Amazing
Adventures of Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk Coaster.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for Islands of Adventure was already under way in 1990
when Universal Studios opened doors to its first Orlando park,
Universal Studios Florida. Construction, estimated at $2.5 billion,
took five years.
</P>
<P>
   Islands of Adventure will help Universal's Florida attraction
compete with Disney World and become a total, multi-day vacation
destination instead of just a one-day park. To that end, Universal
Studios has also added the CityWalk entertainment complex, which
opened in February. On-site theme hotels are on their way: the
Portofino Bay Hotel opens this summer, and four more are to follow
by the end of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the entire complex, which is now called Universal
Studios Escape, Islands of Adventure was designed to complement the
original Universal Studios and to provide guests with thrills they
can't find anywhere else with technology never before used in
theme-park situations.
</P>
<P>
   Colorful characters _ such as the mirthful creatures of Dr.
Seuss' imagination as well as heroes from comic books and the funny
pages _ served as springboards for ideas of what to do with them in
a park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cat in the Hat ride was a natural,'' said Lisa Girolami,
show producer of Seuss Landing. ``The idea was to simply take
guests for a ride through the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Islands of Adventure includes many standard theme-park
attractions, such as log-flumes, free-fall rides and carousels, but
it also adds ground-breaking enhancements to typical park rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started with what was state of the art at the time, and
then we looked at ways to make it better,'' said Mark Woodbury,
vice president of design and creative development for Universal
Studios' Islands of Adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The Incredible Hulk Coaster uses 240 50-horsepower motors to
shoot coaster fans 110 feet in the air _ and from zero to 42 mph in
2 seconds. ``None of those things have ever been attempted before
in a roller coaster,'' Woodbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Poseidon's Fury in the Lost Continent has guests walking through
a tunnel of 17,000 spinning gallons of water before arriving at a
battle between Poseidon, the Greek god of water, and Zeus, the god
of fire. ``It's a pretty stunning piece of work,'' Woodbury said.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive of all, however, appears to be the Amazing
Adventures of Spider-Man, which is equal parts moving-car ride, 3-D
special effects show and simulator attraction all in one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why Spider-Man is so unique is because it combines
a whole bunch of technologies in a different way, and it also
created new technologies to make the experience happen the way it
does or make it as compelling as it is,'' Woodbury said. ``This
includes three-sided rear-projection scenes to a moving audience,
which is pretty significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started that, people said it couldn't be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Guests sampling Spider-Man and other attractions during Islands
of Adventure sneak-previews were glad they did however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it,'' said Katie Everrett, a 13-year-old eighth-grade
student from Jacksonville. ``It wasn't really scary. But it was so
exciting and everything was happening all at once, so it was
really, really good.''
</P>
<P>
   The park's roller coasters, however, are what captivated
32-year-old Ginny LaRose, from Exeter, N.H. ``I liked the Dueling
Dragons and the Hulk, but I would say the Hulk is the best, because
it's totally different,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still other guests preferred the life-size, plant-munching
dinosaurs of the Jurassic Park River Adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jurassic Park is really great,'' said Jacksonville's Cheryl
Searcy, after riding the attraction with her 17-year-old son,
Daniel. ``The scenery was really impressive. And the moving
dinosaurs were state of the art.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a fantasy world,'' adds Daniel. ``It's awesome.''

KILLING IN ITALY STIRS FEARS OF A REVIVAL OF TERRORIST TIMES PAST
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Italians scoured their newspapers Friday with a sickening
sense of deja-vu: blaring headlines about the assassination of a
government official, blurry photographs of the widow leaving the
police station, and a five-pointed star that terrified Italy for
two decades, the emblem of the Red Brigades.
</P>
<P>
   The carefully planned shooting on Thursday of Massimo D'Antona,
51, a labor adviser to the current government, sent a shock
throughout the country, mostly because it was so eerily familiar.
</P>
<P>
   A 28-page statement released by the group claiming
responsibility for the killing was signed ``the Red Brigades,'' the
same name used by the ultraleft-wing organization that was
responsible for dozens of terrorist attacks in the 1970s and early
'80s, including the kidnapping and killing of former Prime Minister
Aldo Moro.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread anxiety about the killing, few Italians seem
convinced that it signaled a revival of the reign of terrorism that
paralyzed Italy 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Italian society is no longer dangerously
polarized, as it was in the late 1960s when the Christian Democrats
held a lock on power and Marxist ideology flowed freely in
universities, offices and even some Roman Catholic churches. Now a
former Communist heads the government, and there is fair, if
unfriendly, competition between left and right.
</P>
<P>
   But the very fact that society has changed so much has made the
assassination of D'Antona all the more puzzling and frightening.
</P>
<P>
   Italian investigators have said it is unlikely that these new
self-styled Red Brigade terrorists are the same who founded the
original movement. The leaders who kidnapped Moro in 1978 are now
in their 40s and 50s, and most have served out their sentences or
are enrolled in work-release programs, though investigators concede
that some lesser-known members could still be at large. The two
gunmen were described by witnesses as in their mid-20s.
</P>
<P>
   The motive for the killing of D'Antona, who took part in the
government's efforts to reform labor laws, was scattered across the
statement of responsibility. It railed against D'Antona as an agent
of ``a neocorporate policy'' sought by ``the imperialist
bourgeoisie,'' and against the Italian government for supporting
NATO and what it called American war-mongering.
</P>
<P>
   D'Antona was chosen as a symbol, but the war in Kosovo seems to
have at least provided a pretext. Since the bombing campaign
against Yugoslavia began in March, D'Alema's political party,
Democrats of the Left, has reported at least 33 attacks on its
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Friday security was tightened at all potential targets, and
police investigators were interrogating anarchists, squatters,
fringe political activists, autonomous union organizers and former
Red Brigade members. They were also reopening years-old cases of
letter bombs and anonymous threats.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no arrests, but some politicians were already
tracing the killing to Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Others were haunted by
the rebirth of an all too familiar extremism.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the cycle of armed violence was absolutely over,
without any chance of reopening,'' said Adriana Faranda, a former
Red Brigades member who served 14 years in prison for her role in
the Moro assassination. ``I cannot understand how there could still
be people who hope to foment a revolutionary process in Italy.''

ANNE PARKER WIGGLESWORTH, 78; PAINTER IN COMBINED TRADITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anne Parker Wigglesworth, an artist whose paintings combined
elements of American and French art traditions, died of cancer May
1 in her home in New York City. She was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wigglesworth lived in the heart of Greenwich Village, where
she was a fixture of the art scene for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to a review of her solo show in the Boston Athenaeum
Gallery, published in the Globe on Nov. 6, 1975, her work combined
two traditions, ``One American, the luminism of open skies and
seas, the other French, a Cezanne-like impressionism stressing the
balance of picture surface unity and complex sensations of deep
space.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wigglesworth was born in Atlanta. She attended Antioch
College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, for a year before answering what
her son called ``the siren call of New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   As she struggled to establish her career, she made jewelry, was
a hostess at Schraft's and modeled for art classes to finance her
work. She studied with the Soyer Brothers, Raphael and Moses. She
married composer Frank Wigglesworth in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband won the Prix de Rome, the couple lived in
Italy for three years and traveled widely with painter George
Biddle, author William Styron and sculptor Robert White.
</P>
<P>
   They lived briefly on Long Island before settling in Greenwich
Village, where their house on Downing Street became an art salon
frequented by composers Virgil Thomson and Henry Cowell, sculptor
Sidney Simon, the Soyer Brothers and other artists.
</P>
<P>
   She painted the portrait of Bishop H.W.B. Donegan and other
members of the Episcopal clergy in New York. Her portrait of Bishop
Donegan now hangs in the St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's School in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   She and her family spent many summers in Ipswich, Mass., where
she enjoyed painting the play of the light on local marshes.
</P>
<P>
   A MacDowell Colony fellow, she had many solo shows in New York
City and her work is held in many public and private collections.
</P>
<P>
   She leaves a daughter, Philio Wigglesworth Cushing of Ipswich; a
son, Henry Cowell Coolidge Wigglesworth of Seattle, Wash.; and a
sister, Mary Betty Herrera of Ocklawaha, Fla.

   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia _ The Lakhta is a rusting hulk that usually
hauls scrap metal to Japan, but since February it has sat idle here
in the largest port in the Russian Far East, its superstructure
painted in Russian and English: ``WE ARE ON STRIKE. WE WANT OUR
MONEY!''
</P>
<P>
   So when the Global Mariner sailed into Vladivostok's Golden Horn
Bay recently, its crew pitched in $720 for the sailors on the
Lakhta. The Global Mariner is a 13,000-ton freighter owned by the
International Transport Workers' Federation, a union of sailors,
truckers, longshoremen and others. Outfitted as a form of sea-going
protest, the British ship is undertaking a round-the-world voyage
to fight the registration of ships under ``flags of convenience'' _
countries other than the place of ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Flying the flag of countries like Belize or Liberia allows them
to avoid heavy taxes and hire crews from low-wage countries,
cutting the cost of transportation. But the union says such vessels
have poor safety records, frequently do not pay employees, and
sometimes abandon sailors in distant ports when aging ships get too
expensive to run. The Lakhta, the union said, represents everything
it is fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Once owned by Far Eastern Shipping Co., the largest
transportation fleet in the Russian Pacific, the ship was sold and
reflagged in Belize. The sailors are a year behind in their wages,
and the owners no longer provide food or water and once even tried
to evict the crew at gunpoint. The ship is caked in rust, and even
its basic seaworthiness is in question. The hatch covers over the
cargo holds do not fully close, a problem that could swamp the ship
in high seas, said Ulrich Juergens, the Global Mariner's captain
and a union inspector, after touring the Lakhta.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have open hatch covers, it is basically a death
sentence,'' Juergens said. ``This is one of the worst cases I have
ever seen. What we're seeing here is inhumane. It shows less than
no respect for the lives of the seafarers.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the world's 85,500 self-propelled cargo vessels of 100 gross
tons or greater, some 16,000 are registered in the 27 countries
that the union lists as flags of convenience. The practice of
registering abroad began in earnest with Prohibition, when
rumrunners hauled their cargoes under the Panamanian flag. But the
practice has grown in recent years as shipping companies try to
save money. In the eight years since the fall of communism, 10
percent of Russia's fleet has been reflagged abroad to avoid the
country's onerous taxes.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Costly regulations and high-wage workers in North America, Japan
and Northern Europe often make it profitable for shipping companies
to reflag. For example, the United States levies a 50 percent duty
on any repairs to American-flagged ships in overseas ports, said
Rod Vulovic, vice president of Sea-Land Service Inc., a Charlotte,
N.C., unit of CSX Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight of Sea-Land's 63 ships are flagged overseas, saving
up to $3.5 million a vessel each year, Vulovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Vulovic rejects the union's charges that ship owners are
cavalier toward workers and safety when their vessels sail under
foreign flags. ``You can have companies such as Mobil Oil that do a
good job and are responsible citizens of the world,'' he said,
``and they're put in the same bag as those who don't pay mariners
and abandon ships.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say foreign registries effectively allow countries
to pick and choose which regulations to follow. Flag-of-convenience
countries, taken as a whole, have a worse safety record than
registries of ships based within a country, said Paul Lane,
director of the Seafarers' Research Center of the University of
Cardiff. Even more troubling, he said, is that sailors at sea are
subject to the laws of the nations under which they are flagged,
and maritime ministries do not effectively monitor working
conditions. How well can states like Liberia or Cambodia, torn by
civil strife for decades, oversee their national ships?
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   The International Transport Workers' Federation has fought
reflagging since 1948. And last year, on the 50th anniversary of
its campaign, it took its show on the road. The union bought an old
freighter for $3 million (it hopes to recoup this cost by selling
the ship when its voyage ends early next year). The union spent an
added $1.8 million refurbishing the ship as a floating museum.
Workers decorated the Global Mariner's enormous holds with flags
from ``convenience'' countries.
</P>
<P>
   They covered the bare steel walls with billboard-sized pictures
depicting what it says are the legacies of such fleets: abandoned
or unpaid sailors, increased shipwrecks, maimed seamen,
cockroach-covered food in a ship's galley (``A seafarers menu,''
the caption states). In one hold, a film shows real footage from
shipwrecks on flag-of-convenience vessels. Sirens blare as rescuers
pull passengers' corpses from the sea. A man grabs a child by the
hair and hauls him into the boat like a drowned seal pup.
</P>
<P>
   The Global Mariner set out last summer on an 18-month voyage to
take its message to the world. Its campaign will cost an estimated
$9 million, money that comes from fees that shipping companies pay
for union members, Juergens said.
</P>
<P>
   The show has drawn crowds in ports ranging from Reykjavik,
Iceland, to Vladivostok, with more than 300,000 visitors coming on
board so far. In Vladivostok alone, 14,983 people came aboard
during a four-day stay. (The Global Mariner belly-flopped, however,
in New York in October: Only 100 visitors came aboard.)
</P>
<P>
   The images of sailors sharing food with cockroaches can be
particularly poignant in a port city like Vladivostok, where
thousands of unpaid sailors work and scores of families have
relatives who are stranded on vessels abroad. Maxim Pechevisty and
Konstantin Strokin, both 21, are students at the Marine Academy,
and they went through the Global Mariner's display twice,
transfixed by the grim images of life at sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows the real conditions aboard the ships under flags of
convenience,'' Pechevisty said. ``We have come across such problems
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Several crew members have sailed on Greenpeace vessels in the
past, and the Global Mariner has employed similar tactics. The ship
uses a high-powered projector to beam slogans onto ships run by
owners it criticizes. In Louisiana the crew hung a 20-by-40-foot
banner criticizing the United States Navy because of a union
dispute at a shipyard in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   But while shaming the Navy may cheer union members on the
Mississippi delta, Russia, with its crippled economy and fathomless
corruption, is not so easily moved by the appearance of a union
ship armed with a high-beam projector.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Lakhta, the crew has not been able to figure
out just who owes them the wages. After it docked in February, the
seafarers tried to sue Dellner Shipping Co. of Vladivostok, which
chartered the Lakhta from the Seattle-based Caribbean Maritime, for
$82,423 in back wages.
</P>
<P>
   Dellner, which took over the vessel in December, says it has
paid its share _ 40 days' worth _ and the previous charter operator
owes the rest.
</P>
<P>
   When the dispute went to court, a judge threw out the sailors'
case. On March 16, the court, at Dellner's request, sent a bailiff
accompanied by 13 gunmen in black masks marching on board. Snipers
scaled the masts, and the gunmen threatened the crew with
Kalashnikov rifles, said a cook, Marina Popova, 36, and other crew
members who were there. A Lakhta sailor managed to throw a matchbox
onto the ship next door with a note begging for help.
</P>
<P>
   After a lawyer and a television crew showed up, the gunmen left.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   The union's Vladivostok inspector is representing the crew, and
the Global Mariner donated boxes of food and invited the Lakhta
seafarers over for dinner. (Ms. Popova declined the invitation; she
was ashamed that the Lakhta was too poor to return the hospitality
for the foreign seafarers.) When Russian border guards refused the
foreigners access to the boat, the Global Mariner crew hopped a
fence to check on their comrades.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of the Lakhta was hoping the arrival of the Global
Mariner would change their situation by drawing attention to their
plight. But then the British ship sailed from port on May 3, and
the Lakhta crew watched it go from their mooring in front of a heap
of scrap metal on the dock in the commercial seaport.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Juergens, the Global Mariner's captain, said he expected the
Lakhta to eventually sink at its anchorage. But Mikhail
Plyushchakov, Dellner's general director, remained optimistic that
the Lakhta would again ply the Sea of Japan under the flag of
Belize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get a new crew on board,'' he said. ``We'll fix all the
problems port inspectors tell us to fix. And we will sail again.''

BELGRADE STRUGGLES TO SOCIALIZE AMID THE BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ At the National Theater, the old adage that the show
must go on is taken very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   And so it has, despite almost daily bombing of the Yugoslav
capital by NATO warplanes. What began as an expression of artistic
freedom has become one of quiet yet determined defiance and
national pride, as both the performers and their audiences refuse
to give up the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the daily briefings of government ministers, who use
bellicose rhetoric to denounce NATO and extol the virtues of the
Yugoslav nation, the defiance shown at the National Theater is more
subtle and free of overt nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   The theater has continued to put on plays, operas, and ballets
written by those who hail from NATO countries. Shakespeare's ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream'' was Friday's main show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about politics,'' says Nebojsa Bradic, the
theater's general director. ``This about being true to our
profession and to our audiences. We will not be bombed off the
stage. The audience gives us strength. We give them some kind of
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater has made adjustments, however, the main one being
that all shows are now matinees that finish before nightfall _ when
the bombs begin to fall. When NATO began its operation March 24,
officials canceled the entire schedule. But within days, Bradic and
his staff realized they desperately wanted to keep performing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We resumed our performances on March 27, a very symbolic day,
because it is World Theater Day,'' Bradic said, sitting in his
office overlooking Freedom Square. ``We put on Rossini's
`Cinderella' at noon, and the people came.''
</P>
<P>
   They have kept coming, day in and day out.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the early performances were interrupted by air raid
sirens. There are two bomb shelters in the theater, including its
second stage, which is normally used for the plays of contemporary
writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three times we did that, went into the shelter. But now
the audience won't leave the house. It has been a joint decision by
the artists and the audience to see through the performance, even
if we hear the air raid sirens,'' said Bradic.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia has seen its gross domestic product shrink by
two-thirds in the last 10 years, and the war has only increased the
financial hardship of the nation's 10 million people. Belgrade's 2
million people have been hit especially hard.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bombing began, the National Theater has slashed its
ticket prices by at least half, sometimes by much more. A ticket to
Friday's late afternoon matinee, a play about the life of Nicola
Tesla, a Serbian inventor who emigrated to the United States, cost
less than $2.
</P>
<P>
   Vojislav Vasilevic, a doctor, took in the Tesla play, and has
been to several other performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so little now, it is very important to have the
theater,'' he said. ``It is good to do something normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Belgrade's smaller theaters are offering free shows, and
movie houses offer cut-rate admissions. Vasilevic said the
professional standards of the National Theater remain high, and he
gladly parted with 20 dinars for Friday's play.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, the only thing to look forward to is the bombing,''
he said glumly.
</P>
<P>
   The actors, singers, and dancers are as enthusiastic as the
audiences. Among those performing daily is Natasa Ninkovic, one of
Belgrade's most prominent young actresses. Last year, Ninkovic
played opposite Dennis Quaid in the Oliver Stone-produced film
``Savior,'' about the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, still a bit breathless after playing Helena in ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream,'' Ninkovic stood backstage and
acknowledged that given her Hollywood contacts, she didn't have to
be in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounds terrible but I have papers, I could go anywhere in
the world,'' she said. ``But this is where I want to be. I feel
like I am helping people here. If my performing makes the day a
little more enjoyable for some ordinary person, then I cannot ask
for anything more.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ninkovic's initial response was that of an artist, she
acknowledges that as the bombing has dragged on her performances
have become an expression of her patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is to show my resistance to NATO, to the crime that
happens every day they bomb civilian targets,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ninkovic said that the NATO bombing has not diminished
her appreciation of western European and American culture. She
would like to do more films and will soon star in the National
Theater's production of ``Popcorn,'' by the contemporary British
playwright, Ben Elton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Ben Elton,'' she said, dreamily.
</P>
<P>
   Bradic said he has purposely chosen to stage mostly comedies and
fantasies. ``In days like these, people need to laugh, to escape,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that there are no plans to stage anything blatantly
nationalistic, and added that the only overtly political statement
made in the theater coincided with the 50th performance since the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said that we were devoting our 50th performance to NATO
because it was their 50th anniversary,'' said Bradic. ``It was done
more in humor than anything else.''
</P>

HILLARY CLINTON CAN LOOK TO WOMEN IN NEW YORK TO BOOST SENATE BID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 23)   (EDs: ONE-GRAF INSERT after 17th graf beginning The Quinnipiac
College Poll ...)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, accelerating
preparations for a likely Senate race in New York in 2000, is
counting on broad support from women voters to help her win the
seat held by retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is showcasing ties with prominent women in New York on
Monday during her ninth visit to the state since Jan. 1 as she lays
the groundwork for what is widely expected to be her announcement
in mid-June that she is forming an exploratory committee to raise
funds for her Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to reach a final decision during a Memorial
Day vacation with President Clinton and the couple's daughter
Chelsea at White Oak Plantation in Yulee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of an exploratory committee would enable the first
lady to raise funds to finance her campaign through private
contributions. Republicans have criticized her for traveling to New
York on Air Force planes at taxpayers' expense.
</P>
<P>
   One former senior White House adviser who remains close to
Clinton said she is ``nudging toward running. She's much closer
than I ever thought possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans two additional trips to the state in early June
and a politically-valuable trip to Israel later in the month.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is expected to seek the
Republican nomination for the Senate seat. New York Gov. George
Pataki has scheduled an announcement on Monday about his own
political future, sparking speculation that he also might seek the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   During her visit Monday, Clinton is expected to raise more than
$1 million at two fund raising events. She will appear at a $1,000
per person fund raiser for Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., the veteran
six-term House member who has vowed to seek the same Senate seat if
Clinton declines to run.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also will appear at an exclusive $10,000 per person
fundraiser at a private residence in Manhattan. The $500,000
expected to be raised there will go to the Democratic Senate
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also plans to take part in a book party honoring Matilda
Cuomo and her new book, ``The Person Who Changed My Life.'' Cuomo,
wife of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, asked Clinton to write
the forward for the book.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also is taking part in an awards gala at Lincoln
Center where the Americans for the Arts will honor her and two
prominent patrons of the arts _ Brooke Astor and Agnes Gund.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's multiple appearances with prominent women in New York
underscores her ongoing effort to highlight her commitment to
issues of concern to women voters, including child care for working
women, the role of women in society and strengthening public
education.
</P>
<P>
   William Schneider, a public opinion specialist at the American
Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., says Clinton is already
reaping a windfall from women voters in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who are Democrats and independents really have a reason
to vote for her,'' says Schneider. ``They want to make a statement
about how she has been wronged and support her effort to strike out
on her own.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider added: ``Supporting her sticks a thumb in the eye of
the Republican Congress, as if they're saying, `Take that, you
middle-aged, conservative old white men.'''
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show sizable support for the first lady in
a hypothetical Senate race against Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinnipiac College Poll completed April 20 shows Clinton
leading Giuliani among women by 17 percentage points _ 54 to 37
percent _ a margin that more than accounts for her eight percentage
point lead over Giuliani among all voters.
</P>
<P>
   Other polls show Clinton with a much smaller edge, and one, a
Zogby Poll, puts Guiliani ahead by six points. But in each of these
polls, Clinton leads in the women's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women always vote a little more for Democrats, but in
Hillary's case, it's not just the gap, it's a chasm,'' says Maurice
Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Mandel, director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at
Rutgers University in New Jersey, predicts that Clinton will
continue to benefit from an edge among women voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent anyone can predict anything in politics and
elections this far ahead, I'd have to say that if Hillary Clinton
runs for the Senate from New York, she will benefit from the gender
gap.''

   Women voters helped propel Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to
victory last fall over incumbent Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
Schumer won the votes of 59 percent of the women compared to
D'Amato's 40 percent share, more than accounting for the Democrat's
55 percent to 45 percent victory over D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Women exceed men in New York not just in voting registration,
but also in actually turning out to vote. According to a U.S.
Census Bureau survey taken after the 1996 election, 52.3 percent of
those who voted in 1996 were women.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Malcolm, president of Emily's List which raises money and
bankrolls pro-abortion women running as Democrats, says her network
will support Clinton in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm says a Clinton-Giuliani race would be decided in the
suburbs where independent minded so-called ``soccer Moms'' are
often the deciding factor in close races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary will do better upstate than Democrats usually do, and
Giuliani will do better in (New York City) than Republicans usually
do,'' Malcolm said. ``So the battle will be in suburbia, among
suburban women.''
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine DeAngelo, president of the New York State Federation
of Republican Women, said Clinton may be underestimating the
pitfalls of a New York candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think that just because she's a woman, she's got all the
woman in New York state behind her,'' DeAngelo said. ``I think
she'll be in for a big fight,''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, echoed the sentiment: ``The best day
(Clinton) has will be the day before she announces.''

   In addition to formation of the exploratory committee, Clinton
plans to continue her efforts to forge close ties with the main
Democratic constituencies that she would rely upon in a Senate
race. The first lady plans a trip to Israel in June to become the
first member of the first family to meet in Israel with
newly-elected Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been working for months to ease the concerns of some
Jewish Americans who expressed worry over her remarks at a meeting
in Davos, Switzerland, last year when she voiced support for an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Democrat with ties to the party organization said
Clinton has spent hours on the telephone with Democratic county
chairman and other local Democrats and has contacted more than 100
prominent Democrats. Those names were suggested to her by Moynihan,
Democratic state party leader Judith Hope and Harold Ickes, the
former White House deputy chief of staff heading up the exploratory
phase of her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Also working behind the scenes is Susan Thomases, a friend of
Clinton's since the 1970s.

TWA AND UNION RESUME TALKS IN BID TO AVERT STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After passing through bankruptcy court twice since 1992, Trans
World Airlines, the airline made famous by Charles Lindbergh and
Howard Hughes, is once again at a crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, federal mediators declared an impasse
between the airline and its largest union, setting off a 30-day
``cooling off'' period that expires at midnight June 10. If TWA and
the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,
which represents 16,000 of the airline's 21,000 employees, cannot
agree on a new contract by then, the union will be free to walk
out.
</P>
<P>
   Both the union and TWA management agree that the airline, which
has continued to lose money in the midst of an industry boom and
has only $211 million in cash, cannot afford a strike. Indeed, both
sides are concerned that even the current threat of a walkout could
severely damage the carrier because an increasing number of
passengers will stop reserving tickets on the airline as the
deadline nears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a few more canceled bookings can have a serious impact,''
said IAM President R. Thomas Buffenbarger in a recent interview.
``Consequently, the closer it gets to that 30-day mark and bookings
dry up more and more, this airline could find itself in a serious
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides returned to the negotiating table Friday after the
union broke off talks Monday. In an update to members, union
leaders said that TWA's last offer was the third in a row that
included ``no significant changes'' and was therefore unanimously
rejected by negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The company, for its part, said it had sweetened its overall
wage proposal to $320 million over two years from an earlier offer
worth $250 million. The increases for the three major groups of
workers represented by the IAM _ mechanics and ramp workers, flight
attendants, and passenger service employees _ range from 9 percent
to 23 percent, bringing each to 90 percent of the projected
industry average by early 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The union argues that its members deserve more after sticking
with TWA through years of sacrifices, although it would not
publicly specify its demands.
</P>
<P>
   Now the country's eighth-largest airline, TWA has descended a
long way from the days when it and Pan American World Airways
dominated the skies as America's premier international airlines.
The current management has shrunk the airline by trading in its
older, wide-body airplanes for smaller, newer models. It has also
focused on improving operational performance, raising its on-time
record and recently winning the J.D. Power quality award for the
second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   TWA now has a strong hub in St. Louis, where it flies 72 percent
of the scheduled airplane seats, and a weak international and
transcontinental operation based at John F. Kennedy International
Airport in New York. The airline lost $120 million last year on
$3.3 billion in sales, down from $3.5 billion in 1996. Its stock
now trades at less than half its 52-week high, closing Friday at
$5.25 a share, unchanged, on the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to simultaneously shrink and reduce unit
costs,'' said Samuel Buttrick, an airline analyst at Paine Webber
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts and industry executives say TWA has too many
employees and some of the most inefficient work rules in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Buttrick said government figures indicated that TWA's New York
operations had lost $100 million a year over the last five years.
``They need to come up with a viable business plan for Kennedy and
the Atlantic or get out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the current negotiations, TWA has proposed abandoning one of
its two terminals at Kennedy, leaving the union to choose which
one. It has also offered to increase pay in exchange for work rule
changes that would raise productivity. The airline says it can only
afford to raise wages to 90 percent of the industry average because
it generates revenue at about 90 percent of the overall industry
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Buffenbarger termed the company's early offers ``an insult.''
</P>
<P>
   The union is in a good position to judge how much TWA can afford
to pay. In 1992, the union received a large amount of stock in the
airline in exchange for 11 percent wage cuts, and it currently has
three representatives on TWA's 15-member board of directors. All
employees, including the IAM members, now hold about 11 percent of
TWA's shares.
</P>
<P>
   Buffenbarger said the union's goal was to get the company's
last, best offer and then let its members decide whether to accept
it or to strike. ``The employees who belong to the machinists'
union are the ones who will make the final decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But TWA warns that the longer the negotiations drag on, the
harder it may be to reach a deal. ``It is going to be a challenge
for us to pay for a contract even if we don't lose any business,''
said Mark Abels, a TWA spokesman. ``If we start seeing customers
draining off as we get further into a cooling period, we will have
to take another look at the offer because we may not be able to
afford it anymore.''

TINY BORDER FORCE BECOMES HUGE AND POWERFUL AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 23)   (ATTN: Arizona, California, Texas) 
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ John Hubert, a senior U.S. Border Patrol agent
here, finds himself compared to reptiles that vanished 65 million
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people consider me a dinosaur,'' Hubert, 52, confided as
his four-wheel drive vehicle rumbled along the edge of this
sprawling city on the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the good old days: getting covered in sweat and dust
when, as a solo agent, he spent hours tracking two dozen or more
illegal immigrants sneaking into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert and those like him are a dying breed as the 2,000-mile
border is more under control than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   New agents often sit in air-conditioned vehicles parked beside
shopping malls or idling along the banks of the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   They radio for backup if they spot even five illegal immigrants
and are more adept at using computers and high-tech scopes than
spotting footprints in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smugglers, drug loads, gunfights: this was a great job,''
Hubert lamented. ``The thrill of the job was the catch.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long road for the Border Patrol, which started as
an obscure part of the U.S. Department of Labor and whose first
batch of officers 75 years ago did not have uniforms. The force is
now part of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the shadows of the Franklin Mountains in West Texas the
patrol was launched on May 28, 1924. It was also here that a
controversial 1993 stand against illegal immigration _ known as
Operation Hold the Line _ would become a blue print for modern
operations from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 8,000 agents in green uniforms, the largest law
enforcement agency on the border has more manpower than ever. The
increased number of agents and a budget of more than $3 billion has
permitted the patrol to make dramatic changes in the Old West
tactics that made it famous.
</P>
<P>
   As agents trade their uniforms for tuxedos this week to attend
birthday bashes, a fight over the patrol's future is raging in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says the patrol has reached its limit
for now, and pushing ahead with mass hiring will result in
lower-quality agents and too many rookies in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress, including Rep. Silvestre Reyes who as a
Border Patrol chief in El Paso introduced Hold the Line, contend
the administration shirked its responsibility when it recently
backed away from a congressional mandate to increase the agency's
ranks by hiring 1,000 new agents per year.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers such as Reyes, D-Texas, want the patrol's strength to
increase to 20,000 agents.
</P>
<P>
   Rugged vehicles and a fleet of $1.3 million high-tech
helicopters have all but replaced horses for working the severe
country along the border. Night-vision scopes and underground
sensors that detect movement have replaced watch towers with bells
and strings attached to cans.
</P>
<P>
   The patrol has flexed its new-found muscle to severely limit
illegal border crossing in El Paso and San Diego and is now
focusing its strength in the Rio Grande Valley and near Tucson,
Ariz. Next up is the brushland surrounding Laredo, Del Rio and
Eagle Pass in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, officials believe, they have a shot at
controlling places they long considered a no-man's land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have proven with the right support what was once a distant
possibility is becoming a distinct reality,'' said Gus De La Vina,
national chief of the Border Patrol. ``We are making some huge
strides.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents are stationed in 22 states, but most work along the
Mexican border, where 75 percent of the cocaine and marijuana in
the United States is believed to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, agents seized more than 11 tons of cocaine and 435 tons
of marijuana. That same year, 1.5 million illegal immigrants were
apprehended along the Southwest border.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's budget of $3 billion today is a far cry from the $1
million with which it started 75 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But critics charge the patrol is growing too fast. They say
agents are trampling on civil rights as towns and cities along the
border become zones of occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these guys are doing is a raw exercise of power,'' Ray
Gil, a lawyer for the San Juan-based South Texas Civil Rights
Project, has said of the military-like presence that would be
unheard of away from the border.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to patrolling in vehicles, agents walk the streets
and ride bicycles through border cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic heading north is stopped at highway checkpoints where
agents often use drug-sniffing dogs to search vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 Amnesty International report chastised the patrol over
allegations of sexual abuse and beatings of those in its custody.
The agency promised to investigate the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allegations of ill treatment collected include people struck
with batons, fists or feet, often as punishment for attempting to
run away from Border Patrol agents,'' the report noted.
</P>
<P>
   A message scrawled in blood-red pen on a cement levee for the
Rio Grande near downtown El Paso warns ``Ojo Migra,'' Spanish slang
for ``Watch Out Border Patrol,'' along with a telephone number to
report abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have considered them a rough law enforcement
agency, but it is part of their jobs,'' said Pete G. Flores, who is
writing a book dedicated to agents who lost their lives on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have to be a lot more careful than your average
law enforcement agency,'' Flores said. ``They do not know if they
are up against people smugglers or dope smugglers who do not think
twice about exchanging gunfire.''

<P>
   During Prohibition, agents, then known as inspectors, chased
whiskey smugglers. As World War II raged, agents took up posts
along the East Coast and watched for German submarines and
saboteurs.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of Japanese subversives led to the roundup of thousands of
West Coast residents of Japanese descent who were shipped inland to
at least three dozen detention camps nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   With the push for civil rights, hundreds of agents in riot gear
were deployed to Alabama and Mississippi in 1961 to guard black
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the windows were broken out in our vehicles,'' recalled
Allen ``Frito'' Fry, a retired agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never been exposed to racism to that extent _ pretty
girls would walk up and call us sons of bitches,'' said Fry, who in
1975 was shot in the stomach while patrolling an area near
Brownsville, Texas, known as the marijuana alley.
</P>
<P>
   A generation later, Fry's son, David, is an agent.

HEALTH GROUP DEFERS ERADICATION OF SMALLPOX STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JUDITH MILLER and LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Prompted by fears of a new outbreak of one of
the world's deadliest scourges, the World Health Assembly in Geneva
effectively decided Friday to defer eradicating the world's known
remaining stocks of the smallpox virus until at least 2002.
</P>
<P>
   While virtually all member states said they remained committed
to the elimination of the smallpox stocks as soon as possible, the
action taken by a key committee acting on consensus, without a
formal vote, reflected widespread agreement that more time is
needed to study smallpox before it is irrevocably destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's recommendations are to be formally approved
early next week, which World Health Organization officials said was
usually a pro forma matter.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate on Friday, many of the 25 national representatives
who spoke affirmed reluctantly the need for a stay of execution for
the virus, the third it has received since the 191-member
organization decided in 1980 to destroy the declared stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution also calls for the creation of an international
committee of experts to advise on whether further research is
needed and if so, what kind, and to devise an timetable for
eradication. It further specifies that the research should be
conducted in an ``open and transparent'' manner.
</P>
<P>
   The decision reflects a major shift in scientific thinking about
the virus since 1996, when the Assembly decided it should be
destroyed at the end of June 1999. It highlighted the existence of
increasingly rare political common ground between the United States
and Russia, the two remaining repositories of the deadly stocks.
Both Washington and Moscow have publicly opposed eradication of the
virus, at least until more research is done.
</P>
<P>
   Though smallpox was officially declared eradicated as a disease
in 1980, most officials now acknowledge that there are probably
clandestine smallpox stocks throughout the world, and that
retaining the virus could speed the development of new drugs to
fight an outbreak that occurred either naturally or as a result of
bioterrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shalala, the U.S. secretary of health and human services,
who led the American delegation at the assembly, said that the
threat of bioterrorism, which was ``obscure'' only a few years ago,
had emerged as among ``the thorniest problems of the post-Cold War
era.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalala, who critics say was somewhat slow to recognize the
threat and the value of postponing eradication, said that the
growing bioterrorism threat required international health officials
to ``change and adapt our response'' and to coordinate efforts to
``prepare for an incident that we hope will never happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A turning point in official U.S. thinking about the virus's fate
came in March, when an independent scientific panel concluded that
research on the deadly smallpox virus could provide important
scientific and medical opportunities that would be lost if the
virus were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   While the committee was not asked whether the virus should be
kept or destroyed, its conclusions strongly influenced President
Clinton's decision to fight for at least temporary retention.
</P>
<P>
   Though almost none of the resolution's 27 co-sponsors mentioned
bioterrorism in their public remarks, fears that the virus might
once again trigger an epidemic in a now largely unvaccinated world
helped produce the new consensus, Western and foreign officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials said that the deferral was also influenced by
recent statements by a senior Soviet defector that the former
Soviet Union had secretly filled warheads of some of its
intercontinental ballistic missiles with smallpox, violating the
treaty it signed in 1972 banning such weapons.

   In an interview this week in Washington, Lev Sandakhchiev, the
director of Russia's State Research Center of Virology and
Biotechnology, known as Vector, where smallpox strains are stored,
would not comment on the former Soviet Union's germ weapons
programs. But he said he was certain that North Korea, among other
states, was secretly keeping smallpox stocks. Destroying the virus
would complicate efforts to develop new anti-viral drugs to counter
an outbreak, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandakhchiev said that an outbreak last year in the Democratic
Republic of Congo of monkey pox, a virus closely related to
smallpox, was a ``warning signal'' that led the Russian government
to redouble its efforts to defer eradication.
</P>
<P>
   The policy implications of the outbreak of more than 300 cases
of a disease that occasionally strikes humans but has not
traditionally spread quickly among them as smallpox once did, has
been debated by scientists within and outside Russia. The outbreak,
he argued, showed that a new form of smallpox might be evolving and
that it would be ``dangerous'' to conclude that the disease had
been eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Henderson, a scientist who led the campaign to eradicate
the virus and once served as deputy science adviser to the White
House, did not agree that the outbreak in Congo suggested that
smallpox was making a comeback in a milder form. Many of the cases
in Congo, he said, turned out to be not monkey pox, but chicken
pox.
</P>
<P>
   He and other advocates of immediate smallpox eradication vowed
Friday to ``continue fighting'' for the virus's destruction. He and
other advocates of smallpox destruction argue that while the virus
has been kept in tight security at both Vector and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta for many years,
relatively little research has been done since the disease was
eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   They discount the notion that governments will spend precious
research dollars on studies of a disease that no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they say, even if the committee of experts that the
World Heath Assembly is supposed to create recommends new
experiments on smallpox, they will be funded at the expense of
research on other lethal diseases like tuberculosis, which is
spreading rapidly in the former Soviet Union, among other places.

BRAZIL CHALLENGES OUTRAGEOUS TV SHOWS ON HUMAN-RIGHTS GROUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ This is a society that prides itself on
having a tolerant, even permissive, attitude about human
predilections. But even in Brazil's liberal climate there are
limits on sex, violence and the bizarre _ and the newly minted
television stars who go by the names Auntie and Little Rat have set
off a fierce national controversy by exceeding them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, public outrage at the behavior of the two performers,
who appear on separate programs on different networks based here in
Brazil's largest city, has become so intense that the government is
being called on to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   But the Brazilian equivalent of the U.S. Federal Communications
Commission is toothless, and court challenges have thus far come to
naught. So the issue has been taken up by the Brazilian federal
government's human rights ombudsman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is indeed a human rights question,'' said Jose Gregori,
director of the human rights office. ``In terms of formal
democracy, Brazil has reached a satisfactory level. But in regard
to security and cultural marginalization, we need to correct
certain problems, and so my principal concern is to diminish
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Rat, known as Ratinho in Portuguese and Carlos Massa when
he is offstage, began his show less than two years ago. He invites
guests whose cases are more bizarre and pathetic than anything
Jerry Springer could imagine. Constant among them are victims of
unusual physical deformities, like a man with a gigantic tumor that
has grown over his face, or almost unimaginable brutality, like a
woman whose jealous husband had gouged her eyes out.
</P>
<P>
   Competing with the soap operas that have traditionally been the
backbone of prime-time programming in this nation of 165 million,
``Little Rat's Show'' has won its share of high ratings. National
marketing surveys indicate that the program appeals most strongly
to the urban working poor and inhabitants of rural areas, groups
that tend to be less educated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Ratinho because he shows the world as it truly is,''
said Antonio Pereira Ramos, 38, a Sao Paulo sanitation worker who
is a regular viewer.
</P>
<P>
   But Massa's image recently took a tumble when he intervened in
the kidnapping of the brother of a country music star. The singer
had been negotiating his brother's release with the kidnappers, but
when Ratinho began a fund-raising campaign to pay the ransom, they
raised their demand sixfold, to $1.25 million. Also, to demonstrate
their seriousness, they cut off one of their victim's ears and sent
it to a television station that carries the Ratinho program.
</P>
<P>
   Massa later apologized, saying his interference had been ``a
huge stupidity.'' But there have been demands that he be sent to
prison as an accomplice of the kidnappers. There has also been a
chorus of complaints that he will do anything to increase his
ratings, which in fact nearly doubled during the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   The fuss over Auntie (Tiazinha in Portuguese) is perhaps more
surprising since, in contrast to American fare, prime-time
programming here has included nudity and daring love scenes for
several years. But Tiazinha, whose real name is Suzana Alves, has
built her appeal on a sensuality that goes far beyond what
Brazilians regard as natural or healthy, entering the realm of what
one magazine here described as ``S&AMP;M light.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing skimpy black lingerie and a mask and wielding a whip,
Tiazinha is the star of a peculiar quiz program that requires teams
of young people to answer questions about current events and
Brazilian culture. If they fail to respond correctly, Tiazinha
dances over to a team member _ always male and always bound and
gagged _ and rips hairs from his legs or stomach with tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a matinee as hot as this on Brazilian
television,'' the weekly magazine Manchete reported recently in an
admiring profile of the 20-year-old brown-skinned, dark-haired
model, who has dethroned a long line of blue-eyed, fair-haired soap
opera stars as the country's reigning sex symbol. ``Nobody makes
faces, purses her lips or wiggles, bumps and grinds as lasciviously
as Tiazinha.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alves' popularity is such that in the last four months she
has been the queen of Carnival, appeared in a long photo essay in
Playboy magazine and tried her luck as a singer on a best-selling
CD. But the foundation of her celebrity remains the daily
television program, which offends many.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad enough that activities of this sort should be shown
on television at all,'' said Maria das Gracas Neves Moreira, a
middle-aged housewife here. ``But for this girl to be making such
blatant appeals to base instincts when our children are likely to
be watching is a special disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, experts said, the explosion of outrageous
programming is a direct result of the economic stability and growth
that Brazil enjoyed until the devaluation of its currency in
January. After decades during which prices increased as much as
1,000 percent a year, inflation has dropped to virtually zero in
the last four years, allowing even the very poor to enjoy increases
in real income and save money to buy consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ratinho phenomenon causes perplexity among
intellectuals,'' Culture Minister Francisco Weffort said in a
recent interview, ``but it is only possible because people in the
lower sectors are buying television sets as never before.'' He
added that it was ``principally for them'' that ``programs of this
type'' were made by the nation's five strongly competitive
television networks.
</P>
<P>
   Weffort and other observers also see the proliferation of
Ratinho-style programs as a reaction to restrictions placed on
expression during two decades of military dictatorship, which ended
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together with democratization,'' Weffort said, ``there is a
climate of `anything goes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's constitution, written in 1988, states that ``any and
all forms of political, ideological and artistic censorship are
forbidden.'' But the charter also requires producers of radio and
television programs to demonstrate ``respect for the ethical and
social values of the individual and the family,'' thereby providing
a legal basis for Gregori's campaign as ombudsman.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mission is not to impose any kind of censorship or
monitoring,'' he said. ``I just want the networks to pay attention
to the terms of their contract, which is a public concession that
requires them to contribute to the well-being of the citizenry, and
take steps themselves to improve the quality of their
programming.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are also those who see the phenomenon primarily as an
expression of racial and class consciousness. Wagner Bezerra, a
media consultant and author of a new book called ``Manual of the
Dissatisfied Television Viewer,'' is one of them, noting that about
two-thirds of Brazil's population can be classified as black or
mulatto.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soap operas are full of rich white families in fancy cars,
and I think the population is tired of that,'' he said. ``Those
programs are saying, `You don't exist' to the dark-skinned
majority, and so they are seeking other options they can identify
with, that reflect their sentiments, even if they are negative and
bizarre.''

HEARD IT ON THE PC GRAPEVIVE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Wash., Calif.)   (af)  
 By GEANNE ROSENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When employees gossip about their jobs at the proverbial water
cooler, the atmosphere is often one of hushed tones and
over-the-shoulder glances. But no such discretion applies at the
Electronic Watercooler, an on-line network of uncensored bulletin
boards intended to attract employees and job seekers at more than
800 companies.
</P>
<P>
   The bulletin boards display office rumors, fears of layoffs,
complaints about work hours and pay and responses to applicants'
queries about salary and work life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we all realize that we'd be making at least twice as much
$$ if we went to Goldman?'' asked one writer, identified as a
Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell lawyer. ``We would definitely NOT be working
any harder at Goldman than we do here.''
</P>
<P>
   The network was started in March by Vault Reports, a New York
company, to attract visitors to its Web site, which also offers job
listings and employment matching services. To advise job hunters,
Vault also sells books and reports on specific companies _ all of
which are represented on the bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   The postings, which can be reached at www.vaultreports.com, have
been coming in fast and furious, with more than 5,200 so far,
including more than 1,000 in the last week. Some of the more active
boards include those on Goldman Sachs, Andersen Consulting, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch, Microsoft and Procter &AMP; Gamble.
There are also more general ones for industries or types of
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically trying to take an age-old concept of gossiping
at the office water cooler and exploding it globally,'' said Samer
Hamadeh, co-founder of Vault Reports.
</P>
<P>
   The messages on the boards are generally anonymous _ often,
authors say, to avoid retribution. But the anonymity allows anyone
to pose as a company employee, job applicant or even a competitor.
Visitors can only hope that some postings are fictional, like one
person's score card of purported sexual exploits at a company
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Employment experts said the site should not be taken too
seriously. ``It's really not the water cooler,'' said Mark A.
Rothstein, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center who
is an expert in employment law. ``It's almost like the bar across
the street from the plant gate, because it involves not only people
who are currently working at the company but former employees and
total strangers, and there's really no way to verify whether these
people have the insider information that they pretend to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are not amused. In fact, Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter blocked the site from office computers. In response, Vault
Reports parked a truck outside Morgan Stanley headquarters in
Manhattan and distributed fliers that described a different route
to the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanmarie McFadden, chief spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, called
the site ``not conducive to the work environment.'' But she
conceded that companies would not be able to stop employees from
visiting the site from outside the office.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in fact, the site received many messages about Morgan
Stanley's widely publicized racial discrimination dispute with
Christian Curry, a dismissed employee. Some postings, representing
their authors as co-workers and Morgan Stanley clients, expressed
outrage at the firm's actions, including a supposed $10,000
payment, under investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's
office, to a police informant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really disgusted,'' one message said.
</P>
<P>
   But some messages challenged the authenticity of others _ one
contended that those supporting Curry had been written by the same
person. ``Just look at the writing style,'' it said, ``and the
common words and expressions.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley had no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The risks of such sites include libel, breaches of privacy and
damage to corporate recruiting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Someone identifying herself as a Procter &AMP; Gamble job seeker
asked on the bulletin board if the company's culture required
``marriage to the corporation and family last.'' After several
responses, she resurfaced with the message: ``Think I'll hold off a
bit on accepting the P and G offer. Who needs the stress?''
</P>
<P>
   Employees who post damaging messages do so at their peril. ``If
employers are able to determine who is actually posting the
information, there would probably be little to stop the employer
from taking action,'' Rothstein said.
</P>
<P>
   What are the chances that a company can track down senders of
anonymous E-mail? ``Oh, we do it all the time,'' said John Jessen,
president and chief executive of Electronic Evidence Discovery
Inc., based in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Companies can easily monitor employees' on-site Internet
activity, and employees have been fired. Edward Jones, the
brokerage firm, recently dismissed 19 people who it said had failed
to admit that they had sent pornography or off-color jokes over
internal e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But even some company managers see an upside. While surfing the
Web, Ed Collins, a senior vice president in Young &AMP; Rubicam's
office in Irvine, Calif., learned about the forums at Vault Reports
and posted a message saying, ``I think it's a great tool to post
information that you'd like to have people respond to'' and invited
employees of the advertising agency to chat.

OUTLOOK NOT HEAVENLY FOR CARR VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Oba Carr says God will intervene on his behalf
Saturday night when he tries to take the World Boxing Council
welterweight title away from Oscar De La Hoya at the new Mandalay
Bay Resort Events Center. If God does, He may have to beat the
referee to it.
</P>
<P>
   Carr is a more than competent prize fighter, arguably one of the
half-dozen best 147-pounders in the world. Because of that, he is
being given his third chance to win a welterweight title.
Unfortunately for him, few observers of matters fistic believe this
opportunity will end any differently than his previous two, unless
a higher power has cable and tunes it to HBO around 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In those earlier fights, Carr had his moments, putting both
International Boxing Federation champion Felix Trinidad and World
Boxing Association champion Ike Quartey on their backs. He knocked
two of the three best welterweights in the world flat, which is an
accomplishment of some note, but it must also be noted that both
got up and one, Trinidad, went on to knock Carr cold, while the
other, Quartey, survived an 11th-round knockdown to win a majority
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, Carr has an unblemished record (48-2-1) and
that is what has brought him the opportunity to become the first
man to fight De La Hoya, Trinidad, and Quartey and if he can drop
De La Hoya as he did the others, he would have an odd trifecta,
being the only fighter to accomplish the feat. What he must avoid
however _ and what he believes God has assured him _ is becoming
the only fighter to lose to all three as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to a mesmerizing fight,'' the born-again
Christian told the world this week. ``I had a vision about fighting
Oscar De La Hoya several years ago. That vision has been consistent
ever since. Soon the vision will come true in a supernatural way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victory is already done in heaven. Now it just has to be
done on earth. Ever since I left Don King and turned my life to the
Lord, He has blessed me. People just do not understand. I've shown
the world I can box. People just haven't seen the other side of me.
I am going to drop the bomb. I have been resurrected. I will
resurrect boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is right and his God is a boxing fan, Carr may have to
resurrect sports books all over Las Vegas as well because they have
universally installed him as a 10-1 underdog against the undefeated
De La Hoya (30-0). If Carr can overcome those odds, he not only
will have beaten a fighter many consider the pound-for-pound best
in the world, but he will have beaten the town that has broken more
hearts than the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya patiently listened Thursday afternoon as Carr stood
at a press conference pulpit and preached the word as he understood
it. The word he'd heard was that there was big trouble coming
Saturday night at the Mandalay Bay Events Center after the first
bell sounds, and De La Hoya agreed. The source of the trouble was
the only issue in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys are going to be the first to witness the old but also
the new Oscar,'' De La Hoya said. ``I have returned to my old
style. Enough with all the boxing stuff. Let's just take care of
the job and fight. Let our fists do the talking.''
</P>
<P>
   The normally soft-spoken De La Hoya has been threatening to go
on the offensive more for nearly two months, claiming he, too, had
a dream a while back. There was no hint of divine intervention in
his dream, however. His was about something more basic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just hit me,'' De La Hoya said. ``What am I doing boxing
these guys? I'm not a boxer. I'm a fighter. What am I doing boxing
guys like Pernell Whitaker and Ike Quartey? I was not fighting my
own style. I should be the leader in that ring but I was adjusting
to them, not them adjusting to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was I doing talking about losing before the Quartey
fight? I decided to listen to myself and be what I want in the
ring. This fight, you'll see a big difference. I'm going to become
more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's critics have noted his knockout percentage has
dwindled since he began moving up in weight from his original 130
pounds to 135, then 140, and now 147. Although he has 24 knockouts
among his 30 victories, he was taken the distance in four of his
last eight fights and has not had a spectacular knockout against a
true challenger in several years, unless you disagree with the
widely held belief that the Julio Cesar Chavez he stopped twice was
an aged and fragile shadow of his former self.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the lightweight division, De La Hoya has been
taken the distance by Whitaker, Quartey, Miguel Angel Gonzalez, and
Hector Camacho and was beginning to feel the dread opponents once
had for him had waned. He blames this on the parade of trainers he
brought in at other's insistence over the past few years, dating to
the importation of a Mexican aluminum siding salesman and defensive
genius named Jesus Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera improved De La Hoya's defense but blunted his offense and
although Emanuel Steward reversed that, he could not survive in the
Hispanic world of advisers who surround De La Hoya and he soon was
cut loose in favor of Gil Clancy and De La Hoya's boyhood trainer,
Robert Alcazar.
</P>
<P>
   That chorus of voices is allegedly going to change after this
fight, the champion has said, and there are rumors Clancy will be
jettisoned along with a number of the growing retinue that
surrounds the young champion.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the cacophony of voices vying for his attention
that will be on his mind Saturday night. Saturday night Oscar De La
Hoya's mind will be filled with thoughts only of Oba Carr and an
urge to prove the only intervention that will be able to save him
will have to come from a quick-thinking referee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was losing total respect, the respect I had four years
ago,'' De La Hoya said of the less aggressive style he plans to
abandon Saturday night. ``I lost respect every single fight the
last three, four years. I used to walk through my opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``My last few fights people tried to make me a boxer but that's
not my style. I'm not a boxer. I'm a slugger. I'm going back to
what got me here.''
</P>
<P>
   What got Oscar De La Hoya world titles in four weight classes
was aggression. What Oba Carr believes will get him his first is
divine interventio. Carr may be right, but in boxing it's safer to
bet on the guy doing the punching than the guy doing the praying.

PROMOTERS AGREE ON DE LA HOYA-TRINIDAD FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Much more will be riding on the outcome of
Saturday's fight with Oba Carr than Oscar De La Hoya thought. Like
another $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of blustery negotiations, promoters Don King and
Bob Arum reached agreement Friday on the terms of a De La
Hoya-Felix Trinidad welterweight unification fight Sept. 18 here at
the Mandalay Bay Resort Events Center. The two had been negotiating
for weeks, with Arum finally offering Trinidad a $10 million
guarantee through King a week ago that carried with it a Wednesday
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   When King countered with his own offer Tuesday, the two began to
talk again with HBO Sports senior vice president Lou DiBella. Late
Thursday, they agreed on the financial terms after Trinidad
demanded an additional $1 million in guaranteed money and an
increase of his share of the pay-per-view sales.
</P>
<P>
   Arum will pay King $10.5 million for Trinidad's services, with
an additional $500,000 believed to be coming from other sources,
while the number of pay-per-view sales required for Trinidad to
begin seeing an upside above his guarantee was cut from Arum's
original stipulation of 1 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, who will be guaranteed $16 million and is likely to
make at least $20 million, has never done more than 750,000
pay-per-view sales and Trinidad has done nowhere near those
numbers, so the 1 million figure almost ensured Trinidad would see
no additional income beyond his guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the money was agreed to, Arum, who will be the lead
promoter, refused to sign until King informed him how many hotel
rooms and tickets he would seek. That remained the sticking point
until midday Friday, when the sides finally agreed on all points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's done,'' Arum said before Friday's weigh-in for the
Carr-De La Hoya fight. ``We jiggled the upside some and I'm
guaranteeing Trinidad $10.5 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Some insiders believe King agreed to the deal because his
contract with Trinidad requires he guarantee the International
Boxing Federation champion more in purses than the fighter can
generate on pay-per-view on his own. So by making this deal, it
eases the financial burden on King, win or lose. If Trinidad loses,
the value of his contract is lessened considerably. If he wins, he
becomes the instant king of the division as well as a likely
candidate to fight De La Hoya again for an even bigger payday in a
rematch, although there is no rematch clause in the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wins, he's on top of the world,'' Arum said of King.
``If he doesn't, Trinidad becomes more manageable for King.''

BAY STATE   UNEMPLOYMENT RATE RISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Massachusetts jobless rate rose slightly last
month, but 5,900 new jobs added in April pushed the number of
people employed in the state to yet another record.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to
2.9 percent in April, the Massachusetts Division of Employment and
Training said Friday, in its monthly report.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of 5,900 new jobs were in the services sector,
especially business services. A slight rise in the jobless rate was
caused by an expansion of the labor force. The number of residents
working in all jobs statewide hit 3.18 million in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the third month in a row, the number of people employed is
at a new high,'' said Elliot Winer, the division's chief economist.
</P>
<P>
   The job gains in Massachusetts are only part of the story of a
prosperity that is spreading throughout New England. Strong job
growth and low unemploymentin April saw Vermont's jobless rate fall
to 2.6 percent from 3.1 percent, and New Hampshire's to 2.4 percent
from 3.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time New England had three states under 3 percent was
in July 1988,'' said Denis McSweeney, regional commissioner of the
federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. At that time Connecticut, New
Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont all had rates below 3 percent.
Massachusetts had a 3.3 percent jobless rate in July 1988.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BASEL, Switzerland _ One day after admitting that some senior
executives were ringleaders in a nine-year price-fixing cartel for
vitamins, the chairman and the chief executive of Roche Holding AG
pronounced themselves blameless and clueless Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will understand that this was not part of our
responsibility,'' said Franz B. Humer, the chief executive. ``It is
certainly not easy to understand the reasons for actions of
employees who in secrecy organized a conspiracy of this kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Roche, a pharmaceutical conglomerate based here, was by far the
biggest player in what the U.S. Justice Department has described as
a sophisticated cartel to fix worldwide vitamin prices as much as
25 percent above the market level.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Roche agree to pay $500 million to settle charges
with the Justice Department. Two of its top executives resigned,
and one of them agreed to serve a four-month prison sentence in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, at a news conference at company headquarters, both the
chairman and the chief executive were almost completely at a loss
to explain how the wrongdoing could have happened _ or what they
would do to keep it from happening again.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Roche was not alone. BASF AG of Germany agreed to
settle similar charges by paying $225 million in fines.
Rhone-Poulenc &UR;  &LR; of France, which was also part of the cartel but
provided crucial information to prosecutors, was allowed to escape
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But Roche was the undisputed heavyweight, controlling about 40
percent of the worldwide vitamin market. It also had a history of
price fixing: in 1997, the same division that was implicated
Thursday had to pay a $14 million fine for its involvement in
fixing the price of citric acid and lysine, which are food
additives.
</P>
<P>
   The potential liabilities of Roche and BASF were clearly on the
minds of investors. Roche shares fell 330 Swiss francs, or nearly 2
percent, to close at 16,670. BASF was down 0.05 euros, to 39.25,
while Rhone-Poulenc was up 1.44 euros, to 48.39.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Roche case most remarkable is that the executives
embroiled in the last round of price-fixing were apparently
involved in the latest one as well _ even as Roche was vowing to
clean up its practices.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Humer attributed the wrongdoing to what he called the
secret machinations of the implicated executives. He insisted that
the company had ``never tolerated practices of this kind.'' He
vowed to start a ``vigorous information campaign'' that would tell
all employees about ethical practices.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they promised to restore Roche's credibility with
its corporate customers _ a number of whom have filed suit _ the
Roche executives could not explain what had happened or why.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really know what they did,'' Fritz Gerber, Roche's
chairman, said. The problem, he said, was that the most important
source of information was the Justice Department and that Roche did
not have access to the government's evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that there was an elaborate conspiracy that was
kept entirely secret by a small group of employees,'' Humer said.
But, he said, ``we are very reliant on what the Justice Department
has published.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By all accounts, the conspiracy was sophisticated and global.
Roche, BASF and Rhone-Poulenc control more than 80 percent of the
world vitamin market.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies have admitted forming a cartel in 1990 that
lasted until this year and that included most of the world's
smaller producers.
</P>
<P>
   In its indictment, the Justice Department said that executives
from the companies met secretly to set prices and carve up the
market. According to the government, the conspiracy involved people
at many levels of management and was operated with the smoothness
of a single company _ ``Vitamins Inc.,'' in one government
characterization.
</P>
<P>
   The big question Friday was how Roche, which had already run
afoul of the Justice Department, could let such a thing happen.
</P>
<P>
   The costs will almost certainly be much higher than the $500
million that Roche agreed to pay to the U.S. government. All
companies in the cartel face class-action lawsuits from the
companies that bought their vitamins, which are produced for human
uses as well as fed to animals.
</P>
<P>
   Both Roche and BASF have announced plans to seek out-of-court
settlements on the lawsuits, but those could cost hundreds of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also face possible fines from the European
Commission's competition authorities, who are looking into the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   By Roche's reckoning, the central villains were Roland
Broennimann, head of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division since
1989, and Kuno Sommer, head of marketing for the vitamin division
from 1994 until 1997, when he was promoted to chief executive of
Roche's flavors and fragrances subsidiary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sommer, 43, pleaded guilty to violating antitrust laws and to
obstruction of justice. As part of a plea bargain, he will serve
four months in prison. Bronnimann is still under investigation and
may yet face indictments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sommer apparently distinguished himself as a star performer.
Sales jumped from 3 billion francs to 3.8 billion francs between
1995 and 1997, and Roche rewarded him by putting him in charge of
the flavors and fragrances business and by elevating him to the
management board, known as the Corporate Executive Committee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roche executives refused to say where either of the two departed
executives were Friday. Roche said neither man would receive any
special severance package, though they would be entitled to their
accrued retirement benefits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can surely understand, we are extremely angry,'' Humer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerber, who took over as chairman in 1978, just two years after
the European Union imposed huge fines for illegal pricing
practices, said he was upset as well. ``It is most unpleasant for
me personally,'' he said.

DECODING OF HUMAN GENOME LIKELY TO BE FINISHED SOON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., N.Y., Britain, France, Japan, Germany)  (lb) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLD SPRING HARBOR, N.Y. _ The publicly financed effort to
decode the human genome, the 3 billion units of DNA at the heart of
every human cell, is now 10 percent complete and is on track to
meet its goal of finishing a first draft of the genome a year from
now, officials of the National Institutes of Health said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Decoding the genome, which holds the cell's genetic programming
instructions, is regarded as a fundamental step toward
understanding the design of the human body and its propensity to
disease. Because all diseases have a genetic component, knowledge
of the genome's precise sequence of DNA units should lead to
fundamental advances in many branches of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of
Health's share of the human genome project, told scientists meeting
at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory that the impending completion
of the genome represented a ``historic time in science.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important organized scientific effort that
humankind has ever attempted,'' Collins said. ``It dwarfs going to
the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were made in the presence of Dr. James D. Watson,
who with Dr. Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA in 1953.
As first director of the institutes' human genome project, Watson
set its completion date as 2005, a goal he judged technically
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's hope of seeing his project produce a complete sequence
of human DNA within his lifetime faltered briefly last year when a
newly formed private company, Celera, announced that it would
complete the human genome by 2001. For a few days, officials at the
institutes seemed inclined to cede the field to Celera and its
aggressive leader, Dr. J. Craig Venter. Venter has suggested that
when he succeeds, the public consortium's efforts will be seen as
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   But the institutes' efforts quickly resumed after their partner
in the public consortium, the richly endowed Wellcome Trust of
London, said the publicly financed effort should continue.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's meeting took on some of the overtones of a pep rally
when photographs of Venter were projected in a context that drew
laughter from the audience, which included many scientists who work
at the genome-sequencing centers financed by the public consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a canary-yellow sweater and a floppy hat, Watson sat in
front of the audience as the progress of the genome-sequencing
project was announced. Collins projected onto a screen the first
page of Watson's 1953 article in the journal Nature, noting that if
the decoding was completed by 2003, as planned, exactly half a
century would have elapsed between the two events.
</P>
<P>
   Collins also stressed the ideological difference between the two
camps by emphasizing the public consortium's goal of putting the
human genome sequence in the hands of the world's scientists as
soon as possible, without fees or restrictions. Celera does not
plan to make all its sequence data immediately available, although
Venter has said scientists will have free access to parts of it.
</P>
<P>
   Venter's challenge to the public consortium preceded a recent
centralization of its efforts and a sharpening of focus. The
various university sequencing centers financed by the health
institutes have been reduced to four, and the smaller, less
efficient centers have been cut out of the action.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving centers now hold weekly conference calls and
submit to a certain amount of central planning, which they had
previously avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Besides moving up its target date for the complete genome
sequence to 2003 from 2005, the public consortium has said it will
produce a ``first draft'' _ 90 percent of the sequence containing
the majority of all human genes _ by next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to produce and publish a first-draft DNA sequence
may make it harder for commercial ventures like Celera to lock up
significant stretches of the genome with patent claims.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision carries a certain cost in that the two-stage
process of producing a first draft and then a complete sequence is
less efficient than finishing the whole sequence with no
intermediate stage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite the progress made since 1996, when human genome
sequencing started in earnest, its completion cannot be taken for
granted. Both the ends and the middles of human chromosomes, the
units in which DNA is packaged, consist of highly repetitive
regions of DNA that may be hard to decode.
</P>
<P>
   So far no human chromosome has been completed, although the long
DNA molecule, which is chromosome 22, has been half-sequenced and
scientists hope to finish it this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office after the meeting, Watson, who is
president of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, called the public
consortium's progress ``extremely satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   One-third of the human genome sequence is to be finished by the
Sanger Center, near Cambridge, England. The next-largest
contributor is Washington University in St Louis. Last year the two
centers finished decoding the genome of the C. elegans roundworm as
a pilot project for tackling the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   At a closed meeting here, where all parts of the genome were
allocated to various centers, it was agreed that a French group
would sequence chromosome 14, Japanese scientists would do
chromosome 18 and a German sequencing center would complete
chromosome 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genome belongs to the world,'' Watson said. ``When it is
being said that this is the most important thing human beings have
ever done, people want to be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the case when Watson first endorsed the idea of
trying to sequence the human genome in the late 1980s. Many
scientists opposed the effort, in part from fear that it would
divert research funds from their own projects.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he set 2005 as a conservative target date for fear
that the project might not receive the necessary funds. ``When we
set those dates, the scientific community was not with us,'' he
said.

   As in, will the merged company's products be painted in New
Holland's signature blue or Case's trademark red? Or will they mix
them into _ gasp _ purple?
</P>
<P>
   It's not as trivial a question as it might seem. Brand identity
in farm equipment has long been defined by color. For decades,
farmers across the Midwest divided into ``green guys'' who owned
John Deere equipment, ``red guys'' who preferred International
Harvester and ``blue guys'' who bought Ford. On the Great Plains,
the combine color code can be read for miles.
</P>
<P>
   Changes of ownership in the 1980s created a new scorecard: Case
adopted the red when it acquired IH. The original blue, Ford,
acquired New Holland, but Fiat of Italy then bought most of the
combined operation; it will also be majority owner of the New
Holland-Case combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Color loyalty is serious business,'' said Lynn Haseley, who
grows corn and soybeans in Beason, Ill. ``My father was a red guy
and my grandfather was a red guy. I grew up with red. I'm a
die-hard red fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Armstrong, host of a daily radio show for farmers on WGN, a
Chicago station that reaches much of the Midwest, said the merger
was the talk of his audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy called in yesterday; he was all lathered up about
it,'' Armstrong said. ``It's just too weird to imagine an IH
combine anything but red.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who grew up on a farm (red), could recall
grade-school fights over whether red or green was superior. ``Of
course, if they weren't red (italics)or(end italics) green, well,
we just felt bad for those poor kids.''
</P>
<P>
   What do the merging companies say? That the old color scheme is
safe. ``Our brand is our color,'' said Bill Masterson, a Case
spokesman. ``The color identity of our products is so important
that we are going to create a multibrand company,'' retaining both
Case red and New Holland blue.
</P>
<P>
   But what if a future corporate reshuffler decides that one color
is plenty? ``Boy,'' said Haseley, blanching at the thought of
himself atop a Case-IH tractor painted blue. ``Well, I guess we'll
just have to find a way to get through it.''

PENNIES FROM HEAVEN (OR JARS)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good news for merchants in southeastern Missouri: the Great Cape
Girardeau Penny Shortage is over.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the outlook was grim. Penny supplies were running
low at the Mercantile Bank, which provides coins to many local
retailers, including local Sam's Club and Wal-Mart stores. And the
bank was told that new shipments from the Federal Reserve Bank of
St. Louis could not be expected before June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that people tend to throw their pennies in a jar at home
rather than spend them, the Mercantile Bank's president, Lowell
Peterson, decided to lure some out of hiding by posting a note on
the bank's front door starting last Monday. It offered $1.10 for
every 100 pennies.
</P>
<P>
   Word got out _ in the local paper, then local television, then
national news wires _ and soon set off ``a phenomenal nationwide
outpouring of copper,'' Peterson said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy called wanting to drive up 700 miles from Louisiana with
$1,000 worth,'' he said. ``We heard from a grade school in
Pennsylvania, from a radio station in Spokane.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first few hours, local people brought in more pennies
than the bank knew what to do with, so Peterson took down the note
and spent the rest of the week politely disappointing out-of-town
callers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crisis averted,'' he said.

SALAD IN A CUP MAY SHAKE UP FAST-FOOD WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ McDonald's has come up with something new for a
car's cup holder: tossed salads.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-food giant is selling McSalad Shakers, a 21 oz.
salad-in-a-cup, in Los Angeles-area restaurants in a test run that
began last week. Customers buying McSalads just pour dressing over
their salad, pop the domed lid onto the clear plastic cup, and do
the James Bond thing _ shake it, don't stir.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a portable tossed salad, with the dressing
distributed across the salad and coating the sides of the cup. It's
served with a longer-than-usual plastic fork.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cup itself fits into most cup holders in the car,'' said
Lisa Dellerson, regional marketing supervisor at McDonald's Corp.'s
San Diego office. ``You hit the brake and you don't have salad and
packaging flying around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolution in salads.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers can choose between a garden, chef, or chicken Caesar
McSalad Shaker. Dressings are Caesar, ranch, light vinaigrette,
light French, Thousand Island, and honey mustard. Prices range from
$1.89 to $2.59.
</P>
<P>
   Oakbrook, Ill.-based McDonald's Corp. also is selling the salad
in a test run in Salt Lake City; Columbus, Ohio; and
Raleigh-Durham, N.C. Some of the cities have had the product for as
long as two months, Dellerson said.
</P>
<P>
   Though in the testing stage, the Shakers are likely to become a
permanent fixture on local menus, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very confident it will do well and we'll keep it, if
it's what our customers need and satisfies them _ and we believe it
definitely will,'' Dellerson said.
</P>
<P>
   The salads have been released without the usual McDonald's
fanfare, so far. The only notice of their availability are small
signs and a display bin inside each store.
</P>
<P>
   But an advertising blitz is scheduled to start May 28. and all
600 or so Los Angeles-area McDonald's will be equipped to prepare
and sell the new salads, Dellerson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles region, which includes parts of Ventura and
Orange counties, was an ideal testing ground for the new product
for several reasons, according to Dellerson.
</P>
<P>
   First, Southern California practically invented the healthy
lifestyle. And the automobile craze. Plus, Angelenos eat out
frequently and are looking for dining options, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a diverse customer base here and we're pretty
confident that Southern California is a good salad market,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Miller, a spokeswoman for Miami-based Burger King Corp.,
said the company does not comment on competitors' products.
</P>
<P>
   However, she did say that the Burger King chain for several
years had required that all its restaurants carry salads.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, the chain left it up to local restaurants to
decide whether to carry the product when it became apparent that
salads didn't sell well in every market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had spot success in some markets that performed very
well,'' she said. ``And in some, consumers didn't make a special
trip for the salads.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McSalad Shakers are selling quite well at the five
Los Angeles-area franchises that Keith Lopaty owns and operates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably selling six times what we were selling of the
old salads, and this is without any type of advertising,'' Lopaty
said. ``They're very tasty and there's a lot of different
ingredients that go into the chef salad and garden salad that we
weren't putting in the old chef salad and garden salad.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the McSalad should appeal to the parent who
takes a youngster in for a Happy Meal but who might not otherwise
eat at McDonald's, Lopaty said.
</P>
<P>
   And they're perfect for the on-the-go diner, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cup allows the salad to be totally portable,'' Lopaty
said. ``It's as easy to walk around with as a drink.''
</P>
<P>
   The salads attracted the attention _ and curiosity _ of Jack
Dennison, a West Hills resident who dropped by a Woodland Hills
McDonald's on Thursday with his wife, Rosemary, for a burger and
soda.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he wandered over to the glass case sitting on the
counter containing the freshly mixed salads.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you eat it?'' he asked, examining the long cups.
</P>
<P>
   After being assured that the longer forks reach all the way to
the bottom of the cup, Dennison said he would have bought one had
he only spotted them before he ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Dennison immediately recognized how the McSalad could
appeal to the harried, hungry commuter. ``It makes it easier when
you're in a car.''

Earlier this month, federal mediators declared an impasse between

off'' period that expires at midnight June 10. If TWA and the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers

BORROWING SENATE STRATEGY, HOUSE DEMOCRATS PRESS FOR GUN-CONTROL
MEASURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fresh from their victory on gun control in the
Senate, Democrats on Friday trained their attention and oratory on
the House, calling for a gun-control vote within the next week and
lambasting Republican leaders for laying out a less immediate
course.
</P>
<P>
   In making that demand, House Democrats were plucking a page from
the play book of their Senate counterparts, who greeted every
Republican concession on gun control over the past two weeks with
the charge that it was too little, too late and still out of step
with public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, who had promised on Thursday to allow a vote
on gun-control measures by the middle of June, accused Democrats of
engaging in political theatrics. But even as the two sides sniped
at each other about timing, they agreed that the House would
probably pass at least a few new restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be some aspects of what the House does
which will include making it more difficult for teenage kids to get
ahold of guns,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, the Republican
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on crime.
McCollum's juvenile crime bill would be the likely vehicle for
those measures.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen House Democrats met with President Clinton at the White
House Friday afternoon to plot their strategy for making sure the
measures succeed. The plan, they said, was to use whatever bully
pulpit they had to persuade Republican leaders to act now, before
conservatives in the party or gun lobbyists disrupted the momentum
of events in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make our voices heard every day,'' said Rep.
Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y., after leaving the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lowey, who is expected to run for the Senate next year if
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton does not, added, ``I wonder if
all those people afraid to send their kids to school want to see us
debate this issue for the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Republican leaders could bring the bill passed by the
Senate to the floor immediately, it would be highly unusual.
Instead, they intend to let a similar House bill proceed through a
House committee and then come to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The pledge by Republican leaders to let a debate on gun control
occur indicated an unequivocal alteration in the political climate,
just as the bill passed by the Senate on Thursday night had.
</P>
<P>
   That legislation, approved by a vote of 73 to 25, contained an
array of new regulations, such as a requirement that licensed gun
dealers include child safety devices with every handgun they sell,
restrictions on the possession of semi-automatic assault rifles by
those under 18, mandatory background checks on all buyers at gun
shows and a ban on the import of high-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   None of those measures represented monumental shifts in public
policy. But, taken together, they were arguably gun control
advocates' biggest victory in Congress in half a decade.
</P>
<P>
   If the House passes similar measures as part of its own juvenile
crime legislation, the House and Senate bills would then go to a
conference committee to reconcile any differences. A final vote
would be held before sending the measure to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Already, House Republicans have signaled more receptiveness to
gun control, though they have also exhibited a nervousness about
the debate being forced on them too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, as the Senate was passing its legislation, both the
House Appropriations and Judiciary committees postponed hearings to
finalize two separate bills after Democrats threatened to try to
attach gun-control amendments. One of those bills was McCollum's,
which Republicans had been insisting was not an appropriate vehicle
for gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, and the Democratic
minority leader, Richard Gephardt of Missouri, met Thursday
afternoon to decide how and when to deal with the gun-control
measures the Senate had passed.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said that the measures could indeed fold into McCollum's
bill and suggested a vote in the middle of June. But when Gephardt
presented that plan to fellow Democrats a few hours later, many of
them pronounced it unacceptable. Gephardt then appeared on the
House floor and called for a vote next week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom Delay, R-Texas, released a statement
Friday denouncing Gephardt's speech, which Delay said contradicted
the satisfaction that Gephardt had expressed with Hastert's
timetable in a meeting with Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all quite surprised that Gephardt did not stick to our
agreement,'' Delay said, adding that Gephardt must not have been
able to sway other Democrats to his viewpoint. ``It is troubling to
witness that Gephardt seemingly does not have the confidence and
trust of his caucus.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sue Harvey, a spokeswoman for Gephardt, said Friday that he
had made no agreement before consulting other House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic aides conceded that there was indeed a rift
among House Democrats in terms of strategy, with some finding
Hastert's timetable acceptable and others intent on rejecting it.
Technically, the Democrats are virtually powerless to force a vote.
</P>
<P>
   A crime subcommittee hearing on gun-control amendments to
McCollum's bill is scheduled for Thursday; in two weeks, the full
House Judiciary Committee is expected to finalize and vote on that
bill.
</P>
<P>
   It could wind up including one gun-control measure _ a raise, to
21 from 18, in the minimum age for the legal purchase and
possession of a handgun _ that is not in the Senate bill. Early
this week, Hastert announced support for raising the age for
purchases, but not possession.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who spent 18 years in the House,
said Friday that gun control is usually a tougher sell there. But,
he said, ``The actual measures we passed in the Senate were modest,
and there has now been a change in public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., one of the House's staunchest
opponents of gun control, agreed with the second half of Schumer's
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Barr added, ``There will be some members who will be swayed by
the president's browbeating and Mr. Gephardt stamping his feet.''

 &HT;    Mustang not stuck in sand
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Maybe the folks at Ford who created the '99 Mustang
have been out in the sun too long, perhaps testing their
convertible. Or maybe they're so caught up in the ongoing
fascination with things Egyptian that they really think it makes
sense to say that the new 'Stang is visually comparable to a
pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Those Egyptian pyramids, they should remember, have been stuck,
immovable and immutable, in the sand for millennia. They hardly
invite Ford design chief Doug Gaffka's comment that the Mustang
design is ``based on the most stable geometric form _ the
pyramid.''
</P>
<P>
   Stable? At speed, that's a good thing, and the new Mustang is
just that. But enthusiasts also want a Mustang that comes off the
line spinning its tires and feeling akin to a horse that has taken
the bit in its mouth and is going to break away unless its driver
really takes control.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, the new Mustang can do that _ sensibly and with an
impressive degree of built-in safety. There's a tweaked 4.6-liter
V-8 engine that, mated with a five-speed manual transmission, can
bolt off the line, and, for control and safety, there's power
anti-lock disc brakes and a switchable traction control.
</P>
<P>
   ``More controlled and comfortable, but certainly not hobbled,''
says AutoWeek. ``Meaner, faster, edgier,'' says Motor Trend. Solid
_ OK, stable _ and sometimes sluggish in handling and acceleration,
a test drive reveals.
</P>
<P>
   But the bright-yellow test car, a 3,100-pound GT coupe totaling
$24,495, was clearly hobbled by its four-speed automatic. Even with
the engine working toward its maximums of 260 horsepower at 5,240
rpm and 300 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm, the GT was slow on
starts.
</P>
<P>
   But get it up to expressway speed, and the Mustang is nicely
responsive with power for passing and a striking level of ride
comfort. The steering provided a bit of feel at center and good
inputs in turns. But that long front end feels heavy and wants to
push out instead of lithely turning in. (Time for throttle-steer,
the buff books recommend, and while goosing the gas and swinging
out the rear end is good on test tracks, it isn't acceptable on
highways.)
</P>
<P>
   The power anti-lock disc brakes are another strong feature, with
good pedal feel and serious stopping capability (60 mph to zero in
about 125 feet). That area of performance, along with the
bump-smoothing nature of a suspension compromised between handling
and ride, is notably improved.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively unchanged interior has supportive, easily
adjusted front seats with a rear for kids or cargo. The
instrumentation and controls, like the V-8 engine, are basic and
work well.
</P>
<P>
   As for the looks, it's a matter of personal preference, although
few are likely to be impressed by the Mustang's faux air scoops.
And while the test GT drew admiring comments and nods of approval,
absolutely no one likened it to a pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Ford Mustang GT rear-drive coupe
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $24,495 (base price: $20,870)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual air bags, power anti-lock disc brakes,
optional traction control ($230)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 4.6-liter V-8 engine (260 horsepower), optional
four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive lockout ($815)
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: upgraded stereo system, $395;
17-inch forged aluminum wheels with 245/45ZR17 tires, $500; package
with power driver's seat, cruise control, rear defroster, front
floor mats, $550; leather interior, $500; lighted visor mirrors,
$95; cigarette lighter and ashtray, $15
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 17 mpg regular unleaded city, 27 mpg highway

CELLUCI NOD TOWARD GEORGES BANK ENERGY DRILLING DRAWS FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Breaking ranks with other Massachusetts politicians on
a volatile international issue, Governor Paul Cellucci has
cautiously endorsed oil and gas exploration on the Canadian side of
the Georges Bank fishing ground, drawing criticism from fishermen
and environmentalists on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian government, under pressure from major oil
companies, is considering reopening its side of Georges Bank in
January 2000 after a 10-year moratorium. Although the US side would
remain closed, opponents say a spill on the Canadian side could be
swept by the currents to US fishing grounds.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci, in Nova Scotia last week on a trade mission, told
newspaper editors there that he would support lifting Canada's
moratorium on oil and gas exploration as long as there were enough
environmental safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are resources there, I think we would want to get
those resources,'' Cellucci told the Halifax Herald.
</P>
<P>
   The comment marked Cellucci's second controversial insertion
into Canadian affairs. Last year, many Canadians were upset at
remarks that seemed to support independence for Quebec. Cellucci
later said he was only expressing ``enthusiasm'' for continued
business dealings with the province.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of oil and gas exploration on Georges Bank had hoped
that the newspaper account was wrong, but Cellucci's aides
confirmed this week that the governor supports a re-evaluation of
the safety of oil and gas drilling in one of the world's richest
fishing grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that there are significant resources that could
have a significant impact on energy costs in Massachusetts, which
are among the highest in the nation,'' spokeswoman Ilene Hoffer
said. ``They are at the same time contained within a fragile
ecosystem. He wants to look at whether or not it is possible to
harness those resources without disturbing that ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's remarks stunned critics of oil and gas exploration,
which came as Massachusetts members of Congress increased efforts
to block exploration. US Representative William Delahunt, for
instance, was scheduled to be in Montreal Saturday to lobby members
of parliament to keep the bank closed. In fact, Cellucci's own
representative to the Canadian hearings last winter warned that the
potential risks of exploration might outweigh the regional
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a shock and disappointment,'' said Angela
Sanfilippo, president of the Gloucester Fishermen's Wives
Association. ``After talking with the people in Canada . . . and
guaranteeing to them that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was
behind them, we don't know what to say to those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Wells, a former member of Canada's Parliament who is
directing much of the opposition to lifting the moratorium, said
Cellucci had given comfort to oil companies by showing division
among Massachusetts officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major, major issue up here and, as soon as he breathes
that, he's totally against everything coming out of New England,''
said Wells, coordinator of NORIGS 2000, a coalition of fishing,
environmental, and municipal groups that opposes oil and gas
exploration on Georges Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Shelley of the Conservation Law Foundation, a Boston-based
group that has fought oil and gas drilling on Georges Bank since
1977, said Cellucci seems to be reversing a Massachusetts position
held for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden for the governor of the state to come out,
without any consultation, and undercut a pretty clear understanding
of what the state's position was, and to do it in a Halifax
newspaper, that's not how I'd like to hear this,'' Shelley said.
</P>
<P>
   Georges Bank, a vast underwater plateau 100 miles off the coast
of New England and Nova Scotia, was long a mainstay of the region's
economy, producing abundant cod, haddock, and other catches until
fishing pressure caused a collapse in the early 1990s. The
Canadians control less than a third of the bank, but it includes
vital cod spawning areas.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and gas companies covet Georges Bank for the deposits
beneath the seabed. Three energy companies _ Chevron, Amoco, and
Texaco _ all have proposed drilling in a fingertip of the bank off
the coast of Nova Scotia, according to the Canadian Association of
Petroleum Producers.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci told Halifax Herald editors that he hoped ``a middle
ground could be found'' between the fishing and energy interests.
He said he was impressed with the environmental safeguards at a new
Nova Scotia gas drilling project outside of Georges Bank. If
similar steps were followed on the bank, he said, oil and gas
drilling could go forward.
</P>
<P>
   That view contrasts with the Massachusetts testimony in Nova
Scotia last winter. Peg Brady, director of the state office of
Coastal Zone Management, urged federal and provincial regulators to
consider extending the oil and gas moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our opinion that the potential risks of lifting the
moratorium to oil and gas exploration may outweigh the regional
benefits and jeopardize the restoration efforts now under way,''
Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, Hoffer said Cellucci was not changing state
policy, noting that Brady's testimony left the door open for oil
and gas drilling at some point. She said more study would have to
be done before Cellucci could say conclusively that the bank could
sustain oil and gas drilling.
</P>
<P>
   In response, representatives of the Massachusetts Fishermen's
Partnership, a large fishing group that opposes oil and gas
drilling on Georges Bank, sent a letter to Cellucci's top
environmental official asking for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very confused by his comments,'' said David Lincoln of
the partnership. ``We are quite concerned that he seems to be
ignoring all of the efforts that have been made to protect Georges
Bank over the last 20 years.''

U.S. EASES CURB ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Ill., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite intense interest in the medical benefits of
marijuana, few scientists are studying it, because the government
has always required that such work be paid for by scarce grant
money from the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   That changed Friday when the Clinton administration eased the
requirement, announcing that it would sell government-grown
marijuana to privately-funded scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was issued as a regulation by the National
Institute on Drug Abuse and is supported by General Barry
McCaffrey, who as director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy has been the administration's most ardent opponent of the
legalization of medical marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, the problem was if you wanted marijuana, you had to
not only show that it was high-quality research, you had to show
that it was more important than other competing applications for
NIH funding,'' said Chuck Blanchard, chief counsel for McCaffrey's
office. ``Now, as long as you are willing to show that it is
high-quality research and also provide your own funding, you can
have access to medical marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the ruling, marijuana studies will still be reviewed for
their scientific merit, but it will become easier for state and
local governments to pay for the research. Experts and government
officials hope the studies could some day lead to the development
of a new delivery system for marijuana, such as an inhaler, that
would enable patients to benefit from its active ingredients
without suffering the toxic effects of the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials already say they hope to take advantage of the
new rule. ``This news today gives us great hope,'' said Mike Nevin,
a member of the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors. About a year
ago, he said, his board allocated $500,000 for studies of marijuana
in cancer and AIDS patients. ``We are hoping the federal government
will grant us the ability to do this study,'' he said, ''and we are
willing to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the National Institute on Drug Abuse has paid a
farmer at the University of Mississippi to grow marijuana for
research, primarily studies on addiction. The government also
provides the drug to eight patients under a ``compassionate use''
program authorized by the Food and Drug Administration, but that
program has been closed to new participants since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as interest grew in using marijuana as a
medicine, scientists have tried, with limited success, to persuade
the National Institutes of Health to pay for the studies. Only
three studies have been approved so far; among them is one being
conducted by Dr. Donald Abrams of the University of California at
San Francisco, who said it took him five years to obtain approval
to study marijuana in AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   And even then, Abrams had to mask his true research interest;
although he wanted to examine the effects of marijuana on the
weight loss associated with AIDS, he pitched the study as one that
would look at the potentially toxic interactions between marijuana
and standard AIDS medications. ``We designed a study that would
appeal to the group of people funding the grant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decision comes two months after an exhaustive study by
the Institute of Medicine, a branch of the National Academy of
Sciences, concluded that the active ingredients in marijuana,
called cannabinoids, appear useful for treating pain, nausea and
the severe weight loss associated with AIDS. Two years ago, a
review by NIH officials reached a similar conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had several pretty distinguished groups now say that
cannabinoids, not smoked marijuana, may have some real potential
medical usage,'' said Dr. Steven Gust, special assistant to the
director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. ``This is a first
step towards ultimately developing purified forms of cannabinoids
that may be FDA-approvable.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is only one cannabinoid-based drug on the market,
Marinol, manufactured by Unimed Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Buffalo
Grove, Ill. But some patients complain that the Marinol pills are
too potent, leading researchers to theorize that an inhaler,
similar to those used by asthma patients, might be a more effective
form of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that such a method might take years to develop, the
Institute of Medicine report recommended that patients who did not
respond to other therapy be permitted to smoke marijuana. But the
regulation issued Friday said the government does not intend to
approve ``single-patient requests for marijuana,'' because they do
not ``produce use useful scientific information.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for legalizing marijuana as medicine had both praise
and criticism for Friday's decision. ``It is a tiny step forward,
but far too tiny,'' said Ethan Nadelmann, director of the
Lindesmith Center, which backed initiatives in California and
Arizona to make marijuana legal for medical use. ``It's an implicit
acknowledgement that the government has blocked research into
medical marijuana for explicitly political reasons for the last two
decades.''

BULLOCK SPEAKS OUT ON HATE-CRIMES BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sitting on the sidelines of state government for
the first time in decades, former Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock said Friday
he's not sure he would have resorted to his legendary bullying
tactics on hate crimes were he still running the show in the Texas
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polls showed that the majority of Texans did favor the
bill,'' Bullock said Friday, ``And so many other states have one.
But I must admit that I have wondered from time to time whether
(hate-crimes legislation) was needed, because murder is murder, and
rape is rape ... whether it's a Chinese woman or a white woman.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he never read the bill that the Texas House passed,
which would have expanded the existing hate-crimes law to enumerate
specific groups that would have garnered extra protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it would have had to have been crafted very cleverly to
not leave one person out'' for him to have let the bill through
under his watch.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush and Bullock's successor, Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry, have been criticized by proponents of the legislation for
failing to show leadership in getting a compromise through the
Senate this session.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, who retired last December after eight years as
lieutenant governor and 16 years as state comptroller, was known
for his mercurial personality and his frequent strong-arm tactics _
even to the point of telling senators how they were to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I twist an arm when I needed to?'' Bullock said about his
style. ``Hell yes, I did. If there was a school bill I needed to
pass, I'd break an arm if I had to. ... Would I kick somebody in
the seat of the pants? Hell yes, I would _ all the way over to the
Capitol.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry, the first Republican to serve in that post since
Reconstruction, has a different style, and lawmakers have been
quick to smile about the differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Rick's style to dictate as Bullock would have on what
to do,'' said Democrat Ken Armbrister of Victoria, who served under
Bullock and Bullock's predecessor, Bill Hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bullock was an expediter,'' Armbrister added. ``And Rick likes
to see coalitions built. He recognizes the merits of what you're
trying to do.''

MICROSOFT TRIES TO USE AOL EXAMPLES TO REBUT ANTITRUST CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Midway through a deposition Friday, American Online
chairman Stephen Case looked quizzically at the Microsoft lawyer
who was questioning him and asked, ``Did I wander into the wrong
room?''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. deposed Case on Friday morning as part the
company's preparations for the rebuttal phase of the antitrust
trial against the software giant, which is scheduled to resume June
1 after a three-month recess. Many of the questions centered around
America Online's Internet business strategy, leading Case to wonder
aloud what on earth any of it had to do with the anticompetitive
charges against Microsoft that are at issue in the case.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, he said, has no intention of competing with
Microsoft's core business in personal-computer operating systems.
Case also denied, in answer to a question, that America Online
planned to build and sell an ``AOL PC'' that would compete with
computers running the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft lawyers tried to argue that some of America
Online's plans would in fact threaten parts of Microsoft's
business. This was intended to bolster the company's argument that
America Online's purchase of Netscape Communications Corp.
undermined the government's case by demonstrating a robust
competitive environment in the personal computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at one point Microsoft's lead trial lawyer, John
Warden, asked Case about America Online's recent purchase of an
online calendar and personal organizer service. Case said he hoped
that would be a popular feature with his customers. Later, a
Microsoft lawyer noted that Microsoft sells scheduling software.
</P>
<P>
   The government, he noted, had argued earlier in the trial about
how hard it was to enter the software business without writing
programs for Windows. ``But what happens to this when the residence
of this software shifts from the machine to the Web, with no
connection to an operating system?''
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers called all of this irrelevant. The case, said
David Boies, the lead government lawyer, was really ``about the
monopoly power Microsoft exercises over PC operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing AOL has done threatens that power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also pushed Case to offer support for Microsoft's
assertion that America Online had plotted with the government to
conceal the company's planned purchase of Netscape until AOL and
Netscape executives had finished testifying at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Case called that allegation ``ridiculous,'' though he did
acknowledge that an AOL lawyer had advised Boies in October that
the online service was involved in sensitive business discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It struck me as a reasonable thing to do,'' Case said. ``It
was a complicated three-ring circus to coordinate. We didn't want
any premature disclosure to leak out'' as a result of an
inadvertent question posed by Boies.
</P>
<P>
   Case insisted that the lawyer did not elaborate and said Justice
Department lawyers seemed genuinely surprised when they were
formally told of the deal in late November.
</P>
<P>
   But the Microsoft lawyer said he found it curious that
government lawyers never tried to find out what the secret talks
were about, since executives from both companies were testifying as
government witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Boies noted that Microsoft's lawyers could have asked their own
questions on this subject when an America Online executive was on
the stand and the courtroom was closed for discussion of sensitive
business matters. ``They certainly knew about this at the time,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Boies added, all of this is simply ``a sideshow, an
effort to deflect attention from the central issues in the case.''
That comment is in line with the general government view that
Microsoft's apparent line of argument for the rebuttal case is far
afield from the principal issues of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's lawyers seem particularly confident about their
rebuttal case and say they have acquired a valuable trove of
documents from America Online and Netscape that they will use to
good effect when the trial resumes.

<P>
   James W. Paulsen, the chief investment officer at Wells Capital
Management in Minneapolis, says he is only tilting. Marshall Acuff,
the equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, is just moving at
the margin. And Jeffrey M. Applegate, the chief United States
strategist at Lehman Brothers, is only trimming his expectations
for returns.
</P>
<P>
   These three strategists and others all had to review their
outlooks last week to accommodate the fact that the Federal Reserve
is now leaning toward raising its short-term interest rate target,
the federal funds rate.
</P>
<P>
   While no one knows when, or even if, the Fed will raise rates,
the policy makers have made it clear that if inflation does tick
up, they will move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But according to these strategists, this bias toward higher
interest rates will not force them to make big changes in what they
have been doing.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the rally does not run wild, these analysts still expect
stocks to rise. Paulsen says the bond market will rally. Applegate
is betting that the Fed will not increase rates to slow growth and
curb inflation. Paulsen doesn't think the Fed will have to raise
rates _ though he says it is still a possibility. Acuff thinks any
rate increase will be modest.
</P>
<P>
   Paulsen has shifted his asset allocation slightly, to benefit
from the bond rally he expects when it becomes clear that inflation
will not get out of hand. So he is cutting his allocation to stocks
to 60 percent, from 70 percent, while raising bonds to 40 percent,
from 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not so negative on stocks,'' he said, explaining this
shift. ``I just think that bonds might meet them tick for tick.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also suggesting a small shift in the composition of stock
portfolios. He thinks economic growth will slow, partly because of
the rise in oil prices, the slower growth in real wages and the
slump in mortgage refinancings. All three will curb consumer
spending, which has been the driving force of the economy's still
rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   For Paulsen, a slowdown makes growth stocks, especially the
big-name companies that can produce solid earnings in a weaker
economy, attractive again. He also likes financial stocks, which
will benefit from declining market rates, and consumer staples,
which also do well in a slower-growth environment.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean he is dumping all his cyclical stocks,
which have done very well this year. ``I believe you should tilt in
the direction you think the market is going,'' Paulsen said. ``But
I am not selling all my cyclicals. I known I can be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Applegate is also shifting out of cyclicals and into growth
stocks. ``The cyclical trade has come and gone,'' he said. But he
is holding his asset allocation at 80 percent stocks and 20 percent
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rise in interest rates has curbed the expansion in
valuations that would help stocks move higher, he said, but
corporate earnings forecasts are improving. His firm just raised
its 1999 operating earnings forecast to 10 percent, from 8 percent.
His year-end target for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index is
unchanged at 1,450, 9 percent above Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   And Applegate would not think of trying to shift out of stocks
to sidestep a slump. He did not even do that last year, when the
major market indexes plunged 19 percent or more, because he worried
that he would not get back in quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Why so sanguine? Because there is confidence that the Fed will
not let inflation get out of hand, which means that the long-term
still looks fine. And because the investing environment had, in
fact, changed long before the Fed announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had worried most of this year about a Fed rate
increase because the economy refused to slow down. The jump in
long-term interest rates by a percentage point, to 5.92 percent
since December, was a result.
</P>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at Goldman, Sachs,
said, ``If you have been an investor paying attention, there was no
major news this week and the response of the markets says that.''
The Dow lost just 0.77 percent, while bonds rallied, with long-term
yields falling to 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What investors should focus on, she added, is the positive side
of the Fed announcement. As she phrased it, the Fed said: ``Look
folks, our economy is strong and the rest of the world is out of
danger.''

COLUMBINE COMMUNITY STRUGGLES TO RECLAIM ITS PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By SARA RIMER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ As graduation at Columbine High School
approached, Sara Martin, a senior and one of the commencement
speakers, said, ``I hope it's not going to be televised.'' Her
speech was personal. ``I don't want to be saying it to people in
Chicago. I want to be saying it to people in the front row and the
back row. There just needs to be a time when we can be ourselves
again.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But graduation will be broadcast live on Saturday, by CNN, as
has almost everything to do with the school since Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold began shooting classmates on April 20 and the first
news helicopters hovered overhead, showing students running and
diving for safety.
</P>
<P>
   As Columbine approaches the end of the school year, the
community finds itself struggling not only with its tragedy, but
also with how to reclaim its privacy. For on April 20 Columbine was
invaded not just by two troubled students, but also by nearly 1,000
journalist from around the world, so many that they quickly swamped
Denver's telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   In a drill made all too familiar by previous school shootings,
the news media not only set about reporting what had happened, but
also asking the victims, witnesses and their families to help
explain why. Columbine was a public tragedy, and there were
expectations: that those in its grip would open their lives and
talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   The expectations were not solely those of the news media. In
many cases they were shared by Columbine students and their
families, some grateful that people wanted to share their anguish,
others feeling their pain validated by the nation's attention,
still others feeling an obligation to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers found eager listeners, whether they were talking
through their own fears or praising slain friends. They also met
talk-show bookers, supermarket tabloids willing to pay the gunmen's
friends $10,000 for their ``personal stories,'' reporters offering
$500 for their yearbooks.
</P>
<P>
   The media outlets included networks, news magazines and large
newspapers (The New York Times sent several reporters), Rolling
Stone, ``Entertainment Tonight'' and MTV, small papers from other
states looking for ways Littleton was like home, media from Europe
and Asia reporting what the violence said about the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For residents who had been riveted to their own televisions
during other people's disasters _ the school shootings at
Jonesboro, Ark., the Oklahoma City bombing _ it was an eerie
reversal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know how those poor people in Oklahoma felt,'' said Lee
Andres, the high school's assistant vocal director. ``It's so weird
and surreal. You can't believe it's your school.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbine was a television event from the beginning; some
students trapped inside the school during the shooting called
television stations on their cellular phones. And from the
beginning that had positive and negative aspects for the
participants.
</P>
<P>
   As news helicopters hovered overhead, Steve Broder, a sophomore,
was in a room where students were trying to save the life of a
wounded science teacher, Dave Sanders. The helicopters, he said,
added to the general terror, because the students feared they would
immediately show any ``help'' signs they put up on windows _ and
the gunmen might be watching the televisions in classrooms
throughout the school.
</P>
<P>
   But across the community, parents and relatives depended on
television for information. Abby Chism, a junior at another high
school whose sister was a Columbine freshman, said she was grateful
for the television cameras, at least at first. ``I saw Amber
running out of the school on TV,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The needs of the community and the media began colliding in the
first hours. Gail Schneider, a mother who waited four and a half
hours before being reunited with her daughter, recalled leaving the
meeting place.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we were leaving, this lady said, `Ma'am, ma'am, I'm on
deadline, I need a few comments,' '' she said. ``I said, `I've been
waiting four and a half hours. There are no comments.' ''
</P>
<P>
   By the next morning, Clement Park, next to the high school, had
become a gathering spot for students. Because of that it was also
media headquarters. Satellite trucks were parked in rows, and
reporters and photographers roamed in search of interviews and
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers grieving mingled bizarrely with journalists working.
Here and there ranks of photographers focusing on one group of
crying students, or 8 or 10 reporters surrounded a single student.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for the students and their families, there was something
familiar as well as surreal about the scene. And some welcomed the
opportunity to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe they were there,'' Kevin Koeniger, a
junior, said of the network anchormen at the park. ``Dan Rather
doesn't really leave the studio unless something huge happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Koeniger said he was pleased that Rather wanted to interview
him. ``He was really cool,'' he said. ``He said he was sorry for
what happened. He really cared. I wanted to talk. I wanted to tell
the story of what happened to people who cared.''
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship between the teen-agers and the media was
complicated. ``Some people didn't give much sympathy,'' Mr.
Koeniger said. ``They just started talking. They didn't identify
themselves. They didn't even ask you if you want to be
interviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that news coverage swelled sympathy for the
school and helped make Clement Park a memorial, it also turned
ordinary hopes and dreams upside down for many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted Columbine to be famous,'' said Andres, the
choir assistant, who graduated from the school in 1980 and whose
father is the chairman of the music department.
</P>
<P>
   Famous for what?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, anything, I just wanted it to be famous for
something good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of great kids. You want to be known. You don't
want anyone to think of it as a symbol of tragedy and sadness.
That's just a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the sort of celebrity many wanted. Sara Martin, the
senior speaker, was interviewed by Time. ``At first I thought,
`This is really cool, I'm going to be in Time.' '' she said. ``Then
I realized, `I'm going to be in Time because they shot my
friends.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the students were in charge. Devon Adams, a friend
of Dylan Klebold, said she did interviews with Time, The New York
Times and CNN because she thought they were reputable and she
wanted to get out her message: Columbine was a good school. She did
not talk about Klebold, she said, because that would not have been
right.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adams said she turned down scores of other requests,
including one by the ``Today'' show. Her mother, Bee Adams, an
artist, admitted to a twinge of disappointment over that decision.
``She's more mature than I am,'' Mrs. Adams said. ``I would be
swayed by the `Today' show.''
</P>
<P>
   As reporters knocked on front doors and appeared at funeral
services, and anyone thought to know anything about the gunmen was
besieged by phone, a backlash set in. Families posted ``No Media''
signs on front doors, left ``No Media'' messages on their answering
machines, changed phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   By then, familiarity was teaching other lessons. Some people
were upset at inaccuracies, misspelled names or wrong ages of their
friends. Many thought that the Columbine High School they read and
heard about, as the media tried to explain the shootings, was not
the school they knew.
</P>
<P>
   Alisha Basore, a senior whose close friend Rachel Scott was
murdered, had gone on ``Larry King Live'' and participated in a CNN
town meeting and had been pleased with the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I got to reach a lot of people,'' she said. ``I
wanted to talk about the experience of it, the stupidity of it, the
shock of it. I got to tell everyone how I felt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miss Basore was furious when she encountered cameras at Miss
Scott's funeral. ``My best friend was killed,'' she said. ``It's
not a media event.''
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the school year approaching, the reporters began
returning. There was so much media interest in the Columbine
graduation that school officials decided to allow pool coverage,
including CNN, according to a district spokeswoman, Marilyn
Saltzman.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the television cameras, however, and the moment of
silence that will be observed for Lauren Townsend and Isiah Shoels,
the two seniors who were slain by the gunmen, and for Sanders, the
science teacher, the seniors are determined that their graduation
be a celebration, not another memorial. They have turned down
offers from Chuck Norris and Bill Cosby, among others, to speak at
graduation. They also turned down an offer from Hootie and the
Blowfish to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Columbine concert choir will sing, as it does every
year, and the speakers, according to tradition, will be two
seniors, Sara Martin and Jennifer Wallick.

LUNG DISEASE RESEARCHER SAYS HE MAY QUIT FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. David Kern of Brown University, a hero among occupational
health specialists for publishing his discovery of a new workplace
lung disease despite efforts to muzzle him, now says he will
probably leave the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be a martyr. I have family responsibilities,''
Kern said Friday while he was in Boston attending a meeting on
threats to academic freedom sponsored by the American Association
of University Professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I leave the field, it suggests we lost in more ways than
one,'' Kern said. ``It's an ongoing injury to the workers of Rhode
Island and the faculty of Brown University. So it's with great
angst that I face this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Kern has been engaged in a bitter, three-year battle over his
right to publish data on a new lung disease over the objections of
a Pawtucket, R.I. textile company, Microfibres Inc., and his
employer, Memorial Hospital of Pawtucket. Nine cases of ``flock
workers' lung'' have been diagnosed among workers at the Pawtucket
plant, and federal investigators last year faulted Microfibres on
workplace safety.
</P>
<P>
   When Kern gave a public presentation of his findings on
Microfibres workers in 1997, the hospital fired him from his job as
director of Rhode Island's only occupational health clinic, and
said it would not renew Kern's contract as a staff physician when
it expires next month.
</P>
<P>
   If Kern abandons occupational health, it will send ``a very
chilling message'' to others in the field and to young doctors who
might choose the specialty, said Dr. Barry Levy of Tufts University
Medical School, a leader in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at Dr. Kern's case, a young academic might say, `I'm
not going to risk my career and the well-being of my family,' ''
Levy said. ``Unless new policies arise out of this, it will signal
to other universities that when it's occupational health findings
vs. corporate interests, they can do the same thing Brown
University did.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy was referring to the university's refusal to support Kern
in his fight to keep his job at Brown-affiliated Memorial Hospital.
Brown officials said in mid-1997 that the hospital was within its
rights to terminate his contract.
</P>
<P>
   About 120 members of the Association of University Professors
are scheduled to debate Saturday a proposed position defending
academic freedom in medical schools. Mary Burgan, the association's
general secretary, said the statement will be put to a vote next
month at the group's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The association acts as a bargaining agent for about half its
44,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Burgan said the group decided to formulate a position on the
academic freedom of medical researchers largely in response to
Kern's case and several other recent instances in which scientists
faced severe pressures when they attempted to publish results that
corporate research sponsors wanted to suppress.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Olivieri of the University of Toronto was fired from
her job as director of a blood clinic at the Toronto Hospital for
Sick Children after she defied a drug company's order not to
disclose data on the safety and effectiveness of a drug it funded
her to study. She was later reinstated after intercession by
academic groups and leaders in her field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an isolated incident and neither is David
Kern's,'' Olivieri said. ``This is an ongoing scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto episode underscores ``just how badly things can go
wrong'' when corporate and academic interests collide, Dr. David G.
Nathan of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Dr. D.J. Weatherall
of the University of Oxford wrote recently in The Lancet, a British
journal.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan and Weatherall said the Olivieri case shows that medical
researchers ``must have the freedom'' to warn patients and other
scientists about deleterious effects of a drug or procedure. If a
company ``takes legal action or otherwise harasses a scientist,''
they added, the hospital or its associated university ``must
immediately offer its support.''
</P>
<P>
   Although occupational health leaders supported Kern, he said he
is disheartened by the response of many colleagues. ``There were
courageous folks who stood up for me, but most looked the other
way,'' he said. ``I'm mightily discouraged by the failure of the
community to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Association of University Professors did not come to Kern's
aid when he was struggling with Memorial Hospital and Brown
University, although the organization cites his case now. ``The
ball was dropped,'' Burgan acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   An effort is under way to secure state funding for a new,
independent occupational health clinic to replace the one that
Memorial Hospital closed, according to George Nee of the AFL-CIO of
Rhode Island. Dr. Michael Fine, who is involved with that effort,
said it might be hard to recruit a specialist to head that center
because ``the environment is quite poisoned.''

   FARMINGDALE, N.J. _ The municipal building in this central New
Jersey community is an old white clapboard house. The mayor is a
retired doctor who practiced here for 44 years and now walks to his
office each day, dressed casually.
</P>
<P>
   The children, who perform well above state averages on school
tests, ride bicycles along the sidewalk on Main Street, stopping at
the ice cream shop or convenience store. And the pharmacist, a
jocular Brooklyn transplant, knows his customers by ailment and
first name.
</P>
<P>
   But if this apple pie of a place sounds like some syrupy relic
of a bygone America, there is at least one thing that very much
connects this one-half-square-mile bucolic borough to the world
outside its boundaries: the New Jersey State Lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Although only 1,400 people live in Farmingdale, there are five
outlets that sell lottery tickets, amounting to one lottery outlet
for every 280 residents. And while lottery agents here do not ring
up nearly as much in sales as their counterparts in large cities
around the state, the lottery is just as prevalent in people's
lives.
</P>
<P>
   According to state lottery statistics, weekly per capita ticket
sales in Farmingdale are $6.92, compared with $3.92 statewide.
Lottery agents here point out that some tickets are sold to people
passing through or coming to Farmingdale but that many of their
customers are local residents.
</P>
<P>
   Solidly middle-class with professional and blue-collar workers
alike, Farmingdale is more than 95 percent white, has a median
household income of about $45,000, and is situated in Monmouth
County, a Republican stronghold. The mayor, Dr. Edward Schauer, who
describes himself as ``very conservative,'' believes that much of
the interest in the lottery in his town has to do with the economic
realities of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would presume that the well-to-do in this town gamble other
ways, but a lot of families have two people working,'' Schauer
said. ``I think those people play because they don't know of any
other way to get a lot of money. I think if they didn't have to
worry about the next payment on the car or the mortgage, they'd be
less apt to gamble on the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to filling prescriptions, Farmingdale Pharmacy owner
Joseph Palumbo sells gifts, collectibles and lottery tickets. His
average weekly lottery sales total about $700, for which he earns 5
percent, or $35. But Palumbo is convinced that having the lottery
machine in the store helps him sell other merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got our regulars who play $10 or $15 a day,'' Palumbo
said. ``That can translate to sales of other merchandise for us.''
</P>
<P>
   One regular customer, Jim Karos, who works at the post office
across the street, comes in each day to buy instant tickets, and
daily pick-three and pick-four tickets. Twice a week, he pools his
money with 10 co-workers to play the Pick 6 game, and three times a
week he and 9 co-workers bet on the Pick 5 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work so I can buy lottery tickets,'' Karos half-joked while
recently buying his tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Karos, 54, decides what numbers to play by using things like the
postal meter totals for the day, or the total amount of express
mail sent out for the day.
</P>
<P>
   As Karos left the store, Palumbo said: ``This is serious for
him. It's important for him to see if he can make some money on the
lottery.''

WILLIAM ALFRED, PLAYWRIGHT AND HARVARD PROFESSOR, DIES AT 76  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.J.)   By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Alfred, the author of ``Hogan's Goat'' and other plays
and a longtime professor at Harvard University, died on Thursday at
his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Although Alfred had a distinguished career as an educator, it
was as a playwright that he achieved his greatest recognition.
``Hogan's Goat,'' a play in blank verse about the bitter political
maneuvering among Irish-Americans in Brooklyn in the late 19th
century, was a surprise success Off Broadway in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Opening at the American Place Theater, it was acclaimed by the
critics and ran for 607 performances. It established Alfred's
theatrical reputation and also introduced Faye Dunaway, who was
featured in the cast as the wife of Matthew Stanton (Ralph Waite),
the central character. ``Hogan's Goat'' propelled Ms. Dunaway's
movie career. She and Alfred became close friends and in 1982, as a
reigning Hollywood star, she returned to the theater in ``The Curse
of an Aching Heart,'' a play about Irish-Americans in the era after
``Hogan's Goat.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred began writing ``Hogan's Goat'' in 1956. Because of the
demands of his teaching career it was nine years before he finished
the play. Robert Lowell, a friend, recommended it to Wynn Handman,
the artistic director of the American Place Theater, which had
produced Lowell's ``Old Glory.'' Within a year ``Hogan's Goat''
opened. In 1971 a television version starring Ms. Dunaway, was
presented on Channel 13.
</P>
<P>
   The author wrote several other plays, and collaborated with
Albert Marre on ``Cry for Us All,'' a musical version of ``Hogan's
Goat'' (with a score by Mitch Leigh and lyrics by Alfred and
Phyllis Robinson), but none of them came close to equaling his
phenomenal initial success. Though theater-struck, he continued
teaching at Harvard, where he was one of the most popular
professors. ``The nice thing about a professor in the theater,''
Alfred once said, ``is that you can always disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Brooklyn in 1922. After serving in the Army
during World War II, he graduated from Brooklyn College and then
studied at Harvard, where he received a master's degree and a
doctorate. While at Harvard he took a course in creative writing
with Archibald MacLeish and began writing verse plays, starting
with ``Agamemnon,'' which was published in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   As a faculty member he was a medievalist, specializing in early
English literature. His most celebrated course was a seminar on
``Beowulf.'' He also taught drama, playwriting and poetry at
Harvard. Among the students he trained were Tommy Lee Jones,
Stockard Channing and John Lithgow.
</P>
<P>
   His quiet academic life was suddenly interrupted by ``Hogan's
Goat.'' In the play, he looked back on Irish immigrants and their
early domination of New York politics. A highly poetic though
realistic drama, it was filled with back room and barroom
atmosphere, focusing on Matthew Stanton, who wants to unseat the
corrupt mayor of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering his difficult voyage to America, Stanton says,  &QL; 
I crossed in mid-December: seven weeks
</P>
<P>
   Of driving rain that kept the hatches battened
</P>
<P>
   In a hold so low of beam a man my height
</P>
<P>
   Could never lift his head. And I couldn't wash . . .
</P>
<P>
   I'd have died with shame, had I sailed here to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get power!'' he cries. ``Without it, there can be no decency,
no virtue and no grace. I have kept my vow. The mayor's chair is
mine but for the running.'' His wife is less enthusiastic about his
political campaign, and he is eventually brought down by the sins
of his own past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hogan's Goat'' was followed by ``Cry for Us All'' on Broadway
in 1970; ``Agamemnon,'' which had its premiere in 1972 at the
McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., and ``The Curse of an Aching
Heart'' on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred's roots remained in academia, where he continued to teach
and write poetry and scholarly essays. He retired in 1991, but was
still a familiar figure in Cambridge and in the audience for
productions of plays at the American Repertory Theater at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a half-brother, Vincent Allfrey.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, he spent a great deal of time with his
great-grandmother Anna Maria Egan who immigrated to the United
States from County Mayo in Ireland. She told him colorful stories
about people she knew in Brooklyn before the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seemed to me to be more alive, even though they were
dead, than the people around me, because she was such a wonderful
storyteller,'' Alfred said. ``And she just intrigued me with one
particular story, which was the seed of `Hogan's Goat.'''

   Ireland is a conservative Catholic country with a liberal
national health system: Among other benefits, approved prescription
drugs are dispensed by doctors at no cost to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, this raises ticklish questions in Dublin, like what
to do about Viagra, Pfizer's anti-impotence pill. Would approval of
the drug appear to be encouraging licentiousness? Would rejection
be seen as obstructing the biblical imperative to be fruitful and
multiply? And on top of that, Pfizer makes ingredients for the drug
in Ireland, at a plant in Cork.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cowan, the health minister, announced a Solomonic solution
last week: Irish men in need could get free Viagra, but only four
pills a month. The limit was set ``to reduce the possibility of
inappropriate usage,'' Cowan told reporters. (No special provisions
were announced for months with five Saturday nights.)
</P>
<P>
   The limit did not bother Pfizer, which said some American
insurers had similar rules. Though couples with free access in
clinical tests tended to use about seven a month, according to
Mariann Caprino, a Pfizer spokeswoman, official recognition of
erectile dysfunction as a serious medical condition was
satisfaction enough. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Congress is about to double the president's pay to
$400,000 a year, the first hike in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   It would not benefit President Clinton, because the Constitution
forbids an increase for a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that the president deserves more,'' says
Paul Light, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, in testimony
prepared for a congressional hearing Monday. The president's
current $200,000 salary ``would put him at No. 785 on the list of
the 800 highest paid corporate chief executive officers, well below
Walt Disney's Michael Eisner, who receives a package worth $589
million,'' he is to say.

<P>
   If the president's pay had been indexed for inflation, he would
be earning $915,000 by now, Light will tell members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Although the current administration is keeping mum on the
subject, a line-up of senior aides to former presidents going back
to Lyndon Johnson is expected to support the pay raise in a hearing
before a House Government and Reform subcommittee. There appears to
be little opposition to the idea in either the House or Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was quietly inserted into a House spending bill by
Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., after he examined the pay of foreign
leaders. His staffers discovered that Singapore pays $465,000,
Taiwan $303,000, Japan $378 and Switzerland $230,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no request from the White House (on the issue),''
said a spokeswoman for Kolbe
</P>
<P>
   The timing appears right. With Clinton's term expiring and his
successor unknown, this year provides an opportunity for action
without regard to the party or the person in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea is not without critics. Gary Ruskin, director of
the liberal group Congressional Accountability Project said he
plans to pan the pay raise at Monday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president doesn't need a raise because he's got a
$200,000-a-year salary plus generous perks,'' Ruskin said. ``This
is mostly driven by desires of Congress and federal judges to get a
raise, and they don't need one either.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the push for the president's pay raise is to make room
for increases in other senior-level salaries without coming too
close to that of the chief executive. Already, the vice president's
$175,000 salary, which goes up when congressional pay increases, is
bumping up close to that of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sepp, spokesman for the National Taxpayers' Union, opposes
a presidential pay hike. ``Certainly (the president should) not
have a penny more for salary until the over-generous pension system
is addressed,'' Sepp said.
</P>
<P>
   Although presidents have relatively low salaries compared with
corporate chiefs, basketball players and even many college coaches,
they enjoy extensive benefits in retirement, including a
taxpayer-paid office staff, rent payments, and travel expenses,
plus $150,000 a year in retirement pay.
</P>
<P>
   But complaints by critics of a pay raise do not dissuade Don
Simon, acting president of Common Cause, a watchdog for ethics in
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the level of pay is a statement of how we think about
the office,'' he said. ``It is the most important job in
government, and the pay should be commensurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing that view, Light said that after the controversies
surrounding the Clinton presidency, ``this is a good way to send a
signal to the next president that this is still an important
office.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is about to double the president's pay to
$400,000 a year, the first hike in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   It would not benefit President Clinton, because the Constitution
forbids an increase for a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that the president deserves more,'' says
Paul Light, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, in testimony
prepared for a congressional hearing Monday. The president's
current $200,000 salary ``would put him at No. 785 on the list of
the 800 highest paid corporate chief executive officers, well below
Walt Disney's Michael Eisner, who receives a package worth $589
million,'' he is to say.
</P>
<P>
   If the president's pay had been indexed for inflation, he would
be earning $915,000 by now, Light will tell members of Congress.

RAILROAD TYCOON II GIVES PLAYERS A REASON TO UPGRADE COMPUTERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many years ago, before computers had all the bells and whistles
they do today, there was a computer game that had a bell and
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   The two were attached to a train, and players set about to build
a railroad. And then they worked to expand the railroad into a line
serving a few cities. Next came a regional line, and if they were
careful, competitive and cutthroat, they could weave a rail network
that captured a nation.
</P>
<P>
   They'd become a railroad tycoon. Which, by the way, was the name
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Railroad Tycoon'' was a wonderfully done game that simulated
the days when people came out of their houses to watch passing
trains, when trains moved more goods than trucks, and when
passengers were able to eat sitting down in a dining car instead of
from a fold-down tray attached to a seat back. (Please return all
trays to their upright positions.)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a reader called wondering where he could buy the
Railroad Tycoon program, which, if I remember correctly, didn't
take much more than a computer using the now archaic 486 chip _
which, the reader lamented, was all he had brought to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, the sequel, ``Railroad Tycoon II,'' presented
our hobo reader with a reason to upgrade his computer. The sequel
took advantage of a new generation of computer with better graphics
and stronger game play. Players build railroads, buy engines, bid
for hauling goods and buy and sell stock.
</P>
<P>
   There are 60 engines from which to choose. In addition, the game
has several difficulty levels, including one that allows players to
build and run trains like they did when they were kids: put the
track together, put a train on it, and enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   For players who have the ``Railroad Tycoon II'' game comes
``Railroad Tycoon II: The Second Century.'' The expansion pack
takes railroad barons to the next era with new maps to develop and
new segments of the economy to control.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion has new features and graphics, and covers the
years 1939 into the future. A company spokesman said railroad
builders can build all over the world and will face ``world
catastrophes such as World War II, the Cold War, and global
warming, and must solve modern problems such as the increasing
demand for mass transportation in major cities.''
</P>
<P>
   The disk has 15 stand-alone maps that allow railroad builders to
play against savvy computer-run players or other humans. Several
new engines are also included: the French TGV bullet train, the
Brennar 412, the Eurostar, and the German DB18-201 (a contemporary
steam train), and new cars such as Metra passenger cars, troop
transports and weapons flatbeds.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new challenges for players:
</P>
<P>
   World War II and Aftermath (1939-50): Gamers help guide the
Allies to victory in World War II by managing the British railroad
system through the Blitz and by hauling supplies from Russia to the
western front to hold off the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   After the war ends, gamers enter the Cold War phase and must
build railroad systems to deliver critical supplies to West Berlin
before Russia cuts the region off from the non-communist world.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern Era (1950-2005): After the war, America's economy and
population booms. Players need to meet the transportation demands
of the rising population and build a high-speed rail connecting Los
Angeles and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Players can now manage the Chunnel between England and France
and build a light-rail system for Seattle and Munich.
</P>
<P>
   The game needs a Pentium computer (133 MHZ processor or better)
with 16 megabytes of RAM and 150 megabytes of free hard-drive
space. And of course, buyers must own the original ``Railroad
Tycoon II'' to play.

THE BOY SCOUTS AND THE UNIVERSALISTS BATTLE OVER THE MEANING OF
FAITH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, national surveys have reported that 19 of 20
Americans say they believe in God. What is missing from those
findings is some indication of what people mean when they say that,
what concepts of God they hold in a nation with many different
views of religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   The question would seem to lie within an on-again, off-again
dispute that has flared anew between the Boy Scouts of America and
the Unitarian Universalist Association, a theologically diverse
organization that has no creed and instead says members may seek
spiritual truth in their own ways. Of its members, who number more
than 200,000, some describe themselves as humanists, some as
Christians, some as pagans and some as agnostics.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Boy Scouts told the association it no longer had
the authority to award its own religious emblem to Unitarian
Universalist boys in Scout troops.
</P>
<P>
   Religious emblems, worn like merit badges, are given by more
than 30 national religious organizations (everyone ``from Bahais to
Zoroastrians,'' a Boy Scout official said) to Scouts who have
undertaken a course of study about traditions of their own
particular faith.
</P>
<P>
   But in the case of the Unitarian Universalists, the Boy Scouts
objected to parts of the association's ``Religion in Life'' manual,
which tells Scouts who belong to Unitarian Universalist
congregations how to attain the association's emblem.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that the manual said some Unitarian Universalist
boys might have difficulty with the religious reference in the Boy
Scout oath, which promises duty to God and country.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the manual included a copy of a resolution, adopted
in 1992 by the association's General Assembly, that criticized the
Boy Scouts' policy of barring homosexuals. (The association has
been an outspoken supporter of gay rights, including a right to gay
marriage.)
</P>
<P>
   After an exchange of letters, the two sides arranged a meeting,
at the Unitarian Universalists' Boston headquarters, between Boy
Scout officials and the association's president, the Rev. John A.
Buehrens, himself a former Scout.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the association pronounced the dispute resolved,
saying it had revised its manual to meet the Boy Scouts'
objections. But the agreement proved short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   On May 7, a Boy Scout official wrote Buehrens saying the Scouts
could not authorize the emblem because the association was planning
to provide written materials to Unitarian Universalist Boy Scouts,
along with the revised manual, describing the association's stand
on bias against homosexuals and on the use of the term ``God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, this simply reopens the entire issue of using
boys as a venue to air your differences with the policies of the
Boy Scouts of America,'' the Scouts' letter said.
</P>
<P>
   On May 18, the association posted the letter on its Internet
site, along with a response from Buehrens, who said he had written
some of the new material himself, a pamphlet titled, ``When Others
(or You) Say `God.'' It was meant, he said, to ``help young people
from a pluralistic religious tradition understand some of the
multiple ways in which the word `God' is or can be understood.''
</P>
<P>
   Buehrens also said the association had disclosed its plans to
provide the materials during the September meeting and the Boy
Scouts had agreed to it.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregg Shields, a Boy Scout spokesman, said the decision to
provide the additional material ran ``contrary to the spirit of the
agreement'' between the two sides. The material, he said, includes
ideas ``that we found objectionable in the original booklet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The award must be representative of the values of scouting,''
Shields said. ``That's what it amounts to. The additional letter,
the additional documents are just inconsistent with our
teachings.''
</P>
<P>
   Shields said that the disagreement did not affect the right of
Unitarian Universalist boys to be Boy Scouts but that they could
not wear the association's religious emblem with their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Boy Scouts, with 4.6 million members, had 1,040
boys in 26 troops chartered by Unitarian Universalist-affiliated
organizations but that there were most likely Unitarian
Universalist boys in other troops as well.

MEXICO RELEASES AID FOR CHIAPAS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ An American aid volunteer whose school bus, laden
with wheelchairs and food donations, was stalled at the Mexican
border for three weeks said Friday that he had delivered his
shipment to Chiapas state.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer, Patrick Young, director of the Wheelchair Project
of Fresno, Calif., said he had been allowed to cross the border at
Reynosa early last week. Mexican authorities agreed he could give
the goods to Caritas, a Roman Catholic charity.
</P>
<P>
   The agency distributed the goods and food worth $3,000 that
Young had bought in Mexico to two rural Indian communities in
Chiapas, including one controlled by anti-government Zapatista
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he did not go to the communities to photograph the
deliveries, as he usually does, because he feared violating
restrictions that immigration officials had written into his visa.

THE FLIGHT TO PRECIOUS PLATINUM PLASTICS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 15 years, the American Express Platinum card has stood alone
among charge cards, offering its affluent holders valuable goodies
from free companion tickets in first- or business-class on
international flights to complimentary massages at chic resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Many banks issue ``platinum'' credit cards, but Michele Rankin,
a vice president at American Express, dismisses them _ not without
reason _ as ``cheap imitations that are platinum-colored.'' With an
average $7,000 credit limit, the typical platinum card is not even
up to buying a round-trip ticket to Paris on the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   But now American Express faces serious competition for the
charge card business of the rich, whose numbers are growing along
with the stock market, from a variety of financial services
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Visa introduced Signature Rewards through three
issuers; the move came shortly after Mastercard started offering
its Worldcard. Both, like all American Express cards, have no
preset spending limits. The industry calls them ``prestige cards,''
and they come with perks that David Fanger, an analyst at Moody's
Investors Service, said ``are designed to target American Express
Platinum customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The most serious challenge to American Express Platinum is
coming from Merrill Lynch, the world's largest securities broker.
In just seven months, Merrill has opened 370,000 Visa Signature
accounts. After 15 years, American Express has 500,000 Platinum
accounts, according to the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter in
Oxnard, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Merrill card is cheaper _ $75 a year, versus $300 for
American Express Platinum. But cost is not these customers' sole
consideration. Merrill's card is offered only with the broker's
Cash Management Account, which requires a $20,000 opening deposit
and bundles together money market, mutual fund and stock and bond
investments in a monthly statement.
</P>
<P>
   Which prestige card has the best perks depends on an
individual's needs _ and a close reading of the fine print.
</P>
<P>
   American Express promotes the free companion tickets _ at the
front of the plane _ that Platinum card holders get every time they
fly overseas and pay with their cards. But the deal is good only on
Continental Airlines and 15 foreign airlines. Companion tickets are
good only from so-called gateway cities. If you own a business
based in New York or San Francisco and travel a lot, the deal is
incredible. But if you live in, say, Buffalo, you have to transport
your companion to New York, Chicago or some other big city on your
own dime before the free travel kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   Platinum holders also earn points _ one for each dollar charged
_ that never expire and can be transferred to the frequent-flier
programs of six domestic airlines and a variety of foreign
airlines. But the biggest domestic carriers, United and American,
are not in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's Visa Signature card lacks the companion ticket deal,
and its points expire after five years. But they are more flexible.
For 25,000 points, Merrill card holders get a ticket worth up to
$500 whether they are flying to Rome, N.Y., or Rome, Italy. If a
ticket costs $600, they just pay the extra $100. The points are
good on any airline, and there are no blackout periods.
</P>
<P>
   For 100,000 points, Signature promises a first-class ticket on
``any airline anywhere in the world at any time.'' But unless you
have $10 million in your Cash Management Account, the fine print
limits the ticket's value to $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Still, card industry experts say new prestige cards offer great
advantages for customers. But what's in it for issuers like
Merrill? Profits _ or maybe even survival.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill is in a fight as free investment advice spreads over the
Internet and as its 4.8 million customers are solicited by discount
brokers and lured by online brokerage services with lower trading
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   So it is venturing into a business long associated with
commercial banks to try to tighten its hold on a high-end
clientele.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view Signature as a relationship product and a way to
reward our best clients,'' said Nancy Kelly, Merrill's vice
president for credit card marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill also hopes its Signature customers will keep more money
in their Cash Management Accounts to cover their credit card
charges. Merrill pays about 4 percent interest to clients on the
idle funds in their accounts. But it invests that money for its own
account and charges 8.5 percent interest on unpaid balances, while
tapping the account for monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill has linked the Cash Management Accounts to an Internet
site where clients can conduct securities transactions and pay
bills. Soon, it plans to offer services like bill presentation, in
which bills from the phone company, the gas station and other
vendors can be paid on line.
</P>
<P>
   Other brokerage firms are expected to offer Visa Signature or
the Mastercard Worldcard as a tool to build loyalty among customers
with lots of investable assets, said Chris N. Theoharides,
president of Advantage Consulting Group in Massapequa, N.Y., a
credit card consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other brokerage houses are seeing a lot of merit in the
Merrill card,'' he said, ``and they are all a little concerned
about a competitor having that one valuable product that will draw
customers away.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage firms can afford to lose money on Signature and
Worldcard, he said, if they bring in significantly more brokerage
fees or protect market share over all.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcard, being offered by Chase Manhattan, First USA, Bank of
America and other banks, provides basic benefits that are similar
to Signature's . But issuers of either car can add benefits:
Merrill, for example, will airlift a card holder home in a medical
emergency if necessary, while basic Signature and Worldcard members
get free transportation to the nearest medical facility. Merrill
and others add features based on the potential profits from their
affluent customers, said William F. Keenan, president of the Denovo
Corp., a marketing research firm in Hockessin, Del.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, David Robertson, president of Nilson, is
skeptical about how well the new competitors will do against
American Express Platinum. Ms. Rankin of American Express, said,
``People have tried throughout the years to copycat us, but we are
the first and the best. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Merrill's new card is a virtually risk-free way for the
broker to lend money.
</P>
<P>
   When a Platinum customer goes broke, American Express becomes an
unsecured creditor near the end of the line in court. But Signature
balances are margin loans against the customer's brokerage account.
</P>
<P>
   So Merrill's Visa is not unlike the cards banks issue to
bankrupts _ a secured credit card for the rich. &QL;

EDITORIAL: SPRINGTIME FOR CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, May 22:
</P>
<P>
   The time has come for House Republicans to save Speaker Dennis
Hastert from humiliating himself. Even Dick Armey, the grumpy
Republican majority leader and no fan of cleaning up campaign laws,
apparently agrees that it looks appalling for Hastert to fight the
will of the majority of House on campaign finance reform. Armey
wants to schedule a vote and get it over with. Friday, Hastert
again said the issue could not be taken up until the fall, which is
his way of burying it. Republican reformers, who have been
dithering over whether to confront Hastert, have no choice but to
sign a petition forcing legislation to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The basic principle here is whether Congress, before the next
election, will stand against the corruption of the political system
by special interests using a loophole in the campaign laws. Most
senators and representatives have said ``yes.'' Their leaders say
``no,'' because they haul in money from the oil, tobacco, gambling
and other industries and, in return, pass laws that help their
benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   The bill sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays of Connecticut and
Martin Meehan of Massachusetts would end unlimited contributions to
parties from business, unions and rich donors, and the use of this
money for ``attack ads'' by independent groups two months before an
election.
</P>
<P>
   House approval is certain _ if the House gets to vote. Knowing
that, Hastert wants to postpone a vote until it is too late for the
Senate to act. He promises to bring it up the third week of
September. But that promise is disingenuous and premised on a false
argument, which is that the House has too much else going on now.
In fact, the House is working short days this spring, and Hastert
has even scheduled an extra vacation week because there is so
little to do. The speaker also knows that September is exactly the
wrong time to bring up campaign reform, because by then the House
will be caught up in budget battles.
</P>
<P>
   Last year House members defied Newt Gingrich by signing a
petition forcing campaign financing to the floor. They can do it
again. The Democrats have a shot at getting 200 signatures. If a
little more than half of the 34 Republican sponsors of the
Shays-Meehan bill sign on, reform will have its day.
</P>
<P>
   We appeal to sponsors in the New York area to do so _ Shays and
Nancy Johnson of Connecticut; Bob Franks, Marge Roukema, Frank
LoBiondo, Rodney Frelinghuysen and Jim Saxton of New Jersey, and
Sue Kelly, Michael Forbes, James Walsh, Sherwood Boehlert, Amo
Houghton and Benjamin Gilman of New York. Their constituents should
tell them that lip service to this cause is not enough.  &QL;

LONGTIME CLINTON FRIEND PLEADS GUILTY IN FUND-RAISING
INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
 (rm) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Democratic fundraiser and longtime Arkansas
friend of President Clinton pleaded guilty Friday in a federal
court in Little Rock, Ark., to two political fund-raising charges
and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department's long-running
campaign finance inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser, Yah Lin Trie, was one of the first major
Democratic figures from Clinton's re-election effort to be charged
in an indictment in January 1998. Trie was one of a small group of
Clinton associates who used his contacts in Asia to help seek money
for the Democrats, ultimately raising more than $1 million for the
party's national committee and Clinton's legal defense fund.
</P>
<P>
   In the plea agreement, the government said it would dismiss all
charges against Trie in Little Rock and Washington in return for
his guilty plea to a felony count of causing false statements to be
made to the Federal Election Commission and to a lesser misdemeanor
charge.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty plea, along with a federal appeals court's decision
earlier this week to reinstate charges against another fund-raiser
rejuvenated the 3-year old investigation into how the Democrats
financed Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement after his plea, Trie said that he wanted to end
the long legal battle that had consumed his life. ``After three
years of constant struggle, my physical and spiritual resources to
resist are exhausted,'' Trie said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the government agreed to dismiss all charges
against Trie in Little Rock and Washington in return for his guilty
plea to a felony count of causing false statements to be made to
the Federal Election Commission and to a lesser misdemeanor charge.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said Friday that he
had no comment on Trie's guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   For Trie, a Taiwan-born naturalized American citizen known as
Charlie, the guilty plea resolved legal problems that in recent
days had seemed to mount against the former Little Rock
restaurateur, who parlayed his friendships with Clinton and the
president's inner circle into an international import-export
business.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously reinstated five of six
criminal charges against another fund-raiser, Maria Hsia. Similar
charges had been thrown out in Trie's case, and the ruling meant
they were certain to be reinstated.It was to one of those charges
that Trie pleaded guilty Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The plea agreement was reached as Trie had ended the first week
of a federal trial in Little Rock on charges that he obstructed
justice by ordering an employee to destroy documents subpoenaed in
1997 by a federal grand jury and the Senate Government Affairs
Committee. Those charges could have resulted in a sentence of up to
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had presented one damaging witness, the manager of
Trie's Little Rock office, Maria Mapili. She testified this week
that Trie directed her to dispose of documents sought by the Senate
investigating committee. Ms. Mapili said she threw away some papers
but hid others that were later seized or turned over to the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For prosecutors, the deal provides a witness who could open a
window on the murky world of the fund raising they are
investigating, a prospect that prompted prosecutors to offer Trie
immunity and a recommendation that he be sentenced to three-years
probation if he cooperates fully. If not, he faces a maximum
sentence of six years in prison and a $350,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They will be able to plumb Trie's knowledge on several fronts.
For example, investigators are likely to enlist him to unravel the
activities of another important fund-raiser, John Huang, who has
long been a focus of inquiry in the fund-raising affair but has
never been accused of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators reported that Trie brought in
$230,000 helping Huang raise money for the Democratic National
Committee's Asian-American dinner on Feb. 19, 1996, at the
Hay-Adams Hotel in Washington. At the dinner, Trie and his Macau
financial partner, Ng Lap Seng, were rewarded with a seat at the
head table next to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But when the campaign finance scandal ignited after Clinton's
re-election, the contributions that Trie helped bring in were
immediately suspect. The Democratic National Committee returned
$645,000 that he solicited and Clinton sent back the $639,000 that
Trie raised for the president's legal defense fund.
</P>
<P>
   Senate investigators later traced more than $1 million wired to
Trie from Asia, including $470,000 from Ng. Justice Department
investigators have long wanted to know more about the source of the
money. Trie could potentially assist that inquiry, although his
lawyers have said the money was for legitimate business
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities are not alone in their eagerness to question
Trie. Congressional investigators also want to interview him, and
federal marshals Friday served Trie with a subpoena to appear on
June 10 before the House Government Reform Committee.

NOTE HINTS FUND-RAISER KNEW OF BRIBERY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
(DW) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department has obtained a note from the
Little Rock office of Yah Lin Trie, a Democratic fund-raiser, that
suggests he was aware of a bribery problem.
</P>
<P>
   The note, handwritten in Mandarin on stationery from a Hong Kong
hotel, is cryptic but intriguing, according to officials who are
familiar with its contents.
</P>
<P>
   The note lists a number of items. The first three items mention
``Hughes'' and the U.S. government, export licenses and a bribery
problem, the officials said. It is not clear who wrote the note,
which was obtained by the Justice Department in a search of Trie's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox committee, a select House committee investigating
China's acquisition of sensitive U.S. technology, learned of the
note during its investigation. The committee, according to
officials familiar with its investigation, believes the use of the
word ``Hughes'' may be a reference to Hughes Electronics, the
satellite-maker and subsidiary of the General Motors Corp. Hughes'
dealings with China are the subject of a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The note is not related to the charges against Trie that stem
from his activities as a fund-raiser for President Clinton and the
Democratic Party in the 1996 election. Trie, who is known as
Charlie and is a longtime Arkansas friend of Clinton and his wife,
Hillary, pleaded guilty Friday in a federal court in Little Rock,
Ark., to two campaign-related charges and agreed to cooperate with
the Justice Department's campaign finance inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes has denied any wrongdoing. But the select committee found
that Hughes had intentionally ignored federal export license
requirements in its dealings with Chinese scientists in 1993 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, Hughes officials were helping China fix problems
with rockets that failed while carrying Hughes satellites.
Documents obtained by the Cox committee suggest that a Hughes
official in China, Bansang W. Lee, was recommending that the
company curry favor with the Chinese in 1993 by softening its
criticism of Chinese rocket failures.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, Central Intelligence Agency officers in China
reported that Lee, who left Hughes in 1995 and went to work for
another American satellite company, had made payments to Chinese
officials in the hope of getting contracts for American aerospace
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyer, Brian O'Neill, has said his client ``never made
any unlawful or improper payments of any kind to any Chinese
official.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear why Trie might have kept a note relating to
export issues and Hughes. But Trie was closely involved in export
issues and China. He served on a presidential trade commission
trying to open Asian markets.

 THE CLINTONS' VACATION HAS POLITICAL OVERTONES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, as he is fond of reminding
everyone from time to time, cannot run again for re-election, which
frees him from certain political calculations. One of these, you
would think, would be where to spend his summer vacation, a
decision that in the past has been so fraught with image-conscious
polling that he went off twice to Wyoming just to please the
environmentalists, when he really wanted to go back to Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with his wife edging closer to running for the Senate from
New York, the summer vacation is still in the balance. And although
administration officials caution that a final decision may be
dozens of permutations away, one thing seems likely: It will be in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The first couple, these officials say, for the first time in
their lives, are exploring the recreational options across the
Empire State. The choices have apparently narrowed, they say, to
the Adirondacks or Shelter Island, although Marsha Berry, the first
lady's spokeswoman, was noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that you can narrow it down to two, or rule out
Martha's Vineyard,'' Ms. Berry said. She noted that the Clintons
were planning a five-day Florida vacation next week, where Mrs.
Clinton will focus on her decision about whether to run for the
Senate. ``That's as far as they're planning, in terms of
vacation,'' Ms. Berry said. The annual vacation decision, she said,
``is one of the hardest things to pin them down on.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials say the Adirondacks and Shelter Island are under
close study. The two spots, at different ends of the state, make
entirely different political statements, and each has its
drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The rustic, woodsy Adirondacks, spread out across 6 million
acres in northern New York, make a nice setting for the outdoorsy
look. But the area is remote and short on the kind of socializing
that the Clintons favor.
</P>
<P>
   It may be telling that when one administration official was
asked whether the Clintons might pick the Adirondacks, his first
response was ``How far is that from New York City?''
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Too far for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Shelter Island, tucked between Long Island's North and South
Forks, is quaint _ it has no traffic lights _ while still easily
accessible to the Hamptons area and its trunks of campaign cash.
But constant shuttling over to Steven Spielberg's estate could
suggest a certain elitism that Mrs. Clinton, if she runs for the
Senate, would probably want to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Morris, the former White House consultant, has in the past
steered the Clintons toward places that have a populist appeal to
middle-class families _ the suburban swing voters who frequently
decide elections. It was Morris who convinced the Clintons in 1995
and 1996 to drop the glitz of Martha's Vineyard and head for
Jackson Hole.
</P>
<P>
   As he writes in his memoir, ``Behind the Oval Office,'' Morris,
with the help of pollster Mark Penn and an elaborately refined
polling grid, found that people whose votes are up for grabs tend
to like baseball, hiking, camping and technology. ``I urged that he
take a mountain vacation, that he hike and camp out in a tent'' and
publicize the high-tech gear he was using, Morris wrote, admitting
that he was carrying his belief in polling to ``a mindless
extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton was not happy,'' Morris continued. He asked Morris
whether, for example, if he wore a baseball cap he could still go
golfing. ``What if I hike, set up my campsite and go fishing but I
don't catch anything?'' an irked president asked the consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his irritation, the president and the first lady went to
Wyoming, and they did camp and hike. But then, after the
president's re-election, they went back to Martha's Vineyard in
1997 and 1998 _ ever nomadic in the summer, having no family
retreat like a Kennebunkport or Hyde Park to call home.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Morris, now widely loathed within the administration, laughed on
Friday when informed of the New York options. ``That's
ridiculous,'' he said, branding their sudden interest in a New York
vacation ``totally and completely phony.'' He said the Adirondacks
were ``derivative of my advice to go to the Rockies'' and that
Shelter Island was ``derivative of Martha's Vineyard, which is
where they really want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   On reflection, he thought the Adirondacks would be a better
choice than Shelter Island. ``Swing voters like camping, hiking and
fishing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While a visit to the woods might have broad appeal, it is
unclear whether this would help with the Adirondack locals, who
tend to vote heavily Republican. Gerald Solomon, who represented
the Adirondacks in Congress for 20 years before retiring last year,
said in an interview Friday, ``The natives would welcome them, but
they certainly wouldn't vote for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said that Mrs. Clinton's advocacy of gun control would
be particularly troubling. He received much attention for his
forceful denunciation of a gun-control measure in 1996, when he
said his wife, who lived alone in Glens Falls while he was in
Washington, needed her rifles for protection.
</P>
<P>
   But he also acknowledged that the seasonal Adirondack economy
could use a boost from the money that a presidential visit would
bring in. ``Their entourage would be most welcome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the Clintons wind up, they are not likely to bump into
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's likely
competitor in a Senate race. The mayor makes a point of not taking
vacations.

 &HT;    `The Phantom Menace': Movie or myth?
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ From Odysseus and King Arthur to Luke and Anakin
Skywalker, the story remains the same: A young man realizes the
hero within through a journey that involves trials, temptations and
transformation. It's what Joseph Campbell, author of ``The Hero
With a Thousand Faces,'' called the ``mono-myth.''
</P>
<P>
   At its most basic, the ``Star Wars'' saga is a simple tale of a
hero's quest, with the timeless theme of good vs. evil. In creating
his modern-day legend, which will eventually encompass six films,
George Lucas has tapped into myths that have been repeated
countless times in every culture, and drawn on age-old archetypes
found in ancient fairy tales. There's the beautiful princess in
distress (Princess Leia); courageous knights (Luke Skywalker and
Han Solo); the wise old man (Obi-Wan Kenobi); a dark knight (Darth
Vader); and the powerful evil ruler (Emperor Palpatine). Aliens and
'droids fill the standard roles of ogres and dwarves.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Star Wars'' films have struck a chord deep within people
all over the world. The method of conveying the story has changed
with the times, with the added twist of astonishing special
effects. But as with fairy tales, people never grow tired of
hearing _ or seeing _ the same essential story.
</P>
<P>
   The latest chapter, ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace,'' which opened Wednesday, presents a new cast of similarly
archetypal characters. The new film goes a step further by
introducing seemingly overt references to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   During the three years he developed the original ``Star Wars''
and its prequels and sequels, Lucas worked toward making it a
modern mythology. He'd been a social-science major who studied
anthropology before he got into film, and discovered Campbell's
works in a mythology class.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to do `Star Wars,' I went back and started doing
more research before I wrote the screenplay,'' Lucas said last week
during a news conference in New York City. ``I re-read `The Hero
With a Thousand Faces' and quite a few other things (Joseph
Campbell) did.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas met the mythology expert after he completed 1983's
``Return of the Jedi.'' They became friends until Campbell's death.
``In that part, he actually was a mentor,'' Lucas said. ``He was an
amazing scholar and an amazing person, and I was privileged to be
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell demonstrated how many folkloric and religious figures,
from the fairy tale Frog King to Buddha, simultaneously enacted the
same phases of their common story. He transformed the way scholars,
historians and psychologists view mythology by interweaving
traditional wisdom with the modern struggle for identity and
spiritual depth.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas imbued his myth with bits of popular culture:
Saturday-matinee adventure serials, movie westerns, swashbucklers
and Japanese samurai epics. Adhering to Campbell's doctrine, he
also reflected the times in which the films were made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars,'' released in 1977, was a reaction against
Watergate, Vietnam and other periods of domestic turmoil that
undermined the concept of the hero for disillusioned Americans.
Lucas reportedly patterned Emperor Palpatine after Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' also speaks to the moment. The villains
are a corporate dictatorship known as the Trade Federation, which
invades Naboo. The Federation viceroy is named Nute, as in
Gingrich. His ally in the Galactic Senate, who ties up Naboo's
call-to-arms in committee, is Lott _ like the U.S. Senate Majority
Leader. The Jedi attempt to stop the invasion, as NATO has done in
countries such as Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The one-with-the-universe concept of the Force has been likened
to Eastern religions. ``The Phantom Menace'' seems to draw more
directly from Christianity with the revelation that Anakin is
apparently a virgin birth _ the ``chosen one'' who will free his
people and bring balance to the Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a virgin birth in every mythological story in every
culture,'' said Irish actor Liam Neeson, who plays Jedi Knight
Qui-Gon Jinn. ``Sometimes people just attribute it to Christianity,
but it's not, really. It's ancient.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Neeson admits that he and Pernilla August, the Swedish
actress who plays Anakin's mother, Shmi, had a few giggles when she
had to deliver the line about there being no father. ``And when it
came to my close-up, I thought, well, how do you play this? A
double-take? You could say, `So, you're still a virgin?'''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas has been conscious about not making the ``Star Wars''
movies religion-specific. He said when the original was released,
many religions used it to demonstrate their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of Immaculate Conception is a motif that goes
through all religions,'' Lucas said. ``It's a motif that goes
through all stories about the local deity or the local hero. It's
the same thing with Hercules. Most heroes are conceived in an
unusual way. And in this particular case, it's actually not
Immaculate Conception. It's conception by metaphor, I would say,
more than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker said he was trying to take the idea of symbiontic
relationships that underscores ``The Phantom Menace'' and
demonstrate it in a more concrete way. The ``midi-chlorians'' that
are unusually abundant in Anakin's blood and that connect us to the
Force are a loose depiction of mitochondria, according to Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Mitochondria are microscopic structures in cells, containing
genetic material and enzymes important for cell metabolism. Lucas
supposes they had something to do with the beginnings of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a way of saying that we have hundreds of little
creatures that live on us, and that without them, we'd all die,''
he said. ``There wouldn't be any life. They are necessary for us;
we are necessary for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas uses them as a metaphor for society _ saying that we must
all get along with each other _ as well as for the planet. ``We
must treat the other creatures on this planet with respect,'' he
said. ``Otherwise, the planet will die.

 &HT;    Deadly American export: Tobacco
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Big Tobacco's not so big anymore, now is it? Not with
all these lawsuits and the billboard-banning, anti-smoking fervor
smoldering across America.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. There's always Hungary. And Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   And India. And Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rather naughtily like to remind my American colleagues that
96 percent of the world is not America,'' said David Simpson,
taking a break this week in downtown Atlanta during the Second
World Conference for Cancer Organizations. ``There is an enormous
market out there, from Asia to Africa to South America, that still
have low smoking rates.''
</P>
<P>
   As founder and director of the International Agency on Tobacco
and Health, based in London, Simpson would very much like the rest
of the world not to emulate America and the United Kingdom when it
comes to smoking.
</P>
<P>
   And lung cancer. And emphysema. And strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Should worldwide smoking trends and aggressive cigarette
marketing continue at current rates, a pandemic will unfold to make
AIDS pale by comparison, said advocates and educators at the
five-day conference. By the year 2030, some 10 million people
worldwide will die annually from tobacco use _ three times as many
as today. Of those deaths, 70 percent will occur in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a pandemic unlike anything in the history of the
world,'' said John Seffrin, American Cancer Society CEO. ``Who
pays? It will be of such enormous proportions, it will have to be
resolved on a global stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Last decade, lung cancer surpassed stomach cancer as the world's
leading fatal cancer, said Dr. Michael Thun, American Cancer
Society epidemiologist. Lung cancer is on the rise in southern
Europe, Japan, Asia and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cycle is repeating itself like clockwork all over the
world,'' Thun said.
</P>
<P>
   That cycle, Thun said, goes something like this: International
tobacco companies buy controlling interest in a country's own
national tobacco firms, then saturate the country with
advertisements extolling the virtues of smoking Western cigarettes
_ wealth, women and fast cars.
</P>
<P>
   Then come sponsorships of sports teams, auto races, rock
concerts and discos.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years down the line come the lung cancer and other
tobacco-related health statistics, first for men, then for women.
</P>
<P>
   China is often held up as the country of impending doom. With
almost one-quarter of the world's population, it smokes one-third
of the world's cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   More people light up in China every day than wake up in the
United States. ``In 25 years, we predict China will have 1 million
lung cancer deaths per year. It's unthinkable,'' said Seffrin.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, some 160,000 Americans died of lung cancer last
year. Currently, 400,000 American deaths _ one in five _ are
attributed to tobacco use. Lung cancer became the leading cause of
cancer deaths of American women in 1987. The U.S. health care cost
for treating tobacco users was $50 billion in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   At the conference, advocates from over 100 nations called upon
governments to pass laws restricting cigarette advertising and
sales to minors. They also learned from successful anti-smoking
campaigns, and exchanged anecdotes of their powerful, ubiquitous
enemies: Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, and BAT, the British
American Tobacco company.
</P>
<P>
   Pamphil Kweyuh of Kenya rolled a video showing African
television commercials for cigarettes. ``See that convertible,'' he
said, pointing to the sleek white car occupied by a glamorous
couple. ``There's probably three cars like that in all of Kenya.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bombay, Marlboro swooped in about two years ago, said Viji
Venkatesh of India's Cancer Patients Aid Association. It has become
the favorite brand, even beating out the traditional bidis, which
are hand-rolled with flavored tobacco flakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's American, it's freedom, it's wealth. I think the
cigarette companies are blatantly targeting that view,'' she said.
``And we have absolutely no government support in terms of laws or
prevention. Right outside schools we have little stalls selling
cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   But some nations' anti-smoking groups have made considerable
progress in lobbying for tobacco controls.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's package warning, ``Smoking Can Kill You,'' is one
of eight rotating messages. The packages also refer people to a
toll-free phone number for addiction help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We modeled the warnings after Australia and New Zealand,''
said Yussuf Saloojee, executive director of the National Council
Against Smoking. ``Your (American) health warnings on cigarettes
are the worst. They're vague, they're small and . . . they don't
present people with a way to overcome the danger.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa also boosted taxes on cigarettes, nearly tripling
the price; sales dropped 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask why Africa even bothers with tobacco control when
it has most of the AIDS deaths in the world, and malaria, TB and
infant mortality,''says Saloojee. ``But if we don't deal with it
now, the future of Africa is not only the diseases of poverty but
the disease of the Westernization.''

<P>
   On the big hype-o-meter in the sky, TV series finales will be
forever judged against last year's ``Seinfeld'' sign-off.
</P>
<P>
   If that fevered extravaganza of hubbub rated a 10, Tuesday's
``Home Improvement'' hits only about a 6. There's been very little
fuss over the departure of one of the most successful sitcoms of
this or any other era.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the arrival of Darth Maul has something to do with that,
but it still doesn't seem right. Even to show insiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it was underrated by the critics,'' said Earl
Hindman, who plays eccentric, unseen neighbor Wilson to Tim Allen's
ever-affable Tim Tyler. ``I do feel that in about 10 years, that
people will look at the show and go, `My gosh, it really was a good
show in terms of total honesty.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched every show, and there are always bummers in a body
of work, but this was a very good show. I think it will be as
lasting as the so-called cult shows _ the ``Seinfelds,'' your
''Cheers,'' ``MASH'' and such. I think those will go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was undervalued by the audience. We've always
had the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   A New York-based theater actor who did a decade on the ``Ryan's
Hope'' soap, Hindman had no idea the series would become an
eight-year success when he originally auditioned, via videotape,
for the Al Borland role, eventually filled by Richard Karn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured it would be a pilot, one show, in there and out of
there, a quick $13,000,'' said Hindman, calling from his
Connecticut home. ``But everyone kept telling me this was a
can't-miss proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know anything about this stuff. You know, make a
pilot, make a few bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to a time slot in the gravitational pull of the
then-huge ``Roseanne,'' the series became the most successful debut
of the 1991-92 TV season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I said, `Hello, we may be here for a while,' '' he said.
``Watching the ratings, I realized, `Oh, I signed my life away.
They got me cheap.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hindman didn't meet series star Tim Allen, from whose stand-up
comedy the show's premise was born, until the first read-through of
the pilot episode. He knew Allen was one of the many comics then
getting TV deals, but that's about all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really know his act,'' Hindman said. ``I'd seen him
in a commercial, but I had no idea who he was.'' During a break,
Allen introduced himself by saying he had watched Hindman on
``Ryan's Hope.'' Odd as it seems today, Hindman remembers Allen as
``shy'' in their first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim has been like our guru,'' said Hindman. ``The whole cast
is fun. A lot of shows are real rough, there's sometimes a lot of
tension on the set. We're fun and games, and you can see it on the
air. Our show has always been loose, and it comes directly from
Tim.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Improvement'' has made Hindman, now 56, financially
comfortable for life, but he doesn't intend to do a slow fade to
where-are-they-now specials on high-dial-position cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't just retire because the show is off the air,'' he
said. ``I will, of course, continue to work.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to pursue his career as ``freelance actor'' and is
currently negotiating to act in a Broadway project he can't yet
reveal.
</P>
<P>
   And he may spend some more time in his home state, Arizona.
Hindman grew up in Bisbee and studied drama at the University of
Arizona and said he still has family in-state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona is my home, my heart,'' he said, noting that he
celebrated the recent University of Connecticut NCAA basketball
championship, but retains the UA Wildcats as his sentimental
favorite. ``Arizona is my team.'' &QL;

NATO STRIKES INCREASE AS CONCERN RISES OVER ACCURACY OF ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO warplanes assigned to attack a military
compound in northwestern Kosovo Friday struck what Yugoslavia's
official news agency described as a nearby prison, killing at least
19 inmates and guards.
</P>
<P>
   The strike came as NATO faced mounting concerns about its
bombing accuracy, even from within the alliance. Germany's foreign
minister, Joschka Fischer, said Friday that NATO should urgently
reconsider its process of choosing what to bomb, though NATO
officials said Germany had not requested a formal review.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's attacks nevertheless resumed a furious pace after
intermittently bad weather hampered strikes. In the 24 hours
leading up to Thursday morning, NATO forces struck only three major
targets including a fuel depot in Belgrade, a missile site near the
Batajnica airport and another fuel facility in Sombor, the Pentagon
said.
</P>
<P>
   But through the day Friday a flurry of strikes was reported
throughout Yugoslavia, including the military compound near the
prison, in the town of Istok, which was hit early Friday and again
Friday night. A television and radio tower and fuel tanks were also
attacked in Smederevo; while bridges, factories and fuel facilities
were hit in Uzice, Pozega and Bor, according to Yugoslavia's news
agency, Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances surrounding the bombing of the prison in Istok
remained murky. NATO and Pentagon officials confirmed that allied
aircraft have struck a military compound in Istok on several
occasions, including Friday. However, they said they could not yet
confirm that any NATO bombs or missiles had struck the prison
itself.
</P>
<P>
   One NATO official said the compound was used as a staging area
for Yugoslav Army and police units operating in Kosovo. A Pentagon
official said the prison was near the compound, but was not
targeted in the strikes, which hit two military barracks across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists traveling with a U.N. mission reported seeing
several dead bodies inside the prison's grassy courtyard. Inside
one of the buildings, rubble filled a stairway, and walls were
pock-marked with shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   The prison's governor, Aleksandar Rakocevic, said his deputy had
been killed and a warden was badly wounded, adding that he believed
three or four prisoners had escaped out of the 1,000 inmates. Many
of them were in for ``terrorist'' offenses, meaning association
with the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   A Serbian official accused NATO of targeting the jail in a bid
to free the prisoners, adding: ``One thousand prisoners _ a perfect
army.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana, apologized Friday to
the governments of several countries whose embassies or
ambassadorial residences were damaged by NATO strikes in Belgrade
Wednesday and Thursday nights.
</P>
<P>
   The force of blasts at army barracks and a petroleum facility
blew out windows and caused other damage to the homes of
ambassadors from Sweden, India, Norway, Spain and Hungary. The
embassies of Libya and Israel were also slightly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The residence of Switzerland's ambassador was hit during a
diplomatic dinner with ambassadors from Sweden, Slovakia and the
Vatican. A strike against a fuel depot shattered windows just as
dessert was served. No one was injured in any of the raids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these governments understand fully well that this
damage, if it does occur at all, is wholly unintentional and that
we are making every effort to strike military targets with the
accuracy that you would expect from this alliance,'' NATO's
spokesman, Jamie P. Shea said in Brussels Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, NATO forces bombed and severely damaged China's
Embassy, killing three people. The diplomatic reverberations of
that attack are still being felt. China announced Friday a ban on
port calls in Hong Kong by American Navy ships. The White House,
meantime, said it planned to send a special envoy to China to try
to assuage China's anger over the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, however, the State Department warned other
countries that the safety of diplomats could not be guaranteed in
the middle of a conflict. ``I think any diplomat who is aware of
the situation knows that Yugoslavia is a dangerous place,'' the
department's spokesman, James P. Rubin, said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite NATO's efforts to minimize unintended damage from its
air war, the errors have exposed tensions in the alliance and
increased political pressure to end the bombing, which has now
lasted nearly two months.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's foreign minister, Robin Cook, said Friday that the
allies remain strongly united behind the effort to reverse
President Slobodan Milosevic's expulsion of hundreds of thousands
of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. He said the airstrikes were
gradually grinding down Yugoslavia's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any sign that the Yugoslav army at the present
rate of attrition is going to hold out until August or September,''
Cook said during a visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With the summer months approaching, the Pentagon announced that
the Clinton administration was pressing its allies to move quickly
to deploy 45,000 to 50,000 troops to the borders of Kosovo so that
a peacekeeping force would be in place once a settlement is
reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now at least some hint that we may be closer to an
agreement today than we were a month ago, and certainly two months
ago or three months ago,'' the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H.
Bacon, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Pentagon continued to build up its air forces,
announcing the activation of another 1,022 members of the Air Force
Reserve and Air National Guard, bringing the total number activated
so far to 5,000. The Pentagon also dispatched 26 more KC-135 aerial
refueling planes to support the airstrikes.

OLIVETTI VICTORIOUS IN UNPRECEDENTED TAKEOVER OF TELECOM ITALIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Olivetti SpA, the former typewriter manufacturer that
transformed itself into Italy's No. 2 telephone company, triumphed
Friday night in the biggest hostile corporate takeover ever,
gaining control of Telecom Italia, a rival more than five times its
size.
</P>
<P>
   In a David-vs.-Goliath struggle reminiscent of the
American-style takeover brawls of the 1980s, Olivetti lured enough
Telecom Italia shareholders with a $65 billion package of cash and
securities to gain at least 51 percent of Telecom Italia's stock.
Friday was the deadline for shareholders to accept or reject the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   The victory wrecked Telecom Italia's main anti-takeover defense,
a hastily arranged marriage proposal to Deutsche Telekom, Germany's
biggest phone company. That $81 billion all-stock deal was worth
far more than Olivetti's bid on paper, but was plagued by doubts
since the companies first announced it exactly one month ago.
</P>
<P>
   `'I am proud of the response of the market to our offer,'' said
Olivetti chief executive Roberto Colaninno. `'I am content.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the victory signaled the ``beginning of a great new
industrial story.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight over Telecom Italia is expected to send a wakeup call
to Europe's clubby business world, where deals are often struck in
friendly fashion behind closed doors, and where fewer than a dozen
hostile takeovers have succeeded in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that Olivetti succeeded in such a flamboyant
fashion is a measure of the changes overtaking Corporate Europe, as
industries globalize and the Continent unifies under a single
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Colaninno, 55, has pledged to restore direction and purpose to
Telecom Italia, the former national telephone monopoly, which has
struggled since the government took it public last year.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti's victory was a stunning defeat for Franco Bernabe, the
Telecom Italia chief executive who had fought stubbornly to thwart
the Olivetti bid. He said, ``It will now be for the shareholders to
decide the future affairs of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Telecom Italia employees effectively conceding
defeat, Bernabe said that Telecom Italia ``emerges from the affair
stronger and more credible. Its international visibility and
notoriety are enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   The first signs of a probable Olivetti victory emerged early
Friday, when one after another of the major institutional investors
that formed the ``hard core'' of Telecom Italia's shareholder base,
including the big Generali insurance company, the San Paolo-IMI
bank, and the IFIL holding company of the Agnelli family of Fiat,
announced they were tendering their shares to Olivetti. The
defection of San Paolo, Italy's biggest bank, was particularly
bitter for Telecom Italia, since its IMI investment banking unit
was among Bernabe's advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Alone among the core shareholders to cast their vote for Bernabe
was Credit Suisse-First Boston. But Credit Suisse also numbered
among the investment banks advising Bernabe.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, it was Gianni Agnelli, Fiat's honorary chairman and
a longtime financial kingmaker, who gave the first indication of an
Olivetti victory. ``For us, this adventure is over,'' he told
reporters in Turin this evening. But there was an undercurrent of
grudging bitterness, given the Agnellis' support for Bernabe and
opposition to Olivetti. Agnelli heartily congratulated Olivetti,
adding: ``It's a difficult business, with a great future. Heavily
indebted.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti had offered shareholders 11.50 euros, or $12.19, in
cash, bonds and stock for every Telecom Italia common share. Though
it remained unclear Friday night when an official tally would be
available, officials involved in the counting estimated that
Olivetti had obtained roughly 51 percent to 53 percent of Telecom
Itala shares.
</P>
<P>
   Though Olivetti's offer was less than what Deutsche Telekom was
willing to pay, investors were evidently swayed partly by Italian
government objections to the partnership with Deutsche Telekom,
which remains 72 percent controlled by the German government.
Moreover, while Olivetti promised 60 percent cash, Deutsche Telekom
offered its own stock. A final push may have come from the
conviction that merging two big former state phone monopolies was
hardly likely to produce a nimble competitor in the fast moving
world of modern telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Roe, a telecommunications analyst at Paribas Capital
Markets in London, said Olivetti could be satisfied with the
result. ``They want to see the field clear to do something definite
and dramatic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that Olivetti could still face major problems,
notably from ``a lot of disgruntled shareholders'' who did not
tender their shares to Olivetti, including holders of savings, or
non-voting Telecom Italia shares.
</P>
<P>
   The victory promises to boost America's large investment banks,
for whom the deal represented their shot at breaking into the
European market and drawing attention.
</P>
<P>
   `'It is great for Olivetti, it is a victory for Colaninno,''
said Richard Blakesley, head of telecommunications mergers and
acquisitions at Chase Manhattan, which was among the investment
banks advising Olivetti. Others included Lehman Brothers and
Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of unintended consequences of the victory will be
the creation almost overnight of a major European market for
corporate bonds. To help finance the takeover, Olivetti will issue
bonds worth up to $24 billion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The deal will go far in shaking up the Continent's phone
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be major repercussions all across Europe,'' said
Holger Grawe, telecommunications analyst at the German brokerage
firm West LB Panmure.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia's brief and unsuccessful flirt with Deutsche
Telekom so enraged France Telecom, a partner of the Germans in
several ventures, that it is threatening to sever its business
ties.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Deutsche Telekom will find itself facing an even
stronger European competitor on its own home turf. The reason is
that under the terms of the Olivetti takeover, Mannesmann AG,
already Germany's largest mobile phone operator, will end up with a
similar position in the fast growing Italian market. Now that
Olivetti has succeeded, Mannesmann will acquire all of Infostrada
SpA, the second biggest Italian fixed network operator after
Telecom Italia, and a controlling 55 percent stake of Omnitel
Pronto Italia, Italy's second biggest mobile phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom spokesman Hans Ehnert said the company would
``discuss and analyze the results internally in our management, and
then with Telecom Italia, and draw the necessary consequences.''
But he said Deutsche Telekom would stick by its strategy of
international growth, suggesting that the company would seek other
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti's victory is also a deep personal triumph for
Colaninno, the aggressive former auto parts manufacturer who became
chief executive of Olivetti in 1996 after the company had been
shaken by losses and investigations by prosecutors into possible
bookkeeping irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   After working as chief executive of Fiaam SpA, a maker of oil
and air filters, Colaninno started a a finance firm in 1980. Carlo
De Benedetti, the Olivetti chairman and a leading financier, then
bought Fiaam and ran it until De Benedetti tapped Colaninno to save
Olivetti.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia, measured by market capitalization, is more than
five times the size of Olivetti, the 90-year old former typewriter
company that nearly went bankrupt in the mid-1990s before
reinventing itself as a telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   For Bernabe, the three-month struggle to repel Olivetti is a
humiliating loss. The 50-year-old executive, who took over
management of Telecom Italia late last year, was unable to convince
the large institutional shareholders who controlled Telecom Italia
to remain loyal.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to the employees, Bernabe said the fight with
Olivetti had known `'difficult moments,'' but that he had always
conducted it `'with maximum transparency and loyalty to the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernabe, who ended a six-year tenure as chairman of Eni, the
Italian energy giant, to run Telecom Italia, was credited with one
of the most dramatic turnarounds while at Eni, which had been
shaken by the Italian corruption investigations of the early 1990s.
He transformed it into one of Italy's most profitable corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dissenters from Olivetti's celebration was Nerio Nesi,
the economics spokesman for the Party of Italian Communists, a
leftist splinter group. Calling Friday `'the blackest of days,''
Nesi said Olivetti's victory likely meant ``thousands of lost
jobs.''

LOTTERY COST IS HEAVIEST FOR THE POOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   As a method of producing income for New Jersey, the lottery is
far less equitable than other historical sources of government
revenue, an analysis by The New York Times has found. At a time
when tax-conscious politicians are searching for ways to reduce
taxes on income and property, lotteries represent an inviting
option.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey income tax, for instance, was designed so that
tax rates rose as income rose. And state property taxes, although
not based on income, tend to reflect income and wealth. Residents
in the 100 highest-income ZIP codes paid income taxes of about 3
percent, triple the rate of those in the 100 lowest-income ZIPs,
according to the analysis of state tax data.
</P>
<P>
   Even the property tax was somewhat progressive, the analysis
showed, with effective tax rates in the highest-income areas about
10 percent higher than those in the lowest-income areas.
</P>
<P>
   But in an analysis of lottery and household-income data, the
analysis found that people in the lowest-income ZIP codes spent
more than 1 percent of their income in 1998 on lottery games _ not
including Pick 3, which could not be analyzed _ while those who
live in the 100 highest-income ZIP codes spent less than 0.25
percent of their income on the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very regressive,'' said Charles Clotfelter, a Duke
University researcher and author of ``Selling Hope,'' a 1989 book
on state lotteries. ``The percentage of a poor person's income that
this kind of tax takes is much greater than for middle- and
upper-income people.''

   The Internet, the SEC and Stock Giveaways
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission may be trying hard to
keep up with what is happening on the Internet. But the Internet
seems to be falling behind on what is happening at the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the view of Stephen Schulte, a securities
lawyer at Schulte Roth &AMP; Zabel in New York who specializes in
Internet issues. As evidence, Schulte points to the continuing
proliferation of ``free stock'' programs on the Net despite clear
SEC warnings that such giveaways risk running afoul of federal
securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   Since April 1998, when Travelzoo.com offered free shares to
people who registered on its Web site, stock giveaways have become
the rage. There is even a Web site
(www.che.wsu.edu/fountain/contents/stock1.htm) devoted to tracking
the other Web sites offering free stock.
</P>
<P>
   Giveaways have been the subject of SEC attention since at least
the 1970s. Consumers getting such shares usually run no risks. But
the companies issuing them are not so lucky. In its older cases,
the commission's legal staff has determined that securities offered
in exchange for something of value must be registered, unless the
company fits within certain limited exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the SEC has issued ``no action'' letters
advising several young Internet businesses that shares offered to
those who visit their Web sites are not really ``free,'' as that
term is defined in federal securities laws. Some of those companies
have put their offers on hold while their lawyers negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   If the commission's advice wasn't clear enough, Schulte said, a
senior SEC staff member told a conference in late February that
```free' stock is a misnomer'' because ``registration with a Web
site provides value to the site's owner and therefore involves
consideration.'' Thus, Schulte added, the SEC staff ``has sent a
clear message'' that unregistered stock giveaways are probably a
no-no.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, this may be a case of message sent, but not
received,'' Schulte said. True, he acknowledged, some companies say
they have suspended their programs ``pending SEC clarification.''
But he added, ``What further clarification do they need?''

   An Oppenheimer Manager Smiles at Buffett's Investment
</P>
<P>
   No, Frank Jennings did not raise a toast to Warren Buffett last
Tuesday, when news surfaced that Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett's
company, held a 2.2 percent stake in the liquor giant Allied
Domecq.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged, ``It cheered me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings is manager of the top-performing Oppenheimer Global
Growth and Income fund, which has held the stock for more than
three years but has barely seen it budge. When Buffett's move was
reported in The Guardian, a British newspaper, Allied Domecq shares
rose 25 pence, or 4.7 percent, to close at 555.5 pence.
</P>
<P>
   According to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher,
Jennings' $576 million fund at last count held the biggest
concentration of Allied Domecq shares of any U.S. offering, at 4.1
percent of total assets.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, who says run-ups of other holdings have recently cut
his Allied Domecq stake to slightly more than 3 percent, is still
bullish on the stock. He figures that Allied Domecq, whose liquor
business includes Ballantine's Scotch whisky and Beefeater gin,
should rise 25 percent annually over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   His math is pretty simple: Allied Domecq stock yields about 5
percent. The company's earnings should grow 10 percent a year on
what he calls a ``normalized basis,'' that is, assuming that Allied
Domecq takes the steps to maximize returns. As earnings grow, the
P/E should rise 10 percent a year as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings expects Allied Domecq to sell its chain of 3,600 pubs,
already on the block, and perhaps its Baskin-Robbins ice cream and
Dunkin Donuts food chains, using the proceeds to buy more liquor
brands as well as its own shares.
</P>
<P>
   A fairly conservative manager, Jennings describes himself as a
``Muld'' investor _ for ``Massive Upside, Limited Downside.'' He
added, ``I'm always looking for a reason not to lose my shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the paltry returns of his Allied Domecq stake so far, he
said he is patient. He added, ``Buffett is willing to wait _ I
think.''

WITH ASSETS PUMPED UP, FEW WORRY ABOUT INFLATION

 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Inflation is back: Not rising prices, except for an
uncharacteristic spurt in April, but the perennial debate about the
sacrifices that must be made when inflation does turn into a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is premature. The 0.7 percent jump in the Consumer
Price Index last month appears to have been an anomaly, reflecting
a set of circumstances not likely to be repeated in May. But the
April jump was the largest for a single month in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   And the Federal Reserve compounded the alarm by announcing last
Tuesday that, while it was not yet raising interest rates to slow
the economy and head off inflation, it was leaning that way,
``concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary
imbalances.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, then, a debate has revived that had lain dormant
during more than two years of very modest inflation. But the terms
of the debate have changed; the issues are different, and the
public's perception of inflation is drastically altered.
</P>
<P>
   The old alarm is missing, for one thing. The CPI may have jumped
in April, but Americans took no notice, according to the University
of Michigan's consumer surveys. ``They don't think any price
increases will stick,'' said Richard Curtin, director of the
surveys. He added that people are more relaxed about inflation than
at any time since the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   That is a considerable change. Three years ago, there was talk
among policy makers of reducing the annual inflation rate to zero,
even if that meant suffering higher unemployment. And people
listened respectfully.
</P>
<P>
   Now that talk is gone. An inflation rate of 1.5 to 2 percent
(the CPI's range for most of the past year) makes no one nervous
today, and a rise to 3 percent seems tolerable to the public, if
not to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   After all, no homeowner _ and most of the nation's families are
homeowners _ is complaining about housing prices, which have been
rising briskly in most regions. Or, as Curtin put it, ``An
important element of the strong consumer confidence today is this
rise in the value of physical assets.''
</P>
<P>
   The revived inflation debate is also taking place in an altered
context. Inflation in America is no longer viewed as a national
phenomenon, but seen as a global one. The American economy can
indeed operate full-blast without the shortages that push up
prices, as long as enough other countries can supplement American
production by diverting their unsold merchandise and their idle
labor to America's needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis and its aftermath have forced that perception
into everyone's consciousness. Faced with recession and weak
consumer demand at home, companies in Asia, Europe and Latin
America have been sending their wares to the United States at
discount prices.
</P>
<P>
   And, gradually, officials and economists are coming to the view
that without this flood of imports, the inflation rate in the
United States could not have remained so low through three years of
expansion and the labor shortages it produced.
</P>
<P>
   Excess global capacity is the new buzz phrase, representing a
concept that three years ago most economists and policy makers
thought impossible. Supply used to be considered something that
rapidly fell in line with demand.
</P>
<P>
   Now oversupply _ caused by excess capacity, if not in the United
States, then somewhere else _ is recognized as a persistent
problem. And deflation, a word shunned in the old inflation debate,
is a common concern in the new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The global economy has become the new wild card in making
policy to control inflation,'' said Stephen S. Roach, chief
economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   This new emphasis showed itself last Tuesday in the reaction of
the National Association of Manufacturers to the Fed's inflation
concerns. The manufacturers, who often complain that they cannot
raise prices because of global competition, urged the Fed to hold
interest rates steady because of ``the general weakness of global
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, when the Commerce Department announced that the
trade deficit had widened in March, because of a big jump in
imports, some Wall Street economists welcomed the news instead of
wringing their hands as they once would have. The former thinking
was that trade deficits pull the United States deeper into debt to
foreign lenders who finance the nation's excess spending on
imports.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually this borrowing can depress the dollar, and a weaker
dollar then makes imports more expensive for Americans, pushing up
the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   That may yet happen. But it was not uppermost last week in the
minds of the economists at Bankers Trust. They applauded. ``A
burgeoning trade deficit continues to act as a safety valve for the
U.S. economy,'' they told clients, ``siphoning production away from
potentially overheating domestic industries and thus helping keep
inflation tame.''
</P>
<P>
   The new inflation debate is fundamentally altered in another
way. Nothing used to be of greater concern than the trade-off
between domestic unemployment and domestic inflation, a concept
embodied in the acronym NAIRU, short for nonaccelerating inflation
rate of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   When the unemployment rate fell too low, the theory said, labor
shortages would put upward pressure on wages, forcing employers to
increase prices. Nairu refers to the level of unemployment below
which this effect kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   But where is NAIRU, exactly? The common wisdom as recently as
1996 put it at 6 percent, or perhaps a bit lower. But the jobless
rate dropped below 5 percent nearly two years ago, and inflation
kept falling.
</P>
<P>
   Many explanations are offered for this uncoupling: job
insecurity, weak labor unions, temporary workers, a more productive
labor force, the global economy. Whatever the cause, NAIRU has lost
its clout in the new inflation debate _ ``sublimated by the
marvelous combination of low unemployment and low inflation,'' as
Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist, put it.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve, in these new circumstances, is much more
constrained. Labor shortages are no longer a persuasive reason for
raising interest rates to head off inflation. And when the Fed does
finally act, the communique will have to take a world view _
explaining convincingly how the global economy is now fomenting
inflation in America instead of stifling it.

U S WEST'S SOLOMON D. TRUJILLO: A CONVERT TO THE CULT OF THE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On May 10, a week before his company announced a $37 billion
merger with Global Crossing Ltd., Solomon D. Trujillo, chairman and
chief executive of U S West Inc., used lunch at a midtown Manhattan
hotel to emphasize his familiar philosophy on corporate
consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some that believe that bigger is better,'' he said.
``I'm not necessarily a subscriber to that theory. It is helpful,
but it is not sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   As telecommunications companies wheeled and dealt their way
around him over the last few years, he repeatedly offered U S West
investors that explanation for his aloofness. But when Trujillo,
47, announced his Global Crossing deal last week, he brought a new
message, one that seemed borrowed from those rivals: ``This merger
brings together the first mile, the last mile and everything in
between,'' he said in a news release. ``It opens up a new world of
advanced communications services to local customers across the
globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo's ability to shift his stance may be his strongest
asset as he tries to change U S West, considered the small,
slow-growing runt of the Baby Bell local phone family, into a
global communications force. But so far his investors have reason
to rue his newly aggressive style; both U S West and Global
Crossing are down sharply from when news of their talks emerged.
</P>
<P>
   As Trujillo's top lieutenants readily grant, investors are
having a tough time figuring out who will be in charge. At least
for now, Trujillo and Robert Annunziata, 50, Global Crossing's
chief executive, intend to share the chairman's and chief
executive's jobs at their merged company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of people not really understanding why
we did this and how it's going to come together,'' said Joseph R.
Zell, president of U S West's data networking unit. ``I think
they've gotten hung up on the dual-CEO thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In other deals, such cohabitation arrangements have often
expired soon after the ink was dry.
</P>
<P>
   The records of the two chiefs are sharply distinct. Annunziata,
one of the industry's leading deal makers, built Teleport
Communications Group into a major alternative local phone company
before selling it to AT&AMP;T. Trujillo, meanwhile, has found himself
running a laggard.
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo himself is anything but a laggard, answering the most
challenging questions about himself and his business quickly and
crisply, though some executives who have worked with him say his
intelligence about his industry is not always matched by a deft
managerial touch.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, two executive vice presidents have
left U S West, as has the manager of consumer services in the
United States. Their departure for new jobs at fast-growing data
communications companies may be due in part to the skills they
picked up because of Trujillo's strong focus on the Internet. But
other industry executives, like Edward E. Whitacre Jr., the
chairman of SBC Communications Inc., appear better able to inspire
their employees' zeal.
</P>
<P>
   SBC, in fact, has become one of the best performers among the
Bells, while U S West is among the worst. But that gap is closing,
and Trujillo's work ethic, described by Zell as his ``superhuman
requirements for minimal sleep,'' has played a major role.
</P>
<P>
   Along with listing the usual corporate and civic achievements,
Trujillo's official biography has Henry Cisneros, the former
secretary of Housing and Urban Development, calling him ``the most
important Hispanic in corporate America today.''
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo and his aides readily ascribe his drive to his
hardscrabble upbringing by his Mexican-American parents, Solomon
and Theresa Trujillo. They moved from New Mexico to Cheyenne, Wyo.,
where Trujillo was born, as the elder Solomon followed his work as
a laborer with the Union Pacific railroad. The son took his first
job at age 8, selling newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later I swept floors in a nickel-and-dime department store,''
Trujillo said on Thursday. ``Washing dishes, sacking groceries,
painted houses, moving furniture, washing dishes in college _ you
name a job, I've probably done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to his working-class background, U S West executives
like to describe Trujillo as ``not your typical Bell company
chairman.'' In fact, Trujillo, who began his communications career
with Mountain Bell in 1974 as a white-collar business forecaster,
had an easier start than some other phone company chiefs. Ivan G.
Seidenberg, Bell Atlantic's chairman, and Whitacre began their
careers with activities like splicing wires and hammering fence
posts.
</P>
<P>
   But Trujillo is unique among major communications executives in
attributing his first job to affirmative action. In 1973, AT&AMP;T, in
a settlement with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
agreed to hire more members of minority groups. The next year,
Trujillo graduated from the business school at the University of
Wyoming, where he had also gone as an undergraduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hired because of affirmative action,'' Trujillo said
over lunch. ``If I had applied the year before, I probably would
not have gotten in.''(BOX) &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arthur Levitt has talked plenty tough about policing
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Levitt is
the nation's top investment cop. He has often warned about the
dangers of on-line trading and prodded investors to make sure they
know what they are buying.
</P>
<P>
   He has cautioned on-line brokerage firms against promoting
themselves as a means to get rich quickly and urged them to better
explain to their customers the risks and costs of trading through
the new medium of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And he has cracked down on Internet investment fraud,
dispatching his new cyberforce of Internet regulators against stock
touts and illegal securities offerings.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is swell. But when Levitt had a chance last week to
show that the SEC will do much more than jawbone on-line brokerage
firms that put the larger investing public at risk, he pulled up
short.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC accused Datek Online Brokerage Services, one of the
fastest-growing on-line brokers, of dipping into customer funds to
meet its own financial obligations, a violation of federal
securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   Datek did it not once but 12 times in the spring of 1998, the
SEC said. In addition to not having the required reserves on hand,
the agency said, Datek filed a false report of its capital position
with the commission.
</P>
<P>
   But Datek got barely a slap on its cyberwrist. In one of those
peculiar lawyerly agreements to dispose of the charges against it,
Datek admitted nothing but agreed not to do it in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage firm will hire a consultant to make sure that it
follows the rules that it may or may not have violated. And the
firm agreed to pay a $50,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   That is roughly the amount of trading commissions that Datek
earns in the first half-hour of trading each day. And it is
minuscule compared with the $50 million that Datek, the
fourth-largest on-line broker, will spend this year to promote its
services.
</P>
<P>
   Datek and other on-line brokerage firms are at the epicenter of
a tectonic shift in the nation's securities markets. Island ECN, a
Datek affiliate, has filed for permission to become the nation's
newest stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Island and numerous other computerized trading systems have
attracted thousands of new investors eager to flex their newly
empowered status in the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   That raises questions about whether the regulatory systems built
to police an old way of doing business are adequate in a new world.
The SEC has already begun to look at whether on-line brokerage and
day-trading firms are doing everything they should to protect
customers, such as making sure their trades are being executed at
the best possible prices.
</P>
<P>
   But part of policing is penalizing wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walker, the SEC enforcement chief, says the treatment of
Datek was harsher than that in previous, similar cases. And he
contrasts Datek's actions, which he said were unintentional and
caused no customers to lose money, with cases in which frauds set
out to use the Internet to steal money from investors.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the latter such cases are worth prosecuting, but they
are the equivalent of sweeping three-card monte dealers off the
streets. Victims often ignore very visible warning signs, like
something-for-nothing promises, out of greed.
</P>
<P>
   The victims of a brokerage firm that is dipping into customer
funds, however, cannot possibly know what is going on. They need
the SEC to police the market's infrastructure with more than a
popgun.

CONFEDERATE SYMBOL BE COMES FLAG OF HATE  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, MAY 23)

<P>
   PHOENIX - To carry the Confederate battle flag onto the fields
of the Civil War was to take the death march.
</P>
<P>
   Blinded by the smoky fog of 19th-century warfare, Union soldiers
aimed for the bearer of this banner as it hovered above the haze.
Thousands of men and boys died under it, while rallying around it,
and even on top of it, shielding their treasure from bullets with
their brave, bloodied bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today their banner has become a bullet _ a bullet of hate.
</P>
<P>
   It evolved from a patriotic token hand-stitched by Virginia
women in the 1860s into a threat waved over the beaten bodies of
Blacks by the Ku Klux Klan in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a cherished symbol of Southern courage also is a racist
symbol used by White supremacist teens in Gilbert, Ariz. It
represents a shot of pain to Blacks, who once again are finding
themselves staring down a barrel of bigotry _ the weapon now buried
in the folds of a flag.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out over the campgrounds at the Country Thunder music
festival in Queen Creek, Ariz., a few weeks ago was like looking
over a Civil War battlefield of old: Confederate banners studded
the fields, flying high over the masses of trucks and tents.
</P>
<P>
   What was once a striking red, white and blue design now carries
many shades of gray.
</P>
<P>
   One group of music fans who flew the flag at Country Thunder saw
it as a symbol of simple rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not racist, just rebels,'' said Scott Taylor of
Cornville.
</P>
<P>
   Another teen was embracing his roots and the legacy of
Confederate bravery and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are from the South,'' said Gordon Miller of Mesa,
Ariz.``To me, that's what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet other campers admitted freely that they were picking up on
the prejudices of the Civil War era, carrying the flag to express a
deep hatred of Blacks based simply on their race.
</P>
<P>
   It's this message that has Blacks, such as Oscar Tillman, the
leader of the Arizona NAACP, who grew up in North Carolina in the
heart of the civil rights movement, shrinking from the flag upon
sight, as if it were a loaded gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the flag is a constant reminder of drinking at the
colored water fountains or waiting at the colored section of the
bus station where I grew up,'' he says. ``It's a constant reminder
of sitting in the house with the lights out, hiding as the Klan ran
up and down the road while flying the flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant reminder of seeing the cross being burned as a
kid, the flag flying over the smoke. It's a constant reminder of a
very dark past that in 1999 we are working not to ever have to deal
with again.''
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of the flag is chiefly in the eye of the beholder,
says Tony Horwitz, who covers the South for the ``Wall Street
Journal'' and is the author of the recent ``Confederates in the
Attic: Dispatches from the Unfinished Civil War.'' And this varied
lot of beholders has kept the debate over the flag burning long
after the smoke from the war cleared in 1865.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very powerful symbol in completely different ways,''
Horwitz says. ``It's revered to many White Southerners, and to many
Blacks, it's a swastika. That's why it's such an explosive issue:
There really is no middle ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Confederate battle flag glares from myriad places
with myriad meanings. It threatens from armbands on skinheads at
heavy metal concerts, appears as an adopted logo of country band
BlackHawk, and was flown as a symbol of rebellion by East Germans
as the Berlin Wall was ripped asunder.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate over which of these places is appropriate has
been heating up lately, as national events create groups today that
are as angry and divided as the North and South of old.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Black men who saw the flag as a threat gunned down a
Tennessee man partly because he flew the flag from his truck. In
1997, a Kansas seventh-grader was suspended for sketching a flag in
math class; also that year, fiery tempers erupted over the South
Carolina government's decision to leave the flag flying above the
state Capitol. And just recently, a South Carolina teacher was
fired over his refusal to hide his support of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   The issue smolders in Arizona, too. Country Thunder isn't the
only conduit for the Confederate flag here.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a ``White power'' group at Highland High School in
Gilbert, which police estimate is nearly 300 strong, told police
that they call themselves ``Confederates,'' which led
administrators to ban the increasingly obvious flag from campus.
When asked what the difference between their group and the KKK was,
the youths said ``nothing,'' adding that many members of the group
hope to one day join the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   It is this type of group that the flag's defenders say scar the
symbol's pure intent.
</P>
<P>
   To Chandler, Ariz.'s Tom Jacks, commander of the local Sons of
Confederate Veterans group, it's a symbol of his heritage,
desecrated by those who use it as a symbol of hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my duty to condemn those who, by their use of the
Confederate flag as a symbol of hate, have maligned and disgraced
the flag and the people who fought and died under it,'' he says.
``It's just a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   But Blacks like Phoenix's D.J. Jackson, who demonstrated for
civil rights here as a teen, view the flaunting of the banner as a
threat to their hard-won equality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts,'' he says. ``It hurts to know that you still have
people that don't see the light. There's bad in every race, good in
every race, there's everything in every race. Nobody's no better
than everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   But what puzzles him most is this:
</P>
<P>
   ``My ancestors were slaves, and every time I bring this up and
talk about what's happenning, I'm told to forget the past. But I
can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Horwitz, the central problem boils down to the
tendency of each side to split the flag's ``two histories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have one history without the other,'' he says. ``You
can't isolate them; it's an issue of context.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since the Civil War, there's been an attempt by
Southerners to distance the Confederacy from slavery. People want
to say Confederate symbols don't have connotations of slavery. We
can debate it till we're blue in the face, but we would not have
had the war without slavery. You can't separate the two.''
</P>
<P>
   This argument also benefits most of those who fly the flag as a
symbol of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though they try to separate the flag from its racist
connotations, you would find that they themselves would certainly
not see it as a racial symbol,'' Horwitz says. ``But they are still
proud of their ancestors who fought bravely, and no one wants to be
told to spit on their ancestors.'' This, Horwitz says, is what the
protesters and defenders alike must understand in order for this
issue to cool off.
</P>
<P>
   Those who see the flag as a symbol of the South must respect the
fact that it carries many more meanings, some of which are
offensive. Likewise, groups that the flag offends must understand
that not all of those who fly the banner are espousing racist
views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racially, we've come a very long way, but we're still debating
race and trying to work it out. We have to recognize that we still
have a long way to go,'' Horwitz says.
</P>
<P>
   Banning the flag altogether is not the answer, he says. Doing so
would be to commit an act of historical heresy to groups on each
side of the Mason-Dixon line. It would obliterate a relic fought
for by Southerners and defy a Constitution fought for by our
forefathers.
</P>
<P>
   Those that have adopted the flag as a message of hate must
simply be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing to do is to ignore it,'' Horwitz adds.
</P>
<P>
   Paul McMasters, defender of the First Amendment for the Freedom
Forum in Washington, says a ban would be a gross violation of the
First Amendment and perhaps a move that would turn an issue of
hurtful yet free expression into the explosive, angry weapons we so
fear today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the speech of the individual and the minority group that
must be protected by the Constitution. That includes the speech of
the revolutionary, the radical, the rascal and, yes, the racist,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that one of the lessons of the (Littleton, Colo.,
school shooting) is that we have to worry about how our school
officials are retreating behind closed doors so that kids are left
to work these things out by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more speech with our kids, not less. We need more
speech among our kids, not less, and more avenues of expression,
not less. As long as people are talking, we can deal with it. But
when those feelings turn inward and explode, we see why our
Founding Fathers put so much faith in freedom of expression.'' &QL;

INS BUST (Phoenix) - Federal authorities on Friday claimed they had
taken new ground in the battle against illegal immigration by
dismantling a Phoenix-based smuggling ring that brought to Arizona
and sent them on to destinations across the country. According an
official of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, undercover
investigators infiltrated the ring's operations in Honduras,
Guatemala and and El Salvador. By JERRY KAMMER. Story will move in

 &QL; 
COHOUSING (Prescott, Ariz.) - Picture the shared meals,
environmental sensitivity and fuzzy friendliness of a hippy
compound. Then add private homes and residents heading off in suits
and ties to typical jobs. The unlikely combination _ known as
``cohousing'' _ is the 21st century answer to the commune. It's a
group of a few dozen households, who own a huge ``common house''
for the community but also individual residences for each.
Arizona's first cohousing project is going up in Prescott, and two
others are in the works in Tucson. By KATHLEEN INGLEY. Story will

 &QL; 
HOME-IMPROVEMENT (Phoenix) - On the big hype-o-meter in the sky, TV
series finales will be forever judged against last year's
``Seinfeld'' sign-off. If that fevered extravaganza of hubbub rated
a 10, Tuesday's ``Home Improvement'' hits only about a 6. There's
been very little fuss over the departure of one of the most
successful sitcoms of this or any other era. ``I do think it was
underrated by the critics,'' said Earl Hindman, who plays
eccentric, unseen neighbor Wilson to Tim Allen's ever-affable Tim
Tyler. ``I do feel that in about 10 years, that people will look at
the show and go, `My gosh, it really was a good show in terms of
total honesty.' '' By DAVE WALKER. Story moved in the ``E''

 &HT;    Neighbors in demand for media interviews

<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ Skip Morgan and his friends shot hoops in his
driveway, watching the cars cruise into the quiet cul-de-sac, gaze
for a moment at the house at the end of the road, and then drive
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been doing it all day,'' he said. ``They just want to
see it, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The stately brick home, shaded by decades-old trees and blocked
off by a stretch of yellow crime-scene tape, has turned the quiet
subdivision into quite a draw. It belongs to the family of the
teen-ager accused of opening fire on a crowd of fellow students at
Heritage High School on Thursday, and it's become a magnet for
those wanting to know more about him.
</P>
<P>
   An armed sheriff's deputy kept everyone away from the home, even
neighbors who wanted to bring water to the suspect's pet beagle,
Gerald, moaning to the crowds from the hot cement driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Curiosity-seekers simply glanced at the two-story house with
broad windows and a winding drive for a moment before turning
around. Reporters _ though kept away from the home by the deputy _
stayed a bit longer, searching for neighbors who have talked to the
suspect, even for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, Skip had talked to so many reporters that
he believed it when his father called him to the phone, saying
anchor Bernard Shaw from CNN was on the line. It was really Skip's
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must have been 20 or 25 of them already,'' said Skip,
17, sipping a soda from a McDonald's cup. ``It got so busy, I had
to take a lunch break.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip and the 15-year-old suspect carpooled to summer school and
he was in the basement when the suspect proudly showed off his
parent's wood-and-glass gun cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect kept to himself, rarely hanging out outside his
home, Skip said. He had a basketball hoop at the end of his
driveway, but he never used it. He played baseball in a rec league
but wouldn't join neighborhood kids for games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just played on the Internet all the time,'' Skip said.
``His line was always busy when my sister would call his sister.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone who knew the suspect thought he was that
different.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Vander Meer, now a 17-year-old sophomore at Heritage
High, considers herself a friend of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock,'' she said. ``I started crying really bad
because I couldn't believe it was (him). ''
</P>
<P>
   Vander Meer said her friend was doing poorly in school, but
showed no signs of being seriously troubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know him; I can't even fathom why he did this,'' she said.
``I didn't want people to just think he always thought about this
stuff when he didn't really show any signs to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Other teens in the neighborhood had less contact with the
suspect. Heritage senior Mike Bouchard, 18, remembered the suspect
trying out for band as a freshman. He played with the drum line for
no longer than a couple of weeks, always standing in the back,
before quitting without a word to anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard didn't even know the suspect lived in his subdivision
until after the shooting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Schroeder, 14, rode the bus with the suspect every morning,
including Thursday. As always, he said, the suspect climbed onto
the bus and walked straight to the back, not talking to anybody. In
retrospect, he said, the teen seemed a little pale.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I really didn't notice anything,'' he said. ``It
just felt different.''
</P>
<P>
   Even people who barely knew the suspect attracted reporters.
Next-door neighbor Sue Kelly, a real estate agent for the
subdivision, spent several minutes with an NBC camera crew even
though she barely saw the families since selling them the home and
its acre-and-half lot a little more than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked them for neighbors,'' she said. ``Otherwise I wouldn't
have sold them the house.''

SCIENTISTS ACT TO CONTROL SPREADING SALMON VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mysterious virus that killed Atlantic salmon at a
Massachusetts fish hatchery last winter has been detected in fish
from three more Maine rivers, prompting a multi-state scientific
effort to understand the disease before it threatens the tiny
population of one of the Northeast's premier sport fish.
</P>
<P>
   None of the six salmon whose blood tested positive for the virus
this month showed signs of the tumors that killed salmon at the
North Attleborough federal hatchery. However, biologists were
concerned to find the virus at all: It has now been detected in
four of the seven Maine rivers that are the focus of efforts to
restore salmon runs decimated by dams and pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unsettling findings, state officials began releasing
2.3 million salmon fry into the rivers this month to boost
populations. Biologists said the young fish would have died in
captivity anyway because hatcheries lack facilities to raise salmon
to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The virus ``is certainly a cause for concern,'' said Donald
Hoenig, a Maine Department of Agriculture veterinarian who chairs
the state fish health technical committee. ``Whether we should be
alarmed at this point, I would hold off on that.''
</P>
<P>
   However, state and federal officials are taking no chances. They
are sending fish to a US Fish and Wildlife lab in West Virginia for
analysis and are holding for research 500 to 1,000 salmon fry whose
parents came from rivers where the virus has been detected.
Meanwhile, researchers at Cornell University are studying the
virus, and they have already developed an early detection test.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists hope that the so-called swim bladder sarcoma virus
has always been present at low levels in the Atlantic salmon
population, and they have only recently noticed it. They theorize
that the outbreak at the North Attleborough hatchery, which killed
82 of 276 salmon in one group, was triggered by stress not normally
found in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   But some observers fear the virus is a new invader, perhaps
imported by aquaculture facilities that raise salmon in pens on the
coast. Hoenig said aquaculture is an unlikely suspect since the
virus has not been detected among the pen-raised fish.
</P>
<P>
   Still, researchers have frustratingly little evidence since the
virus is newly discovered and there are few similar documented
outbreaks among fish.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's effort to rebuild salmon stock centers on hatcheries,
where fish are segregated according to the river their parents came
from. That way, each of the seven eastern Maine rivers in the
program gets a genetically separate population that returns each
year to spawn.
</P>
<P>
   After the outbreak at North Attleborough last year, state
officials had to quarantine a second hatchery that raised fish from
the same river, the Pleasant. Two of 150 salmon tested positive for
the virus, and all the fish were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Before releasing this year's fry, officials at the US Fish and
Wildlife Service hatchery in East Orland used the Cornell blood
test to determine if the virus was present. To their
disappointment, they found a small number of fish from the
Narraguagus, Machias, and East Machias rivers all carried the
virus, though they showed no signs of illness.
</P>
<P>
   John Coll, regional chief of fish health at the US Fish and
Wildlife Service in Pennsylvania, said he is encouraged that only
three adults out of more than 150 tested carried the virus, along
with another three juveniles, called smolts. However, he was quick
to avoid drawing conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure what it means yet,'' he adding that he expects
more testing in the fall when the fish return to spawn.

DEFICIENCIES SEEN IN SENATE GUN CONTROL MEASURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Democrats were claiming victory after the Senate
approved gun-control legislation this week, some of those who led
the fight for the bill waited only a few minutes to call for a
reality check.
</P>
<P>
   The measures passed by the Senate did little or nothing to
affect the 60 million handguns already in circulation, these
advocates said, and it is far from clear whether the political will
exists for the ultimate aim of some gun-control proponents, the
licensing and registration of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the talk about how school shootings have changed the
atmosphere on gun control, Senator Edward M. Kennedy said the
Senate measures _ such as requiring child safety locks on new
handguns and background checks on all gun-show purchases _ should
be considered a beginning, not an end.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans come to the opposite conclusion. Senate
majority leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, for example, said the
Senate action will awaken voters to what he considers the danger
that Democrats want to license guns, which the National Rifle
Association has been warning about for years.
</P>
<P>
   So the big question is whether the Senate's move on gun control
will lead to even tougher restrictions. In the coming weeks, the
House probably will approve a similar bill, but is not expected to
add stronger measures. If groundbreaking provisions are to be
enacted, a presidential candidate would have to make them a
campaign centerpiece and win election in order to implement them.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who has been urging his Senate colleagues to adopt
gun-control measures since his brother, President John F. Kennedy,
was assassinated in 1963, now hopes that Congress this year will
tackle controversial proposals such as forbidding anyone under 21
years old from possessing a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans refuse, Kennedy said, ``I believe this will haunt
them all the way to the 2000 election.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Thursday's 51-50 vote to require background checks
on all gun-show sales, with Vice President Al Gore needed to break
a tie, demonstrated how the atmosphere in Congress has changed
toward some gun-control issues. But the close vote also showed how
difficult it would be to pass even stronger measures. Even as
Democrats were hailing the gun-show victory, they were quietly
withdrawing an amendment that would have forbidden people under age
21 from possessing a handgun. The measure, which Gore supports,
probably would have been overwhelmingly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is one of a few major nations in the world
that does not require federal licensing of handguns, according to
the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. A United Nations survey of 49
countries found only the United States and the Czech Republic do
not have a firearm-licensing system. By comparison, the United
Kingdom and Japan ban all or most handguns. The UN study also
showed that the death rate from handguns in the United States is
13.7 per 100,000 people, three times the average of other countries
in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   This has led gun-control advocates to say gun licensing would
dramatically lower the death rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any regulation of handguns in the United States.
For all intents and purposes, we don't have gun control,'' said
Mark Pertschuk, legislative director of the Coalition to Stop Gun
Violence. ``It is amazing to me when we have a shooting, people
say, `It's the schools, teachers, the television.' What's needed is
incredibly simple. It's the guns.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Powers, an NRA spokesman, said gun-control advocates
are making the wrong comparison to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US is the only country on Earth with the Bill of Rights,''
Powers said. ``It is that document that separates us from other
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Powers was referring to the Second Amendment and the right to
possess guns. The amendment states: ``A well regulated Militia,
being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the
people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   To gun-control advocates, the licensing of guns would not
prohibit people from possessing them. While the NRA states that
convicted felons should not be allowed to buy or possess handguns,
the gun lobby says licensing is not the answer. The solution,
Powers said, would be for the Clinton administration to enforce
existing laws that make it a federal crime for felons to buy guns.
``The Bill of Rights is for law-abiding Americans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That argument resonates with many members of both parties,
especially in states with strong hunting traditions. For example,
Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat, is not about to sign
onto legislation that would require gun licensing, although he did
vote for the gun-show measure this week. During the Senate debate,
Leahy wandered into the press gallery to make sure reporters
realized which state has the fewest gun regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any gun laws,'' Leahy said proudly of Vermont,
other than to regulate hunting seasons. Scoffing at the argument
that tougher gun laws would lead to lower crime rates, he said
Vermont already has one of the lowest crime rates in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont is a unique state in many ways, but its gun tradition is
mirrored around the country. Leahy's stance demonstrates how
difficult it will be for Congress to go further than the Senate did
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, however, sees reasons for optimism and concern, but he
says he worries that Congress only seems to take action after a
shooting tragedy.

RUSSIA, US DEADLOCK OVER TROOP USE IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Three weeks of diplomatic efforts to end the
Kosovo conflict stalled Friday as Russia and the United States
failed to resolve a fundamental dispute over the role of NATO and
Serbian forces in a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic deadlock came as NATO continued its air raids on
Yugoslavia, killing at least 19 in a series of attacks on a jail in
Kosovo, according to Serb officials.
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's chief Balkans envoy, former prime minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, abruptly canceled negotiations with American and
European envoys, observers expressed growing pessimism over chances
for a diplomatic breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any breakthroughs or any breakdowns,'' said UN
special envoy Carl Bildt, Sweden's former prime minister, noting
that negotiations are expected to resume next week in Moscow. The
European Union's Kosovo envoy, Wolfgang Petritsch, said it is
likely to be ``several months'' before the bombing campaign ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meetings in Moscow have not yet delivered any positive
results,'' added Vladimir Lukin, head of the Russian parliament's
foreign relations committee. ``The US continues to take a very
stubborn, negative stance.'' He said NATO's demand that Yugoslavia
pull all its forces from Kosovo is ``tantamount to detaching the
province from Serbia. It means Yugoslavia's full capitulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia and Western powers agreed on a blueprint for peace on May
6. The so-called Group of 8 accord, which has been endorsed in
principle by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, calls for
withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo and the deployment of an
international security force to oversee the return of more than
800,000 refugees. Russia's acting foreign minister, Igor Ivanov,
said differences remain over the timing of a Serb withdrawal and
the composition of the force. Washington wants NATO to form its
backbone while Moscow wants the United Nations to select the
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, diplomats said there were increasing
signs that Milosevic's forces may be planning a military overthrow
of the pro-western Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro. Petritsch, an
Austrian ambassador, said Montenegro was ``moving closer'' to
falling victim to a ``creeping coup.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1,000 and 5,000 residents of the Montenegran town of
Cetinje held a demonstration Friday to protest the arrival of
hundreds of Yugoslav troops in their town. On Thursday, the
Yugoslav army sealed off Montenegro's border with Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The siege is tightening around Cetinje, but they will not
frighten us,'' the town's mayor, Savo Paraca, told the crowd. ``We
are telling the army today that it is not welcome in our city.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Milosevic insisted that the flight of hundreds of
thousands of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo in recent months was
prompted by NATO's bombing campaign. He said mediation efforts
should be handled by the United Nations, a move opposed by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calls for a peaceful and political solution, which Yugoslavia
supports, would prevail over the dictates of force,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a week-long lull, a new wave of some 3,700 refugees
crossed the border from Kosovo into Albania Friday. They denied
that NATO bombs caused them to flee, telling reporters and UN
officials that Serb forces had come knocking on their doors and
commanding that they leave.
</P>
<P>
   The Dubrava jail in Istok, Kosovo, was bombed six times Friday,
Yugoslav media reported. Prison Governor Aleksander Rakocevic said
prisoners and guards were among the casualties of one of the
daytime attacks. NATO planes targeted the prison again on Friday
evening but there were no immediate reports of further injuries or
damage at the complex 45 miles west of the Kosovo capital Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Serb officials said the 1,000-inmate prison held mainly
supporters of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. In Brussels,
Belgium, NATO officials said bombers were targeting a ``security
complex'' in Istok but had no word on casualties or other details.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO military spokesman in Brussels said Yugoslav special
police used in Kosovo were based at the prison complex and that it
was a staging point for both police and Yugoslav Army units
operating in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin Friday accused
Milosevic of seeking to deprive the United Nations of full access
to the more than 700,000 Kosovars driven from their homes inside
Kosovo by Serb authorities. He said a UN mission that arrived in
Yugoslavia last week to assess the humanitarian tragedy in the
region had been forced to spend most of its time investigating NATO
bombing sites in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential that the United Nations not allow itself to be
forced into cooperating with his agenda to use the mission to
generate favorable propaganda,'' Rubin said, noting that the team
had been allowed to visit Kosovo for only three days. ``It is
obvious that President Milosevic does not want the international
community to bear witness to events in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Sergei Lavrov,
condemned NATO's bombing of a hospital Wednesday night and
suggested that NATO's renewed air strikes on Belgrade may be aimed
at scuttling peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These so-called mistakes occur now daily and the only way to
stop this tragedy is to stop the bombing,'' said Lavrov. ``Just as
we try to achieve a settlement the bombing intensifies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this is not a deliberate attempt to undermine the
political settlement efforts,'' he added. ``What is going on in the
skies over Yugoslavia not only doesn't help but makes those efforts
much more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The sharp Russian response represents a serious challenge to US
efforts to prevent a deterioration in relations between Moscow and
Washington over the Kosovo conflict. ``The Clinton administration
thought it could bring the Russians onboard,'' said Gary Dempsey, a
Balkans analyst at the Cato Institute in Washington. ``That's
clearly not happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, meanwhile, said he and
Finnish President Martti Athisaari plan to return to Moscow next
week to resume negotiations with Chernomyrdin. The US ambassador to
the United Nations, Peter Burleigh, also assured Russia that
Washington ``is committed to a peaceful settlement'' of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials insisted that accusations of reckless NATO
targeting is unfair, noting that only 12 of the alliance's 10,000
fired missiles have gone astray. But NATO political spokesman
Jaimie Shea said NATO would not let up on its military campaign,
adding that the 19-nation alliance's unity is ``rock solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea, hinting at a potential buildup of NATO forces in the
Balkans, warned that nothing short of total capitulation to NATO's
demand by Yugoslavia would halt NATO bombings. Shea said NATO's
13,000 troops in Macedonia have been freed from humanitarian relief
duty, adding that an additional 3,000 would be in Macedonia within
two weeks. There have also been reports that NATO's commander, Gen.
Wesley K. Clark, has asked NATO to let hm assemble of force of up
50,000 troops along Kosovo's borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a capable so-called enabling force, advance guard
force,'' said Shea. He said it was up to NATO political leadership,
which will meet on the issue next week, to decided ``whether that
force is going to need to be reinforced in the near future to be
fully ready for the mission.''
</P>
<P>
   A debate in NATO over a the prospect of a land invasion has
driven a wedge between NATO's hawks and doves. While Britain has
pressed for NATO to prepare for a possible ground war, Germany and
others have openly opposed the plan. Clinton said he would rule
nothing out.
</P>
<P>
   Germany political leaders joined Italy Friday in calling for
greater caution in the NATO bombing operation, which has
accidentally struck hospitals, foreign embassies and ethnic
Albanian and Serb civilians since the conflict began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and
British Foreign Minister Robin Cook issued a joint denial that
there is a rift between Washington and London.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said any decision on sending ground forces
into Kosovo needs to be resolved in the next three weeks.
Otherwise, the allies will be unable to return the refugees to
their home before the Spring of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to have a decision on ground forces by the middle of
June,'' said Ivo Daalder, a former Balkans expert in the US
National Security Council. ``It takes two months to get the forces
in and one month to conduct the operation. By mid-September, you
have to start winterizing the camps. The refugees won't be able to
come back until the following spring.''

EDITORIAL: PATIENTS FOR HIRE, DOCTORS FOR SALE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, May 22:
</P>
<P>
   People go to doctors because they assume the doctor will tell
them what they need to do to stay healthy or get well. But in
articles published in The Times on Sunday and Monday, the reporters
Kurt Eichenwald and Gina Kolata have opened the door on a practice
of medicine that few of us knew existed _ a warped world in which
patients have become commodities, lured into research projects for
the profit of their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing to create a supermarket of new pills, the
pharmaceutical industry has created a frantic competition for
patients on whom new drugs must be tested before they can be
approved. A bounty system has evolved in which doctors are paid by
drug companies to enroll research subjects with certain kinds of
problems: $1,200 from Bayer for a patient with vaginitis; $2,955
from Merck for one with hypertension; $4,410 from SmithKline
Beecham for a willing diabetic.
</P>
<P>
   The devil's bargain is that the doctor knows that enrolling the
patient is worth money, but the patient does not. It is a
recruiting system with the potential to corrupt either the drug
companies, because they are forced to outbid one another for
patients, or the doctors, because they are tempted to enroll
patients who may not be medically appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The articles reveal a whole research universe slipping out of
control. A review by The Times of more than 300 recent drug
studies, and more than 200,000 government research request files,
found hundreds of thousands of patients involved and indications
that some doctors make $500,000 to $1 million a year in recruitment
bounties. One Southern California doctor now in prison forged his
patients' medical records and test results on a massive scale to
boost his income.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, most clinical trials of drugs were conducted by
doctors at medical research institutions. But that system proved
too slow at recruiting patients, so the drug companies and their
contractors turned to doctors in private practice, tripling their
number since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the monitoring systems to protect patient welfare,
already under fire for past performance, have shown no interest in
the ethical conflict of doctors being paid to recruit their own
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Dickey, president of the American Medical Association,
says that the bounty system is unethical by AMA standards and that
the organization will work with federal regulators to try to end
the practice. They need to act expeditiously. The patient search
has now begun to tap the poor populations of South America,
threatening to corrupt the practice of medicine even more widely.

BAY STATE FOREST RESOURCE IGNORED, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Forest covers more than 60 percent of Massachusetts,
but no one plans for the future of what may be the state's most
valuable natural resource, according to a new Harvard University
report. This results in woods that have little public identity,
reduced value to wildlife and limited lumber production.
</P>
<P>
   The report, warmly received by a legislative panel in Gardner
Friday, calls for more active management of the 3 million acres of
woodlands in the state, including logging to improve wildlife
habitat, a bigger wood products industry, and land set aside to
become the ``old growth'' forests of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is almost entirely a lack of attention to management or
any kind of evidence that people are putting the forest to work in
a systematic way,'' said Charles H.W. Foster, co-author of the
report, ``Thinking in Forest Time.'' ``We have a resource that in
many ways is lying fallow.''
</P>
<P>
   State Environmental Affairs Secretary Robert Durand praised
Foster's work, and he promised to ``lead the effort'' to begin
better managing both public and private land.
</P>
<P>
   ``In planning discussions in the past on environmental issues,
it was easy to neglect the forests because they don't have a
constituency,'' said Durand, a longtime champion of forest causes.
``I think we've finally got the right mix of decision-makers . . .
to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has completed a remarkable forest turnaround since
1860 when nearly 70 percent of the state was cleared for
agriculture. With the decline of farming, many fields have reverted
to forest, and today the US Forest Service estimates that 62.5
percent of the state is covered with trees.
</P>
<P>
   However, Foster and fellow Harvard Forest ecologist David R.
Foster argue that the return of the woods has been almost entirely
unguided, creating problems that most people don't even notice. For
instance, there are relatively few young forests in the state,
depriving animals that prefer forest clearings, such as many
songbirds, of their habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Durand was so concerned about the increasing density of the
state's forests that, while a state senator, he succeeded in adding
$10 million to the 1996 open space bond to pay for habitat
improvement projects such as forest thinning.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also suggest that the Massachusetts woods don't
produce nearly the amount of forest products they could, forcing
the state to import more from areas that may not have as stringent
environmental standards as Massachusetts. Underscoring that point,
the researchers delivered their findings in Gardner, the state's
furniture capital, at Wachusett Community College, which is seeking
new markets for Massachusetts wood.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Foster and David Foster called for the state to produce
30 percent of its own lumber, paper and other wood products,
compared to only a few percent of locally grown wood products
today. To discourage logging in ecologically valuable woods, the
researchers called for the state to buy timber rights on private
land.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers want a forest plan that allows for a mosaic
of forest types, including more land set aside to mature into old
growth forest. Currently, the state has barely 1,000 acres of old
growth that somehow avoided the woodsman's ax since the first
European colonists.
</P>
<P>
   And the researchers want a plan that private land owners will
follow, not just governments and land trusts. They pointed out that
private owners in one region of the state, the 1,800 square miles
on the north end of the Quabbin Reservoir, already follow a common
strategy to preserve the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a crucial point in time,'' said Charles Foster. ``We
have a chance for the first time in history to plan intelligently
for the forest.''
</P>
<P>
   Adopting the Harvard approach will mean more chainsaws in the
Massachusetts woods, but the researchers say the public needs to
understand that a managed forest is better for nature and the
economy as well, avoiding a binge of logging later when the state's
forests reach old age en masse.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the average citizen, the prospect of harvesting trees
triggers instant environmental concern, notwithstanding the fact
that carefully managed forests tend to provide more uses, values
and benefits than those lacking responsible stewardship,'' the
report concludes.

FENWAY OPPOSITION OUT IN LEFT FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where have you gone, Ted Mack? Please come back, Gene Jones,
wherever you are. For those of you who don't go back to black and
white television, Ted Mack was the host of the ``Original Amateur
Hour,'' which featured guys playing the clarinet with their left
ears, or someone with no fingers catching knives under his armpits.
Gene Jones was the local version of Mack, hosting ``Community
Auditions,'' which wasn't supposed to be hilarious but was, just as
it has been this week watching seemingly every citizen in these
parts have his say about Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about amateur night. Let's start with this one-liner. One
of the group wanting to preserve old Fenway (which doesn't look
like the new Fenway when you see the model) was asked where the
team would play while the park is being renovated. ``Can't they
just take the year off?'' Sure. The players will gladly sit out and
donate their salaries to the cause. And the American League will be
glad to have one team every day with no one to play. Great idea.
</P>
<P>
   How about this one, on the same subject, to the same group.
``What's wrong with playing in Foxborough?'' Isn't that a side
splitter. No way Jose. Playing in Foxborough, we might disturb the
people in the trailer park who want to die there. Seriously, where
do these people come from? Do they have no life?
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the question of the neighborhood and how it
will be affected. Consider that the Red Sox play 81 home games a
season. There are 365 days in the year. That means only one day out
of nearly every five is there a game in Fenway Park. On an average
game day, the neighborhood is impacted for about six hours tops.
It's been that way for close to 100 years and the new ballpark
isn't going to change it.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway Park was up and running before anyone in the neighborhood
who wants to gripe about it moved there. They had to know it was
there. I don't think anyone forced them to live there, and very few
of them own property there. Some of the best interviews come from
the property owners. All of a sudden Yawkey Way is Newbury Street,
our version of the Gold Coast. Of course this has nothing to do
with them trying to drive up the price when it comes to the land
being purchased. Example: Chuck Schmidt of the Detroit Lions said
Thursday that when his team first starting looking at land in
downtown Detroit for a stadium site, the cost was $15 per square
foot. By the time they went to eminent domain proceedings, and
court, it was up to $75 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   And I love all the talk about parking. The Yankees have been
playing in the Bronx forever, in a stadium that once held 70,000
and now holds 55,000, or 11,000 more than a new Fenway would seat.
There is next to no parking at Yankee Stadium. Yet they survive,
and the neighborhood is intact. The Red Sox have been around for
nearly a century. They have never gotten a cent off the city or
state, even though over that period they have meant hundreds of
millions of dollars to the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   This is not about some millionaires getting richer off the
public. Fifty-five percent of the money that will come from the
sale of the team, and the park, when it is completed, will go to
charity. That is written in Mrs. Yawkey's will. It has to happen.
This is a unique situation. Over the long haul, a new Fenway Park
will give a lot more back to the community than the community will
give to it. Meanwhile, let's hope we've had enough of the clown
shows. We went through this with Boston Garden. It's now a parking
lot and somehow we have survived. The economy of the state has not
collapsed.

in hockey, and (Patrick) Roy beat Detroit almost by himself. How
about Detroit? Everyone was saying how great the Red Wings were and
how smart they were to wrap up the Cup by getting (Chris) Chelios,

basketball and depth is the key factor. No matter who they play out
of that top 10, there is almost no dropoff. Jalen Rose doesn't even
start and he's become one of the most explosive players in the
game. I like Utah and their experience to make it from the West,
but Indiana to win it all.''

   Congratulations to Reggie Dupard, the Patriots' first-round pick
in 1986, for going back and getting his degree from SMU 13 years
after the fact. ``I'm sorry things didn't work out with the
Patriots,'' says Dupard, who now heads up a youth ministry in
Dallas. ``I injured my big toe the second week of camp and was
never the same. Something like Deion Sanders is going through down
here right now with the Cowboys. And with the Patriots I partied to
much. Never focused on football the way I should. I liked coach
(Raymond) Berry but playing on that team was like being in a Club
Med. A lot of parties and not enough focus on football. I played
five years in all, the last two in Washington, and then I gave it
up. Pro football for me was never what I hoped it would be. Now I'm
very happy with my life.''

   Bill Cleary has no one in mind to be the next head coach of
Harvard hockey. ``We had to put it out to bid and go through the
process. I've had a lot of calls from people who are interested.
When Ronn Tomassoni was here, I just never gave much thought to a
next hockey coach. We want a good person. We want someone who
understands what being involved with Harvard is and what it takes
to make this a successful program.'' My nominee is Ben Smith, a
Harvard man who coached the US women's team to the gold medal in
Nagano.

   How can anyone connected with the Patriots say they are
interested in running back Lawrence Phillips after taking such a

   Red Sox CEO John Harrington on the appraisals of major league
teams released by Forbes Magazine this week: ``They are not even

to them.''

   Former Syracuse running back Rob Konrad from North Andover, was
in Miami shopping for a new car this week. Shortly after he left a
dealership, he got a call on his cell phone from a Miami agent,
asking if he was happy with his agent. Konrad had to laugh because
he was sitting with Mike Clohisey, who works with agent Jack Mula
in Boston. Seems the dealership was tied to the Miami agent, who
has a reputation for trying to steal other agent's players.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of that, the going rate for college juniors who figure
to be first-round picks in the NFL is $1,500 a month, under the
table, from an agent, until the player is drafted. Meanwhile,
college coaches look the other way when the kid comes back to
school for his senior year wearing a $3,000 watch.

 &HT;    Task at hand deflected possibility of death for faculty hero
 &HT;    By Leon Stafford and Nathanial W. Cook
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ The assistant principal the nation is calling a
hero didn't realize how close he came to death until he lowered the
hammer of the loaded .357 Magnum that minutes before was pointed at
his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the gun cocked after he handed it to me, I knew it
was serious,'' Cecil Brinkley said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Heritage High School administrator had just coaxed the
weapon from a 15-year-old student who had briefly terrorized the
suburban Rockdale County campus. ``That's Cecil. If there was a
fight, he was always the first one there,'' said Jerry Johnston,
who worked with Brinkley at Heritage and has known him for 19
years.
</P>
<P>
   Students know Brinkley as a disciplinarian, said Jason McElroy,
a student at Heritage. While Brinkley is quiet and minds his own
business, the youngster said, students know they are in trouble if
sent to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you mess up, you're gonna pay,'' McElroy said. ``But he's a
good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley, a father of two and grandfather of six, is retiring in
September after 40 years in education. He is an avid reader and has
earned a reputation as one of the best gardeners around, said his
son Matt Brinkley, 30. Not surprisingly, since he grew up in a
farming family of 13 brothers and sisters in Greensboro, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Brinkley's family moved to Rockdale County in 1975. Both
of his children are Heritage High graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always consistent and has always known the difference
between right and wrong,'' Matt Brinkley said. ``A friend of mine
called me and said, 'That's what I expected your father to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Brinkley spent Friday in a whirlwind of interviews with
local and national news media. Dressed in a blue sportcoat and
khaki pants, he smiled shyly and spoke softly before the cameras,
downplaying his role in defusing the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just doing my job'' was his familiar refrain.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday started out like any other day, Brinkley recalled. He
sat down with his wife, Elizabeth, to eat breakfast around 5:50
a.m., stopping to say a prayer of thanks before enjoying his Basic4
cereal. They talked about her students at Salem High School, the
end of the school year and her impending retirement from teaching
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Brinkley kissed his wife, said goodbye and slid behind the
wheel of his beloved 1969 Buick station wagon, a vehicle known to
every student at Heritage High. It was 6:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:03 a.m., Rockdale police said, a 15-year-old sophomore
began spraying bullets at his classmates milling in the school's
common area before classes began.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley was in his office. He had already checked his mail,
grabbed the morning paper and run errands around the building. When
he heard a popping sound like firecrackers, his first thought was
that seniors were playing a prank again, like the crickets they
unleashed in the hallways the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I saw the students running in a panicked state and I knew
this was serious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley ran across the common area and out the door where the
armed student had apparently fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked to the left and saw him near the entrance to the
school, on the sidewalk, kneeled down,'' Brinkley said. ``He had
placed the pistol barrel in his mouth. I didn't know what he was
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy was about 40 to 50 feet away. Brinkley darted back into
the building and sped down a hallway parallel to the sidewalk. As
he came out of another door, he was within 10 feet of the student
with the gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pointed his pistol towards me,'' Brinkley said. ``I said,
'Give me the gun. Give me the gun.' He seemed nervous, but I knew I
needed to get the gun away from him. I kept saying 'Give me the
gun,' as I walked towards him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tense moments later, the boy finally lowered the barrel of the
.357-caliber handgun and placed the weapon in Brinkley's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got his pistol, he grabbed me and gave me a great big
bear hug, and he said, 'I'm scared.' He wasn't really crying, but
his voice was unsteady,'' Brinkley said.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant principal said the deadly violence a month earlier
at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., never entered his
mind while he was disarming the Heritage student.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ... see a situation that is so serious that something has
to be done, that you know you have to do what has to be done.

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ As graduation at Columbine High School
approached, Sara Martin, a senior and one of the commencement
speakers, said, ``I hope it's not going to be televised.'' Her
speech was personal. ``I don't want to be saying it to people in
Chicago. I want to be saying it to people in the front row and the
back row. There just needs to be a time when we can be ourselves
again.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But graduation will be broadcast live on Saturday, by CNN, as
has almost everything to do with the school since Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold began shooting classmates on April 20 and the first
news helicopters hovered overhead, showing students running and
diving for safety.
</P>
<P>
   As Columbine approaches the end of the school year, the
community finds itself struggling not only with its tragedy, but
also with how to reclaim its privacy. For on April 20 Columbine was
invaded not just by two troubled students, but also by nearly 1,000
journalist from around the world, so many that they quickly swamped
Denver's telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   In a drill made all too familiar by previous school shootings,
the news media not only set about reporting what had happened, but
also asking the victims, witnesses and their families to help
explain why. Columbine was a public tragedy, and there were
expectations: that those in its grip would open their lives and
talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   The expectations were not solely those of the news media. In
many cases they were shared by Columbine students and their
families, some grateful that people wanted to share their anguish,
others feeling their pain validated by the nation's attention,
still others feeling an obligation to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers found eager listeners, whether they were talking
through their own fears or praising slain friends. They also met
talk-show bookers, supermarket tabloids willing to pay the gunmen's
friends $10,000 for their ``personal stories,'' reporters offering
$500 for their yearbooks.
</P>
<P>
   The media outlets included networks, news magazines and large
newspapers (The New York Times sent several reporters), Rolling
Stone, ``Entertainment Tonight'' and MTV, small papers from other
states looking for ways Littleton was like home, media from Europe
and Asia reporting what the violence said about the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For residents who had been riveted to their own televisions
during other people's disasters _ the school shootings at
Jonesboro, Ark., the Oklahoma City bombing _ it was an eerie
reversal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know how those poor people in Oklahoma felt,'' said Lee
Andres, the high school's assistant vocal director. ``It's so weird
and surreal. You can't believe it's your school.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbine was a television event from the beginning; some
students trapped inside the school during the shooting called
television stations on their cellular phones. And from the
beginning that had positive and negative aspects for the
participants.
</P>
<P>
   As news helicopters hovered overhead, Steve Broder, a sophomore,
was in a room where students were trying to save the life of a
wounded science teacher, Dave Sanders. The helicopters, he said,
added to the general terror, because the students feared they would
immediately show any ``help'' signs they put up on windows _ and
the gunmen might be watching the televisions in classrooms
throughout the school.
</P>
<P>
   But across the community, parents and relatives depended on
television for information. Abby Chism, a junior at another high
school whose sister was a Columbine freshman, said she was grateful
for the television cameras, at least at first. ``I saw Amber
running out of the school on TV,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The needs of the community and the media began colliding in the
first hours. Gail Schneider, a mother who waited four and a half
hours before being reunited with her daughter, recalled leaving the
meeting place.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we were leaving, this lady said, `Ma'am, ma'am, I'm on
deadline, I need a few comments,' '' she said. ``I said, `I've been
waiting four and a half hours. There are no comments.' ''
</P>
<P>
   By the next morning, Clement Park, next to the high school, had
become a gathering spot for students. Because of that it was also
media headquarters. Satellite trucks were parked in rows, and
reporters and photographers roamed in search of interviews and
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers grieving mingled bizarrely with journalists working.
Here and there ranks of photographers focusing on one group of
crying students, or 8 or 10 reporters surrounded a single student.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for the students and their families, there was something
familiar as well as surreal about the scene. And some welcomed the
opportunity to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe they were there,'' Kevin Koeniger, a
junior, said of the network anchormen at the park. ``Dan Rather
doesn't really leave the studio unless something huge happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Koeniger said he was pleased that Rather wanted to interview
him. ``He was really cool,'' he said. ``He said he was sorry for
what happened. He really cared. I wanted to talk. I wanted to tell
the story of what happened to people who cared.''
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship between the teen-agers and the media was
complicated. ``Some people didn't give much sympathy,'' Mr.
Koeniger said. ``They just started talking. They didn't identify
themselves. They didn't even ask you if you want to be
interviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that news coverage swelled sympathy for the
school and helped make Clement Park a memorial, it also turned
ordinary hopes and dreams upside down for many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted Columbine to be famous,'' said Andres, the
choir assistant, who graduated from the school in 1980 and whose
father is the chairman of the music department.
</P>
<P>
   Famous for what?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, anything, I just wanted it to be famous for
something good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of great kids. You want to be known. You don't
want anyone to think of it as a symbol of tragedy and sadness.
That's just a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the sort of celebrity many wanted. Sara Martin, the
senior speaker, was interviewed by Time. ``At first I thought,
`This is really cool, I'm going to be in Time.' '' she said. ``Then
I realized, `I'm going to be in Time because they shot my
friends.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the students were in charge. Devon Adams, a friend
of Dylan Klebold, said she did interviews with Time, The New York
Times and CNN because she thought they were reputable and she
wanted to get out her message: Columbine was a good school. She did
not talk about Klebold, she said, because that would not have been
right.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adams said she turned down scores of other requests,
including one by the ``Today'' show. Her mother, Bee Adams, an
artist, admitted to a twinge of disappointment over that decision.
``She's more mature than I am,'' Mrs. Adams said. ``I would be
swayed by the `Today' show.''
</P>
<P>
   As reporters knocked on front doors and appeared at funeral
services, and anyone thought to know anything about the gunmen was
besieged by phone, a backlash set in. Families posted ``No Media''
signs on front doors, left ``No Media'' messages on their answering
machines, changed phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   By then, familiarity was teaching other lessons. Some people
were upset at inaccuracies, misspelled names or wrong ages of their
friends. Many thought that the Columbine High School they read and
heard about, as the media tried to explain the shootings, was not
the school they knew.
</P>
<P>
   Alisha Basore, a senior whose close friend Rachel Scott was
murdered, had gone on ``Larry King Live'' and participated in a CNN
town meeting and had been pleased with the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I got to reach a lot of people,'' she said. ``I
wanted to talk about the experience of it, the stupidity of it, the
shock of it. I got to tell everyone how I felt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miss Basore was furious when she encountered cameras at Miss
Scott's funeral. ``My best friend was killed,'' she said. ``It's
not a media event.''
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the school year approaching, the reporters began
returning. There was so much media interest in the Columbine
graduation that school officials decided to allow pool coverage,
including CNN, according to a district spokeswoman, Marilyn
Saltzman.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the television cameras, however, and the moment of
silence that will be observed for Lauren Townsend and Isiah Shoels,
the two seniors who were slain by the gunmen, and for Sanders, the
science teacher, the seniors are determined that their graduation
be a celebration, not another memorial. They have turned down
offers from Chuck Norris and Bill Cosby, among others, to speak at
graduation. They also turned down an offer from Hootie and the
Blowfish to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Columbine concert choir will sing, as it does every
year, and the speakers, according to tradition, will be two
seniors, Sara Martin and Jennifer Wallick.

MOORE WILL BE BACK ON FAMILIAR TURF AGAINST CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the desolate expanses of Oklahoma were producing millions
of barrels of oil in the 1970s, there were few indications the
region would ever produce soccer players. But when the North
American Soccer League created the Tulsa Roughnecks franchise, it
attracted an investor named Carl Moore, whose son would go on to
become one of the US national team's top goal scorers.
</P>
<P>
   Joe-Max Moore's interest in soccer began in Tulsa, where he
learned from watching the Roughnecks. But the NASL dried up by 1985
and the Moore family moved to Mission Viejo, Calif., where Joe-Max
could continue his soccer education. His competition would include
an obscure high schooler named Nomar Garciaparra, and one of his
major influences would be Sigi Schmid, his coach at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Moore is preparing to return to Southern California,
leading the Revolution into Sunday's match against the Los Angeles
Galaxy, now coached by Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sigi will prepare them well, no question,'' Moore said. ``He
will be an excellent professional coach. I wish the best for him,
but I have a job to do as well.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Moore will be on a goal-scoring mission. The Revolution
have not scored in 250 minutes of play, since Moore converted a
free kick in a 2-1 loss to Colorado May 1. Only one of his three
goals has been scored in the run of play. And the Revolution
haven't produced enough of the free kick chances Moore and Edwin
Gorter can convert.
</P>
<P>
   Simply, the Revolution have become a resourceful team
defensively. But they have yet to achieve a balance of defense and
offense. Once the defense broke down in last week's 2-0 loss to
Columbus, the Revolution did not seem dangerous enough to
retaliate, though they controlled the tempo for much of the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we're getting there as a team,'' Moore said. ``At
the beginning of the year, we were more a defensive and
counterattacking team. Against Columbus, we had more possession.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore has 26 goals in 58 games for the Revolution, a strike rate
of .448, among the best in Major League Soccer. The Revolution
could have one of the more potent attacks in the league with Moore
and Giovanni Savarese, who has 43 goals in 91 MLS appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gio and myself should have done more with what we got against
Columbus,'' Moore said. ``With me, it's a personal thing. I need to
focus a little more. We are creating opportunities, and it's a
matter of time before we put a couple of goals in and start
building confidence within the team.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This will only be Moore's second game for the Revolution at the
Rose Bowl. He missed previous games with injuries and national team
commitments . . . The Revolution fell twice to the Galaxy by 5-1
scores last year. After the second defeat, Walter Zenga replaced
Thomas Rongen as head coach.

GOLDMAN, SACHS HIRED TO HANDLE SALE OF THE JETS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The estate of Leon Hess announced Friday that it was
selling the Jets and had hired the investment firm Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co. to handle the process.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement had been expected since Hess died on May 7,
because people familiar with his wishes said he did not want to
pass the team on to his family.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Jets issued a statement regarding the estate's sale
of the team, Hess' will has not been filed in Surrogate's Court.
</P>
<P>
   The attractiveness of the Jets as a National Football League
team in the country's largest market is likely to yield a sale
price of at least $500 million, sports finance experts say. Hess
invested $250,000 in the team in 1963 with four other partners. He
bought out his last partner in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gutman, the team's president, will work with Goldman,
Sachs. The team emphasized that Coach Bill Parcells continues to
have ``complete authority'' over football operations and has the
full support of the Hess estate.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tagliabue, the NFL commissioner, discussed the estate's
plans earlier this week with John Hess, Leon's son. ``And he will
have further discussions with John,'' said Greg Aiello, a league
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets set no deadline, but if last year's sale of the
Cleveland Browns is a guide, the process could be completed before
the season starts. It may go quickly, especially because John Hess
is not expected to bid to keep the team in the family, as John Kent
Cooke did during his recent failed bid to buy the Washington
Redskins from his father's estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the wish of the New York Jets, the Hess family, and the
executors of the estate, that the 1999 season be dedicated to the
memory of Leon Hess,'' the Jets said in a statement announcing the
team's sale.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Goldman, Sachs is not surprising. It oversaw
the sale of the Browns last year for the NFL. Eric Grubman, a
managing director of Goldman, Sachs, managed the Browns' process,
has done investment work for John and Leon Hess at the family's
Amerada Hess oil business, and is expected to run the Jets' sale.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs is very likely to establish deadlines; produce a
prospectus for interested buyers; handle contacts with all bidders
and produce the highest price, and present the bids to the estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought my team through Goldman, Sachs, and they did an
excellent job,'' Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England
Patriots and chairman of the NFL. finance committee, said Friday.
``They extracted every bit and then some. They're very professional
and know all the nuances of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said his personal wish was that the team not be sold and
for John Hess to own the Jets.

BELL ATLANTIC TO OFFER REBATES IN MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Bell Atlantic Corp. Friday said that its three million
Massachusetts customers will share $38 million in rebates and rate
reduction this summer following a controversial state regulatory
decision on Wednesday that the company was no longer required to
pay fees for local calls headed to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the money already in escrow, Bell Atlantic Friday
said it will provide customers with a one-time $4 credit for each
telephone line and cut the cost of touchtone telephone service to
49 cents per month from 98 cents a month. Both pricing changes are
expected to take effect sometime this summer, a Bell Atlantic
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The lower telephone costs stem from a 3-2 vote by the
commissioners of the state Department of Telecommunications and
Energy over whether local calls to the Internet are truly local. If
a local call goes to an independent phone company, Bell Atlantic
has been paying fees, called recirprocal compensation to complete
the call.
</P>
<P>
   Three commissioners sided with Bell Atlantic's position that
Internet calls are very different from voice calls, because they
first are routed to an independent phone company, and then to an
Internet service provider which connects the customer to the
Internet. Thus, Bell Atlantic should not have to pay recirporocal
compensation, the company maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Two commissioners, including chairwoman Janet Gail Besser, sided
with independent telephone companies, which maintain the calls are
local and therefore they should receive reciprocal compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The DTE decision surprised some indpendent phone companies like
RNK Inc., a Stoughton, Mass. carrier that transfers Bell Atlantic
calls. Richard Koch, company president said the DTE decision will
sharply impact his business. He maintains his firm is owed $688,000
in reciprocal compensation from Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public deserves to get the $38 million, but Massachusetts
is the only state to have done this and it's wrong,'' said Koch. He
points to nine other states that have dealt with the same
reciprocal compensation issue and ruled in favor of independent
phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic officials maintain that the DTE's decision plugs a
``loophole,'' in no longer requiring middlemen, like independent
phone companies, to collect reciprocal compensation fees for
terminating calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the DTE not closed this loophole our ratepayers would have
been faced with a substantial annual rate increase to cover the
cost of these fees,'' said Robert Mudge, Bell Atlantic vice
president-Massachusetts. ``The consumer has clearly won with this
ruling.''

 &HT;    Barr: Don't blame guns for plague of violence
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Rep. Bob Barr says he plans to do whatever it
takes to stop guns from becoming ``the scapegoat'' on Capitol Hill
for teen violence.
</P>
<P>
   As the Georgia Republican sees it, guns are unfairly being
blamed for the wounding of six students Thursday at Heritage High
School near Conyers, Ga., and a shooting rampage that killed 15
people at a Colorado high school last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media will blame guns, not culture, parental
responsibility or school responsibility,'' said Barr, a board
member of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 15-year-old student who opened fire on his fellow
students at Heritage: ``I'm not interested in giving this kid bear
hugs _ they ought to put him in shackles,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile shooters should be tried as adults, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people are seriously asking themselves why this kid did
this,'' Barr said. ``I hope they realize that our culture is
responsible for this act, not our guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr is gearing up for an all-out battle next week when a
subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee holds a second
hearing on the causes of teen violence.
</P>
<P>
   Barr was distressed by the gun control measure approved in the
Senate on Thursday, saying it did not address the larger question
of why young people are becoming more violent today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some Republicans are operating more scared than
responsibly,'' said Barr, referring to the six Senate Republicans
who voted with Democrats to require background checks on all people
who buy firearms at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in Conyers ... would not be impacted by any of
the proposed laws or the ones that already exist,'' Barr said. ``We
have more gun control than we had 20 years ago, yet we have more
violence. Clearly the answer is not more laws.''

DEFENSE LAWYER DISPUTES LEWIS EARNINGS TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Had he lived, Celtics star Reggie Lewis would have
earned at least $117 million in his lifetime from playing,
endorsements, and broadcasting jobs, a sports agent testified
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And even if Lewis's career were cut short by a medical condition
_ such as the heart problem that killed him _ he still could have
made more than $41 million through coaching, marketing, and sports
commentary, agent Arn Tellem said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie Lewis had a brilliant career ahead of him as a
basketball player,'' said Tellem, testifying Friday in the medical
malpractice trial stemming from Lewis's death. ``There was no
reason to believe his career wouldn't have gone on for a long time
where he could have earned huge sums of money.''
</P>
<P>
   But an attorney for Lewis's chief cardiologist, Dr. Gilbert H.
Mudge Jr., called Tellem's estimates wildly inflated, noting that
Lewis's off-the-court earnings were negligible before his death,
and arguing that his medical troubles would have dramatically
reduced his value as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team isn't going to be as willing to pay large dollars to
someone who might be at medical risk,'' Dailey said in
cross-examining Tellem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a history of illness or injury, that will be a
factor in what you're able to negotiate for, isn't that right?''
Dailey asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there's no dispute,'' said Tellem.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's projected financial worth will be critical information
if jurors find Mudge liable for malpractice and award damages to
his widow, Donna Harris-Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven weeks after Lewis was discharged from Brigham and Women's
Hospital, where he was diagnosed by Mudge with a benign fainting
disorder rather than a potentially lethal heart condition, he
collapsed and died while shooting baskets at Brandeis University.
He was 27.
</P>
<P>
   Called as an expert witness by lawyers for Harris-Lewis, Tellem
_ whose client roster includes Red Sox star Nomar Garciaparra,
Baltimore Orioles slugger Albert Belle, and Los Angeles Lakers
guard Kobie Bryant _ described Lewis as ``one of the best players
in the NBA,'' and said the former Celtics captain was ``entering
the prime of his career'' at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Given Lewis's athletic talent, good looks, charisma, and
philanthropy, ``If handled right, there's no doubt in my mind he
would have reaped tremendous benefits . . . over the course of his
life,'' Tellem said.
</P>
<P>
   Tellem said his ``conservative'' estimate of Lewis's projected
earnings as an NBA player included about $100 million in salary
through 2005, when Lewis would have been nearly 40.
</P>
<P>
   Tellem also figured in $13.2 million in endorsement and
marketing revenues, such as product pitching, book deals, speaking
fees, and memorabilia sales, and $3.5 million in broadcasting jobs
after his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   If Lewis's health forced him to retire early, Tellem estimated
he could still make $25.6 million as an NBA coach if he held that
job at least until 2003, plus $12 million in broadcasting, and $3.5
million in endorsements and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   But Dailey was skeptical of Tellem's calculations, noting that
the salaries and endorsement fees paid to several other well-known
NBA players and coaches are well below what Tellem estimates Lewis
would have earned.
</P>
<P>
   Tellem retorted that other players' earnings or average NBA
salaries is ``of no relevance to what Reggie Lewis would make as a
player today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie Lewis was not an average player. That's an insult,''
Tellem said. ``He was an extraordinary player, and extraordinary
players are not compared to average players.''
</P>
<P>
   Dailey also questioned whether Lewis would have continued
playing basketball until age 40, noting that only about 32 percent
of NBA players are over 30, and that only about 8 percent are over
35.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that while Tellem estimated Lewis could earn in
excess of $13 million in marketing deals in his lifetime, the
player had earned less than $400,000 in endorsement fees in the
course of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Dailey also observed that several sports memorabilia and
merchandise companies have gone out of business in recent years,
and that Reebok _ which had an endorsement deal with Lewis _ has
begun terminating contracts with athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies have had problems recently . . . but others
have stepped in to pick up the slack,'' Tellem responded. He also
said the ``explosion in the '90s of technology and television
revenues and fan interest'' had to be considered when estimating
Lewis's future earning potential.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith instructed jurors that Tellem's
estimates were based on the assumption that ``Mr. Lewis, if
properly treated, would have been able to continue his basketball
career at the same level. . . . In other words, he would not have
been disabled by his medical condition.''

COMMENTARY: VISITING THE INS, SOMETHING OUT OF KAFKA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Vt.)   By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bonnie Blackwell is a Canadian scientist, the inventor
of a new technology for dating ancient objects. She was in New York
earlier this year when her mother became fatally ill in Canada.
This is the story of how employees of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service kept her from seeing her mother before she
died.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blackwell is married to an American, Joel Blickstein, a New
York City high school teacher. She has what is called a trade Nafta
visa, which entitles her to work in the United States on her
specialty. And she has a U.S. National Science Foundation grant for
that work.
</P>
<P>
   Last October her husband applied to bring her in as a relative.
They sent their documents to the INS office in New York. They got a
letter back from an INS office in Vermont saying they needed also
to apply for a change in her visa status to permanent resident: the
holder of a green card. It took them more than a month to find out,
in many telephone calls, how to do that. They filed in February.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Ms. Blackwell, who was in New York, made a visit to
Canada to do research at McMaster University. On her way back to
the U.S., a border agent warned her that once she had applied for a
green card, she should not leave the United States for Canada again
without first getting ``advance parole,'' a form I-130. If she
failed to get that, she could be barred from re-entering the U.S.
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blackwell spent many hours on the telephone finding out how
to get form I-130. She waited on hold for as long as two hours. In
February she mailed the application to the Vermont INS office. She
got a form back saying it should go not there but to ``the
appropriate office.'' After two more days of telephoning she found
out that that was New York.
</P>
<P>
   In April Ms. Blackwell learned that her mother, who was 90 years
old, was dying of cancer. The I-130 form said processing it would
take 30 days. It was more than that since she had filed, so she
made a series of fruitless telephone calls to the INS in New York
to see what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   On April 22 Ms. Blackwell went to the INS office in New York.
After waiting in line for hours, she reached a woman who slapped a
paper on the counter saying, ``It will now take 75 days to process
an I-130.'' When Ms. Blackwell said her mother was dying, the woman
said: ``The only thing we accept over the counter is proof that
there has been a death in the family. Anything else has to be done
by mail.'' Ms. Blackwell went home and sent an Express Mail letter.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother died on Saturday, April 24. On Monday, Ms. Blackwell
got the death certificate and went back to the INS office. After
waiting in line, she got to the counter at 11:30 _ to be told that
she had to be there by 11. But another INS man said he would see
what could be done.
</P>
<P>
   She sat in the dank, overcrowded waiting room until 4:30 in the
afternoon. Then another INS person called her name and told her,
``We've lost your papers; you'll have to come back tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The funeral was the next day. That morning at 9, Ms. Blackwell
put in a new I-130 application. At 2:30 p.m. she was told, ``We
don't have your pictures _ we've lost your entire file.'' She went
downstairs to a photo shop and got pictures of herself. At 4:45 she
was given the form I-130.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me two days to recover enough to drive to Canada,''
Ms. Blackwell said when I spoke to her. ``Every week my mother
would ask, `When are you going to come home and see me? I want to
see you one more time before I die.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand it. The INS presents a horrible view of
America, nasty and heartless. And individually Americans are so
nice _ they do all sorts of wonderful things for you.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked INS headquarters for a comment on Ms. Blackwell's case.
Bill Yates, deputy executive associate commissioner, telephoned me
and said the New York office had told him Ms. Blackwell had not
filed correctly. But he did not stop there. At my suggestion he
talked with Ms. Blackwell on the telephone. Then he called me back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe every word she said,'' Yates told me. ``I feel
terrible for what happened. This is a woman who followed the rules.
We failed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her we had plans underway to improve training and to
set up a national service center, with an 800 number where you can
talk to someone within 15 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Yates was impressive. But it will be hard to change the
culture that too many people encounter at the INS: a culture of
indifference and hostility.

TOBACCO SUITS AIM AT ADVERTISING CURBS NEAR SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA MASSEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Several of the nation's largest tobacco companies
filed suit in federal court Friday in an attempt to block the state
attorney general's consumer protection regulations aimed at curbing
cigarette advertising near Massachusetts schools.
</P>
<P>
   William Porter, deputy chief of the consumer protection and
anti-trust division of the attorney general's office, said Friday
night that he received copies of complaints filed by two of the
companies, Philip Morris Inc. and Lorillard Inc., late Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints allege that the attorney general's regulations
issued in January violate first amendment rights by ``severely
limiting the company's ability to communicate with adult smokers
about its products.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philip Morris complaint also claims that federal laws such
as the Cigarette Labeling Act include provisions prohibiting state
regulations such as Reilly's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general plans to actively and vigorously defend
these cases.'' Porter said. ``We'll do everything we can to keep
these rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 regulations, which were issued under the state's consumer
protection statute by former Attorney General Scott Harshbarger,
aim to curb sales and ban outward-facing tobacco billboards and
store ads at retail establishments within 1,000 feet of elementary
and middle schools, parks and playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Harshbarger said the new rules would ``end the
deceptive tactics used to market, sell and distribute tobacoo
products to our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Slated to take effect Aug. 1, the program has been praised by
anti-smoking forces as a potential national model for
tobacco-control.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Porter said the complaints come as no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was expected that the tobacco companies would challenge the
regulations,'' he said. ``It's not uncommon for them to challenge
anything that affects their business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Porter said he believes the allegationss will prove false.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general knows that his regulations are lawful,''
he said. ``They are not unconstitutional and they are not prempted
by federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he had not seen copies Friday night, Porter said two
other tobacco companies, R.G. Reynolds and Brown and Williams, told
lawyers for Phillip Morris that they planned to file suit Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for R.G. Reynolds confirmed Friday night that the
company had filed a complaint, but declined to discuss details of
the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers at Foley, Hoag and Elliot, the Boston firm representing
Brown and Williamson, were unavailable for comment Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are the four largest in the country and
manufacture such brands as Marlborough, Camel and Newport.

   Deciding the Destiny Of a 23-Acre Universe &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now that George Lucas has released yet another film about the
struggle for hegemony over the universe, he can turn his attention
to his own battle _ for control of a 23-acre patch of a San
Francisco park.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it is any old park. It is the Presidio, an urban
retreat twice the size of New York's Central Park, with miles of
hiking and biking trails, cliffs, beaches, a Redwood forest and a
hodgepodge of historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   A panel appointed by President Clinton to turn the 223-year-old
former military garrison into a self-sufficient national park plans
to pick a developer on Thursday for the Letterman Hospital site _
with the choice now down to Lucas and San Francisco's
father-and-son developers, Walter and Douglas Shorenstein.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas says he wants to build ``the world center for the digital
age,'' moving his Industrial Light and Magic special effects shop
and other businesses into the Presidio. The Shorensteins, with the
Interland Corp. of San Mateo, plan public attractions including an
American Indian Museum, with the Internet company Cnet Inc. as
their anchor tenant.
</P>
<P>
   Some nearby residents worry that ``Star Wars'' cult followers
will swarm to the park if Lucas, who released ``The Phantom
Menace'' last week, wins the contract. But Lucas has his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost 3,000 lunches a week when the Army left,'' said
Patricia Vaughey, a restaurant owner. ``We think there'd be more
money for us if Lucas comes.'' &QL;

   Celebrating Women's Success &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Once the women numbered only eight. This week, 800 were at the
annual Financial Women's Association dinner at the Grand Hyatt
Hotel in Manhattan, honoring Abby Joseph Cohen, who as Goldman,
Sachs' chief United States market strategist is Wall Street's most
influential bull, and Charlene Barshefsky, the United States Trade
Representative.
</P>
<P>
   Founded 43 years ago by the eight _ the (italics)only(end
italics) eight women on Wall Street then, said Lenore C. Albom, a
vice president at Chase Securities and the group's president _ the
association began as an alternative to the Men's Investment Club,
which had denied them membership.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Men's Investment Club no longer exists, and the
women's association is selling fund-raising tables at $5,000 a
clip.
</P>
<P>
   Both honorees wore their trademark silk scarves and both
presented rosy views of the American economy. Ms. Cohen was chosen
as a symbol of women's hopes and frustrations: long denied a
partnership at Goldman, Sachs, she finally gained one last year.
</P>
<P>
   In an introduction, Elaine Kloss, an agent with the New York
Life Insurance Co., repeated a favorite quip of Ms. Cohen's: ``I
believe that every male chief executive should have a working
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen's perspective on attaining that partnership? ``It was
not the defining moment of my life,'' she said, ``but it was very
pleasant.'' &QL;

   Earlier this month, in voice-mail messages to clients, he made
it clear that he regarded the circumstances surrounding the
collapse of merger talks between Nextel Communications and MCI
Worldcom as an affront.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the other side kept their trap shut, this would have been a
normal process,'' Grubman said, referring to news accounts about
the negotiations. ``We don't do that, and our clients don't do
that. Unfortunately, that's not true for other people on the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, in Grubman's view, was the fact that Walter Piecyk,
a former Nextel employee who is now an analyst at Paine Webber,
told his own clients that the Nextel-MCI Worldcom talks might be
revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is dead,'' Grubman said, challenging Piecyk's intelligence
in insulting terms before saying that he was in some of the talks
but Piecyk wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Grubman said he merely wanted to correct some
investors' impression that Piecyk's career at Nextel had given him
some inside information about the company's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Piecyk basked in the attention. ``We continue to stand by our
call,'' he said. ``I'm flattered by the concept that I could have
that large an impact on Worldcom, a stock I don't even cover.''

SIMMONS COLLEGE OBSERVES ITS 100TH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In the 1800s, John Simmons became one of the country's
richest men from the suits sewn by his women employees in Quincy
Market.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Simmons, the inventor of ready-made clothing, left
his fortune to create ``Simmons' Female College.''
</P>
<P>
   While other women's colleges modeled themselves on the
classical, liberal arts education provided to men at Harvard and
Yale, Simmons wanted his college to be the MIT for women. At a time
when most women didn't work, he wanted them to leave college with a
career, not just a diploma, suitors and good-lady etiquette. He
wanted them to be able to earn their own living.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred years later, the mission hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This educational institution is absolutely grounded on the
current reality of work,'' said senior vice president Lisa
Chapnick.
</P>
<P>
   The first four-year women's college to combine liberal arts with
career preparation celebrates the 100th anniversary of its charter
signing on Monday. Next Friday, Governor Paul Celluci will declare
``Simmons College Day.'' His wife, Janet, graduated from Simmons'
library school in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Situated in the Fenway next to the Isabella Stewart Gardner
Museum, Simmons is described by its president Daniel Cheever Jr. as
a ``small university'' with its all-women undergraduate college and
four graduate schools.
</P>
<P>
   While many women's colleges are struggling to define their
mission and hold onto their enrollment, Simmons has kept its
reputation as a school where its graduates are prepared for the
working world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what we do well in,'' Cheever said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the practical aspect of Simmons that appealed to junior
Ramsey Alwin, who is majoring in education and sociology with a
minor in political science.
</P>
<P>
   ``The academic knowledge and vocational training skills are good
complements,'' said Alwin, who plans to teach for a few years
before going on to law school.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive academics at Simmons ``has made me concentrate
on my education,'' said Marie Celestin, 23, who decided to transfer
from the University of Massachusetts-Boston last year after helping
plan a conference on women at Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simmons forces me to look at myself as a priority,'' said
Celestin, who is originally from Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons has distinguished itself with such career-oriented
programs as its highly ranked Graduate School of Library and
Information Science, one of the first of its kind. In 1904, the
Graduate School of Social Work became the first
academically-affiliated school of social work in the nation. The
Graduate School of Management is the only business school in the
world designed exclusively for women.
</P>
<P>
   Cheever, who has been president for the last four years, said
the college had been in a slump before his arrival. Enrollments at
some of the schools had dropped, faculty had been cut and the
operating budget had lost money for the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not large amounts, but they were running deficits. There was a
big backlog of projects. Capital improvement projects that needed
to be attended to. The nine residence halls all needed
renovation,'' Cheever said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, the school is thriving, with rising enrollment and
``modest financial surpluses.'' said Cheever. Simmons has about
1,200 undergraduate women and almost 2,200 graduate students. The
graduate schools are co-ed, with the exception of the business
school. Its endowment has almost tripled over the last decade to
$147 million today.
</P>
<P>
   The school has ambitious plans to expand. Last week, the
president presented to the board of trustees a strategic plan that
calls for eight new degrees and programs by 2003, including a new
bachelor's degree in social work. Also included is one of the
nation's first clinical doctorate programs in physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Simmons will add 13 accelerated bachelor's/master's
degree programs. ``A bachelor's degree used to be enough. Now in
many areas, a master's degree is required,'' Chapnick said.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Cheever says he will present a plan to renovate
three residence halls and student center.
</P>
<P>
   Even during the school's troubled years, ``the faculty and
programs were very solid.'' It was a college adviser, Margaret
Hennig, who inspired Ann Fudge, executive vice president of Krafts
Foods and president of the Maxwell House division, to pursue a
career in business. Fudge credits Simmons for her position as one
of the highest-ranking women in corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably wasn't able to appreciate the value of Simmons
until I was in Harvard Business School,'' she said.

DEFENSE LAWYER DISPUTES LEWIS EARNINGS TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Had he lived, Celtics star Reggie Lewis would have
earned at least $117 million in his lifetime from playing,
endorsements, and broadcasting jobs, a sports agent testified
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And even if Lewis's career were cut short by a medical condition
_ such as the heart problem that killed him _ he still could have
made more than $41 million through coaching, marketing, and sports
commentary, agent Arn Tellem said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie Lewis had a brilliant career ahead of him as a
basketball player,'' said Tellem, testifying Friday in the medical
malpractice trial stemming from Lewis's death. ``There was no
reason to believe his career wouldn't have gone on for a long time
where he could have earned huge sums of money.''
</P>
<P>
   But an attorney for Lewis's chief cardiologist, Dr. Gilbert H.
Mudge Jr., called Tellem's estimates wildly inflated, noting that
Lewis's off-the-court earnings were negligible before his death,
and arguing that his medical troubles would have dramatically
reduced his value as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team isn't going to be as willing to pay large dollars to
someone who might be at medical risk,'' Dailey said in
cross-examining Tellem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a history of illness or injury, that will be a
factor in what you're able to negotiate for, isn't that right?''
Dailey asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there's no dispute,'' said Tellem.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's projected financial worth will be critical information
if jurors find Mudge liable for malpractice and award damages to
his widow, Donna Harris-Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven weeks after Lewis was discharged from Brigham and Women's
Hospital, where he was diagnosed by Mudge with a benign fainting
disorder rather than a potentially lethal heart condition, he
collapsed and died while shooting baskets at Brandeis University.
He was 27.
</P>
<P>
   Called as an expert witness by lawyers for Harris-Lewis, Tellem
_ whose client roster includes Red Sox star Nomar Garciaparra,
Baltimore Orioles slugger Albert Belle, and Los Angeles Lakers
guard Kobie Bryant _ described Lewis as ``one of the best players
in the NBA,'' and said the former Celtics captain was ``entering
the prime of his career'' at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Given Lewis's athletic talent, good looks, charisma, and
philanthropy, ``If handled right, there's no doubt in my mind he
would have reaped tremendous benefits . . . over the course of his
life,'' Tellem said.
</P>
<P>
   Tellem said his ``conservative'' estimate of Lewis's projected
earnings as an NBA player included about $100 million in salary
through 2005, when Lewis would have been nearly 40.
</P>
<P>
   Tellem also figured in $13.2 million in endorsement and
marketing revenues, such as product pitching, book deals, speaking
fees, and memorabilia sales, and $3.5 million in broadcasting jobs
after his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   If Lewis's health forced him to retire early, Tellem estimated
he could still make $25.6 million as an NBA coach if he held that
job at least until 2003, plus $12 million in broadcasting, and $3.5
million in endorsements and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   But Dailey was skeptical of Tellem's calculations, noting that
the salaries and endorsement fees paid to several other well-known
NBA players and coaches are well below what Tellem estimates Lewis
would have earned.
</P>
<P>
   Tellem retorted that other players' earnings or average NBA
salaries is ``of no relevance to what Reggie Lewis would make as a
player today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie Lewis was not an average player. That's an insult,''
Tellem said. ``He was an extraordinary player, and extraordinary
players are not compared to average players.''
</P>
<P>
   Dailey also questioned whether Lewis would have continued
playing basketball until age 40, noting that only about 32 percent
of NBA players are over 30, and that only about 8 percent are over
35.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that while Tellem estimated Lewis could earn in
excess of $13 million in marketing deals in his lifetime, the
player had earned less than $400,000 in endorsement fees in the
course of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Dailey also observed that several sports memorabilia and
merchandise companies have gone out of business in recent years,
and that Reebok _ which had an endorsement deal with Lewis _ has
begun terminating contracts with athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies have had problems recently . . . but others
have stepped in to pick up the slack,'' Tellem responded. He also
said the ``explosion in the '90s of technology and television
revenues and fan interest'' had to be considered when estimating
Lewis's future earning potential.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith instructed jurors that Tellem's
estimates were based on the assumption that ``Mr. Lewis, if
properly treated, would have been able to continue his basketball
career at the same level. . . . In other words, he would not have
been disabled by his medical condition.''

TOBACCO SUITS AIM AT ADVERTISING CURBS NEAR SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA MASSEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Several of the nation's largest tobacco companies
filed suit in federal court Friday in an attempt to block the state
attorney general's consumer protection regulations aimed at curbing
cigarette advertising near Massachusetts schools.
</P>
<P>
   William Porter, deputy chief of the consumer protection and
anti-trust division of the attorney general's office, said Friday
night that he received copies of complaints filed by two of the
companies, Philip Morris Inc. and Lorillard Inc., late Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints allege that the attorney general's regulations
issued in January violate first amendment rights by ``severely
limiting the company's ability to communicate with adult smokers
about its products.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philip Morris complaint also claims that federal laws such
as the Cigarette Labeling Act include provisions prohibiting state
regulations such as Reilly's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general plans to actively and vigorously defend
these cases.'' Porter said. ``We'll do everything we can to keep
these rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 regulations, which were issued under the state's consumer
protection statute by former Attorney General Scott Harshbarger,
aim to curb sales and ban outward-facing tobacco billboards and
store ads at retail establishments within 1,000 feet of elementary
and middle schools, parks and playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Harshbarger said the new rules would ``end the
deceptive tactics used to market, sell and distribute tobacoo
products to our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Slated to take effect Aug. 1, the program has been praised by
anti-smoking forces as a potential national model for
tobacco-control.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Porter said the complaints come as no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was expected that the tobacco companies would challenge the
regulations,'' he said. ``It's not uncommon for them to challenge
anything that affects their business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Porter said he believes the allegationss will prove false.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general knows that his regulations are lawful,''
he said. ``They are not unconstitutional and they are not prempted
by federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he had not seen copies Friday night, Porter said two
other tobacco companies, R.G. Reynolds and Brown and Williams, told
lawyers for Phillip Morris that they planned to file suit Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for R.G. Reynolds confirmed Friday night that the
company had filed a complaint, but declined to discuss details of
the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers at Foley, Hoag and Elliot, the Boston firm representing
Brown and Williamson, were unavailable for comment Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are the four largest in the country and
manufacture such brands as Marlborough, Camel and Newport.

BIG EAST LIKELY TO GET VIRGINIA TECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Big East is about to get bigger. The question is will it be
better? Most seem to think not.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is the inclusion of Virginia Tech as the 14th member
of the basketball conference, a topic that will be debated the next
few days at the annual spring/summer meetings in Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Although it won't be voted upon this week _ that must be done at
the presidential level _ there seems little question that Tech,
already a member in football but playing in the Atlantic 10 in
other sports, will be added as the 14th basketball member.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't make any formal decision,'' said Big East
commissioner Mike Tranghese. ``But we are clearly going in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But why? When asked what the urgency was of adding Tech to a
basketball league that most feel has too many teams already, no one
had a reasonable explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is courting them, so I don't know why the Big East is
doing this,'' said an official familiar with the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Adding Tech would cause some major reshuffling in a league that
has grown from 10 to 13 teams in the past five years and is still
having trouble adjusting to the addition of West Virginia, Rutgers,
and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we have to do is go to two seven-team
divisions, and make a lot of changes in scheduling,'' said
Tranghese, who has successfully fought for a reduction in the
number of league games from 18 to 16, which will start next season.
``And the other thing that is clear is that not everyone is going
to New York (for the conference tournament). There isn't a format
that makes any sense that can make a 14-team tournament bracket
work. Someone is staying home.''
</P>
<P>
   More than someone. Tranghese would like to leave at least four
teams home, creating a more workable 10-team bracket in which the
top six have opening-round byes.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Big East gives first-round byes to the top three
teams and has a five-game schedule on the opening day of the
tournament, an arrangement that requires the first game to be
played at 11 in the morning, with a game going well past 11 at
night.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving teams home will be a touchy issue. ``It's very
sensitive,'' conceded Boston College athletic director Gene
DeFilippo. ``A lot of our fund-raising in basketball is predicated
on that trip to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, DeFilippo feels a sense of loyalty to Virginia Tech,
which has been a solid member of the eight-team football league and
recently has represented the conference in Bowl Championship Series
games in the Sugar and Orange Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Located in Blacksburg, Va., Tech is not near a major media
market. No other leagues are chasing the school and even if they
were, Big East football could survive the loss of Tech much easier
than it could handle being without Syracuse or Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to deal with it sooner rather than
later,'' said Tranghese, who must reconfigure basketball
regular-season schedules to preserve traditional rivalries in a
two-division league. ``If we don't do it now, the presidents will
do it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   That will happen sometime before the end of the summer and
beginning with the 2000-2001 basketball season, Virginia Tech will
likely be a full member of the Big East Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that will be a long-term benefit for a league remains to
be seen.

NO SURPRISES IN NBA LOTTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's NBA lottery is better known for what it hasn't than
what it has.
</P>
<P>
   There is no franchise or impact player. There is not even a
center by conventional standards. There is no Sunday television
audience. There are also three teams who have already traded their
picks and a fourth _ the Celtics _ who will likely surrender theirs
once the Ping-Pong balls tumble and the logo cards are unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   Everything will be known by Saturday _ 6:30 p.m. is when things
begin _ and shortly thereafter, barring a mathematical miracle, the
Celtics will say bye-bye to their pick and send it to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Boston isn't hoping to get into the top three
spots, the only ones selected by lottery, and thus save their pick.
(They keep it if it's 1-3.) The Celtics have a 3.7 percent chance
of landing the top pick, a 4.28 percent chance of getting the
second, and a gaudy 5.06 percent chance of picking third.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Chris Wallace and basketball operations
assistant Jeff Noyes will represent the Celtics in lovely Secaucus,
N.J. Wallace will get the face time on NBC while Noyes, accompanied
by a few good luck charms, including a 3-foot carved statue of a
leprechaun, will be in the back room where the numbered balls fall
and determine the fate of franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rick Pitino has predictably downplayed the whole thing
ever since he reluctantly traded Boston's pick to the Cavaliers as
part of the deal to acquire Vitaly Potapenko. He hasn't had much
luck at the lottery since taking over; his first lottery was when
San Antonio got Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland and Toronto could end up with two lottery picks
apiece. The Raptors have their own as well as that of Denver, part
of the Chauncey Billups trade. Phoenix has Dallas's pick from the
Steve Nash deal. Minnesota also will be a participant, owning the
Nets' choice as a result of the Stephon Marbury trade.
</P>
<P>
   After the first three spots are chosen, the teams then line up
in reverse order for drafting position. The Grizzlies finished with
the worst record in the league (8-42) and have the best
mathematical chance of getting the first pick _ 25 percent. The
Clippers (20 percent) and Bulls (15.7) have the next best chance.
Chicago is in the lottery for the first time on its own. It
previously took part with a New Jersey pick in 1989 and selected
Stacey King.
</P>
<P>
   The team with the best mathematical chance, however, rarely
comes up with the first pick. Denver was by far the worst team last
year _ winning 11 games _ and was shut out of the top two spots.
The Clippers, who had the third-worst record, got the first pick,
and Vancouver, tied for the fourth-worst record, got the second
choice. The last team to get the No. 1 pick and have the worst
record was the 1990 Nets, who took Derrick Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus No. 1 this time around is Lamar Odom, the
multitalented 6-foot-9-inch forward from Rhode Island. Others who
figure to be considered near the top are Duke's Elton Brand and
Maryland's Steve Francis. The Clippers might go local with UCLA's
Baron Davis if they pick near the top.
</P>
<P>
   Those four all are underclassmen coming out early, an unending
trend. The top seniors are Wally Szczerbiak, Andre Miller, and
Jason Terry. High schooler Jonathan Bender, a 6-11 center from
Picayune, Miss., is also considered a lottery pick.

BLACKS IN ATLANTA SEE TURNABOUT IN LATEST SHOOTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When a teenage gunman stormed his high school earlier
this week, transforming a quiet community into a symbol of
inexplicable violence, another nearby community had a few questions
to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Why did rich white suburbanites think they were so special? That
was what one black radio listener wanted to know in neighboring
downtown Atlanta, just 20 miles away, where weapons once pervaded
the public schools, and where inner-city minorities have long been
considered the most troubled youths around. Did suburban residents
like being cast as monsters? Didn't whites know that the black
community had faced up to the problem years ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a turn-the-tables kind of thing,'' said Royal
Marshall, a talk-show host at WCNN radio in Atlanta, where several
black listeners aired their views in the hours after the shooting.
``I don't want to quote Malcolm X all the time, but it is the
chickens coming home to roost. We should have been looking for
solutions all along.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the recent school shootings have been committed by
reasonably affluent young white males, raising questions across all
communities about why privileged children go astray. All have
defied the basic socioeconomic principle: poverty breeds violence.
</P>
<P>
   But never have the differing perceptions of black urban and
white suburban school violence been as striking as it was on
Thursday in Conyers, Ga., just minutes from the former violent
crime capital of the United States. The proximity of the two
communities has made residents of both wonder: Will suburbanites
ever let go of the perceptions that their neighborhoods are
completely safe and that the cities are hotbeds of crime?
</P>
<P>
   School crime has dropped within Atlanta in recent years,
mirroring trends in city schools nationwide. According to school
officials in Fulton County, where the 59,000-student population is
90 percent black, assaults declined 12 percent from 1988 to 1999;
robberies during that period dropped a full 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   School officials say improvements result largely from years of
practice in handling crime, as well as tough security measures. All
high schools and middle schools in Atlanta are equipped with metal
detectors; according to news accounts last year, students are even
offered a reward for turning in peers carrying weapons or illegal
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our numbers are coming down,'' said Lisa Smith, spokeswoman
for the Fulton County school system, whose domain includes Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the image of urban blight stubbornly persists. No
politicians were outraged by the 20 handguns found in city schools
last year. No headlines blared ``IT HAPPENED HERE'' _ as one did
Friday on the front page of the Atlanta Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if when crime occurs among black students in Atlanta
schools, Smith said, ``that's what everybody expects.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment may, in part, stem from Atlanta's
tale-of-two-cities sort of atmosphere, as a modern urban metropolis
surrounded by the rural traditions of the deep South. It may also
account for Atlanta's famously crowded suburbs, both black and
white, swelled from decades of flight from urban crime.
</P>
<P>
   So many residents live in the suburbs that Atlanta has
difficulty maintaining population; the highways leading in and out
of the city are so constantly jammed with commuters that Atlanta is
widely considered the worst traffic zone in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Thursday's shooting, several residents of Conyers,
whose racial composition is relatively mixed, said there was good
reason for the psychological barrier between Atlanta and its
environs.
</P>
<P>
   A white student who witnessed the shooting, William Britt, said
that if there was a turning of the tables, he believes that it was
because so many urban blacks had started to move into the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're experiencing what they've been experiencing all
along because they're coming down here,'' Britt, 18, a junior,
said. ``It's a chain of events.''
</P>
<P>
   And Brian Barnhardt, who was shot in the right buttock during
the rampage, said no comparison could be drawn between his hometown
and the neighboring metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even close to Atlanta like that,'' Barnhart, 16,
said Friday after returning home from the hospital. ``We're a small
town. We're a small county...I never thought it would happen
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that persistent interpretation of the suburbs _ even
though all of the high-profile school shootings in the last two
years have occurred outside cities _ will remain rooted in the
national psyche is impossible to tell, according to several
sociologists and health workers in Atlanta. Most were pessimistic,
partly because because the statistical picture remains: more
violent crime occurs in the city than in the suburbs. More urban
students are poor. And although there have not yet been any mass
shooting sprees, more urban students are caught with guns than
their suburban counterparts each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe not as many die at once, but people are getting shot
right here (in Atlanta), right now,'' said Downa Fuqua-Whitley, a
senior research associate at the Emory University School of Public
Health.
</P>
<P>
   But reflecting the complexity of the problem, she noted,
``Certainly in the Atlanta area, we've seen a decrease in some of
our rates, but people's perceptions have not gone along with that.
There's a `them' and an `us,' urban and suburban, and I don't know
if they could even breach that gap because they so strongly
dissociate themselves from other people.''
</P>
<P>
   After last month's school shooting in Littleton, Colo., in which
15 people died, Fuqua-Whitley conducted one of her regular focus
groups with city school children to discuss violence. None of the
children was surprised by, or wanted to dwell on, the Columbine
High School attack, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to talk about what was going on here in Atlanta,''
she said. ``But one or two in the group did express that when the
kids are white and rich and suburban, it gets a lot more
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, such public scrutiny has led not to widespread fear of
suburban life. Nor will it necessarily lead to a change in
perception of urban crime, according to Emory Professor Jennifer
Obidah, who conducts studies on urban youth and violence.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, Obidah said, is that suburban shootings are
portrayed as aberrations, not as part of a ``culture of violence,''
as black crimes were during the early 1990s when urban violence
peaked. Rather than comparing the circumstances of urban and
suburban crime _ holding them up to one another, for example, to
see whether all violent students feel alienated at home _ the
gunmen in each case have been scrutinized for what makes them
different from the rest of the suburbs, to allow everyone else to
feel safe, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're touching on issues of class and race,'' Obidah said.
``The good parents are the ones that go to work and provide for
their children. If you say these children are neglected, you're
undermining the whole conversation about who these parents believe
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the urban-suburban conversation was largely confined to
WCNN on Thursday, where no one was more eager to foster the debate
than the host. Marshall began the two-hour show with his own view:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad what happened at Columbine High School, the magnitude
of what happened,'' he said. ``It's sad what happened in Rockdale
County. It's terrible. But unfortunately...we saw this stuff
happening in the black community first. And now that it's
spreading, now we want gun control. Now we want to start praying.
Well, hell, we should have been praying 15 years ago when black
people died.''

PENTAGON BACKING BUILDUP OF NATO TROOPS AT KOSOVO BORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration announced Friday that
the United States would press its allies to move quickly to deploy
what was described as a peacekeeping force of about 50,000 troops
on the borders of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's announcement of support for such a force,
including 7,000 Americans, represented an effort to try to threaten
the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, and NATO was expected
to take up the issue early next week. Although the forces are
intended to be used to help return the Albanian refugees and to
police any agreement reached with the Serbs, NATO and the Pentagon
have left open the possibility that the troops could enter Kosovo
without his permission.
</P>
<P>
   As the administration sought to pressure Milosevic militarily,
officials said that the United States was negotiating with Russia
on concessions that would allow Milosevic to keep some forces in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic talks in Moscow between Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott and the Russian envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, Thursday
and Friday have centered on the NATO peacekeeping force going into
Kosovo in exchange for permitting some forces, under the control of
Slobodan Milosevic, to stay, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That would represent a significant shift from one of NATO's key
conditions for a peace agreement, that Milosevic must agree to his
soldiers and police leaving Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said as recently as
Thursday that one of NATO's war objectives was the departure of
``all'' of Milosevic's forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But a Clinton administration official suggested this position
would be finessed by ``all'' Yugoslav Army and Serbian police
forces having to leave the province as part of a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Serb soldiers and police would then be allowed to
return in designated numbers to protect Serb religious sites, serve
as tax and customs officials at the border and perhaps, to work in
limited numbers in a newly formed Kosovo police force.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott ended a round of talks with the Russians Friday and left
Moscow to spend the weekend in Washington. He said he would return
next week.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my talks here in Moscow this time have been
significantly constructive and serious to justify my coming back
yet again next week,'' Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, he met with Igor S. Ivanov, who was reappointed
by the new Russian government as foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On NATO's military front, the alliance's chief decision-making
body, the North Atlantic Council, is expected to meet early next
week to authorize the expanded peacekeeping force of about 50,000
and its earlier than expected formation.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain will argue that time is running
out for the positioning of the force if it is to be effective
before the winter arrives in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said the U.S. forces,
together with other NATO country soldiers, would initially move
into Macedonia. They would go ``as quickly as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration made the announcement after NATO's commander,
Gen. Wesley Clark, spent a day at the Pentagon this week outlining
the need for acting now.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has said that 7,000 American soldiers would
participate in the force. Before the air strikes began, the
Pentagon announced 4,500 Americans would be included in a smaller
peacekeeping force of 28,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   About 13,000 NATO troops, largely French and British, are
already in Macedonia as a vanguard for the peacekeeping force that
NATO wants to patrol Kosovo once the air strikes end.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 American troops are in Albania accompanying a fleet
of Apache helicopters and 8,000 Italian soldiers are also based in
northern Albania, working mainly on helping the ethnic Albanian
refugees expelled from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In tandem with the military moves, the administration appeared
to be pushing the diplomatic talks along.
</P>
<P>
   The White House wants to have a peace settlement on hand that
the Yugoslav leader will acquiesce to once he ``cries uncle,'' as
administration officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   To make this strategy work, the White House has bet on bringing
the Russian government as close as possible to NATO's demands and
then taking an agreement worked out with NATO and the Russians to
the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution passed by the Security Council would give a United
Nations mandate to a Kosovo peace agreement and isolate Milosevic,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants to have the United Nations resolution
passed in time for the summit of the leaders of the seven
industrialized countries and Russia _ known as the G-8 _in Cologne,
Germany, on June 18.
</P>
<P>
   The concession by the administration on allowing some Serb
forces in Kosovo hinges on the recognition by NATO at its summit
three weeks ago that after the war is over Kosovo would remain part
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sore point for the ethnic Albanians, on whose behalf
NATO has largely conducted its air war.
</P>
<P>
   For the ethnic Albanians who made up more than 90 percent of the
population of Kosovo before the air strikes and about half of whom
have been forcibly expelled by the Serbs, a goal of the air strikes
is the eventual independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians argue, according to an administration official,
that since NATO has agreed that Kosovo will remain a part of
Yugoslavia, Milosevic must be allowed ``expressions of
sovereignty'' within the police, military and border guards working
in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott was attempting to keep the scope of Milosevic's Serb
military presence on ``more of a model of park rangers than the
VJ,'' an administration official said, referring to the Yugoslav
Army.
</P>
<P>
   It would be unacceptable for NATO for Serbs to serve as border
guards, the official said. But there were other functions at the
border _ such as customs and tax collection _ that the Serbs might
be able to do, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians were ``trying to save face out of all this'' for
Milosevic, the official said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But for Milosevic to be allowed to keep some military or police
in Kosovo would present a major obstacle to one of NATO's war aims:
the return of the more than 700,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who
have been expelled from Kosovo by the Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has repeatedly stressed that an unnegotiable goal of the
war was for the ethnic Albanians, now stranded in Albania and
Macedonia, to return home.
</P>
<P>
   But the refugees, many of whom have been radicalized by the
terror and brutality of the Serbs, would be deterred from returning
if armed Serbs remain in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the presence of Milosevic's forces, no matter how
minimal, would make it highly unlikely that the guerrillas of the
Kosovo Liberation Army would agree to such a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership of the guerrillas have already said that they
will not disarm, a demand laid down by the group of seven
industrialized countries and Russia in Germany two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The basic aim of the guerrillas is the independence of Kosovo
and an agreement that solidifies Kosovo in any way as part of
Yugoslavia would represent a repudiation of those aims.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks Friday, Cook said the shape of the peace
settlement being fashioned has as its base line the agreement from
Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   In that agreement, the Serbs were allowed to have 2,500 police
and 2,500 soldiers of the Yugoslav Army. The administration wanted
to keep the number of Serb and Yugolsav forces below those figures,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Kosovo Liberation Army signed onto an agreement that
permitted even a minimal number of lightly armed Serbs or Yugoslav
soldiers in Kosovo, there was a high potential for violence between
the two groups, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a concern on our part that you don't put people there
as invitations for retaliation,'' the official said. ``We would
like to have as few as humanly possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping force would probably have a role in protecting
the Serb and Yugoslav forces and keeping them apart from ethnic
Albanians, he said.

 &HT;    `Compassionate' move makes final exams optional
 &HT;    By R. Robin McDonald and Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ Responding to a panicked and anguished community,
Rockdale County has effectively ended school for many students at
Heritage High School by making final exams optional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how difficult this has been. We want to be
compassionate,'' said school Superintendent Don Peccia.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage's principal will make the offer to students during
Monday announcements, when they return for classes for the first
time since six students were shot there Thursday. Students happy
with their grades so far will be excused from the finals planned
next week.
</P>
<P>
   The wild confusion of gunfire, bloodshed and frightened students
diving for cover has ended, but for many the terror continues. Some
700 people attended a meeting Friday morning at Heritage Hills
Baptist Church near the high school. People baffled and horrified
by the attack hugged and comforted each other as counselors and
school officials tried to answer questions. One wounded student,
Ryan Rosa, came on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Clark, a 16-year-old sophomore, said the morning bloodshed
at school revisited her in her sleep. ``I actually had a dream that
I got shot,'' she said. ``We were walking around school and a guy
came in shooting everybody, and we all died.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be in school as little as possible,'' said junior
Randy Norman. He has asked his girlfriend, who attends a separate
high school in the county, to beep him after every class.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage High will be open today from 8 a.m. to noon so students
can pick up belongings and talk to counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say they have finished investigating the school
scene, which was littered with a trail of hastily discarded book
bags when panic turned to pandemonium Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the shooting suspect, a Heritage High School
sophomore, had sawed most of the stock off a .22-caliber rifle and
strapped it inside his pants leg. A .357 magnum was stuffed in his
bookbag.
</P>
<P>
   He fired 14 shots, 11 from the rifle and three from the handgun,
as he shot six students in the school lobby near the cafeteria,
said Rockdale County Sheriff Jeff Wigington.
</P>
<P>
   As the students fled through doorways and scattered along halls,
teacher Carol Ingle hustled some into a closet. She calmed them by
quoting from the Book of Psalms.
</P>
<P>
   No one was critically injured, and all but two victims had been
released from hospitals Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the youth had broken into a locked gun cabinet in his
basement to get the guns. Authorities have traced the two weapons
from their point of purchase, though they declined to offer
details.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the troubled teen say he was distraught over a failed
romance. His targets seemed random, said witnesses, and the six
victims were all struck in the waist or below, leading some to
speculate that he was not aiming to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in this community, which has seen great growth but
retains much of its small town charm, said the fact that no one
died took some edge off the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, now they have a hero, Assistant Principal Cecil
Brinkley, who disarmed the youth.
</P>
<P>
   After the teen stopped shooting, he backed out of the building,
fell to his knees and placed the handgun in his mouth. For several
minutes, teachers and counselors tried to talk him out of killing
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ten feet from the suspect, Brinkley asked the 15-year-old to
hand over the weapon. Instead, the youth directed the gun at him.
Brinkley walked forward and repeated his request.
</P>
<P>
   The student handed over the gun, and they hugged. With a shaky
voice, the young man said, ``I'm scared.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Brinkley shared his thoughts during those tense
moments. ``It's not heroic,'' he said. ``At that moment I just
needed to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The youth has been charged with aggravated assault. Rockdale
District Attorney Richard Read said he wants to try him as an
adult. That could mean the difference between life in prison or
mere probation. A county judge in juvenile court will make the
decision. The suspect faces a detention hearing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   People offered mixed opinions about the former Boy Scout. Some
described him as a quiet, churchgoing youth, while others said he
was obsessed with guns and seemed suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   For the victims of the attack, time will heal their bullet
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Laster, 15, was recovering Friday from the gunshot
wound she suffered in the Thursday shooting. Her room at Hughes
Spalding Children's Hospital was flooded with cards, flowers and
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Barnhardt's wound is in his right buttock. He is a pitcher
on the Heritage High baseball team, and there's some concern since
he uses his right leg to push off when he throws. More than
anything, he's mad. When he saw a picture of the shooting suspect,
he said he thought, ``That guy? I could beat up that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   His thoughts are not on forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't forgive him. He shouldn't have done something like
this,'' said Barnhardt as he was being released from Rockdale
Hospital on Friday, his parents by his side.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen-year-old Cania Cullins, who plays the clarinet in the
school's marching band and is known for her beautiful hair and
perfect nails, was shot in the knee. Despite her injuries, Cania
has compassion for her classmate, said her pastor, Bishop Jim
Swilley of the Church in the Now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that he could know I forgive him, and I'd love for him
to come to church,'' she told Swilley.
</P>
<P>
   But the discussion goes beyond Rockdale County. The shootings
have placed the middle-class county in the spotlight of a national
dialogue on school safety and the behavior of young people. The
attack was the sixth mass shooting at an American high school or
middle school since October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   If the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado a month
ago ignited such discussions, then the Heritage High School
incident has inflamed them. The shootings occurred hours before the
Senate debated legislation that would toughen background checks for
gun buyers. The measure passed after Vice President Gore cast the
tiebreaking vote.

INVESTIGATORS FOCUSING ON SCHOOL KILLERS' FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ One month after the Columbine High School massacre, 80
law enforcement investigators are planning to labor through the
summer trying to determine if any friends of the two school gunmen
aided them or knew about the attack beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   With seniors preparing to graduate Saturday, such basic
questions remain unanswered as detectives studied e-mail, 15
personal computer hard drives, video rental records, and
conflicting stories from the 1,400 interviews conducted so far.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic technicians are trying to match hundreds of bullets and
casings to the guns used by law enforcement officials and by the
two high school seniors, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Unmatched
bullets could indicate that a third gunman participated in the
shooting, which left 15 people dead, including Harris and Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the two teen-agers could have carried in the
51 bombs that were found in and around the Littleton school, said
Larry Bettendorf, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms
and Tobacco. He said that most of the bombs were either small
carbon dioxide cartridges filled with black powder or medium-size
bombs filled with homemade napalm. The largest bomb, made from two
propane tanks, was found in a duffel bag in the school cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   After several house searches and lie detector tests, one
acquaintance of the gunmen has been arrested. Mark Manes, 22, a
computer technician, was charged with providing a handgun to a
minor.
</P>
<P>
   Robyn Anderson, Klebold's 18-year-old prom date, bought two
shotguns and a semiautomatic rifle for the two boys last fall from
unlicensed dealers at a gun show near Denver, Bettendorf said. Had
she bought the guns from a federally licensed dealer, she might
have faced federal charges of acting as a ``straw purchaser'' for
minors, but sales by unlicensed dealers are not covered by the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking very carefully to see if any federal laws were
violated. We are looking at the chain of the sale of the weapons,''
said Tom Strickland, the U.S. attorney based in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge amount of evidence that is being
investigated,'' Strickland said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office plans to return control of
the high school to the school district June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Near the school, the last memorials honoring the victims have
been removed from Clement Park. Last week, a tractor trailer truck
carried the offerings eight miles north to a federal warehouse,
where they fill 40 rooms, or 21,000 square feet. This summer, a
committee is to evaluate proposals for a permanent memorial in
Clement Park. The memorial could include some of the offerings of
photographs, flowers, poetry and placards.
</P>
<P>
   The victims are being remembered by more than flowers. Donations
totaling more than $3 million have been received by 15 charitable
funds. The Healing Fund, administered by the local United Way, has
already distributed almost $400,000, including $5,000 to each of
the 38 families.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the neediest cases is Lance Kirklin, 16, who was shot
five times. Kirklin, who does not have medical insurance, faces $1
million in medical bills and at least five more facial surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Two other boys, Richard Castaldo, 17, and Sean Graves, 15, are
suffering from lower body paralysis that doctors hope will be
temporary. Patrick Ireland, 17, who crawled out of a window into
the waiting arms of law enforcement officials, also remains
hospitalized. So does Mark Taylor, 16, who is in serious but stable
condition. The one girl still in the hospital, Anne Marie
Hochhalter, 17, is in fair condition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the month since the shootings, some parents have channeled
their grief into action.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Castaldo, father of Richard, has started to campaign to
shield minors from violence and pornography on the Internet. Tom
Mauser, whose son Gary, 15, was killed, has helped found Sane
Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic (SAFE), a state lobby for gun
control. This political action committee is chaired by former
Colorado Govs. John Love, a Republican, and Richard Lamm, a
Democrat turned independent.

REBUFFING GOP MODERATES, HASTERT DEFERS VOTE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Mass., Conn., Calif., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his first confrontation with Republican
moderates, House Speaker Dennis Hastert has spurned their request
for an early vote on campaign finance legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's decision to schedule the debate for mid-September,
which was relayed to the Republicans late Thursday, has now left
them with a stark choice: acquiesce or break with their party and
sign a Democratic petition intended to force the bill to the House
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, the chief Republican
sponsor of a bipartisan bill to ban the unregulated and unlimited
donations to political parties that are known as soft money,
indicated he would sign the petition. ``For me I just think that
it's absolutely imperative that the legislation come before the
August break,'' Shays said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill that Shays sponsors with Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass.,
passed the House by a decisive vote of 252-179 last year but died
in a Senate filibuster. Its proponents say that to have any success
this year they need a House vote before the August recess, and
maybe even before Memorial Day, to allow pressure to build on the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Friday how many of the 30 other Republicans who
supported Shays' bill would follow his lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have gathered 196 signatures on the petition, 195
Democrats of the House's 211 Democrats and one independent. They
need a majority of the House, or 218 signers, to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   But discharge petitions are usually considered an extreme act of
dissent because they take the majority's control over the
legislative calendar and hand it to the opposition party. Last
year, 12 Republicans broke with their party and signed a similar
petition only after then-Speaker Newt Gingrich blocked the bill
from the floor. Once those 12 signed, Republican leaders scheduled
the debate but kept it going for weeks in odd hours in a new effort
to slow or kill the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Shays said he viewed the decision on whether to sign the
petition as a ``conscience vote for every member because it does
put you in the hot seat with your colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Brian Bilbray of California, one of the 12 Republicans,
said he was organizing a meeting of the Republicans for Tuesday to
seek a consensus on how to proceed, particularly now that gun
control has unexpectedly moved to center stage in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten the speaker committed to September, not July,''
he said. ``Then we get blind-sided by the gun issue. Do we push
forward even though we're going to be eclipsed by the gun issue?''
he asked. ``What's the best timing? Timing is everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., who signed the discharge petition
last year, has indicated that he will not do so again out of
deference to the new speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The choice these Republicans make has potential ramifications
beyond this one issue. In their drive to pursue their own agenda,
the Democrats have been pushing hard for moderate Republicans to
break ranks with their party. Minority Leader Dick Gephardt renewed
that call Thursday, saying ``if they are really for campaign
reform, now is the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, fearful they could lose their majority in 2000,
have put a countervailing premium on party unity this year. And
many Republicans have made clear that they would view it as an act
of disloyalty if some of their colleagues bolted over the campaign
legislation, which is opposed by the majority of their party.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the speaker, 100 Republicans led by Rep. John
Doolittle of California urged him not to heed the supporters of the
Shays-Meehan legislation. They wrote that ``we urge you to
disregard the threat of discharge petitions and other tactics
designed to distract Republicans _ and you in particular _ from
accomplishing our shared goals.''
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, a spokesman for Hastert, said the speaker was
trying to balance between these two groups of Republicans by
allowing a debate on the campaign finance issue but not until
mid-September, after the annual spending bills are considered.
``The vast majority of our members don't want this on the floor,''
Feehery said. ``We're trying to balance both of these concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocacy groups fighting to overhaul campaign finance
legislation said the speaker was stalling to kill the bill. ``This
is the precise same manipulative game plan they used in the last
Congress to try to maintain the corrupt status quo,'' said Fred
Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a group devoted to
overhauling the campaign finance laws.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the ferment on the issue, another set of
Republicans led by Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas reintroduced an
alternative campaign finance measure this week that would ban the
national political parties, but not the state parties, from
collecting soft money. It would also bar federal candidates from
holding soft money fund-raisers and it would bar soft money raised
in one state from being used in another.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson argued that it was time to try a different approach
to the issue, because the Shays-Meehan bill had died repeatedly in
the Senate. ``There's an old Southern saying,'' he said. ``You
don't learn much from the second kick of the mule.''

RAY'S STAR ON THE RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ A year ago, he was a darkhorse who drove a black
car.
</P>
<P>
   Times have certainly changed _ for the better _ for Greg Ray,
the dashing 32-year-old Texan from Plano who last year stunned
everyone at Indianapolis Motor Speedway by qualifying second
fastest during Indy 500 time trials in his underfunded car.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at him now.
</P>
<P>
   In one short year, Ray has gone from pauper to prince.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, a heavy favorite to win the pole for the 83d
Indianapolis 500 in Saturday's time trials. Ray, who led for 18
laps last year and finished 18th when he was forced out because of
a gearbox problem on Lap 167, parlayed that run into a ride with
John Menard's well-heeled outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk up and down the pits and ask any driver what team
he'd like to be with and this is the team, I'll guarantee you,''
said Ray. ``It's an honor to drive for this team so, yeah, what a
difference a year makes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the fabled Brickyard swung open its gates a week ago,
Ray has been consistently fast in his Team Menard-prepared
Oldsmobile Aurora-powered Dallara. Thursday, Ray toured the
2.5-mile oval at 227.192 miles per hour, marking the fastest
unofficial lap of the week, bettering Tony Stewart's 226.683
Wednesday. Then Friday, Ray gave another glimpse of his
pole-winning potential when he went 227.175 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels nice to be this consistently quick with this group
(of drivers),'' said Ray, who turned the fastest unofficial lap
during an open test last month at the Speedway with a 227.072. ``We
regard our competitors very highly. We're not taking anything for
granted by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who will be gunning for Ray are Stewart, who had to
win a court decision against former boss Menard in order to drive a
Home Depot-sponsored car he co-owns with Larry Curry; CART driver
Robby Gordon; A.J. Foyt drivers Billy Boat, who Monday crashed the
car with which he won last year's pole, and Kenny Brack, the
defending Indy Racing League champion; and the retiring Arie
Luyendyk, a two-time Indy 500 winner who set an official one-lap
track record of 237.498 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although this year is my last year as an active driver, I will
still be working with the Treadway Racing team and maybe doing some
broadcasting,'' said Luyendyk. ``I do not feel dramatic toward
leaving because I'll still be here. I never thought I would hold
the speed records I have. In order to be successful you need the
right crew and engineers that you can work with. And you need the
right chemistry together.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything will have to go perfectly for Stewart, who will need
to qualify before 1:30 p.m. in order to ensure he makes the window
of opportunity to qualify for the NASCAR Winston Cup race in
Charlotte, N.C., Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't feel any pressure,'' said Stewart, who put his
team behind the 8-ball Thursday when he crashed his primary car
into the wall between Turns 3 and 4. ``I only have one lap to
qualify in other (NASCAR) races I do. You won't have to hold your
breath for these four laps. I can screw one up and still make up
for it in the three I have left.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ray, ``Every corner is different on every lap. Holding your
breath for 40 seconds is one thing. Holding your breath for 3 1/2
minutes is another. I don't know who's going to win the pole, but
whoever it is they're going to have to work for it.''

HOW AN ANALYST CHILLED A GROWTH SECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, May 23)  
(DW) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time Sheryl R. Skolnick sneezes, some investors may
want to run for cover. On Feb. 4, Ms. Skolnick, a BancBoston
Robertson Stephens managing director, dropped her ratings on four
stocks in the assisted-living care sector, citing the possible
effects of an impending General Accounting Office report on the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Such a wide-ranging move, virtually unheard of on Wall Street,
was enough to send the four stocks to the cellar. Shares of
CareMatrix, one of the largest companies in the group, dropped 22.4
percent that day, to $18.625. Alternative Living Services drooped
15.7 percent, to $21.9375, while Sunrise Assisted Living fell 8
percent, to $38.25. Balanced Care slid 7.4 percent to $6.25, a
price that must now look like a fortune. It closed at $2.125 on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts now believe that the selloff was too severe, leaving
the sector, which provides housing and services to elderly people
who need only minimal assistance, a prime buying opportunity. Even
the stingiest value investor might do a double take at the prices.
CareMatrix and Alternative Living Services are trading at a mere
13.8 and 11.9 times 1998 earnings, compared with a price-earnings
ratio of 33.5 for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Skolnick re-established ratings on the battered
group two weeks later, after she learned more about the report's
likely contents, the stocks have not fully recovered. As it turned
out, Ms. Skolnick had more influence on the sector than the
government. When the report was issued late last month, it
primarily suggested making more information available to consumers
and did not propose, as some had feared, Federal regulation of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The report had almost no effect on the group's stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, an industry trade group, the Assisted Living
Federation of America, was livid when Ms. Skolnick removed her
ratings, calling the move ``irresponsible'' and ``an extreme
overreaction and possible misrepresentation'' of the government's
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say there are important lessons here _ that thinly
traded stocks are subject to abrupt and severe gyrations, and that
those moves can be prompted by obscure forces like the negative
vote of only one analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors may believe the bull market has been so robust
that it has eliminated some of the risks inherent in many stocks.
Or they may believe that the relatively attractive valuations of
some small-cap stocks insulate them from major downdrafts. The
debacle in the assisted-living sector shows otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I have done anything differently?'' Ms. Skolnick asks
herself months after making her research calls. ``No. I would have
still warned investors that this event was out there,'' she said,
referring to the government report. ``But clearly the land of
illiquid stocks is not for the faint of heart, never has been.''
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, the assisted-living stocks appear especially
vulnerable to volatility. Even the larger companies in the group
have meager floats _ the number of shares available for trading to
the public _ so a very small number of investors can move the
price. Alternative Living Services and CareMatrix have floats of
only 18 million and 9.8 million shares, respectively. Johnson &AMP;
Johnson's float, by comparison, is 1.3 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   Further aggravating matters, many investors may not have a sound
grasp of what assisted living is, despite the fact that big hotel
companies like Hyatt and Host Marriott have become major players in
the business. One myth has it that assisted-living facilities are
nursing homes with a fancier name, with most of the industry's
revenues coming from Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Assisted-living facilities care for elderly residents too frail
to live alone but too healthy for nursing homes. Almost 88 percent
of industry revenue comes from private payers, according to the
Assisted Living Federation.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be no shortage of potential residents. Analysts
predict that the industry will grow from $14 billion this year to
$20 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   CareMatrix and Alternative Living Services are expected to notch
earnings gains next year of 25 percent or more. Care-Matrix, for
example, more than doubled its capacity last year and expects to
have an additional 3,500 residents in its facilities before
year-end.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, the assisted-living stocks are definitely
undervalued,'' said Ms. Skolnick, who has ``buy'' ratings on
CareMatrix and Sunrise. ``Many of them are excellent companies. But
there are times when an excellent company is not an excellent
stock.''

REVIVED METROSTARS OFFENSE IS LOSING HURTADO, AT LEAST FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After their best production of the season last Saturday in a 3-2
victory over Miami, the MetroStars will clash with the Colorado
Rapids in Denver on Saturday night with renewed spirit, even though
they will play without Eduardo Hurtado, one of the league's most
efficient goal scorers.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado aggravated a hamstring injury against Miami and will
miss at least Saturday night's game against Colorado (5-2). His
position will be filled by Nansha Kalonji, the team's discovery
player, who will be making his first start after four appearances
as a substitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to play,'' Kalonji said after a two-hour practice in
the rain Wednesday at Kean University in Union, N.J. ``I've been
feeling good in practice, and every practice is like a game. The
way you practice is the way you play.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bora Milutinovic, who took the team to Denver for a
practice Friday, had no hesitation about his choice of a
replacement for Hurtado.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be Sasha,'' Milutinovic said, referring to Kalonji.
``I think he'll do OK He's learning every day.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the attack for the MetroStars (4-4) will be Roy
Myers of Costa Rica, with Mark Chung playing on the left side of
the attack. Chung played that position against Miami last Saturday,
and he scored the first goal and assisted on the other two, earning
player of the week honors in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurtado and Myers are two different players,'' said Kalonji,
who played with Myers in three of his four appearances as a
substitute and scored a goal against D.C. United. ``I know how to
work with Myers, but Hurtado can hold two or three players. He
attracts attention and takes the pressure off me.''
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars seem to be improving with every game. Milutinovic
works with them on the field sometimes for more than two hours at a
time and spends additional hours showing his players films of
themselves and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bora gets his message across,'' said Mike Sorber, the
MetroStars' defensive midfielder, who started all four games for
the United States when Milutinovic was the coach of the 1994 World
Cup team. ``The thing is that we always play the same way. We try
to keep possession and attack at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Corrales, who played for the U.S. Under-23 team in its
1-1 draw with Canada on Wednesday and missed three days of practice
with the MetroStars, will play at his left fullback position
against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Arley Palacios, Mark Semioli and Mike Petke will be the other
defenders, and Mike Ammann will be in goal. Billy Walsh, Miles
Joseph and Sorber will be the midfielders.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars and Colorado have met eight times since the start
of the league four years ago, and each team has won four times.

 &HT;    School violence revives controversy over prayer
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ There haven't been any shootings in this
sprawling city's schools, but students and parents fear the
violence that erupted in Colorado _ and now Georgia _ may touch
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before the Rockdale County, Ga., shooting, hundreds of
people packed an emotional school board meeting here, most of them
pleading with officials to allow students to pray at their high
school graduations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the difference that a thing as small as a prayer can
make,'' Lisa Dugger, a 15-year-old high school sophomore, told the
Duval County School Board. ``If we remove God entirely from our
lives and our schools, I believe what happened at Columbine could
happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an argument many are making as the nation struggles to
understand the rash of school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Many trace the upswing in violence to society's moral decay, and
experts predict the steady trickle of school prayer cases appearing
in the courts over the past few years will grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the school shootings, it's become much more of an
issue,'' said John Ferguson, a researcher at Vanderbilt
University's First Amendment Center, which tracks the issue and has
helped mediate school prayer disputes around the country. ``A lot
of people believe these shootings happen because we've taken God
out of the schools. I believe that is an oversimplification, but
it's a growing perception.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jacksonville, the 6-year-old controversy shows no sign of
fading.
</P>
<P>
   This week, board members voted 4-3 to appeal last week's ruling
by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta that held the
district's policy of allowing student-led graduation ``messages''
was unconstitutional because it amounted to an official endorsement
of prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the policy argued the court's ruling was a
clear-cut repudiation and the board has no business spending
precious funds on such a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission as a board is education,'' said member Gwen
Gibson, who voted against the appeal. ``We have to set priorities.
I have to balance spending $200,000 on this against student needs.
That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, though, the principle is too important to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a national issue that has to be addressed,'' said
member Stan Jordan, who voted to appeal. ``It's a bigger issue than
Duval County. I think we may be of service to the nation if we go
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle over religion in the public schools goes back to a
1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that declared school-sanctioned
prayer an unconstitutional violation of laws that separate church
and state.
</P>
<P>
   Schools may teach religion and Bible history, the court ruled,
but they must do so objectively, as an academic subject.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and administrators must remain neutral and avoid
endorsing any particular religion, the court held.
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars believe many people _ including school officials
_ have overreacted to the ruling, believing wrongly that the court
aimed to eradicate all traces of religion from the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are misinformed,'' Ferguson said. ``Students
are allowed to pray at school on their own, but teachers can't lead
them in prayer. People believe no one is allowed to say anything
religious in school.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two decades, a growing number of cases have appeared
in the courts as districts across the country, often prodded by
religious activists, have tried to bring prayer and religious
observance more directly into school life.
</P>
<P>
   A number of districts have tried to come up with legally
acceptable forms of prayer by making the activities student-led, or
voluntary. In Jacksonville, students were given the right to vote
first on whether they wanted a graduation message, and then on
which student would give the message. The content of the messages
was left completely up to the chosen students, with no review by
school officials.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say such approaches are often nothing more than bald
attempts to circumvent the Supreme Court ruling and put officially
sanctioned prayer of the dominant local religion back in the
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with prayer,'' said Ken Hurley, a
Jacksonville resident whose son was one of the students who
challenged the Duval policy. ``It just can't represent only one
group. Here it is the Christians. There are no Buddhists or Muslims
(represented) here.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, religious activists argue that their rights are
being curtailed by the ban on prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to force religion on anybody,'' said Caroline
Weidner, who was to have given one of the ``messages'' at a
Jacksonville high school. ``I feel this is taking away my rights,
not only my freedom of religion, but also my freedom of speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intense emotions generated by the controversy, some
legal scholars believe the courts have been moving toward a
consensus on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus seems to be that if you pick the kids by
objective criteria and let them say what they want, it's OK if that
happens to be a prayer, if they don't ask for audience
participation,'' said Oliver Thomas, special counsel for the
National Council of Churches, who is also affiliated with
Vanderbilt's First Amendment Center. ``The key is the district has
to be neutral. They can't wink and nod and set it up so that the
kids know they're being allowed to pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas fears the recent ruling in the Jacksonville case may send
a chill through school districts that were struggling to find a way
for students to pray without offending their classmates or
violating the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when districts see this ruling, there could be a real
reaction, that some districts might censure graduation speeches,''
he said. ``I'm afraid this will confuse thousands of schools that
were trying to resolve the issue in good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has read the 11th Circuit ruling in the Duval County
case, and believes the court felt the Jacksonville district was
actively trying to encourage prayer instead of leaving it up to the
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that's true, but I think the court didn't believe
the district was neutral,'' he said. ``I think they were saying,
`We're not buying that the Duval Board didn't try to rig this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates on both sides of the issue predict the matter will
eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court. Neither side seems likely
to concede what each believes to be bedrock principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is clearly against student-initiated prayer,'' said
Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation
of Church and State, which argues for preserving the constitutional
ban on officially sanctioned prayer in schools. ``It's still a
captive audience at an official event.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and
Justice, a conservative group founded by religious broadcaster Pat
Robertson, believes the trend is just the opposite _ toward
allowing student-initiated, student-led prayer. But he agrees on
one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately the Supreme Court will have to delve into the
issue,'' he said.

MIRROR IMAGES: STARS, AVALANCHE LOOK A LOT ALIKE
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
Reflections can be funny. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They can waver and flicker across the ice, distorting shapes.
They can smile back from the morning mirror, suggesting unlimited
potential. They can bounce off opponent's eyes, right back into our
own, giving us pause as to how others see us, how we want to be
seen, how we see ourselves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think ego is a big part of sports,'' Stars center Joe
Nieuwendyk said, perhaps reflecting on his freshman psych classes
at Cornell University. And I think at times when we're most
competitive, we do compare ourselves to others, we do want to win
little battles as well as big ones. I think that's just part of the
game.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Stars, meet your mirror. The Colorado Avalanche will
stand across the ice from the Stars at 6:30 tonight at Reunion
Arena and begin what could be the most important playoff series in
Stars franchise history. To get where the Stars want to go, to get
a chance to win the first Stanley Cup in the 31-year history of the
franchise, they must defeat the Avalanche in the best-of-seven
Western Conference finals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And to beat the Avalanche, the Stars might have to become the
Avalanche. To win the Western Conference finals, Stars players will
look across from themselves the next two weeks and see their own
reflections. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons seem uncanny. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Mike Modano will likely be matched up against
Avalanche center Peter Forsberg in a battle that each of their
coaches believes his guy'' will win. Stars goalie Ed Belfour will
stare down at the other end of the ice and covet the thick coat of
respect that Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy wears like a royal cloak.
And Nieuwendyk will square off against old pal Joe Sakic in a
rivalry in which most outsiders would pick Sakic, but most insiders
know the passionately competitive Nieuwendyk has won time and time
again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I want to beat Sakic; he's a great player,''
Nieuwendyk said. But I also want to beat him because I know that
will help our team win this series, that scoring a goal or a
winning a key faceoff against him could help change the
playoffs.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are those who call the Western Conference finals the real
Stanley Cup championship. There are those who point to the West's
ability to win the past three Cups in sweeps, who summon pictures
of the NFC's dominance over the AFC in Super Bowls before a
Coloradan named Elway burst through the looking glass. There are
those will heap even more pressure on this series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if the Stars need any motivation to stay within themselves,
to forget the overwhelming burden and concentrate on the simple
task, a look across the ice might provide just the right tweak to
the ego. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You look at both teams, and they were built in similar ways,
getting similar players to do similar things,'' said Stars winger
Brent Severyn, who played with the Avalanche two seasons ago. And
maybe the most interesting thing about all that isn't just the
similarities on the outside, but the similarities on the inside.
Both teams are competitive teams, character teams. They want to
prove themselves.'' &QL; 
Offense &QL; 
What better way to win a championship than cracking your mirror
image? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Modano has been fighting to become more like Forsberg for the
past three years _ to become the ultimate mechanism of offensive
skill and defensive responsibility. And Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
pays Modano the ultimate compliment when he matches him up with
Forsberg, apparently believing Modano will win or neutralize in the
long run, that the Stars' first line will outscore the Avalanche's
first line, even if it's only 1-0. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We just feel playing Modano and \RJere\S Lehtinen against
anybody is a good matchup,'' Hitchcock said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen is the wild card in the Modano-Forsberg battle. He's
the best defensive forward in the NHL, and the Avalanche have no
mirror image of him. What's more, Lehtinen, as a Finn, has had a
natural rivalry with Forsberg, a Swede, for much of his life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the Stars win that battle, the scope turns to Sakic and
Nieuwendyk. Both are willowy centers with long skating strides,
wicked wrist shots and astounding ability in the faceoff circles.
They're like twin brothers of different mothers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both benefit from having another great center on their teams, a
diversion that often allows them to find open space while the more
electric Modano and Forsberg attract the primary attention of
opponents. In this series, Sakic and Nieuwendyk won't be so lucky.
They face each other. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the matchup has been one that Nieuwendyk has
won. Over the past two seasons, in head-to-head games, Nieuwendyk
has three goals and three assists and is plus one, while Sakic has
one goal and two assists and is minus one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's something we'd like to use to our advantage,'' Nieuwendyk
said at midseason, almost prophetizing the showdown to come. I
think if we did meet in the playoffs, it'd be nice to have \Rthe
statistical advantage\S out there to give them something to think
about.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And if those are merely subtle fighting words, the two teams
have the ability to deliver much stronger personal blows. Just ask
Claude Lemieux of the Avalanche and Pat Verbeek of the Stars. Each
is what is called an agitator,'' the type of player that can get in
the face and under the skin of an opponent. Both also can score
goals. Lemieux has 1,494 career penalty minutes and 325 goals.
Verbeek is even more annoying with 2,665 penalty minutes and 478
goals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And if those two aren't going at each other, fans can check out
the showdown of the graybeards _ quite literally _ in 39-year-old
center Guy Carbonneau of the Stars and 38-year-old center Dale
Hunter of the Avalanche. Both are known not only for their
defensive ability, but also for their chippiness. Carbonneau is not
nearly as penalized as Hunter, but he's just as effective at
delivering a subtle message with his stick. &QL; 
Defense &QL; 
On defense, Avalanche stopper Adam Foote's minutes and
responsibility have increased in the playoffs. Foote and Sylvain
Lefebvre will be on the ice against the Stars' best offensive
players, just as Hatcher and his partner, Richard Matvichuk, will
draw the responsibility of facing Forsberg and linemates Lemieux
and Valeri Kamensky on most shifts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When each team needs offense from the blue line, it will call on
a steady-handed European defenseman to create open ice. Sergei
Zubov is the Stars' Russian point guard, the controller of tempo,
the power-play quarterback, the man who creates a different way of
looking at the game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Zubov's mirror is Latvian defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh, whose
influence has been documented. When he held out for a new contract
at the beginning of the season, the Avalanche struggled. Once he
was signed, the Avalanche ran off a season-best 12-game winning
streak. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The third and fourth lines are a little more nebulous in their
comparisons. But just as Grant Marshall, Mike Keane and Benoit
Hogue have proved they can add offense, grit and versatility up and
down the lineup for the Stars, Adam Deadmarsh, Chris Drury and
Milan Hejduk have done the same for the Avalanche. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think I can look at Deadmarsh and what he does for them and
want to do the same thing,'' Marshall said. Obviously, I have to
just play my own game, but there are similarities to how that can
effect each team.'' &QL; 
What's more, each team has a hired gun. In the off-season, the
Stars bought Brett Hull's services. The Avalanche traded for Theo
Fleury in February. Both have proved dangerous scorers, and both
could be key at key times. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think the thing you can say about both of them is they have
the ability to come up with big plays, big scoring plays, when
their teams need them,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. &QL; 
Goalies &QL; 
But the biggest battle will come between two goaltenders. Roy is
the winningest playoff goalie in NHL history with 107 career
victories. He has won three Stanley Cups, including the 1996 title
with the Avalanche. Belfour has 53 career playoff victories, but
has played in the Stanley Cup Finals only once. And lost. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think what you see between those two is an absolute
competitive will to win,'' Severyn said. They both want it badly,
and they both aren't afraid of showing it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Belfour is more conservative; Roy more risky. There are subtle
differences, just as there are subtle difference in each of the
matchups. As much as each player has his mirror, each refracts as
much as reflects. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stars win with great defense, the Avalanche with great
offense. The Stars have become a team that can win a high-risk,
high-scoring game if they need to. The Avalanche has embraced the
defensive philosophy of rookie coach Bob Hartley. Each team, in
fact, has smoothed out its respective differences in the past
month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder they're where they are now. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Obviously there are different ways to build winning teams and
there are different ways to win hockey games,'' Stars general
manager Bob Gainey said. But there are also common elements to
winning teams. And while those elements can be individual players,
I think the thing you can find most is how teams adapt to
challenges, how they adapt to what another team is doing. That
might be the most common thread.'' &QL;

STARS DON'T MIND UNDERDOG STATUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coming to Reunion Arena tonight, Game 1 of what eventually will
be a terrific Western Conference finals. The winner of this one
kisses silver in mid-June. The Stanley Cup stops here.
</P>
<P>
   But is it just me, or has the hype factor for Stars-Avalanche
been sorta subdued this week?
</P>
<P>
   Even the two teams have seemed to size up each other with a
ho-hum attitude of ``oh, it's only you.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may be a natural reaction to the sudden demise of the
Detroit Red Wings, and also a credit to what the Wings stood for.
The Stars had spent two years building a team that could dethrone
Detroit. Then along comes Colorado this week and does it for them,
which might have caused a temporary emotional sinking spell for the
Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Both clubs, however, will have emotional motors revved up once
the puck drops tonight. Just wait _ this series will end up a
dandy. And already, there's been one surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Out in Vegas, the Avalanche is posted as the favorite in this
best-of-seven set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Told you so,'' said Stars coach Ken Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   And he did. The Avalanche-Wings handshake line was still in
progress at Joe Louis Arena on Tuesday night when Hitchcock, who
had been watching on TV, proclaimed, ``We're the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to stop it with the coach-speak, Hitchcock answered, ``No,
we're not going to be favored in this one.'' And he also couldn't
be happier it turned out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Those 114 regular-season points, signifying the best
regular-season record in the NHL, apparently meant nothing. Neither
did the spotless 5-0 home-ice record in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Las Vegas put up a wagering line for the Western
Conference finals that once again reflected a ``Detroit thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Colorado not only knocked off the defending champ, it also won
that series going away,'' Hitchcock said yesterday. ``Once that
happened, the people who decide on a favorite are naturally going
to lean that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing that became relevant in making that decision
is Colorado had an easier time with Detroit than we did with St.
Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock obviously does not argue with the conclusion. In fact,
expect to hear ``we're the underdog'' brought up many times as the
series progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, just what the Stars should want for the Avalanche
series is a repeat of the St. Louis round. Low-scoring games that
require patience and discipline to win. It is their strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with that,'' added Hitchcock, ``we have to elevate our
overall commitment and game. They have very strong offensive
players who can't be turned loose. A Wild West shootout is not what
we want here.''
</P>
<P>
   In 10 playoff games thus far, the Stars have graded superior in
two areas _ goaltending with Eddie Belfour and penalty killing.
Those two areas are also where Stanley Cups are won.
</P>
<P>
   But the Avalanche can match Belfour with Patrick Roy, while the
penalty killers regrouped against Detroit and finished very well.
In a shock, the Red Wings became a disorganized, undisciplined
mess, while Colorado transformed itself into, yes, a Stars carbon
copy.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie head coach Bob Hartley finally got his message across.
And he will be asking for more of the same against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny that Hitchcock is now the grizzled veteran of NHL
coaching ranks, while Hartley is where Hitchcock was four years
ago. He was an unknown from the minors when hired, and he came in
trying to sell a certain system to veteran players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both came up the same route,'' Hitchcock said of Hartley.
``We both earned our spurs by riding a lot of buses in the
minors.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock stopped short, however, of saying Hartley was
borrowing a coaching page from his tenure in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more a case of when a team reaches a certain
level in the playoffs, the talent factor is obviously involved,''
he said. ``But I do know this _ to reach the final prize it takes a
combination of talent and a 100 percent commitment to a defensive
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Hitchcock ``sold'' his philosophy to players once
reluctant to buy. Because of that, and Belfour, make this series
the Stars in six. The `'underdog'' wins while the Red Wings watch
on TV.
\Ntagtop:Randy Galloway's ``Sports at Six'' can be heard
weeknights, 6-8 p.m., on WBAP NewsTalk 820.

 &HT;    Atlanta gets on board effort to build futuristic train
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta, founded on 19th-century railroads, will get a
crack at developing a train for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Regional Commission has won federal funding to study
how it might deploy, finance and market the nation's first magnetic
levitation train, said Pamela Berry, a spokeswoman for the Federal
Railroad Administration in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetic waves propel and levitate futuristic ``maglev'' trains.
Though companies in Germany and Japan have run test trains at
nearly 300 mph, the technology represents a financial risk since no
such railroad is in commercial service anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent of Congress was to see if someone could prove the
feasibility of maglev technology on U.S. soil,'' said ARC Director
Harry West. ``Hopefully, this means we're one of the half dozen or
so places that can try.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the federal rail agency will review maglev studies
from the Atlanta group and six others. By summer, it will reward
the top project $950 million to build a demonstration track.
</P>
<P>
   The catch: Congress still must appropriate the money _ a
longshot, some planners say.
</P>
<P>
   If the Atlanta Regional Commission wins funding for an
experimental track, the test segment might cover about 40 miles,
reaching Acworth or Cartersville.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the regional agency foresees a 110-mile route from
downtown Atlanta to Chattanooga. If it works, such a train could
take a rider from Atlanta and into Tennessee in about 22 minutes _
quicker than a perfect rush-hour drive from Cobb County to downtown
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater will announce the
study grants Monday afternoon at Baltimore's B&AMP;O Railroad Museum.
Maglev applicants in Pittsburgh and Baltimore and two applicants in
California also won grants, Berry said. And railroad and
transportation analysts said groups from New Orleans and the
Florida Space Coast also made the cut. ``Money for each region is
still being worked out,'' Berry said. ``No one knows how much
they'll be getting.''
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, state transportation Commissioner Wayne Shackelford
has committed $1 million to be coupled with an anticipated federal
grant of $2 million.

 &HT;    Wife loses round in her bid to stay married to Holyfield
 &HT;    By Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Janice Holyfield testified Friday that she and her
husband, heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield, have had sexual
relations four times since he filed for divorce March 26.
</P>
<P>
   The champ said he can't remember whether they had or not.
</P>
<P>
   Fayette County Superior Court Judge Ben Miller said it doesn't
really matter, because he doesn't think sexual relations
necessarily equal marital reconciliation. Miller denied Janice
Holyfield's motion to dismiss the divorce action.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's ruling was unusual because many other divorce cases in
Georgia, including Holyfield's first divorce, have been derailed
when the couples had sexual relations between the filing of the
complaint and the judge's final approval. Case law says a marriage
is not irretrievably broken if the parties are engaged in acts of
reconciliation, including sex, said John Mayoue, Janice Holyfield's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue said Janice Holyfield wanted the case thrown out because
she still loves the champ and thinks they have a chance of
reconciling.
</P>
<P>
   She filed an affidavit saying she and Evander Holyfield had
sexual relations April 16 in a house she lives in that is on the
grounds of his mansion in north Fayette County. They had sex at
least three other times, she said, and the boxer said he still
loved her.
</P>
<P>
   The champ took the stand and said he remembers saying he loved
Janice Holyfield, but can't remember if they actually had sexual
relations those times.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue said he may appeal. Jim Thomas, one of Evander
Holyfield's lawyers, said the ruling made sense because Holyfield
would just refile for divorce if the case were dismissed. ``What
would be accomplished?'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The divorce case now heads to mediation. A lot of money is at
stake. The champ grossed $92 million in prize money alone from five
fights since marrying Janice Holyfield in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McGough, one of Evander Holyfield's divorce lawyers,
complained Friday that Janice Holyfield has violated a restraining
order regarding the couple's finances. McGough said she'd taken
$1.1 million out of joint accounts and put them into accounts she
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue said Janice Holyfield would return the money. He said she
panicked upon looking at the couple's accounts and seeing $20
million in recent activity that she couldn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   She was upset because her husband was refusing to pay some of
her bills, including medical expenses for their 8-month-old son,
Elijah, Mayoue said. One Emory Clinic bill for $148 was sent to a
collection agency. Mayoue said the couple spent about $500,000 a
month, though he didn't detail the expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing that you and I can relate to,'' Mayoue told the
judge. ``If you and I are spending $20 or so, they're spending
$20,000 or $200,000. You just put a few zeros in it.

   Fayette County Superior Court Judge Ben Miller said it doesn't
really matter, because he doesn't think sexual relations
necessarily equal marital reconciliation. Miller denied Janice
Holyfield's motion to dismiss the divorce action.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's ruling was unusual because many other divorce cases in
Georgia, including Holyfield's first divorce, have been derailed
when the couples had sexual relations between the filing of the
complaint and the judge's final approval. Case law says a marriage
is not irretrievably broken if the parties are engaged in acts of
reconciliation, including sex, said John Mayoue, Janice Holyfield's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue said Janice Holyfield wanted the case thrown out because
she still loves the champ and thinks they have a chance of
reconciling.
</P>
<P>
   She filed an affidavit saying she and Evander Holyfield had
sexual relations April 16 in a house she lives in that is on the
grounds of his mansion in north Fayette County. They had sex at
least three other times, she said, and the boxer said he still
loved her.
</P>
<P>
   The champ took the stand and said he remembers saying he loved
Janice Holyfield, but can't remember if they actually had sexual
relations those times.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue said he may appeal. Jim Thomas, one of Evander
Holyfield's lawyers, said the ruling made sense because Holyfield
would just refile for divorce if the case were dismissed. ``What
would be accomplished?'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The divorce case now heads to mediation. A lot of money is at
stake. The champ grossed $92 million in prize money alone from five
fights since marrying Janice Holyfield in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McGough, one of Evander Holyfield's divorce lawyers,
complained Friday that Janice Holyfield has violated a restraining
order regarding the couple's finances. McGough said she'd taken
$1.1 million out of joint accounts and put them into accounts she
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue said Janice Holyfield would return the money. He said she
panicked upon looking at the couple's accounts and seeing $20
million in recent activity that she couldn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   She was upset because her husband was refusing to pay some of
her bills, including medical expenses for their 8-month-old son,
Elijah, Mayoue said. One Emory Clinic bill for $148 was sent to a
collection agency. Mayoue said the couple spent about $500,000 a
month, though he didn't detail the expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing that you and I can relate to,'' Mayoue told the
judge. ``If you and I are spending $20 or so, they're spending
$20,000 or $200,000. You just put a few zeros in it.

OFFICER'S PLEA OFFER REJECTED BY PROSECUTERS IN TORTURE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have refused a plea deal sought by the
police officer charged with torturing Abner Louima in a restroom of
a Brooklyn police station, people close to the case said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They said that the plea offer was made and rejected on Thursday,
the day after a police sergeant provided devastating surprise
testimony against the officer, Justin A. Volpe, saying the officer
had boasted to him that he had committed the torture.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Volpe offered to provide the prosecutors with new
information about the case in return for leniency, according to the
people close to the case, but the overture was rebuffed because the
prosecutors did not believe that he could provide credible
information.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted at the trial under way in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn, Volpe could receive a sentence of up to life in prison
without the possibility of parole for what prosecutors say was his
brutalization of Louima at the 70th Precinct station house in
Flatbush in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn M. Kornberg, declined Friday to comment
on the reports that he had unsuccessfully approached the
prosecutors on Thursday, saying only, ``At the present time we're
not taking any plea.'' He refused to discuss the possibility of
future attempts to gain leniency through other methods during the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   One such option would be for Volpe to interrupt the trial to
plead guilty to all the charges against him without the benefit of
a deal with prosecutors, and to throw himself on the mercy of the
court. If that occurred, the trial would most likely continue for
the three other officers and a sergeant who are his co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility would be for Volpe to take the witness stand
and confess to a lesser role in the reported assault on Louima, in
the hope that the jury would not convict him of the most serious
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg declined Friday to discuss these options, saying, ``I
can never speak for the future _ who knows what the future will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Consideration of Kornberg's possible defense strategies arose
after the lawyer, in a reversal of his stated plans to vigorously
cross-examine the witness, Sgt. Kenneth Wernick, instead said he
had ``no questions.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the sergeant had told the jury that on the morning
prosecutors say Volpe tortured Louima with a stick in the station
house restroom, Volpe bragged that he had shoved a stick ``five or
six inches'' into Louima's rectum, and had then shown the sergeant
the stick.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the case said Kornberg did not know about the
extent of that testimony until Monday, when he received prosecution
documents related to Wernick's coming appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The people who reported Kornberg's unsuccessful plea offer would
not describe what new information Volpe said he could provide.
</P>
<P>
   But a history of the case suggests that it could be information
implicating additional police officers in a cover-up of the
reported attack on Louima, or that it could be a new version of the
events involving the four other defendants on trial.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely that prosecutors would be skeptical of any
attempts by Volpe to give information either increasing or reducing
the level of involvement that prosecutors ascribe to the other four
defendants, coming two weeks after testimony in the case began and
so soon after Wernick's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution declined to comment Friday on the reports of
Kornberg's plea offer or on any other matters related to the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not commented on the trial before and I will not
comment on it now,'' said Zachary W. Carter, the U.S. attorney in
Brooklyn, whose office is prosecuting the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that increased racial tensions in the city when it
became known two years ago, Louima, a 32-year-old black man, was
brutalized by Volpe and three other white officers after being
arrested in a street melee outside a Flatbush nightclub, Carter's
office says.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors say that Volpe and the other three _ Charles
Schwarz, Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder _ beat Louima in a police
car, and that Volpe and Schwarz then attacked him in the station
house restroom. They say that Volpe rammed part of a broken stick
into Louima's rectum and then his mouth, causing major damage to
his rectum and bladder, while Schwarz held him down. The four men
are charged with federal civil rights violations. The prosecution
says the officers erroneously believed that Louima had punched
Volpe during the street disturbance. The fifth defendant, Sgt.
Michael Bellomo, is charged with trying to cover up the alleged
beating in the police car.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the other officers declined Friday to comment on the
reports of a plea offer by Kornberg. They said their clients were
not seeking any such deals and they expressed confidence that the
jury would acquit their clients. The trial was in recess Friday and
is to resume on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg, while declining to comment on the reports that he had
approached the prosecution on Thursday, did say that he had not
sought a plea deal for Volpe between his indictment by a federal
grand jury in February 1998 and the start of the trial, for which
jury selection began nearly two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe and Bruder could get sentences of up to life in prison
without parole if they are convicted of violating Louima's civil
rights in actions that included a sexual assault, which is how the
indictment defines the alleged attack with the stick.
</P>
<P>
   If Volpe pleads guilty, Judge Eugene H. Nickerson has the
discretion to reduce his sentence on the ground that he has
accepted responsibility for his crime. Lawyers estimate that such a
reduction could mean a sentence of about 30 years, with the
possibility of reducing that term by 15 percent through good
behavior in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese and Bruder would face up to 10 years in prison if
convicted of violating Louima's rights by beating him in the police
car, and Bellomo would face the same maximum if convicted of trying
to cover up that offense.

`PHANTOM MENACE' REALIZED THROUGH SPECIAL EFFECTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Like it or loathe it or just wish that the Jar
Jar thing would shut up, it's hard not to be impressed by the new
``Star Wars'' prequel's rich designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' boasts completely realized
alien worlds, 60 new species to inhabit them and dozens of
never-before-seen vehicles to travel upon and between them.
</P>
<P>
   To bring George Lucas' storybook universe to photorealistic
life, some 250 computer artists spent two years creating more than
2,000 digital shots. Industrial Light &AMP; Magic, the field-leading
effects outfit Lucas formed nearly a quarter-century ago, was
virtually dedicated to developing the kind of computer-generated
imagery tools the director needed to bring his vision of ``Phantom
Menace'' to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy,'' reports Lucas, who has not directed a
feature film since the first ``Star Wars'' 22 years ago. ``At this
point, I've managed to overcome a lot of my creative roadblocks in
terms of the technology of moving the medium that I work in to a
different level. That means I'm more like a kid in a candy store
now. I've moved from doing these very difficult frescoes on the
wall to having oil paints.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only were elaborate castles, chandelierlike underwater
cities, giant carnivorous fish and battalions of skeletal battle
droids whipped up out of bits and bytes, but such relatively simple
things as ceilings and foliage were also computer generated. This
saved on set construction for the $125 million production. Of
course, since Lucas is ILM's sole owner, he got the digital work at
cost, much cheaper than what clients like James Cameron (``The
Abyss,'' ``Terminator 2: Judgment Day'') and Lucas pal Steven
Spielberg (``Jurassic Park'') would be charged.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, the research and development ILM put into other
directors' groundbreaking effects films helped lower ``Phantom
Menace's'' actual price tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that everybody else has developed we take on board
and everything that we develop goes on to the next person, and the
stakes are always risen,'' says ``Phantom Menace'' producer Rick
McCallum. ``It started with `The Abyss' and then it went on to
`T2,' `Jurassic Park,' `Toy Story,' `Men in Black' and `Bug's
Life.' The great thing, though, is that for the first time, all of
this stuff is converging at a speed where a shot that cost $100,000
two years ago costs $20,000 now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just the finished shots, which intimately integrate the most
fantastic visual elements with footage of live actors and practical
sets, but the starting fundamentals of ``Phantom Menace'' were
assisted and economized by computers. Detailed ``animatics'' _
moving versions of the static, storyboard sketches most movies use
as rough blueprints _ were worked up on high-powered Macintoshes.
This gave Lucas and his designers detailed guides to how every
element would move within any given frame before a foot of film was
exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking example of digital virtuosity in the movie is
the character of Jar Jar Binks. An alien of the amphibious Gungan
race, Jar Jar is clumsy, hyperactive, floppy-eared and 7 feet tall
_ and entirely computer generated, although he interacts with the
film's human stars with a never-before-seen complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Many find the purposely childish Jar Jar ``Phantom Menace's''
most irritating element. But most complaints overlook the point
that the thing wouldn't bother them so much if it didn't come off
so convincingly real. Although voiced by actor/dancer Ahmed Best,
who also played the character during the live shoot for the other
actors' benefit, the Jar Jar you see on screen is 100 percent CG.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahmed was terrific, I used his voice, he turned in a great
performance on the set,'' Lucas says. ``But to make the digital
character, you had to hire a second actor. That actor has the same
techniques and the same skills and the same talents plus some, and
that actor's called an animator.''
</P>
<P>
   Animation supervisor Rob Coleman, a veteran of such breakthrough
digital character pieces as ``The Mask'' and ``Men in Black,''
headed the Jar Jar CG team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He works in collaboration with the original actor,'' Lucas
explains. ``Sometimes they work together doing the motion capture
(the process of feeding real movement information into a computer),
sometimes they spend time together. But he takes the performance
that the actor on the set did and turns it into minute facial
expressions and body movements that really create the character on
the next level. (That whole process) takes three to four months.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's most impressive setpiece is a 10-minute pod race on
the desert planet of Tatooine. Inspired by the ``Ben Hur'' chariot
race sequence, the high-speed contest involves rickety, jet
engine-powered ``hot rods'' that zip along a few feet above the
rocky surface.
</P>
<P>
   The race's highly kinetic visuals were overseen by John Knoll, a
CG genius who was one of the authors of the popular Photoshop
software system. But just as impressive as Knoll's breakneck
movement is the way the sound flies around your senses in sync with
the images.
</P>
<P>
   That sonic assault, among some 1,000 of the film's sound cues,
was designed by longtime Lucas collaborator Ben Burtt. Burtt's
created most ``Star Wars'' noises, from the lightsabers'
distinctive buzz to impossible outer space explosions. But the
loud, varied, almost living pod race sound showcases Burtt's
wizardry like nothing before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound is 50 percent of the experience,'' McCallum
believes. ``Every pod, every engine has its own sound, which gives
it character. Ben just has this wacky imagination for figuring out
where he's going to pull every single noise from. Those aren't just
sounds that you go off and record. You've got to build them layer
by layer by layer. In one driver's engine, I think there are 120
different sounds that had to be mixed and modulated; even my
Porsche is in one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of the post-production wizardry on display in
``Phantom Menace,'' a big physical production needed to be mounted
first. Footage was filmed in England, Italy and the Tunisian
desert; lots of the exotic vehicles and even the creatures had to
at least be mocked-up in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built 65 huge sets, we made 1,100 costumes, we still had a
lot of animatronic work and puppetry,'' McCallum explains.
``Everything is designed, everything has to work. That's a serious
bit of brain damage, believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of serious damage, history repeated itself when an
exceedingly rare Sahara thunderstorm struck the Tatooine set in
Tunisia as production there was getting under way _ just as a
similar windstorm did when the first ``Star Wars'' filmed there
more than 20 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for insurance,'' McCallum says. ``It was intense. It
took us three months to build the city and a couple of months to
build the base camp. We had to actually create all the roads to get
to it in the middle of the desert where we were. To see it wiped
out on its second day of use was pretty heartbreaking. But luckily,
the Tunisian army was doing maneuvers about 30 miles away, and they
came out and helped us rebuild the whole city.''
</P>
<P>
   When things like this keep happening to him, it makes sense that
Lucas prefers to make as much of his movies as he can on computer
consoles. Still, for all the creative and manipulative power new
technology gives the director, some say that ``Phantom Menace'' is
alarming proof of how high tech can morph the humanity out of a
film.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, unsurprisingly, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a director's medium, there's no question about that,''
he says of movies in general and his kind of movies in particular.
``In film, you basically change performance through the editing
process and, hopefully, make it better. But I think digital
actually makes it easier for the actors, because a lot of the
difficult parts of getting a performance can be fused together much
more easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether you believe that or not, there's no question that
``Phantom Menace,'' however groundbreaking, is just a launching pad
for inconceivable new filmmaking technologies of the future.
Inconceivable, that is, to those of us not named George Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were actually planning to do II and III back to back,''
McCallum says, referring to the next two films in the prequel
trilogy, at least one of which Lucas has said will be completely
made digital. ``But once George started talking about what he
really wanted to do, we realized that we don't have the technology
for the third one yet.'' &QL;

CARR IS NOT DISSUADED BY BACKSEAT TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Oba Carr feels like the forgotten man in his world
championship bout with Oscar De La Hoya, the World Boxing Council
welterweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   Carr's likeness does not even appear on the posters advertising
his fight Saturday night at the Mandalay Bay Resort. Instead, the
face of Floyd Mayweather Jr., the WBC junior-lightweight champion
and rising Top Rank star, graces the corner of the poster opposite
De La Hoya. Mayweather is fighting on the undercard.
</P>
<P>
   And with the news that a deal for a bout between De La Hoya and
Felix Trinidad, the International Boxing Federation welterweight
champion, is complete, Carr slipped further into the background
today.
</P>
<P>
   When the two meet on HBO's ``World Championship Boxing,'' Carr
will now simply be a tuneup for De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Carr, the WBC's No. 1 contender, does not see himself
in that role. He said he has had a ``consistent vision'' for the
last two years that he is going to defeat De La Hoya and become a
world champion.
</P>
<P>
   Carr has twice fought for world titles _ against Ike Quartey and
Trinidad _ but he lost both times. This time Carr, who is very
religious, believes his vision will come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put my heart and soul in this fight,'' he said. ``God has
blessed me in this moment. To take his title I'm going to have to
be 100 percent, mentally, physically and spiritually.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr added: ``The victory is already done in heaven. We just
have to make it work on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be a problem considering that De La Hoya, a superb
ring tactician and hard puncher, has rededicated himself to being a
knockout artist. De La Hoya, who will earn $5 million for the bout,
said he will be going for the knockout against Carr, who will make
$350,000.
</P>
<P>
   What if it does not happen in the early rounds? Will De La Hoya
abandon the strategy and just fight to assure the victory?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to press and press and press until he can't take it
anymore,'' De La Hoya said. ``I guarantee that no fighter can last
if I hit him with my hardest shots.''
</P>
<P>
   A knockout victory over Carr will not prove anything to anyone
except De La Hoya, who seems to need the reassurance that he is a
magnificent boxer. That yearning for respect has led him to give
Bob Arum, his promoter, a mandate to make the best fights possible.
</P>
<P>
   It was De La Hoya who asked for a bout against Quartey, whom he
defeated in a 12-round decision. And it was De La Hoya who has made
the necessary concessions to get Trinidad in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya cannot believe that he allowed himself to be called a
chicken for not stepping up sooner and fighting the top
welterweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those guys saying they wanted to fight me; it was all a
bluff,'' he said. ``They were always putting the ball in my court.
They were making me look like I was the one who was scared. Now
that I'm accepting the challenge, they're the ones who are scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight with Trinidad will happen, not because of Trinidad's
people, but because of me. I want this fight. I will do what I have
to do to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears De La Hoya will get his wish on Sept. 18 at the
Mandalay Bay's 12,000-seat arena. Arum and Don King, Trinidad's
promoter, completed the deal Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for De La Hoya to earn $15 million and Trinidad
to earn $11 million. No contracts have been signed. King said that
all he has to do is get Trinidad's father, Felix Sr., to sign off
on the deal and it will be sealed. King has not been an impediment
concerning the fight, even though he is risking one of his top
money-making champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fight that everybody wants to see,'' King said.
``I'm not going to do anything to stand in the way of it happening.
If it doesn't happen, it won't be because of anything I've done.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Georgia colleges warned not to close records
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A firestorm erupting over new open records legislation
has singed the state University System's private foundations, many
of which are concerned about keeping the names of their anonymous
donors private.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia State University's nonprofit foundation earlier this
week passed a resolution spelling out its belief that anonymous
donors are protected under the privacy exception in the Georgia
Open Records Act.
</P>
<P>
   When it looked as if some other universities were on the verge
of passing similar resolutions, Board of Regents Chancellor Stephen
Portch warned university presidents in a memo Thursday not to
challenge the tough new amendments to the act, signed by Gov. Roy
Barnes earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to be challenging the governor's bill,''
Portch's memo states. ``The regents have been portrayed as opposed
to open government in the past. For an institution founded to
pursue truth, that doesn't ring well.''
</P>
<P>
   Portch apparently was responding to concern in the governor's
office about a movement afoot in the regents' Advisory Committee
for College and University Advancement to take legal action against
any requests for private donor information.
</P>
<P>
   James B. Osborne, head of the Medical College of Georgia's
foundation and chairman of the advisory committee, had proposed
that the foundations form a consortium and hire a law firm to
represent the first foundation receiving a request.
</P>
<P>
   The universities are concerned that the new legislation would
make donor lists more readily available to the public. They fear
the release of that information would lead to a decline in private
financial contributions, the lifeblood of many universities and
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   However, that plan concerned the governor, a major proponent of
open records legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big concern of donors is making sure their contributions
go to further education,'' said Bobby Kahn, the governor's chief of
staff, ``instead of being spent on lawyers' fees for attempts to
illegally elude public scrutiny that are destined for failure. This
is precisely the kind of behavior that prompted the governor to
strengthen the Open Records Act, and it's truly disappointing to
see that these people have not gotten the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes is supporting the state attorney general and local media
organizations seeking lists of donors and other financial
information withheld by the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation,
which wants to keep records of the Atlanta Olympic bid committee
private. Barnes said he believes the GAAF is subject to the open
records law, while the foundation's attorneys contend it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne said the university and college foundations were not
trying to break the law, only seek a legal interpretation of the
privacy exception in the law.
</P>
<P>
   However, some advancement committee officers decided Wednesday
against forming a consortium. ``We met and concluded everyone is so
different that each nonprofit foundation has to deal with the issue
individually on a case-by-case basis,'' Osborne said.
</P>
<P>
   The GSU foundation passed its resolution Wednesday _ before
Portch's memo was circulated _ and no other foundation has followed
suit. The University of Georgia foundation board met Friday, but
the issue was not on the agenda. The Medical College of Georgia's
foundation board declined to pass the resolution, but agreed to
seek a legal opinion.

 &HT;    Georgia colleges warned not to close records
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A firestorm erupting over new open records legislation
has singed the state University System's private foundations, many
of which are concerned about keeping the names of their anonymous
donors private.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia State University's nonprofit foundation earlier this
week passed a resolution spelling out its belief that anonymous
donors are protected under the privacy exception in the Georgia
Open Records Act.
</P>
<P>
   When it looked as if some other universities were on the verge
of passing similar resolutions, Board of Regents Chancellor Stephen
Portch warned university presidents in a memo Thursday not to
challenge the tough new amendments to the act, signed by Gov. Roy
Barnes earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to be challenging the governor's bill,''
Portch's memo states. ``The regents have been portrayed as opposed
to open government in the past. For an institution founded to
pursue truth, that doesn't ring well.''
</P>
<P>
   Portch apparently was responding to concern in the governor's
office about a movement afoot in the regents' Advisory Committee
for College and University Advancement to take legal action against
any requests for private donor information.
</P>
<P>
   James B. Osborne, head of the Medical College of Georgia's
foundation and chairman of the advisory committee, had proposed
that the foundations form a consortium and hire a law firm to
represent the first foundation receiving a request.
</P>
<P>
   The universities are concerned that the new legislation would
make donor lists more readily available to the public. They fear
the release of that information would lead to a decline in private
financial contributions, the lifeblood of many universities and
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   However, that plan concerned the governor, a major proponent of
open records legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big concern of donors is making sure their contributions
go to further education,'' said Bobby Kahn, the governor's chief of
staff, ``instead of being spent on lawyers' fees for attempts to
illegally elude public scrutiny that are destined for failure. This
is precisely the kind of behavior that prompted the governor to
strengthen the Open Records Act, and it's truly disappointing to
see that these people have not gotten the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes is supporting the state attorney general and local media
organizations seeking lists of donors and other financial
information withheld by the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation,
which wants to keep records of the Atlanta Olympic bid committee
private. Barnes said he believes the GAAF is subject to the open
records law, while the foundation's attorneys contend it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne said the university and college foundations were not
trying to break the law, only seek a legal interpretation of the
privacy exception in the law.
</P>
<P>
   However, some advancement committee officers decided Wednesday
against forming a consortium. ``We met and concluded everyone is so
different that each nonprofit foundation has to deal with the issue
individually on a case-by-case basis,'' Osborne said.
</P>
<P>
   The GSU foundation passed its resolution Wednesday _ before
Portch's memo was circulated _ and no other foundation has followed
suit. The University of Georgia foundation board met Friday, but
the issue was not on the agenda. The Medical College of Georgia's
foundation board declined to pass the resolution, but agreed to
seek a legal opinion.

KOSOVO INSURGENTS REPORT KILLING RUSSIAN OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ In a development that could complicate
Russia's role in the Kosovo crisis, rebels fighting for the
territory's independence claim to have killed a Russian captain in
a battle with Serbian troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army said that the dead
man was just the latest in a list of Russians who have been killed
in Kosovo, and that they had known for months that Russian officers
and soldiers were fighting with Serbian troops.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group claims that Russians' fighting makes Moscow's
role in peace negotiations impossible and denies Moscow the right
to take part in any future peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough evidence to prove that the Russians are
supplying the Yugoslavian army with arms and with soldiers,'' said
Jakup Krasniqi, chief spokesman for a group called the Interim
Government of Kosovo, which is closely linked to the Kosovo
Liberation Army. ``After that, how can we trust them?''
</P>
<P>
   Russian television showed a videotape of the dead soldier
dressed in a Serbian uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials in Moscow confirmed that an officer of the
name given by the Kosovo Liberation Army had been enlisted in the
ranks of the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry, which generally
handles fire and emergency rescues. But they said the man, Vitaly
Bulakh, who was 34, was given a medical discharge in 1997, and was
then assigned to the Khabarovsk military district as a retired
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army suspects that Bulakh was sent to
Kosovo on official duty, but it is also possible that Russian
mercenaries are entering the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said that according to documents found on the man, he
graduated from a Russian military academy in 1996. They added that
he had 3,500 Russian rubles with him.
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi of the Kosovo Liberation Army said Friday afternoon
that a strong letter of protest had been sent to the Russian
Embassy in Tirana, in which a ransom of 5,000 firearms, with
ammunition, was demanded in exchange for the return of the
officer's body. As of Friday night, there had been no response from
the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of Russian participation in Serbian military maneuvers,
if corroborated, would buttress information provided by several
rebel officers and soldiers over several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nexhmedin Kastrati, a commander in the Kosovo Liberation Army,
said in an interview last week in northern Albania that his troops
had encountered Russian officers and mercenaries in combat in
Kosovo. He said his men had also intercepted radio calls in Russian
and recovered military documents written in Russian and containing
Russian names.
</P>
<P>
   Kastrati, who said he served with the Yugoslav army from 1991 to
1998 and fought in Croatia and Bosnia, said the Russians were few
in number but exerted substantial influence over training and
tactics of Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are free to act as they choose,'' Kastrati said in an
interview at a Kosovo Liberation Army office in the Albanian town
of Kukes. They are often at the forefront of an attack, he said,
adding, ``On the front lines we can hear the exchange of words and
the swearing, all in Russian.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebel fighters have reported that Russian soldiers treated at
hospitals in Kosovo had to use translators to speak to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Several rebel fighters also reported seeing or hearing Russians
in Kosovo. One, Sabri Popaj, interviewed two weeks ago, said that
in combat in southern Kosovo near the villages of Zerze (the
Albanian name for Zrze) and Bellacerka (Bela Crkva), he had heard
commands in Russian. He said his fighting group, the 124th Brigade
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, had also intercepted radio
communications in Russian.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of Russians' fighting in Kosovo come at a delicate
moment. Russia's special envoy to the Balkans, Viktor Chernomyrdin,
has been working, with the support of Washington, to broker a deal
with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to stop the
fighting and withdraw Serbian troops from Kosovo so that hundreds
of thousands of Albanian-speaking refugees can return.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicions could affect the makeup of peacekeeping forces in
Kosovo. Many Albanian-speaking Kosovars distrust Russians and say
they would not return home if Russians were stationed there as
peacekeepers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Russian casualty appears to be bolstering the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which in recent weeks has been trying to
professionalize its ranks and improve its image, which is that of a
disorganized and weak force.
</P>
<P>
   After the NATO bombardment began March 24, the rebels issued a
general mobilization call. Recruits flooded into Albania from as
far away as the United States and Canada, and from all over Western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel officers say they now have enough troops to start a major
offensive, even if the U.S. Army does not employ its anti-tank
Apache helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels still lack sufficient arms, particularly
anti-tank weapons and heavy artillery. ``The main reason why we
started the mobilization campaign was to get weapons,'' the
commander said. ``It is a lot easier for people coming from
America, Europe and Albania to pick up weapons along the way to
Kosovo than it is for those of us inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week the rebel army's top command was reshuffled, and a
veteran officer, Agim Ceku, who was a brigadier general in the
Croatian army, was named chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   In Kukes, the officer in charge of rebel recruitment has
reportedly been reassigned after several instances in which young
Albanians from Kosovo were grabbed off the street and forced to
join the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have plenty of people who want to join the KLA, but we
cannot afford to sign them up,'' Kastrati said. ``Our first
priority is people who are prepared mentally and physically to go
into Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Popaj, the rebel fighter, who said two of his sons, two of his
brothers and a nephew were killed by Serbian troops in Bellacerka
in March, said the Serbs had used civilians as shields to protect
themselves from attack, and now traveled in cars and trucks taken
from civilians rather than in their own vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel fighters said they sometimes redeployed troops during a
NATO attack, when the Serbs were taking cover and often were
separated from their equipment and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Popaj said the Serbs' front-line forces wore a kind of
bulletproof trench coat, which could not be pierced by automatic
rifle fire. ``They advanced without fear,'' he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: NOT TOO SOON TO PREPARE FOR PACERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Knicks wake up Saturday morning sitting on top of
a new world in the National Basketball Association. They overcame
Miami in Round 1 and hold a 2-0 lead against Atlanta in Round 2
with a chance to close the Hawks out in Games 3 and 4 on Sunday and
Monday at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   This peaceful interlude seems an appropriate time to introduce
that cloud on the Knicks' horizon, speak the word no one likes to
speak. I'd like to introduce the dreaded P word: Pacers. The
Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Players and coaches may not look ahead, but fans do. And Knick
fans have already begun wringing their hands over the prospect of
meeting Indiana for the Eastern Conference title.
</P>
<P>
   Too early, you say, to look ahead nervously? Not for this team,
not for these fans. The Knicks, for all their rapid transformation
in the last few weeks, must prepare for the Pacers in the manner
that a runner prepares for the marathon. The Pacers _ more than the
Heat or even the Bulls _ have been the Knicks' nasty nemesis of the
'90s. Four seasons ago, Indiana handed the Knicks their most
devastating loss of the decade when Reggie Miller scored 8 points
in the final 16 seconds to send the Knicks to a 107-105 loss in
Game 1 of a second-round series, a series the Knicks eventually
lost when Patrick Ewing's Game 7 finger roll went in and out of the
basket in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last season, the Pacers, using a typically punishing
inside attack, again tossed the Knicks from the playoffs in the
second round and all but said, ``And stay out!''
</P>
<P>
   Can these new, lighter Knicks defeat Indiana? Of course they
can.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers are not the team they were last season, when they
took Chicago to seven games in the conference finals. And the
Knicks are not the team the Pacers knocked out of the playoffs.
Indiana made the mistake the Knicks did not make during the off
season: Indiana stood pat. The Knicks added two crucial pieces:
Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby. Sprewell has been a genie, and
now coach Jeff Van Gundy has to only free Marcus Camby. I thought
we had already turned that corner, but apparently not. Van Gundy is
still making Camby pledge. In Game 1 against Atlanta on Tuesday,
Camby had a weak 10 minutes. He sat down and never played again,
but no matter, the Knicks won going away, thanks in large part to
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2 on Thursday, the Knicks, in their typically
inconsistent style, went flat. But Sprewell and Camby saved the
day. Sprewell, moving with the ball, scored 31 points, and Camby,
moving without it, scored 11 points, grabbed 13 rebounds and
created havoc. Together, they turned a 13-2 first-quarter deficit
into a 38-36 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The post-game spin was that the psychology of not playing in
Game 1 had motivated Camby in Game 2. Nonsense. Had he had a second
chance in Game 1, Camby would have been a force and the Knicks
might have won by 50 points. It's time for these regular-season
mind games to stop. Either Van Gundy has faith in Camby or he
doesn't, but things are likely to go better for the Knicks if Van
Gundy puts Camby back in the game in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the Knicks have retreated into that defensive mode of
old, they have lost. Atlanta was bracing for the Knicks to come
rumbling by ground; instead, the Knicks arrived speeding by air.
Indiana is even better on the ground, but not so great in the air.
With the exception of Jalen Rose, the Pacers' answer to Sprewell,
Indiana is not that versatile. Reggie Miller can't beat you without
screens, and the same goes for Chris Mullin. But if the Knicks slug
it out with the Pacers, Indiana wins.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell and Camby are safety locks that prevent the Knicks from
sliding back into the past. Without Sprewell and Camby this season,
the Knicks are out playing golf right now and Van Gundy is probably
out of a job. Without Camby, the Knicks are not in the playoffs,
not past Miami and not up by 2-0 in the second round after two road
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has done a superb job getting the Knicks to buy into
the team concept. Now he has to determine what Camby has done, and
the coach should buy into that. Camby's ability to turn a game
around should be enough of a sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In this decade, the Knicks have had four shots at Indiana: they
beat the Pacers in 1992-93 and 1993-94 under Pat Riley and then
lost in 1994-95 and 1997-98 under Riley and Van Gundy. Now, as the
Knicks prepare for another encounter with the Pacers, the challenge
for Van Gundy is to turn the guys who aren't his guys into his
guys. As it turns out, they hold the key to the Knicks' vast
horizons.

 &HT;    NRA chief gets OK to speak from GOP
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After a day of soul searching, Georgia Republican
leaders decided today's speech by a top official of the National
Rifle Association will go on as planned, despite concerns that it
might inflame tensions following the school shooting this week in
Rockdale County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right thing to do,'' state GOP Chairman Rusty Paul
said of continuing the speech by NRA Executive Vice President Wayne
LaPierre. ``We can't be panicked into making a decision. We need to
have this discussion more than ever now.''
</P>
<P>
   Party officials were told to expect as many as several hundred
NRA supporters in the Augusta Civic Center's guest area to hear
LaPierre's five-minute address.
</P>
<P>
   Paul was wavering on the issue Thursday after a Heritage High
School student opened fire on campus, injuring six. Several key
congressional leaders said they were prepared, if asked, to
recommend that the speech be canceled for a variety of reasons. But
after consulting other GOP leaders, Paul said LaPierre can add to
search for solutions and should not be muzzled.

FINANCIAL EXECUTIVES GROUP OPPOSES SEC PROPOSAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's largest group of corporate financial officers is
lobbying to quash a plan that would make it easier for directors of
public companies to know when managements are being too loose in
the way they tally profits.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the Financial Executives Institute said it
opposed a proposal that would require outside auditors of public
companies to tell members of the audit committee each year whether
management was being aggressive or conservative in its accounting
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, a group of more than 14,000 financial executives,
said it feared the plan would allow auditors to ``second guess''
corporate management's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The financial executives were responding to proposals made
earlier this year by a committee appointed by Levitt after a string
of high-profile cases in which companies including Cendant, Sunbeam
and Livent disclosed that they had mislead shareholders by
reporting results that were wrong by tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the committee released its recommendations to make
corporate audit committees better watchdogs for shareholders and to
help prevent what Levitt has referred to as ``accounting
shenanigans'' by public companies. The commission and the nation's
stock exchanges are now considering the committee's
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the institute's letter, Lynn E. Turner, the
commission's chief accountant, said Friday that regulators would
still press for new rules requiring an annual discussion between
auditors and the audit committee about the ``quality'' of the
company's financial reporting and how aggressive or conservative
management was being in applying the accounting rules.
</P>
<P>
   But Turner said that he agreed with the financial executives
that management should be included in those discussions.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter, the financial executives also said they were
opposed to the plan that would require audit committees to write a
letter to shareholders each year saying that they had talked to the
auditors and were comfortable with the company's financial
statements. The executives said the plan would make the audit
committee legally liable for the accuracy of the company's
financial statements _ a responsibility better left to management
and the auditors.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said they did not agree with a proposal to
require auditors to review companies' quarterly financial
statements and to talk to audit committees about those quarterly
reports. That plan would cost companies too much, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A requirement to have a meeting or a telephone conference,
whether or not there are any items to discuss, seems bureaucratic
and unwarranted,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   But Turner said Friday that he believed that both those plans
were good ones. ``I don't think there's a lot of cost'' to a
quarterly discussion, he said. ``It only needs to be a phone
call.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WAITING FOR TROUT IN MONTANA

<P>
   The oldest cottonwoods along the Bighorn River have fissured
bark nearly as deep as a man's palm is wide, and where cattle have
rubbed against them their bark is pale. Beneath the cottonwoods,
morels grow in the new grass. To hunt for morels is to remember
something unsettling about the task of looking. One day last week,
I searched the partial shade of each tree along a quarter mile of
riverbank, and as I did I tried to concentrate on seeing the
fawn-brown cranial effusion that is a morel. But concentrating
didn't make the morels appear. They were there or not there, and
nothing could induce them to appear where they weren't.
</P>
<P>
   Things are different when it comes to Bighorn River trout, which
in some circumstances can be induced to appear where they didn't
seem to be before. On a bright day, some trout are visible from a
high bank _ linear wisps of movement against a dark green
background, more angular and better camouflaged than the undulating
filaments of aquatic weed that wash downstream. But to some
anglers, a fish is truly visible only when it rises to the surface
and feeds. Sometimes trout shoulder the river aside, and sometimes
they barely crease it, taking a cluster of midges sliding past on
the water's tension, as light as thought. Most of the time, the
fish adhere to the stream-bottom, waiting, feeding in the
subsurface drift.
</P>
<P>
   Until the fish do rise, you wait, too, and the complexity of
place imposes itself. In slack current, rafts of goslings test the
water, their parents, like tugboats, nudging them this way and
that. Everywhere there is the racket of red-winged and
yellow-headed blackbirds, the high-ceilinged squawk of pheasants,
the wet slap of mergansers' wings on takeoff. Green hills climb in
the distance, level off, and become wheat and barley fields,
private inholdings on the Crow Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   A morning comes when the wind has died and clouds have hidden
the sun at last. The thing that will make the trout appear from
nowhere is about to happen. The nymphs of a species of mayfly _
Baetis tricaudatus _ will rise through the water column and hatch
on its surface, and the trout will rise with them.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-afternoon, the mayflies are not there, no matter how hard
I look, and then a minute later they are. It is as though morels
were to erupt from the grass while I watched, beneath every
cottonwood and as far as the eye can see. The mayflies are the same
color as the river's dull surface, their wings canted upstream over
slender bodies. They are not ubiquitous, but they are always coming
into view no matter where I look, and coming into view among them
are the heads of brown trout and rainbows, suddenly visible at
last.
</P>

   I tried, with friends that night, to estimate how many Baetis
hatched during the single hour of their emergence. Even the most
conservative number looked improbable, and the probable number was
unimaginable to us all.

TEXAS SENATE WOULD ALLOW LICENSED FIRMS TO DISPOSE OF NUCLEAR
WASTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Vt., Maine) 
 
By KATHY WALT 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Senate on Friday approved the
licensing of private companies to dispose of low-level nuclear
wastes.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers, over the objections of sponsor Sen. J.E.
``Buster'' Brown, R-Lake Jackson, also drastically reduced the
potential for nuclear waste dump sites to proliferate in Texas by
stipulating that such graveyards could be located only in Andrews
County, northwest of Midland.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to do is make it where we can get the best
available technology and the best minds working to bring about a
site but also have limitations ... (on) what comes in,'' Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, House Bill 1171, must go back to the lower chamber.
The Senate version contains two key differences from the
House-approved plan: the provision that allows private companies to
be licensed and another that prohibits private license holders from
accepting nuclear waste from states other than Texas, Maine and
Vermont. Texas has a long-term interstate compact with Maine and
Vermont to accept their waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is that your legislation would make Texas the
outdoor privy for low-level nuclear wastes,'' said Sen. Carlos
Truan, D-Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Attorney General John Cornyn issued a legal
ruling on the privatization issue, saying such a move would force
Texas to accept shipments of waste from the federal government's
nuclear weapons industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown said the U.S. Department of Energy already has the
authority to license private companies to dispose of nuclear waste
in Texas if it wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the bill contains safeguards to prevent massive
amounts of radioactive wastes from flowing to Texas. For example,
he said, the bill would limit the waste a private company could
accept from the federal government to no more than 20 percent of
what it expects to get from Maine and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also contend that the state's ability to regulate the
disposal sites would be diminished under privatization. Brown,
though, said his bill would ensure the government's right to
regulate disposal sites and would require companies to post surety
bonds or set aside sufficient cash reserves to indemnify the state
from liability.
</P>
<P>
   The House version would restrict licensing to government
entities but would allow government entities to then contract with
private companies to actually manage a dump site.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews County right now is the only county whose residents have
asked to have a nuclear dump in their own backyard and the only
county whose commissioners also have approved of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said his only concern about restricting possible nuclear
waste disposal sites to Andrews County is if the county somehow
fails to get a permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If for some reason it fails, somebody in this Legislature is
going to have to come back next session and pick another county,''
Brown said. In trying to fend off the Andrews County amendment by
Lubbock Republican Sen. Robert Duncan, he reminded lawmakers of the
feud over the state's attempts to place the dump in Sierra Blanca.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission last fall
rejected the Hudspeth County site, which Gov. George W. Bush also
had opposed. That tossed back in the Legislature's lap the problem
of trying to find where to send contaminated items from nuclear
power plants in Texas, Vermont and Maine, as well as waste from
hospitals and universities and other low-level nuclear waste from
household items like luminous watch dials and smoke alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Since Texas created the Low Level Nuclear Waste Disposal
Authority in 1981, the agency has spent $53 million and has yet
been able to get a site in Texas licensed as a permanent storage
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Senators Friday also approved a bill that would require state
officeholders and candidates to file their campaign finance reports
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which must win one more House vote before it can be
sent to the governor, ``opens the door on Texas government and
allows all Texans to pass through,'' said its sponsor, Sen. Mike
Moncrief, D-Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who raise at least $20,000 would be required to file
their reports of campaign contributions and expenditures with the
Texas Ethics Commission electronically, and the commission would
have to post them on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Paper reports also would continue to be available for viewing or
copying at the commission's offices in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Moncrief said 14 other states already require electronic filing.
State officials and candidates already can voluntarily file their
reports electronically in Texas, but only 16 percent do so, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, approved on a voice vote, was amended by Sen. Troy
Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, to also require legislators and
legislative candidates to more quickly report large donations they
receive in the closing days of a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Present law requires legislators and legislative candidates, but
not statewide officeholders, to report contributions of more than
$1,000 received within nine days before an election to the Ethics
Commission within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser's amendment would require lawmakers and candidates for
their offices to report large contributions received within 14 days
before an election to the commission within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Steve Ogden, R-College Station, unsuccessfully tried to
amend the bill to require candidates to fully report all
contributions and expenditures each week during the last month
before an election.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden said his amendment was necessary to uncover late donations
that can be crucial to a campaign's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is if you don't have any trouble spending it, you
shouldn't have any trouble reporting it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to spend it,'' retorted Sen. Jeff Wentworth,
R-San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the bill earlier this session but will have
to consider it again because of Senate changes.
</P>
<P>
   In other action:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Senate approved, 26-4, a bill to clarify that self-help
legal books and related materials, which help people prepare their
own wills and other official documents without a lawyer's help,
don't constitute the practice of law.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, House Bill 1507, which now goes to the governor,
was designed to address questions that have been raised about the
legality of such self-help materials.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders of Dallas last month banned
the distribution in Texas of self-help legal software distributed
by Parsons Technology Inc., whose materials had been challenged by
the state's Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Another publisher, California-based Nolo Press, also is involved
in a similar fight in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Senators approved House Bill 926 to increase the penalty for
tampering with the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills test.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative action follows several reported incidents of
tampering with the tests in some school districts. The bill would
make tampering, which is now a misdemeanor, a third-degree felony,
punishable by two to 10 years in prison and as much as a $10,000
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Tampering with the intent to defraud would be a second-degree
felony, punishable by two to 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now goes back to the House for consideration of Senate
amendments.

BORROWING SENATE STRATEGY, HOUSE DEMOCRATS PRESS FOR GUN-CONTROL
MEASURES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Inserts new 6th and 7th graphs; subs 14th graph to detail
Clinton position)  (rm) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fresh from their victory on gun control in the
Senate, Democrats on Friday trained their attention and oratory on
the House, calling for a gun-control vote within the next week and
lambasting Republican leaders for laying out a less immediate
course.
</P>
<P>
   In making that demand, House Democrats were plucking a page from
the play book of their Senate counterparts, who greeted every
Republican concession on gun control over the past two weeks with
the charge that it was too little, too late and still out of step
with public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, who had promised on Thursday to allow a vote
on gun-control measures by the middle of June, accused Democrats of
engaging in political theatrics. But even as the two sides sniped
at each other about timing, they agreed that the House would
probably pass at least a few new restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be some aspects of what the House does
which will include making it more difficult for teenage kids to get
ahold of guns,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, the Republican
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on crime.
McCollum's juvenile crime bill would be the likely vehicle for
those measures.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen House Democrats met with President Clinton at the White
House Friday afternoon to plot their strategy for making sure the
measures succeed. The plan, they said, was to use whatever bully
pulpit they had to persuade Republican leaders to act now, before
conservatives in the party or gun lobbyists disrupted the momentum
of events in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for his part, was expected to address gun control in
his weekly radio address on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers who spoke with Clinton on Friday said that he
urged House Democrats push for at least one measure in addition to
those passed by the Senate: a raise in the minimum age for handgun
purchases and possession to 21 from 18. House Speaker J. Dennis
Hastert of Illinois early this week indicated support for raising
the age for purchases, though not possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make our voices heard every day,'' said Rep.
Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y., after leaving the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lowey, who is expected to run for the Senate next year if
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton does not, added, ``I wonder if
all those people afraid to send their kids to school want to see us
debate this issue for the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Republican leaders could bring the bill passed by the
Senate to the floor immediately, it would be highly unusual.
Instead, they intend to let a similar House bill proceed through a
House committee and then come to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The pledge by Republican leaders to let a debate on gun control
occur indicated an unequivocal alteration in the political climate,
just as the bill passed by the Senate on Thursday night had.
</P>
<P>
   That legislation, approved by a vote of 73 to 25, contained an
array of new regulations, such as a requirement that licensed gun
dealers include child safety devices with every handgun they sell,
restrictions on the possession of semi-automatic assault rifles by
those under 18, mandatory background checks on all buyers at gun
shows and a ban on the import of high-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   None of those measures represented monumental shifts in public
policy. But, taken together, they were arguably gun control
advocates' biggest victory in Congress in half a decade.
</P>
<P>
   If the House passes similar measures as part of its own juvenile
crime legislation, the House and Senate bills would then go to a
conference committee to reconcile any differences. A final vote
would be held before sending the measure to the White House. A
White House spokesman, Barry Toiv, said Friday night that Clinton
was hoping that a House bill went further on gun control and had
not yet decided whether he would sign a bill like the Senate's.
</P>
<P>
   Already, House Republicans have signaled more receptiveness to
gun control, though they have also exhibited a nervousness about
the debate being forced on them too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, as the Senate was passing its legislation, both the
House Appropriations and Judiciary committees postponed hearings to
finalize two separate bills after Democrats threatened to try to
attach gun-control amendments. One of those bills was McCollum's,
which Republicans had been insisting was not an appropriate vehicle
for gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and the Democratic minority leader, Richard Gephardt of
Missouri, met Thursday afternoon to decide how and when to deal
with the gun-control measures the Senate had passed.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said that the measures could indeed fold into McCollum's
bill and suggested a vote in the middle of June. But when Gephardt
presented that plan to fellow Democrats a few hours later, many of
them pronounced it unacceptable. Gephardt then appeared on the
House floor and called for a vote next week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom Delay, R-Texas, released a statement
Friday denouncing Gephardt's speech, which Delay said contradicted
the satisfaction that Gephardt had expressed with Hastert's
timetable in a meeting with Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all quite surprised that Gephardt did not stick to our
agreement,'' Delay said, adding that Gephardt must not have been
able to sway other Democrats to his viewpoint. ``It is troubling to
witness that Gephardt seemingly does not have the confidence and
trust of his caucus.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sue Harvey, a spokeswoman for Gephardt, said Friday that he
had made no agreement before consulting other House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic aides conceded that there was indeed a rift
among House Democrats in terms of strategy, with some finding
Hastert's timetable acceptable and others intent on rejecting it.
Technically, the Democrats are virtually powerless to force a vote.
</P>
<P>
   A crime subcommittee hearing on gun-control amendments to
McCollum's bill is scheduled for Thursday; in two weeks, the full
House Judiciary Committee is expected to finalize and vote on that
bill.
</P>
<P>
   It could wind up including one gun-control measure _ a raise, to
21 from 18, in the minimum age for the legal purchase and
possession of a handgun _ that is not in the Senate bill. Early
this week, Hastert announced support for raising the age for
purchases, but not possession.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who spent 18 years in the House,
said Friday that gun control is usually a tougher sell there. But,
he said, ``The actual measures we passed in the Senate were modest,
and there has now been a change in public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., one of the House's staunchest
opponents of gun control, agreed with the second half of Schumer's
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Barr added, ``There will be some members who will be swayed by
the president's browbeating and Mr. Gephardt stamping his feet.''

MARYLAND GRANTS TYSON PAROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Tyson, the former world heavyweight champion, was granted
parole Friday by the state of Maryland and will be released from
the Montgomery County jail no later than June 4.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has served four months of a one-year sentence for
assaulting two elderly motorists last Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to complete his sentence under a supervised
house-detention program instead of in a halfway house. The parole
board, which granted parole on a 5-1 vote, said one factor in its
decision was that Tyson would be supervised upon his release. If
Tyson completed his sentence in September, he could not have been
placed under the supervisory terms of parole.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor was that the two motorists, Abmielec Saucedo and
Richard Hardick, supported Tyson's release. At the sentencing
hearing Feb. 5, Saucedo and Hardick said through their lawyers that
Tyson should not be sentenced to prison.
</P>
<P>
   But Montgomery County District Court Judge Stephen Johnson
sentenced Tyson to a one-year term. Tyson had pleaded no contest to
two counts of misdemeanor assault and faced up to 10 years in
prison on each count.
</P>
<P>
   When he entered jail Feb. 5, Tyson was still on probation in
Indiana for a 1992 rape conviction. Judge Patricia Gifford, who
presided over Tyson's rape trial, granted an appeal by Tyson to
modify his probation so that he could serve the rest of it in the
Montgomery County jail. Gifford added a 60-day sentence to Tyson's
time, which amounted to 30 days with good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, 32, has been undergoing psychological counseling, taking
an antidepressant and working on his high school equivalency
diploma. He threw a television against a wall in a recreation room
and spent five days in solitary confinement before a disciplinary
panel decided that he should not be punished. Tyson said prison
authorities took away his medication, because they wanted him to
see a jail psychologist as opposed to his own psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson knocked out Francois Botha in the fifth round Jan. 16 and
three weeks later was sentenced to jail. If he can get himself in
condition, Tyson could return to the ring in August. Showtime,
which has a contract with Tyson, has an Aug. 21 date that it can
use for Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't want to talk about anything with Mike Tyson
until after he is released from jail,'' said Jay Larkin, senior
vice president of programming for Showtime. ``The instant he is out
we'll sit down and talk plans, times, dates and opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's incarceration did not stop possible opponents from
positioning themselves. His first bout could be against Axel
Schulz, and Shannon Briggs is angling for a December bout. &QL;

 &HT;    Jar Jar in `Phantom Menace' gets in way of story, critics
contend.
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The critics have not been kind to Jar Jar Binks.
While reviews of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' have
been widely mixed, film pundits are united in their dislike of the
unintelligible, computer-generated Gungan.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called the overtly cute
sidekick to Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn the film's biggest
miscalculation. ``Looking like a large and ungainly sea horse, Jar
Jar, who inexplicably speaks in a kind of Caribbean patois, is a
major miscue, a comic-relief character who's, frankly, not funny,''
Turan wrote. ``The Gungan as a whole prove very difficult to
understand, and when you can make out what they're saying (`You're
in big do-do this time') you wish you hadn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman described the character
as ``a rabbit-eared mascot ... whose goofy tongue-twisting patois
renders him a nuisance within 30 seconds.'' Some have also found
Jar Jar's silly manner of speaking offensive.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today who offered what may be
the most prescient appraisal, especially for parents of young
children: ``Jabbering annoyance that he is, ... this frog-faced
galoot and his ``me-sa, you-sa, we-sa'' pidgin English is in the
grand tradition of Chewbacca and C-3PO. Jar Jar will be the action
figure most likely to cause you to trip on your kid's bedroom
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   From prissy robots and growling Wookiees to cuddly, teddy
bear-like Ewoks, the ``Star Wars'' films have always held strong
points of appeal for children. Series creator George Lucas, who
wrote, directed and executive produced this first of three planned
prequels, which opened Wednesday, said that fans who grew up with
the original trilogy have gotten older and that the new film is
really for young people.
</P>
<P>
   But is Lucas at risk of alienating his core audience to attract
new fans?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way,'' said ``Phantom Menace'' producer Rick
McCallum, ``for those people that are perhaps a little more bitter,
mean-spirited or twisted, you're not going to like it as much. It
won't be the same thing. You won't have the same expectations. But
it is ostensibly a kids' movie, and they're coming to it in a
completely different, new light. And hopefully, they'll live
through it just like perhaps you did when you were younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its preteen target audience, McCallum said the film is
trans-generational, and will be easier for parents to sit through
than most movies made for kids. ``I really do think there's a new
generation out there that's ready and hyped and excited about
seeing the film,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace's'' younger focus is probably the result of
Lucas' newfound role as the single father of three adopted
children. The 55-year-old filmmaker had his adopted son, Jett, then
6, with him constantly on the set. Jett reportedly coined the word,
``Gungan,'' using it at age 2 to describe heavy machinery. The
Gungan language is a mixture of patois and childish malapropisms
(``Exsqueeze me'').
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Lucas said the new movie is no more kid-friendly than any
of the previous ``Star Wars'' films. ``When I did the other films,
I said, this is a film for 12-year-olds, and it's a kids' movie. At
the time, everybody said fine, and that was I think one of the
reasons we got a lot of bad reviews. They said this is just a
Disney movie. But then somehow over the years, people have sort of
drifted away from that and tried to make it into something other
than what its actually is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, speaking last week at a press conference at the Regency
Hotel, used the uproar over the announcement of ``Episode I's''
title as an example. ``The fans had sort of decided that the title
was going to be something significant, and I said this is a
Saturday-afternoon serial for children. ``The Phantom Menace'' is
the perfect title for a film like this,'' he said. ``It has a
roll-up, it has `Episode I.' People forget what the movies actually
are.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the heavily merchandized Jar Jar seems befuddled by his
dialogue. ``Me gods! What is me-sa saying?'' he asks at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Best, the former ``Stomp'' performer who created Jar Jar's
movements for computer animators and provides his voice, told one
publication that the first dialogue he saw for the character looked
like a sentence full of typos. Yet the cast members are quick to
defend Jar Jar's role in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of adults have been complaining about Jar Jar being so
stupid,'' said Jake Lloyd, the 10-year-old actor who plays young
Anakin Skywalker. ``I think a 10-year-old would like it.'' Lloyd
said that without Jar Jar, the human characters would have no
relation to the Gungans, an amphibious race that figures
prominently in the film's climactic battle sequence.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Best said the much-maligned character
represents the innocence and honesty of the film. He was aware of
the early hits Jar Jar has been taking from fans and critics.
``Whether or not the fans will dig him, I don't know,'' Best, 25,
said. ``I dig him. I guess that's what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides being difficult to understand, Jar Jar has been
criticized for his Caribbean-flavored accent. Entertainment Weekly
described him as ``the gene-spliced love child of Roger Rabbit and,
so help us, Stepin Fetchit.'' Other alien characters are also
drawing some fire for perceived racial stereotyping. The
Neimodians, who launch a surprise attack on Naboo, talk like
Asians. Watto, the hovering blue junk dealer who likes to haggle,
sounds like an Arab.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no accent,'' Best said, regarding Jar Jar. ``I guess
there is an accent _ I mean, you guys have all been hearing an
accent, but it's completely unintentional. I'm Caribbean, but there
was no Caribbean in it. Jar Jar's from Naboo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' is heavy on lighthearted kid appeal, but
the series will inherently grow darker over next two prequels, as
Anakin is seduced by the dark side of the Force and becomes Darth
Vader. ``I think it's a different world for kids now,'' said
McCallum, a father of four. ``It's no longer black and white _ it's
gray. And we're really going to get into the grayness of it for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning once again to the critics, Todd McCarthy of Variety
offers the perfect summation: ``So while the new picture may not
deliver everything the original fans have been fantasizing about
for most of their lives, Lucas may again assert his status as the
shrewdest marketeer among filmmakers, if he can capture the new
generation for his fresh trilogy while still taking old-time fans
along for the ride.

FREEZE ON N.Y. LAWMAKERS' PAYROLL IS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A state judge ruled Friday that a new law
withholding state legislators' pay until a budget is passed is
unconstitutional. His decision dealt a blow to an attempt to speed
the state's notoriously lethargic budget process.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said they
would appeal the ruling. Both camps in the case have agreed that
the ruling will not go into effect while an appeal is pending, so
it may be months before the legislators see new paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   The 211 members of the Assembly and the Senate have not been
paid since March 31, the last day of the old fiscal year, and some
say they are beginning to have financial trouble. ``Let's just say
that my landlord is happy at the thought of my getting paid
again,'' said state Sen. Thomas Duane of Manhattan, one of 14
legislators, all Democrats, who sued to challenge the law.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs took heart from the strongly worded decision by
Justice Richard Huttner of state Supreme Court in Brooklyn. He
found that the law gives the governor a coercive power over the
Legislature that curbs its power and independence, in violation of
the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When even one legislator, by dint of economic circumstance, is
coerced into passing a budget that may require him or her to
sacrifice conscientiously held beliefs, then the entire process is
tainted,'' Justice Huttner wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The state budget is 51 days overdue, there are no serious
negotiations under way, and the Republicans who control the Senate
and the Democrats who run the Assembly are blaming each other for
the lack of progress. Republicans say Democrats have dawdled,
pinning their hopes on the court case, while Democrats have accused
the governor of waiting for them to crumble under the pressure of
working unpaid for months.
</P>
<P>
   In the icy atmosphere of the Capitol, where even civil talk
among the powers has become rare, the dispute over pay has deepened
the animosity between Pataki, who continues to collect his salary,
and the Assembly Democrats, including Speaker Sheldon Silver of
Manhattan. And it has heightened tensions between Silver, who did
not take part in the suit but looked favorably on it, and state
Senate Republican Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, who first proposed
the law withholding pay.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has proposed a $72.7 billion budget, while the Assembly
Democrats want to spend $2 billion to $4 billion more, and the
Senate Republicans' plan falls between the other two proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Cases turning on constitutional questions can sometimes be
appealed directly to the Court of Appeals, New York's highest
court, bypassing the Appellate Division, but it remains unclear
whether that will happen in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Huttner ruled that the withholding law, known as Chapter
635, violated both the separation of legislative and executive
powers implicit in the state constitution, and an explicit
provision barring any change in a legislator's pay during a
two-year term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chapter 635 flies in the face of that prohibition,'' he wrote.
``By enacting Chapter 635, those legislators who voted in favor
improvidently and unconstitutionally incapacitated the Legislature
from performing its duty as a representative body.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Richard Gottfried of Manhattan, who has taken the
lead in the suit, said: ``The court's analysis is quite plain, and
doesn't leave much room for argument. I know we're not going to get
paid, but I'm very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver could not be reached by telephone because he was
observing the Jewish holiday of Shabuoth.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno issued a statement saying: ``This entire issue can be
easily resolved by passing a budget. It is long past time that the
Assembly join with the Senate and the governor in adopting a
prudent, responsible budget that meets the needs of the people of
this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, Pataki's communications director, expressed
confidence that the law would be upheld. The plaintiffs' pursuit of
the case, she said, ``proves that they're not interested in doing
the people's business, only in getting paid.''
</P>
<P>
   The withholding law was rooted in the legislators' deep desire
for a pay raise, which Pataki had opposed for years. In December,
he relented and signed a bill increasing state elected officials'
salaries by 38 percent. Legislators now earn $79,500 a year, plus
stipends for leadership and committee positions that raise the
average close to $90,000. The governor earns $179,500.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki insisted that a withholding law be part of the price
the Legislature would pay for his agreement to the raise.
</P>
<P>
   In April, 11 Assembly and Senate Democrats who had voted against
the law, and three who first took office in January, after it was
enacted, sued to overturn it. Many Republican legislators are
sympathetic to their cause but have not spoken out, unwilling to
risk the ire of Bruno, Pataki or the public. And some lawmakers in
both parties voted for the law, believing that it would be struck
down in court.

NICKLAUS IS 2 OVER, WITH A NEW HIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVONDALE, Pa. _ He hit some good shots, he hit some poor shots,
but for Jack Nicklaus, it was another mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   After a 10-month absence from competitive golf, and hip
replacement surgery on Jan. 27, Nicklaus returned Friday, shooting
a two-over-par 74 in the opening round of the Bell Atlantic
Classic. Nicklaus was tied for 37th place in the field of 77
golfers, eight strokes behind the first-round leader, Frank Conner
(66), who was two shots better than three others in the field.
</P>
<P>
   But for Nicklaus, Friday was about more than posting a score. It
was another step in his remarkably swift recovery, a return to
tournament golf weeks faster than his doctors had projected. And at
59, it was a chance to reacquaint himself with all the things he
missed during his recuperation _ the competition, the gallery, the
adrenaline rush of hitting a shot just the way he envisioned it.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus played down his expectations before Friday's round, but
the competitive fire that helped him win 18 professional majors
switched on when he stepped onto the first tee at Hartefeld
National Golf Club, surrounded by the largest gallery among the
tournament crowd estimated at 25,000. There were several highlights
during Nicklaus' round, which included three birdies, three bogeys
and a double-bogey. He had a 12-foot birdie putt at No. 2, a
terrific bunker shot at No. 8, which led to another birdie, and a
great approach shot at the par-4 No. 15, leading to a 12-foot
birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus' left hip was pain-free, despite his making his return
on one of the Senior PGA Tour's hilliest courses. Carts are
available for senior players, but Nicklaus walked the course, using
the cart only on two occasions to speed up play.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Nicklaus was not satisfied with his 74,
despite the circumstances. But that is part of what makes him Jack
Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to shoot a 65 Friday, but I would've liked
to,'' Nicklaus said. ``I did exactly what I expected to do. I
didn't break 70 in any of my practice rounds. My concentration and
focus was fine. My conditioning was fine. It's a start for me. My
body is better now than it has been in three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I hit some good chip shots, but as many as I had, some
were bound to be good. I'll get better, and I'll do better playing
myself back into shape than I will sitting at home. The galleries
weren't too big in my backyard. Playing in front of people, I don't
want to embarrass myself, so coming out will motivate me to work
harder. And I had been home long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks, Nicklaus will be host of, and compete in, the
Memorial Tournament, and he will also play in June's U.S. Open.
Though Nicklaus doubts he will play in this year's British Open, he
plans to compete in the remaining two Senior Tour majors, the Ford
Senior Players Championship in June and the U.S. Senior Open in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus had been dealing with severe hip pain for more than two
years, but after his successful surgery, Nicklaus is optimistic
that he will be able to compete as often as he wishes. Nicklaus has
not won on the Senior Tour since 1996, but as recently as last year
he finished tied for sixth place at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Nicklaus shot a 38 on the front nine, including a
double-bogey on the par-3 No. 9, but he shot a 36 on the back nine,
and he was looking forward to Saturday's second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved the game, and I've always loved to play,''
Nicklaus said. ``I didn't think that I would be playing golf all my
life, but I am. But I also love to do other things. That's why the
hip operation was important, so I could do the things I love.'' &QL;

SMALL-PRINT PROVISIONS OF GUN BILL PLEASE FEDERAL OFFICIALS BEST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A handful of relatively little-noticed provisions in the crime
bill passed by the Senate on Thursday may do as much or more to
curb the flow of illegal guns to criminals and juveniles than the
much-debated measures that require child safety locks and
background checks at gun shows, senior Treasury Department
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   These provisions would make it easier to prosecute gun dealers
who sell firearms to straw purchasers on behalf of criminals,
increase sentences for people convicted of selling guns to
juveniles and require dealers at gun shows to record the serial
numbers of all guns they sell, including used guns.
</P>
<P>
   Currently gun dealers have to report only the sales of new guns,
making it very difficult for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms to trace guns that have been resold and then used in
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Taken as a whole, the bill's provisions are incremental and
might not have prevented the recent school shootings that helped
propel its passage in the Senate. But the new enforcement measures,
combined with the bill's provision for mandatory background checks
of buyers at gun shows, would go a long way toward closing some of
the loopholes in gun laws that firearms agents, prosecutors and
judges have long said make them difficult to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these changes significantly increase law enforcement's
ability to identify illegal gun traffickers and attack the way the
guns are supplied to criminals and particularly to youth,'' said a
senior official at the Treasury Department, which oversees the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. ``Yesterday's vote was a
breakthrough, a real watershed.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Rifle Association, Bill Powers, did
not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Rand, a lawyer for the Violence Policy Center in
Washington, a research and advocacy group, said she particularly
welcomed the imposition of background checks at gun shows, calling
the measure ``the most important step we've taken in regulating the
secondary sales market, where 40 percent of guns are sold.''
</P>
<P>
   The secondary market includes all sales by private individuals,
rather than Federally licensed firearms dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The number of gun shows has increased significantly in recent
years, to about 4,000 a year, especially after a 1986 law
effectively allowed individuals to sell large numbers of guns at
gun shows without being considered dealers, who need Federal
licenses. In practice, agents of the firearms bureau say, this has
allowed large numbers of guns to be sold to people without
recording the sales or the buyers' identities.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require a private or individual seller to get a
federally licensed dealer at the gun show to perform the background
check on a prospective buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Delfay, the president of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, the largest gun industry trade organization,
acknowledged that allowing people to buy guns at gun shows without
them undergoing the same kind of inspection required at gun stores
was a loophole. But, he said, ``I think they fixed the loophole not
wisely, but too well.''
</P>
<P>
   Delfay said the new provision would require dealers at gun shows
to send a record of each sale to the firearms bureau. Dealers now
keep these forms and send them to the bureau only when they go out
of business.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle association and its supporters have worried that such
records could be the first step in a national gun registration
system, which they oppose.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill contains several other provisions that did not
figure prominently in the debate on gun shows but may have an
impact on gun trafficking. One directs U.S. attorneys to focus more
attention on firearms enforcement, which is often overlooked by
federal prosecutors, firearms agents say.
</P>
<P>
   Another requires the attorney general to make regular reports on
gun prosecutions. At the moment, agents say, reporting is
impossible because the firearms bureau has been kept on such a
small budget by the gun lobby's supporters in Congress that it does
not have computers to enter data on prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Still another provision would ban the sale of guns to anyone
with a serious juvenile conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention
Research Program at the University of California at Davis, said a
study he conducted found that people who had been convicted as
juveniles were more likely to be charged with new crimes as adults
than handgun buyers with no criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   Pawnshops also were part of the debate. Used guns sold and
redeemed through pawnshops are believed to play a significant role
in firearms-related crimes. ``As you can imagine, a lot of
criminals have an occasion to pawn their guns,'' said Dennis
Henigan, a lawyer with Handgun Control.
</P>
<P>
   The pawnshop provision in the Senate bill, however, simply keeps
in place a requirement for background checks of anyone redeeming a
gun at a pawnshop, preventing the reopening of a loophole that
existed until a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision of the bill concerns gun safety.
</P>
<P>
   Gun safety advocates have long been concerned that some 150
children are killed each year when children pick up loaded guns and
accidentally shoot themselves or playmates. In response to
legislative pressure last year, most gun manufacturers voluntarily
agreed to include some type of safety device, such as a trigger
lock or a locking box, with each new gun they shipped.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate proposal, all new guns would have to be sold
with such devices.
</P>
<P>
   But there is debate even among gun-control advocates about the
effectiveness of the requirement. Handgun Control, for example,
supports it as sending an important safety message. Others believe
that those who store firearms unsafely or feel that they need ready
access to their weapons for self-protection will not use a lock.

   30-YEAR TREASURY YIELDS DECLINE TO 5.75 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond declined this week from a
1999 high of 5.92 percent on May 14. It closed Friday at 5.75
percent. Treasury bond prices held onto strong gains as jitters
about emerging markets caused flight-to-quality buying while the
expiration of June options increased purchases of bond futures.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Board policy-makers said that they
were leaning toward raising interest rates to slow economic growth
and curb inflation. Although they did not raise their interest-rate
target, which is now 4.75 percent, the warning is now official.

   JAPANESE BANKS REPORT BIG LOSSES

<P>
   Japan's eight largest banks have reported steep fiscal-year
losses. The poor performance largely reflected efforts by the banks
to clean their books by writing off bad loans. The losses, however,
were still larger than expected. The main reason is that the banks
must follow stricter rules for evaluating bad loans and creating a
deeper cushion of money in the event that good loans go bad.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Candid version of the advice the Ford Motor Co. might offer its
competitor, Renault SA, on making an investment in a Japanese car
company would probably be something like this: Get ready for a
long, hard trek, because the payoff won't come quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's 20-year, $624 million odyssey with a Japanese car maker,
the Mazda Motor Corp., has so far produced a lot of headaches. But
since Renault has already plunked down $5.4 billion to buy a 36.8
percent stake in the sputtering Nissan Motor Co., Japan's
second-largest auto maker, avoiding the potential potholes is no
longer an option.
</P>
<P>
   So what lessons has Ford learned that might be useful to its
French competitor? Grasp authority and hang onto it for dear life.
Expect nasty surprises. Hand responsibility for a turnaround to
your partner and its employees. Respect the sacred cows, but don't
kowtow to them. Read the life story of Mother Teresa _ hers is the
sort of tenacity and forbearance that you will need.
</P>
<P>
   These principles have led to what industry executives regard as
the beginning of a turnaround at Mazda's headquarters and sprawling
factories in Hiroshima. The company has gained market share in
Japan despite slipping sales and an extremely weak domestic car
market; in the fiscal year ended March 31, it posted its first
overall profit, including the performance of subsidiaries, in six
years.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profits doubled, and, thanks to a more than $2 billion
reduction in costs, the break-even point for Mazda alone, exclusive
of subsidiaries, has plummeted almost 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has been accomplished without the cultural clashes
that many people expected when Ford took control of Mazda in 1996
after 17 years as a major stockholder. After all, international
auto mergers have a history of ending badly, with the two
best-known examples involving Renault: the managerial chaos at the
American Motors Corp., which Renault controlled through most of the
1980s and sold to Chrysler in 1987, and Renault's failed merger
with Volvo of Sweden in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Renault and Nissan executives have been trying
to understand why Ford and Mazda have gotten along so much better.
``That relationship between Ford and Mazda is very good, and that
is one example of two cultures working,'' Yoshikazu Hanawa, the
chief executive of Nissan, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is clear that the French are trying to follow Ford's
blueprint. Ford increased its stake in Mazda in 1996 by giving it
cash for new shares, and Mazda spent the cash to reduce debt,
bankroll vehicle-development programs and meet other urgent
financial needs. Now Nissan has issued new shares to Renault and
has plans for a similar kind of spending.
</P>
<P>
   Also following Ford's lead, Renault is trying to combine its
product lineups with its Japanese partner's to eliminate
duplication, but without sending lots of managers to Japan. ``It is
not about merging corporate structures; it is about working
together to develop and sell cars, which is not quite the same
thing,'' said Louis Schweitzer, chairman of Renault.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rapport between Ford and Mazda obscures an awkward
fact that can only trouble Renault's shareholders: Ford has made
little money on its Japanese investment and is unlikely to make
much anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Ford has behaved to some extent as an indulgent sugar
daddy, willing to bail out its Japanese partner and providing
gentle nudges rather than risking blunt action that might upset
managers at Mazda's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, eight times the size of Mazda, is the world's
second-largest company in sales, after General Motors, so it can
afford to make generously financed, long-term bets on the Japanese
market. Renault does not have that luxury. It is slightly smaller
than Nissan in sales and less than one-third the size of Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's problems are bigger than Mazda's ever were, mainly
because Nissan has continued to bleed financially as the Japanese
auto market has crumbled over the last three years, while Ford has
taken some steps to stanch Mazda's losses.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Schweitzer, delighted at the scope of his deal,
declared soon after the ink was dry in March that it would offer a
``shortcut to the world growth status we were looking for.'' If
Ford's experience is any guide, however, the road ahead of Renault
may be more of a meandering detour.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, Ford's investment in Mazda, starting in 1979
with the purchase of a 25 percent stake for $140 million, amounted
to little more than an expensive visitor's pass for Detroit
engineers and managers to tour Japanese factories. One of Ford's
goals was to figure out why Japanese auto makers seemed able to
build more reliable and affordable cars than American auto makers,
and it did pick up valuable tips on quality and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But it had little success in influencing Mazda's overall
strategy _ failing, for example, to persuade Mazda not to produce
cars that competed directly with Ford models.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first 17 years of the partnership, in fact, Mazda
executives largely ignored their American partners. Indeed, in the
early '90s, Mazda went on a panicked spending spree, building a
modern factory for the equivalent of several hundred million
dollars, and opening three new sales divisions while the Japanese
economy tumbled into its worst recession since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Mazda executives appointed by Ford, meanwhile, were not
even invited to key meetings and did not always receive full
information about Mazda's activities, said Henry D.G. Wallace, a
career Ford executive who served as Mazda's executive vice
president in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The situation changed in 1996, when Ford spent $484 million to
raise its holdings to 33.4 percent after Mazda found itself losing
money and struggling to meet its debt payments. By itself, such a
stake usually does not confer control in Japan. But Ford imposed a
crucial condition on its investment: that it have the right to
appoint Mazda's president.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace got the job, becoming the first foreigner to oversee a
Japanese auto maker. And he was no figurehead. At Mazda, as in most
large Japanese companies, whoever is president is virtually an
absolute monarch; his wishes rarely go unfulfilled, no matter how
unreasonable, unprofitable or ill-conceived. No longer, Wallace
said, was he outside the loop. He was the loop.

 &HT;    Fear clings to Kosovar
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Kelmend Hapciu is an ethnic Albanian refugee from
Pristina who has been living and working in Dayton _ very quietly _
for the past four months. Although members of his immediate family
are here, other relatives and friends remain in Kosovo or in the
refugee camps in Macedonia or Albania.
</P>
<P>
   He fears for their safety.
</P>
<P>
   He watches the news on television, scanning the faces of
refugees streaming across the border. Ask if he recognizes anyone,
and he sadly nods his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pristina is a small place, perhaps 250,000,'' he said. ``I
lived there all my life; it is possible that I know every one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hapciu asks that relatives who remain in Kosovo not be
identified in this article, fearing possible retribution by the
Serb police force. He has not heard from them since the bombing
began in March.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last month, however, Hapciu has been joined here by
his wife and two children, but their escape was harrowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they walked across the border they had to bribe a
policeman,'' he said. ``Just after they crossed the border, it was
closed.''
</P>
<P>
   A journalist who is currently on a fellowship at the Kettering
Foundation, Hapciu knows first-hand the terror imposed on his
country by the Serb army and police force.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Pristina, you never voluntarily said you were a
journalist,'' he said. ``You said you were unemployed or working in
some other profession. The journalists were among the Serbs' first
targets. The fear of being stopped by a policeman and asked if you
were a journalist was very real.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1982 to 1990, Hapciu worked as an international news editor
for the Albania daily newspaper, Rilindja. But in 1990, Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic abolished Kosovo's autonomy and the
Serbian parliament banned the newspaper. It was shut down and its
property and printing presses seized. Hapciu moved to a weekly
newspaper, but it too was banned last December with the adoption of
the Serbian Law on Information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been going on for many, many years,'' he said.
``Albanians have learned to live with the fear. I have heard that
there are between 500 and 600 villages that have been completely
burned down.''
</P>
<P>
   Hapciu believes the NATO bombing campaign was necessary, but
that ground troops also should have been used to prevent the flood
of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombing has been effective and it had to be done if you
were going to try to save the lives of the people,'' he said. ``One
can argue about the timing. It should have been done much sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Hapciu thinks the problem of Kosovo and the ethnic Albanians
should have been dealt with during talks that led to the Dayton
Peace Accords in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't tackled then and somebody had to pay the price,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hapciu has doubts about a possible settlement, even with Serbian
forces pulled back and a NATO-Russian peacekeeping force in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of Milosevic is going to be one of the crucial
questions that will decide that agreement,'' he said. ``But how can
you negotiate with a man you have called a war criminal?''
</P>
<P>
   Albanians, he said, have a strong attachment to their land, but
he does not see a quick return of the refugees, even with a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can only imagine what those people who fled are going
through,'' he said. ``I don't see a single one returning without a
very, very strong international force.''
</P>
<P>
   Hapciu said his wife and children talk constantly of Kosovo and
someday returning to Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I want to return as quickly as possible,'' he said.
``That is my country.''

<P>
   Ford also had a powerful ally in Sumitomo bank, Mazda's main
lender. Sumitomo and Ford had a close, longstanding relationship;
it was Sumitomo officials, for example, not Mazda executives, who
convinced Ford to make its initial investment in Mazda, and it was
Sumitomo officials who put Ford on a white horse to rescue Mazda in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Ford wanted to see was that the relationship with Mazda
would go smoothly, and when it was necessary, we did talk to Mazda
to insure its cooperation,'' said Sotoo Tatsumi, the retired
Sumitomo chairman who first approached Ford in the early '70s, when
he was a general manager. ``Until a few years ago, not all the
people at Mazda welcomed Ford.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Ford managers who are now Mazda executives consider
the Sumitomo relationship crucial to their success. ``It's not just
Ford and Mazda at work here,'' James E. Miller, Wallace's successor
as Mazda's president, often says. ``It's Ford, Mazda and
Sumitomo.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Renault's 36.8 percent stake in Nissan is slightly larger
than Ford's holdings in Mazda, Renault does not appear likely to
wield as much control. Renault will be installing Carlos Ghosn, one
of its best executives, at Nissan this summer, but he will be the
chief operating officer, and while Nissan's executive vice
presidents will report to him, he will report to Hanawa.
</P>
<P>
   Ask top American or European auto executives about their
Japanese rivals these days, and they are likely to repeat dark
rumors about how much debt the Japanese companies have _ and how
much of it lurks in hidden business partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of Nissan's liabilities off the balance sheet
apparently had a lot to do with a decision by DaimlerChrysler AG
not to invest in the company. But Renault says it has not been
scared by what it has found in poring over Nissan's books.
</P>
<P>
   There are many stories in the auto industry about how much debt
Ford might have discovered at Mazda after taking control, mostly at
dealerships that were owned by Mazda. Kaoru Kurata, an auto analyst
at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd., estimates that Mazda's
dealership-related debts may be as high as $3.66 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ford executives say their full year of research before taking
control adequately documented these debts. But Gary K. Hexter, a
Ford manager who is now Mazda's chief financial officer,
acknowledged that there had been some surprises elsewhere. ``Yes,
we've found some liabilities that hadn't been adequately
identified, both at Mazda and at the subsidiary companies,'' he
said. ``It's inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   William C. Ford Jr., chairman of Ford Motor, said there had not
been any major shocks. ``We have a very firm idea of where Mazda
is,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent any future shocks, however, Hexter has the thankless
task of trying to bring order to Mazda's books, pulling together
figures on roughly 180 affiliates and subsidiaries. He has
established borrowing limits; he also requires pre-approval of
major new spending and reviews new business proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made a lot of progress, but it has been slower in the
domestic subsidiaries and dealerships,'' he said. ``There's such a
huge range of businesses, which makes it difficult to manage them
centrally.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford executives have long believed that there is nothing like
tangible success to help win friends and allies. So the Ford
managers dispatched to Mazda have made a practice of setting all
sorts of targets and then making it clear that they expect them to
be met.
</P>
<P>
   That is a big change for Mazda, said Kei Kado, a director in
charge of product development planning and international business
planning. ``Most Japanese workers would feel that a target is a
sort of challenge,'' Kado said. ``But the people from Ford regard
it as a commitment _ and in Japan, if you don't meet your
commitments, you put a knife in your stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his tasks was to achieve a 40 percent reduction in the
variable costs of car production _ the expenses left after
subtracting things like profit margins, fixed costs, advertising
and the price of logistics from the price of a car. He accomplished
that, and now Miller is asking him to save 30 percent to 40 percent
more.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda's dealers and directors were shocked when he began pushing
a plan that consolidated back-office dealership operations
regionally, eliminated unprofitable shops and pared the number of
dealer chains from five to three. All of Mazda's Japanese directors
opposed the plan, but Miller persisted. Then the results came in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our monthly expenses went down by nearly 100 million yen,''
exclaimed Yoichi Suzuki, president of the consolidated dealership
operation in Saitama prefecture, still somewhat in awe of the
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their approach is brilliant in terms of business,'' Suzuki
said of the Ford officials. ``They are energetic, speedy and clear
about what they want. The Japanese style is more ambiguous,
dependent on mood and human relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, though, Mazda's Japanese managers have become accustomed
to once-startling changes. Among other things, Mazda has eliminated
the time-honored Japanese practice of shuffling unneeded
white-collar workers off to affiliates for two-year job stints,
rather than laying them off. Instead, it now dispatches them to its
own assembly line, where staffing is relatively lean.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Ford has been criticized for not moving
faster at Mazda to reduce capacity, cut jobs and use other tools
favored by American companies overhauling their operations. In
Japan, however, it has been praised for the same cautious approach.
``I did not give them any specific advice,'' Sumitomo's Tatsumi
said, ``but I knew Ford understood it would need a soft touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the company has eliminated about 6,000 jobs, it has
winnowed its ranks through attrition, early retirement and leaner
hiring practices, softening the effects on the Hiroshima area,
where the company is crucial to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford's genius has been in differentiating the truly sacred
cows from the merely privileged ones. Consider taxicabs. In 1995,
Mazda was producing cars for sale to taxicab companies, a business
dominated by Toyota and Nissan, and it wasn't making money on the
operation.

 UNDATED: the operation.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wallace's suggestion that Mazda exit the cab business met with
protest from Japanese executives _ cries quickly silenced when he
asked whether they wanted to be riding in Mazda taxis after the
company went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   At the insistence of managers sent from Ford, Mazda also slowed
research into rotary engines, a product for which the company was
famous but which had limited usefulness. ``That was painful,
because a lot of people felt it was the heart and soul of the
company,'' said Wallace, now group vice president for Asia-Pacific
operations and affiliations at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn,
Mich.
</P>
<P>
   To soften this sort of pain, Ford's executives have tried to
adopt local customs whenever possible. Miller has stunned his
Japanese colleagues with his whole-hearted embrace of the
after-hours carousing that is an integral part of Japanese
business. His stamina in keeping up with the parties that migrate
from restaurant to bar to bar has astonished Mazda employees.
</P>
<P>
   And like Japanese executives, Miller often takes to the
public-address system to rally the troops, reading haltingly in
Japanese to make announcements, issue exhortations and pay
compliments for jobs well done.
</P>
<P>
   His cosmopolitan ways reflect one of Ford's biggest assets at
Mazda _ its unusually large corps of globe-trotting executives.
Miller is an American, but his curriculum vitae reads like that of
the most seasoned international executive: president of Ford New
Zealand from 1989 to 1993; head of Eastern Europe and exports at
Ford Europe to 1994; president of Ford's South African subsidiary
until 1997, when he joined Mazda.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the six group vice presidents at Ford grew up outside
the United States, including Wallace, a Scot. So did Jacques
Nasser, the new chief executive and president, who was raised in
Lebanon and Australia and speaks fluent Arabic, French, Spanish and
Portuguese, in addition to English.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn, the top Renault executive going to Nissan, was born in
Brazil, and the company has long had a large and successful
business in South America. But Renault's leaders are clearly
worried that they may be short of top managers with international
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably we would look outwards for a few new talents at
Renault,'' said Schweitzer, Renault's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   While it appears that Ford has pulled off at least the
beginnings of a turnaround at Mazda, the true benefits of its
investment remain to be seen. ``While we've climbed mountains,''
Miller said, ``there are higher mountains in the range to climb.''
</P>
<P>
   The first synergies will not appear until the end of next year,
when the two companies are expected to begin producing sport
utility vehicles with common suspensions, engines, transmissions
and other components.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, its Mazda stake gives Ford a foothold in the
Japanese market, which can only prove valuable whenever car sales
rebound there. Ford officials hope to sell Mazdas in other Asian
markets, as well, though they have not developed a strategy since
the recent economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   With these benefits hard to measure in dollars and cents, it is
difficult to make a case for the wisdom of Ford's investment. The
company got a bargain in 1979 by securing a quarter interest in
Mazda for the equivalent of $318 million in today's dollars; that
is a pittance compared with the $6.5 billion that Ford paid in
March for Volvo's car-making operations, a smaller but more
consistently profitable business than Mazda. And Ford has also
collected $100 million in dividends from Mazda over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Ford had invested the money it sank into Mazda in 1979 in
its own stock instead, the shares would now be worth $8.4 billion,
a 6,000 percent return. And for $8.4 billion, Ford could buy
controlling stakes in several Mazda-sized companies today.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many auto executives are betting that the industry will
eventually consolidate into five or six big companies. Each of
these leviathans will need sizable operations in Japan. And given
the impossibility of starting from scratch there, American and
European auto makers are going to be in business with the Japanese
one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   By that reasoning, Ford's years of losses at Mazda might someday
not seem like such a waste of money. And Renault, in taking an even
bigger gamble than Ford, can only hope to have as much success.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer, conscious of his company's failures in the past,
said he is determined to form a close partnership with Nissan. His
Japanese partner may not be a beauty now, but he nonetheless uses
the language of love to describe his plans for the courtship.
</P>
<P>
   ``To build a good relationship,'' he said, ``you should not look
at each other but do things together and look in the same
direction.''

DAN SANDERS, A TEACHER AND A LABOR LEADER, DIES AT 69  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Brazil)   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dan Sanders, a former executive vice president of the
New York State United Teachers and a principal architect of the
teacher labor movement in the state, died on Thursday at the
Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the Bronx. He was 69 and had
lived in Putnam Valley, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He died of complications from Alzheimer's disease, said his
wife, Elaine.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, Sanders directed the New York State United
Teachers' legislative program in Albany and Washington. He also
served as a vice president of the American Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was born in the Bronx. He received a bachelor's degree
from the City College of New York in 1951 and a master's degree
from the City University of New York in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   From 1952 to 1962, he taught social studies in New York City and
the Lakeland school district, in Yorktown, N.Y. He was a founder of
the Northern Westchester Federation of Teachers, a forerunner of
the Lakeland Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, as regional director of the Empire State
Federation of Teachers, he coordinated the negotiations for the
first collective bargaining agreements for teachers in New
Rochelle, Mount Vernon and Yonkers. In 1971 and 1972, as executive
director of the United Teachers of New York, he was a key figure in
negotiations leading to the merger of that organization with the
New York State Teachers Association, which produced the New York
State United Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected executive vice president of the organization in
1978. He retired nine years later.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is survived by his wife; his sons, Robert, of Geneva,
and William, of Recife, Brazil; a brother, Sidney, of Great Neck,
N.Y., and a sister, Ruth Mellet of San Diego.

LA using mirrors in bid to land team
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Probably all of us have those little projects we've been putting
off _ maybe some landscaping, adding a deck or even a Jacuzzi.
</P>
<P>
   But it never fails. There's never time to get started and every
time we look up there's not so much as a weed pulled.
</P>
<P>
   We mention this because if we were smart we would tell our
Household Commissioners (i.e. significant others) we are much
further along than it appears.
</P>
<P>
   Much like Los Angeles has been telling the NFL, there's lots
going on behind the scenes. It will all come together. Trust us.
And if you think nothing's happening, you're just not looking deep
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the NFL expansion meetings in March, when Bob
McNair's sure-thing NFL bid was spurned in hopes of Los Angeles
getting its act together, the league has wanted a commitment of
public support from LA.
</P>
<P>
   But it's just not there. The response from LA's bid leaders _
Eli Broad, Ed Roski and Michael Ovitz _ has been that the support
is there if you look hard enough. The LA bidders point to
infrastructure the city provided long ago in the form of parking
spaces in the Coliseum area and street, utility and underground
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, LA bidders say it's more than $120 million worth of
support. Eureka! Let the bulldozers roll.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that also means our patio projects are only a
heartbeat away from popping up before our eyes, too.
</P>
<P>
   Using LA's reasoning, delivery trucks will have to park in our
cul-de-sacs. That's infrastructure, baby, at least a couple-hundred
thou worth. Certainly, Home Depot trucks will have to drive on
highways. That puts us at least another couple of million ahead of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Here we thought we weren't making progress. Here we thought Los
Angeles was as unprepared and ambiguous today as it was in March,
when Roski announced to many a raised eyebrow, ``We're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, they're in the weeds as much as our back yards.
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners will convene again Monday, with some of the meeting
in Atlanta dedicated to hearing progress reports on LA's bid. The
NFL wants solid business models and site-development plans laid out
in detail. It wants to see bonds, public money.
</P>
<P>
   Even if commissioner Paul Tagliabue again ignores the gaping
holes in the LA bid, even if he continues to bend over backward for
Los Angeles _ extending the Sept. 15 deadline for LA will be Tags'
next move _ owners will continue to be played like fools. McNair
and his locked-in bid will continue to play a frustrating waiting
game.
</P>
<P>
   But at what point does it fall apart for LA? The reasons for
wanting Los Angeles have not changed and they are good ones. It is,
after all, Los Angeles. It has 20 million potential television
viewers and is a worldwide media hub.
</P>
<P>
   But since the March meetings in Phoenix, Los Angeles not only
has failed to answer NFL questions, it has raised more.
</P>
<P>
   When NFL officials recently visited LA to examine progress,
bidders included some 9,000 parking spaces on the USC campus as
part of its required 26,000 spaces necessary for the bid. The NFL
deemed those spaces inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, at next week's meetings, Ovitz will detail an elaborate
plan to construct 10,000 parking spaces _ underground _ at an
estimated cost of $100 million. No one has volunteered to chip in
that $100 million. Details. And presumably, Ovitz will skim over
that San Andreas fault thing under LA, too.
</P>
<P>
   But is this even Ovitz's project to take over? When Ovitz
dropped his Carson, Calif., idea and joined Broad and Roski in the
Coliseum proposal weeks ago, it was hailed as a victory.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the NFL will not give the bid to a Broad-Roski-Ovitz
team. It will support only one side or the other, meaning
Broad-Roski is fighting Ovitz as much as ever. They're just now
fighting over the same turf.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the issue of public support. The NFL realizes the
huge flaw in LA's argument that existing infrastructure counts
toward the bid. If there was such a thing, we all could claim
multimillion-dollar patio projects.
</P>
<P>
   NFL executive Roger Goodell, who has aspirations of succeeding
Tagliabue as commissioner and once was LA's loudest trumpeter, is
distancing himself from the LA bid. The NFL wants to see new, solid
Los Angeles dollars committed to the project.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated cost of the LA project is nearly $1 billion. No
NFL owner likely will support that kind of privately funded
project, because they realize it is cost-prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue wants the NFL in Los Angeles so bad, he can't see
straight. But you have to figure someday the owners will. And they
just might come out of the weeds in support of Houston.

 &HT;    Semifinals: Pick a goalie, please
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NHL playoffs are down to four teams. Maybe that
should be, down to four goalies.
</P>
<P>
   The goaltender is the centerpiece of any hockey team, and this
season the NHL is left with its most elite conference championships
in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often easy to pick a series winner as you look at
strengths and weaknesses of each team. And then sometimes you find
yourself just saying, `Well, that team has the better goalie,'''
said Ken Dryden, Toronto Maple Leafs president and a Hall of Fame
goalie. ``But this year, it's hard to find a difference in the
teams because of their goaltending.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Western Conference finals that begin tonight, Colorado's
Patrick Roy faces Ed Belfour of Dallas. Roy is the league's
all-time leader in playoff wins. Belfour started for a team that
allowed the fewest goals this season and earlier in the playoffs
had a shutout string over seven periods.
</P>
<P>
   In the Eastern Conference finals, Buffalo's Dominik Hasek
opposes Toronto's Curtis Joseph. Last year, Hasek reaffirmed his
status as the globe's best goalie after leading an undermanned
Czech Republic team to the Olympic gold medal. Joseph, who signed
with the Leafs as a free agent, is second only to Hasek with a
playoff saves percentage of .930.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas led the league in wins, and Colorado is coming off four
consecutive playoffs wins over two-time defending champion Detroit.
They generally are considered more talented and deeper than either
Buffalo or Toronto. But because a goalie can have a greater impact
on his team than any single athlete in the four major sports,
handicapping this ``Frozen Four'' is problematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goaltending is an odd position, in that it's so important
whether the goalie is good or not good,'' said Dryden, who won five
Vezina Trophies as the league's best netminder and played on six
Stanley Cup teams with Montreal. ``The closest thing you can come
to that is the pitcher in baseball. If he's a 20-game winner or a
four-game winner, he has great influence on how your team does.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek, a finalist this year for the Vezina and Hart (MVP)
awards, has led a eam of modest talent to the conference finals for
the second year in a row. But he has been overshadowed of late by
Roy, who made 71 saves in the Games 5 and 6 wins over Detroit and
stopped 210 of 224 (.937) in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we feel we have the best in the game, especially
this time of year,'' Avalanche center Joe Sakic said, alluding to
Roy's record 107 playoff wins. ``But it's no coincidence that the
four best goalies are all in the finals right now.

 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service ATLANTA _ WESTERN CONFERENCE
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO VS. DALLAS
</P>
<P>
   _ Resumes: Colorado finished the regular season 44-28-10, first
in the Northwest Division, and has eliminated San Jose (4-2) and
Detroit (4-2) in the playoffs. Dallas finished 51-19-12, first in
the Pacific Division, and has eliminated Edmonton (4-0) and St.
Louis (4-2).
</P>
<P>
   _ Season series: Colorado won 2-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the '90s: Colorado won the conference finals over Detroit
and the Stanley Cup over Florida in 1995-96 and lost in the
conference finals to Detroit in 1996-97; Dallas lost to Detroit in
the conference finals last year. As the Minnesota North Stars, they
defeated Edmonton in the conference finals in 1990-91 and lost to
Pittsburgh for the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   _ Update: With four consecutive wins over the defending Cup
champions, some perceive the Avs as the favorites in this series.
They are deep at forward with the addition of Theo Fleury (five
playoff goals) and return of Valeri Kamenski from an injury. Goalie
Patrick Roy is playing as well as in Colorado's title year, making
71 saves in the last two games against Detroit and stopping 210 of
224 (.937) in the series. Dallas has been just as strong in goal,
with Ed Belfour, but has struggled offensively. Brett Hull, demoted
from the Stars' top line during the St. Louis series, was back with
center Mike Modano in Game 6 and responded by setting up Dallas's
tying and winning goals in a 2-1 OT win. Hull's goal scoring will
be needed in this series for the Stars to keep pace. Dallas coach
Ken Hitchcock said five of his players were bothered this week by a
viral infection, but he did not identify them and expected all to
be ready for the opener.
</P>
<P>
   _ Quote, unquote: ``We've beaten the `B' team but we haven't
beaten the `A' team.'' _ Hitchcock, noting that the Stars' only win
this year came before Colorado's second-half surge and acquisition
of Fleury.
</P>
<P>
   _ By the numbers: 6-0. Colorado's road record in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prediction: Colorado in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   BUFFALO VS. TORONTO
</P>
<P>
   _ Resumes: Buffalo finished the regular season 37-28-17, fourth
in the Northeast Division, and has eliminated Ottawa (4-0) and
Boston (4-2) in the playoffs. Toronto finished 45-30-17, second in
the Northeast Division, and has eliminated Philadelphia (4-2) and
Pittsburgh (4-2).
</P>
<P>
   _ Season series: Buffalo won 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the '90s: Buffalo lost to Washington in the conference
finals last year. Toronto lost in the conference finals in 1993 to
Los Angeles and 1994 to Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   _ Update: These teams have had a long-running border war but are
meeting in the playoffs for the first time. Toronto was the
league's highest-scoring team this year but managed just 10 goals
in five meetings with the Sabres, with Dominik Hasek stopping 153
of 163 shots. Hasek leads playoff goalies with a .942 saves
percentage, but the Sabres also have been getting excellent play
from center Michael Peca (11 points), who has scored the first goal
in three postseason games. The Leafs are far deeper offensively
than Buffalo, and goalie Curtis Joseph (.930, 1.81 goals against in
12 playoff starts) has been nearly as strong as Hasek. But the
Sabres appear to have a huge edge on the power play, having
converted 10 of 44 chances (22.7 percent) in the postseason. The
Leafs have struggled at 12-for-57 (10.5 percent) and were only
1-for-23 (4.3) this year against Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Quote, unquote: ``I barely remember being in the organization.
I had years of therapy to erase that from my memory.'' _ Buffalo
winger Dixon Ward, who played 22 games with Toronto in 1994-95 and
later was released.
</P>
<P>
   _ By the numbers: 32. Number of years since the Maple Leafs last
appeared in the Stanley Cup finals. They defeated Montreal in an
all-Canadian series in 1966-67.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prediction: Toronto in seven games.

BOY TOOK PARENT'S GUNS FOR GEORGIA SCHOOL ATTACK, SHERIFF SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thomas Solomon, the 15-year-old accused in the
shooting of six students at a suburban high school , broke into his
stepfather's locked gun cabinet to get two weapons, then carried
them aboard a school bus, authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning the teen-ager by name, Sheriff Jeff T.
Wigington of Rockdale County, where the shooting took place in
Conyers Thursday morning, said the attacker had strapped the rifle
to his leg beneath a pair of baggy blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Solomon's family, who said he was authorized to
speak on their behalf, said the boy had been under medical
treatment for depression, and was taking Ritalin, which is often
prescribed for hyperactivity or an attention deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The friend, who asked not to be identified, said Solomon was a
trained marksman who often went hunting with his stepfather.
Because of the boy's skills as a marksman, the friend said, he may
have deliberately shot to wound, rather than kill.
</P>
<P>
   The image of a depressive, almost anonymous boy riding a yellow
bus to school with his family's weapons seemed to deepen the sense
of unreality that the shooting has created here.
</P>
<P>
   Although only one of the six victims suffered a serious injury,
the incident has brought the Atlanta region unwillingly into the
small fraternity of cities and towns that have experienced spasms
of school violence. As the Atlanta Constitution's main headline
read this morning: ``It Happened Here.''
</P>
<P>
   With classes at Heritage High School closed for the day,
parents, students and teachers clustered at churches and community
centers, discussing the incident and how it would affect life at
Heritage and around Conyers, a middle-class town 25 miles east of
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Several parents said there was barely a family in the county
that had not spent the evening analyzing the shooting and its
meaning, particularly after the deadly attack last month in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where people move for the peace and quiet, and it's
still that way,'' said Margaret Lilly, whose son Lee is a senior at
the high-achieving, middle-class high school. ``We don't want our
kids to be imprisoned. What kind of country do we live in if our
kids have to go through metal detectors? But it may come to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another parent, Mary McAlpin, who has three children at Memorial
High School in Conyers, said she was so worried about copycat
shootings that she wished the school district would shut down
classes for the rest of the school year, which ends next week.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Heritage, however, most children in the
district went back to class Friday. Donald A. Peccia, the
superintendent of the Rockdale County schools, said attendance was
about 90 percent, slightly below normal. Classes at Heritage are to
resume on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Solomon, the youth charged in the violent
incident that has triggered the soul searching of an entire region
sat in a juvenile detention facility for a second day Friday as
investigators continued to search his family's home. Although his
parents, Robert and Mae Dean Daniele, have not made any public
statement, they hired two of Atlanta's best-known criminal defense
attorneys, Edward T.M. Garland and Donald F. Samuel, to represent
their son.
</P>
<P>
   Neither lawyer would comment on the case Friday A hearing is
scheduled for Monday in the county's Superior Court, where the
district attorney will try to persuade a judge that Solomon should
be tried as an adult on charges of aggravated assault, cruelty to
children and weapons violations.
</P>
<P>
   A law-enforcement official said investigators searching the
boy's house had found a print-out from an Internet site describing
how to make bombs. The official noted that such material was easy
to find on the Internet and said there was no evidence that Solomon
had actually tried to make a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and friends of Solomon's had reported seeing about a
dozen rifles in a display case in the basement of the family's
house, and the sheriff said Friday that one of the doors to the
case had been ``jimmied'' open and two weapons removed.
</P>
<P>
   But the family friend said Friday that the case had both an
outer lock and a locking bar on the inside that secured the rifles
to the back of the case. Daniele, a trucking company executive,
kept the keys at all times, the friend said, and did not know how
the weapons could have been removed from the case.
</P>
<P>
   The friend said Solomon had no history of violence, but had been
treated for depression over the last year as his grades had fallen.
The parents got along well with their son, the friend said, arguing
occasionally over his cigarette habit. Daniele often went hunting
with his stepson and had enrolled him in several rifle classes,
where he excelled, the friend said, bringing home several trophy
deer.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon came close to shooting himself after wounding the other
students, according to Cecil T. Brinkley, the high school's vice
principal, who disarmed him.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, he said he ran out to the commons area
after hearing the first shots and saw Solomon kneeling on the
ground with the revolver in his mouth. Brinkley said he walked
slowly over to Solomon, who then pointed the gun at him. Brinkley
repeatedly said ``Give me the gun,'' until the boy extended his
hand with the pistol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked down and that was the first time I realized it was
cocked,'' Brinkley said. ``I said, `I need to unload this pistol.'
It was all instinct. I didn't know what he'd done. I know you don't
believe me, but I was just worried about getting the gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley, who is 60 and has two grown children and six
grandchildren, said Solomon grabbed him after letting go of the
gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me the biggest bear hug and started shaking,''
Brinkley said. ``He said, `I'm scared.' He wasn't crying, but his
voice was very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the six student victims were released from the hospital
Friday after being treated for gunshot wounds to the legs and
buttocks, joining two others who were released on Thursday. One
student still had a bullet lodged in her knee today and was
expected to go home in two or three days; another had a bullet in
her intestine and could remain in the hospital for several more
days.

 &HT;    Earnhardt Inc. grabs Andrews for crew chief
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ Paul Andrews' unemployment on the Winston Cup
circuit was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, fired three days ago as crew chief for Jeremy
Mayfield's No. 12 Ford, was hired Friday by Dale Earnhardt Inc.
Andrews, a 12-year veteran on the circuit, will head the No. 1
Chevrolet of Steve Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw (Andrews) in the unemployment line, grabbed him by the
arm and told him we needed to go talk to Dale,'' Park said. ``We
had him hired in two minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, 42, worked at Penske-Kranefuss Racing since December
1996. The Maine native spent nine seasons with the team formed by
the late Alan Kulwicki before joining Penske-Kranefuss, where he
also worked with driver Geoffrey Bodine.
</P>
<P>
   While with Kulwicki, Andrews won five races and the 1992 Winston
Cup title. This will his first time working on a Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen very quickly in this sport and I'm not just
talking about the action on the track,'' Andrews said. ``One of the
first phone calls Wednesday was from (Park's team). I visited DEI
Wednesday and talked to Dale for a long time and he made me feel
wanted again.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, 31, of Islip, N.Y., is 31st in Winston Cup standings after
11 races, trailing leader Dale Jarrett by 756 points. Park hasn't
had a top-10 finish this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez lands a job
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Lopez, who was fired as Park's crew chief May 11, was
hired by Darrell Waltrip's No. 66 Ford team on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, 36, of Verdun, France, worked with Waltrip last year when
he was a substitute driver for the injured Park for 13 races.
Waltrip had a fifth and sixth-place finish in the Earnhardt-owned
car, his best finishes of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Philippe earlier this year,'' Waltrip said. ``I
said, `Now, look, I'm not trying to lure you away by any means
because we've got a lot
</P>
<P>
   of work to do here and I don't even know if you'd want to come
to work for us right now.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But things didn't work out well (with Park) this year and he
quit. When he did that, I said, `I know who I'm going to get for my
crew chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis Carter, who co-owns Waltrip's car, was the interim crew
chief after Donnie Disharoon quit after only three events.
</P>
<P>
   Bad deal for Burton
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton didn't finish qualifying after he missed his pit
stall during the mandatory two-tire change stop in Friday night's
The Winston qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, making his fourth start in the all-star event, was
disqualified and will start 20th. After Burton missed his stall,
car owner Bill Davis waved him by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had a tire going down,'' Burton said. ``I about
lost it going into (turn) 1 and I about lost it going into 3.
Coming down pit road, I was afraid to shift down and the rear tire
was hopping. It wasn't a tire, so I'm not sure what the deal was.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Rudd also had problems on pit road, qualifying 19th after
he spun out after a 10.742-second stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot more respect for the drag (racing) boys,'' Rudd
said. ``I stayed on the concrete trying to build speed and it was
working good, but I got my right-rear tire just off the edge of the
concrete. Next thing I know, the thing just did a loop.''
</P>
<P>
   Said enters The Winston Open
</P>
<P>
   Craftsman Truck driver Boris Said, a former road-course racer,
entered tonight's The Winston Open in a car co-owned by Winston Cup
regular Ernie Irvan. If all goes well, Irvan-Sirmo Racing may enter
the car in next week's Coca-Cola 600.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking it one event at a time and learning as much as
we can,'' crew chief Frank Kimmel said.

<P>
   In the modern pantheon of hot cars, the Nissan Maxima ranks as a
minor deity _ not up there with, say, the BMW 3-Series, yet forever
to be honored as the first midsize sport sedan for about the same
price as a drab family hauler.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in 1981, the Maxima had crisp handling and a peppy
engine, and it quickly won converts among Americans accustomed to
Detroit bargemobiles and dorky Japanese compacts. A new, sleeker
design in 1985 _ with front-wheel drive and a standard V6 engine _
brought annual sales into six-figure range.
</P>
<P>
   Another major makeover in 1995, which delivered more interior
room and better performance for less money, cemented customer
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   But in today's global market, all automakers must run simply to
stay in place. And a series of snazzy, competitively priced midsize
sedans led by the Audi A4 cruelly dated the old Maxima. Yes, it
still had an enviable record for reliability as well as the
smoothest V6 around.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the competition was so refined, including somewhat
less expensive family sedans like the Honda Accord and Toyota
Camry, the rack-and-pinion steering seemed too light, the driver's
seating position seemed a bit awkward and the styling looked dowdy.
Sales have remained above the 100,000 mark, in large part because
Nissan offered sweet lease deals and generous rebates on the
already modest sticker price.
</P>
<P>
   Could the Maxima make a comeback? The auguries were not
promising: Nissan was strapped for cash and, in any case, top
executives feared that any radical change in the familiar shape
would alienate tradition-minded customers in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But with a lot of help from the design studio in California and
the engineering nerds in Japan, Nissan has pulled off the
improbable. After a mechanical revamping and substantial face lift,
the Japanese-built 2000 Maxima is again a world-class,
no-compromise sport sedan and a marvelous bargain to boot. Even the
styling, though no match for the cool postmodern designs coming
from Europe, will turn a few heads.
</P>
<P>
   Some specifics: The standard 24-valve, 3-liter V6 has been
goosed to 222 horsepower, a gain of 32, and the torque curve has
been flattened to provide raging acceleration in the 20 to 60 mph
range at which most drivers merge into freeway traffic. The
four-wheel independent suspension has merely been tinkered with.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, small mechanical changes have led to large gains in
surefootedness. The light feel of the wheel has been fixed with
more sophisticated speed-sensitive power steering.
</P>
<P>
   With stop-and-go traffic and cell phones to contend with, most
Maxima buyers will doubtless choose the electronically controlled
four-speed automatic. But purists can still opt for the
glassy-slick five-speed manual that I drove.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxima does not stint on safety. Front air bags are
standard, of course, and side air bags can be had for extra money.
The Maxima's excellent anti-skid disk brakes are still excellent.
</P>
<P>
   An electronic traction control is available as an option on cars
with the automatic transmission. All models get terrific halogen
headlights. And the sporty SE version will be available with
17-inch wheels and grippy low-profile tires.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionary changes in the Maxima's suspension and drivetrain
are complemented by revolutionary changes in comfort and
convenience. The wheelbase is just 2 inches longer, the body is
stretched by only 1.5 inches and the curb weight is up just 50
pounds, but the cabin is far more airy.
</P>
<P>
   The previous Maxima's front seats seemed too narrow and the
footwells too small for long American legs. Now the seating is
reminiscent of the Lexus ES300 or the new Acura 3.2TL, with
eight-way adjustment, more padding and room to sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   The back seat, miracle of miracles, can now manage a fifth
passenger in relative comfort. And the suppression of road noise is
up to the standards of the near-luxury class.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxima's controls have been improved, too, with handsome,
readable gauges and bigger buttons. The audio system comes in three
grades ranging from a 60-watt, four-speaker version to a 200-watt,
seven-speaker behemoth by Bose, with integrated cassette and CD
players.
</P>
<P>
   Cup holders and a second 12-volt outlet have been added in the
rear. And the 60-40 split back seats fold forward, allowing
oversize objects to pass through from the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   So what about the Maxima's looks? Both the front and rear have
been reworked to pass for contemporary without sacrificing what
Nissan's chief designer, Gerald Hirshberg, calls it's
``Maxima-ness.'' It's still no beauty, but the over-the-hill
generic Japanese aspect is gone.
</P>
<P>
   I've saved the best for last. Better handling, more power and a
much stiffer chassis have transformed the Maxima into a driving
machine that transcends the class. Equipped with the five-speed
manual, it has become the poor man's BMW _ and I mean the 5-series
BMW with a real back seat, not the 3-series that barely
accommodates four.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that dealers who can coax showroom browsers into
test drives will make a lot of easy sales.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not the very best: the by-no-means-stripped Maxima
GXE lists for just $21,569, while the gussied-up GLE can be had for
$26,769. Adding leather and a sunroof can run up the bill a bit
more. But feature-by-feature, the Maxima is a solid $3,000 to
$5,000 less than comparable sedans from Acura, Audi and others. &QL;

PHILLIES' GM REBUFFS SCHILLING'S ACCUSATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Philadelphia Phillies general manager Ed
Wade was upset with pitcher Curt Schilling's comments last week
that the club's ownership was not committed to winning.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling said the Phillies need one more big-name pitcher to
get the team over the top, but the club was unwilling to acquire
one. Wade strongly disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to upgrade our rotation since the end of
last season, and we will continue to try,'' Wade said Friday, ``We
haven't turned down any trade for starting pitchers because of
dollars. We've asked about every pitcher Curt mentioned \RBrad
Radke and Kenny Rogers\S and quite a few who he hasn't mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trading for starting pitching is difficult, not because of
dollars, but because there aren't very many available pitchers, and
the talent that the other club is looking for is either too
significant to give up, or you just don't have the right match.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade isn't saying anything that Doug Melvin hasn't already said.
There isn't much starting pitching out there.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling is right when he said the Phillies need another
starting pitcher. But Wade thought it was a little ridiculous when
Schilling criticized them for not pursuing Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Astros made a huge offer to try and keep him with club,''
Wade said. ``But Johnson chose to sign with his hometown team, the
Diamondbacks. Where does Curt think the Phillies would have been in
that pursuit, coming off a 75-win season?''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies have done a good job getting younger and better.
For too long they tried to stay with the veterans that caught
lightning in a bottle in 1993, and they suffered for it. But of the
25 players who were with the team at the end of the 1997 season,
only seven remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got tired of spinning our wheels trying to keep the 1993
club alive,'' Wade said. ``One of the reasons that Curt wants us to
go out and get someone is that we have come pretty far, pretty
quickly. But it's wrong to say we have not been committed to
improving the team.''
</P>
<P>
   They have a pretty good nucleus of young players, including
infielders Scott Rolen, Desi Relaford, Marlon Anderson and Rico
Brogna, outfielders Bob Abreau and Doug Glanville and catcher Mike
Lieberthal. They also have two young pitchers who have a chance,
Carlton Loewer and Paul Byrd. But they need one more starter, and
they're hurting at closer.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing the job will be hard, and what the Phillies do with
Schilling could make the difference. He's obviously the No. 1
starter that every contender needs, and the Phillies are reluctant
to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   But if Wade made a shrewd trade that brought the right package
of young players, it could be just the deal that finishes a
well-done rebuilding effort.
SPOTLIGHT ON CAL RIPKEN JR.
Bill Janscha Cal Ripken Jr. is batting .333 with three homers and
eight RBI since coming off the disabled list.
Time on disabled list refreshing for Ripken
Cal Ripken Jr. deserves at least one mulligan.
</P>
<P>
   Way too many people were suggesting he should retire after he
went on the disabled list with a bad back last month. But Ripken
may end up fooling everybody.
</P>
<P>
   He's been playing great since his return, hitting .333 with
three homers and eight runs batted in going into the weekend series
with the Rangers. He's also showing much more mobility in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's time off not only allowed him to rehabilitate a bad
back that's been bothering him for several years, but it also
allowed him time to heal the pain of his father's death in spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a silver lining to the injury,'' Ripken said. `It
gave me time to heal mentally and physically. I jumped right back
into baseball because I thought it was the best thing to do after
my dad's funeral. Maybe it was a little too soon. Maybe I should
have taken a little time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a matter of being able to concentrate and see the
ball clearly. \RHitting\S requires a good, clear head and good
focus. The things that bother you affect your focus. I'm playing
with a clear head right now, and it feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Chasing DiMaggio Never say a record will never be
broken. Cal Ripken Jr. proved no record is unreachable. But here's
why Joe DiMaggio's 56-game streak is so incredible.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez's hitting streak came to an end after 30 games,
making him only one of 37 players in major-league history to hit
safely in at least that many consecutive games. The second-longest
streak of his career is 23 games.
</P>
<P>
   Add them together and they equal 53, three short of DiMaggio.
Stan Musial, one of the greatest hitters of all time, had a 30-game
hitting streak in 1950 and a 24-game streak in 1952, a combined two
short of DiMaggio.
\Nsubheds:Coors power surge Some numbers from the Reds' 24-12
victory against the Rockies on Wednesday at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams combined for 81 total bases, a major-league record.
The old record was 79, accomplished by St. Louis (41) and
Philadelphia (38) on May 11, 1923.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' 15 extra-base hits were one short of the National
League record.
</P>
<P>
   The teams scored 36 runs, the most in Coors Field history.
</P>
<P>
   The teams combined for nine homers that traveled 3,604 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds tied a 97-year-old franchise record with 28 hits and
amassed the second-highest total of runs in franchise history;
their 55 total bases were a club record and three shy of the
big-league mark.
\Nsubheds:Short hops
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Devil Rays have the first pick in the amateur
draft and are looking at three players: Josh Hamilton, a
pitcher/outfielder from a high school in Raleigh, N.C.; Robbie
Beckett, a pitcher from Spring; and Eric Munson, a catcher from the
University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Three young players have the Royals over .500: center fielder
Carlos Beltran, second baseman Carlos Febles and right fielder
Jermaine Dye, who is finally starting to hit as expected two years
after being acquired from the Atlanta Braves. They're also getting
good pitching from Jose Rosado, an all-star in 1997 who had fallen
off, and Jeff Suppan, a former top prospect from the Red Sox who
was a disappointment in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were off Monday, and yes, Kevin Brown did take the
Fox company jet back to Florida to see his family.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians are on a pace to score 1,199 runs. The
record is 1,067 by the 1931 New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Mets pitcher Rick Reed was miffed when Brewers manager Phil
Garner accused him of scuffing the baseball. Said Reed, ``I don't
even know how to cheat. The only thing I can say is if that guy
thinks I'm cheating, he's got the wrong stats. I came in with a
7.48 ERA.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams are showing less patience with struggling young players.
The latest was Expos first baseman Brad Fullmer, who was sent back
to Triple A last season. Said manager Felipe Alou, whose entire
team was struggling: ``Maybe some of the guys should look at it as
a message.''
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays have good young pitching, but they need
much more from David Wells, 36, who is 1-4 with a 7.68 ERA in his
past six starts. Those contract-extension talks suddenly went on
pause.

 &HT;    Blister puts Hudek on DL
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To make room for Bruce Chen on the roster, the Braves
put reliever John Hudek on the 15-day disabled list Friday because
of a blister on his pitching hand. The move allows Atlanta to keep
Justin Speier, who has pitched more consistently than Hudek.
</P>
<P>
   Hudek, who is out of minor-league options, said he has no
problem with the move and will agree to go to the minor leagues for
a rehabilitation assignment as soon as he can pitch without wearing
a bandage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they had to make a decision with three guys _ (Kevin)
McGlinchy, Speier and me,'' said Hudek, who hasn't pitched in a
week because of the blister. ``McGlinchy can't go with what his
role is; Speier, he can go more innings right now. ... It worked
out. It's fine. There could be other things, worse things.''
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to the Braves from the Reds in the Mark Wohlers
deal on April 16, Hudek has been the last reliever out of the
bullpen. He has a 9.35 ERA in eight games for the Braves, highest
on the staff. He has eight walks in 8 2/3 innings pitched. Speier
has a 3.65 ERA with only four walks in 12 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pitching so far has been either real good or bad,'' Hudek
said. ``The margin of error for me is very minor.''
</P>
<P>
   This will buy him some time to prove to the Braves that he can
get back to the way he pitched last year for the Reds when he went
4-2 with a 2.43 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Hudek said when asked if he'd go on a
minor-league assignment. ``What else am I going to say? It'll
benefit both of us. They can see when I'm getting back and it'll
benefit me to see hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs acquire closer Aguilera from Twins
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs traded two minor-league pitchers to bring Twins veteran
closer Rick Aguilera to Chicago and bolster a shaky bullpen that
recently lost closer Rod Beck to the disabled list with a bone spur
in his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs gave up right-handers Kyle Lohse, 20, and Jason Ryan,
23, to bring in Aguilera, a 37-year-old with a 3-1 record, a 1.27
ERA and six saves in 17 games for Minnesota this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were one of the teams Twins general manager Terry
Ryan contacted regarding Aguilera, trying to unload his $3.25
million salary, but Braves general manager John Schuerholz said his
discussions with Ryan never entered the ``meaningful'' stage, that
player names were never exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not motivated to do what they were asking,''
Schuerholz said. ``We didn't see there was a need and there has
become less of a need as our bullpen has shown what it can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood finding his old form
</P>
<P>
   Since his bad outing in Los Angeles when he gave up four runs in
3 1/3 innings to fall to 1-2, Kevin Millwood has been a different
pitcher _ a lot like his old self.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had to be better than I was last year,'' said
Millwood, who was 17-8 with a 4.08 ERA and moved into the No. 4
slot in the rotation this year. ``If I go out and pitch the way I
did last year, I don't see why I have to ask anymore out of myself.
Last year was a pretty good year. Nobody's going to be happy doing
the same thing every year, but maybe I was putting a little undue
pressure on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, 3-3 with a 3.60 ERA, makes his ninth start tonight.

<P>
   YONKERS, N.Y. _ The school massacre in Littleton, Colo., last
month has emerged as one of the more poignant reference points this
commencement season.
</P>
<P>
   In her address on Friday celebrating diversity, Joanne Braxton,
a professor of American studies at the College of William and Mary,
told Sarah Lawrence graduates that the atmosphere of ostracism that
the two gunmen had felt was something very foreign to this
Westchester County campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Littleton, Colorado, would never happen here, because it's
safe to be different,'' said Dr. Braxton, who graduated from Sarah
Lawrence in 1972. ``Maintain that difference. Keep all the
passionate discussion when you leave here.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous speakers are weaving recent shooting incidents at
American high schools into their commencement talks, from Attorney
General Janet Reno at Wilkes University to Bill Bradley, the
Democratic presidential candidate, who spoke of ``the pressure on
our families and our children'' at the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In a commencement address at American University, the filmmaker
Barry Levinson warned about blaming television and the media for
the shootings, yet acknowledged that ``television breeds a certain
degree of cynicism.''
</P>
<P>
   In her speech on Friday, Dr. Braxton used Littleton as a
metaphor for the dangers of conformity and intolerance. ``The
violence in Littleton, Colorado, is symptomatic of larger disorders
in our society,'' said Dr. Braxton, who has written extensively
about the trans-Atlantic slave trade and is co-editor of ``Wild
Women in the Whirlwind: Afra-American Culture and the Contemporary
Literary Renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The embrace of diversity must form in order to make homes and
families safe,'' she said. ``We must communicate, not isolate. If
we must be intolerant of something, let us be intolerant of
intolerance itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 330 undergraduate and graduate students received degrees
Friday at Sarah Lawrence's 70th commencement exercises.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Juilliard School
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When introducing Patrick Stewart at Juilliard's 94th
commencement exercises on Friday, Joseph Polisi, the school's
president, gave details about Stewart's distinguished career as a
Shakespearean actor. But he could not resist quoting the famous
lines of Capt. Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise,
Stewart's best-known role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make it so,'' Polisi said to the cheering audience at Alice
Tully Hall at Lincoln Center. ``I wish I could say that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to the graduating class of 220 actors, musicians
and dancers, Stewart said: ``Audiences want to be moved, excited,
terrified, amused, shocked, changed. That is our job as artists _
to give people an experience they will never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the recipients of honorary degrees was the choreographer
Bill T. Jones, who burst into an impromptu dance step after
receiving his Doctor of Fine Arts degree, inspiring the other
honorees _ Peter Paine, the philanthropist, and Harvey
Lichtenstein, outgoing president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music _
to do the same as they returned to their seats. Beverly Sills, the
president of Lincoln Center, who also got an honorary degree,
refrained because of a broken toe.
</P>
<P>
   Under a cloudless sky, at a reception after the ceremonies on
the theater balcony, Stewart stood for photographs with graduates
and their families. As the crowd thickened around the actor, Polisi
whispered to him, ``I really do wish I could say, `Make it so' the
way you do, you know.'' Stewart answered, ``I wanted to say it in
my speech, but I thought you did it so well.''

JUDGE RULES THAT SCHOOL CURRICULUM CROSSED CHURCH-STATE LINE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ A Westchester County school district
violated its students' First Amendment right to religious freedom
by allowing schools to engage in religious-oriented activities,
including the construction of a Hindu god's likeness by
third-graders and New Age prayer recitals at a high-school Earth
Day celebration, a Federal District Court ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling upheld 3 of 15 claims brought by a group of Roman
Catholic parents who said the Bedford Central School District
promoted Satanic rituals and cult worship and impermissibly mixed
religion into the school curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   The judge did not rule against all the activities protested in
the suit, allowing the district to continue certain card games and
yoga lessons, for example.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, which chided both sides for their inability to
accommodate each other's views, Judge Charles L. Brieant III
ordered school district officials to stop teachers from creating
lessons that incorporate religious symbols or routines, holding
that those lessons violated the constitutional doctrine of
church-state separation.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the judge scolded the school district for allowing
students to make ``worry dolls,'' brightly painted miniature dolls
constructed of wire, thread and toothpicks, which are supposed to
dispel everyday anxieties when left under a child's pillow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business with the worry dolls is a rank example of
teaching superstition to children of a young and impressionable
age,'' Brieant wrote in his ruling. ``It assumes that an inanimate
object has some occult power to relieve us from worry and assure a
good night's sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized a segment of one third-grade teacher's
week-long lesson on the culture of India, in which the teacher read
her class stories of an elephant-headed Hindu god, Ganesha, and
then planned to have pupils make their own Ganeshas from paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``While reading the Ganesha story can be part of a neutral
secular curriculum, this court fails to find any educational
justification for telling young impressionable students to
construct images of a known religious god,'' the judge wrote in
response to the plaintiffs' complaint that the school was forcing
them to make graven images, in violation of their religious
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   He also ordered the school district to end religious exercises
and paraphernalia at Fox Lane High School's ``truly bizarre'' Earth
Day celebrations. He said a creed students listened to _ ``This is
what we believe. The Mother of us all is Earth. The Father is the
Sun,'' constituted religious worship of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent recurring lawsuits on similar grounds, Brieant also
ordered schools officials to publish a clear policy demanding that
teachers and guest lecturers in the future remain neutral toward
all religions, although he was clear that religion is not a
forbidden topic, if it is presented without advocacy. ``To describe
the religious beliefs of some persons without endorsing those
beliefs does not violate the First Amendment,'' Brieant explained.
</P>
<P>
   While he touched on an array of other activities in the Bedford
district that the Catholic parents had challenged _ including
classroom readings on the life of Buddha, lectures on crystals by a
retired engineer and a field trip to a cemetery that he labeled
``terminally dumb'' _ Brieant steadfastly adhered to judicial
protocol by staying away from advocating wholesale change to the
district's curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Both the school district and the parents groups who brought the
suit claimed the verdict gave them a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were delighted and elated and thankful to God for the
judge's decision that our rights were violated,'' said Mary Ann
Dibari, 60, a plaintiff whose two granddaughters attended middle
school in the district. ``It's a real vindication. Here's a federal
judge deciding that an area of the Constitution was violated.''
</P>
<P>
   School district officials Friday admitted they were surprised to
have lost any portion of the suit, even though 12 of the 15
practices the plaintiffs cited were not found to pose First
Amendment problems, and they took pains to put the judge's ruling
in the best possible light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly pleased that the judge found on behalf of the
district for the vast preponderance of matters that the plaintiffs
alleged,'' said Dr. Bruce L. Dennis, the superintendent of Schools.
</P>
<P>
   While the case has received wide attention, legal experts said
that the activities struck down by Friday's ruling were too
esoteric for the ruling to have far-reaching implications.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't sound like something that's going to have a wide
impact on schools nationwide,'' Edwin Darden, a lawyer for the
National School Boards Association in Washington, said after
reading a portion of Judge Brieant's decision. ``It's very specific
facts here that the judge ruled on.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents were represented by the American Catholic Lawyers
Association. The Bedford school system was supported by People for
the American Way, a civil liberties group. Both sides are planning
to appeal.

 &HT;    Bill lets lottery winners collect kitty all at once
 &HT;    By Paul Owers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The payment possibilities for Florida
Lottery winners, while not endless, certainly are improving.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush signed a bill last week making Florida the 19th
state to allow winners the option of signing over future lottery
payments to third-party investors for immediate cash.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, about 500 Florida Lottery winners have had no choice
but to accept jackpots paid out over 20 or 30 years _ a real bummer
if a winner was, say, 75 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Congress gave states the OK to offer lump-sum
awards, but once winners selected a payment option, they were stuck
with it. The state legislation, which takes effect in September,
now lets recent and future winners change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those who collect the kitty all at once get about
half the jackpot because the lump sum doesn't include interest
earned over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK, I'll take the cash up front,'' said Richard
Ellington of West Palm Beach, who bought 20 tickets this week in
hopes of winning tonight's $66 million jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd invest it myself, pay off a few debts and maybe retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Even given a choice, about 40 percent of the winners since
November still have opted for the deferred payments, said Ed
George, spokesman for the Florida Lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there could be a change in their situation _ like a
divorce _ and this gives them more flexibility,'' said Robin
Shapiro, general counsel for Singer Asset Finance, a Boca
Raton-based company that has been pushing for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Asset has worked with lottery winners in other states,
financing the amounts however they choose. It profits if the
interest rate at which it sells pooled jackpots is less than the
rate it pays to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   States had no idea of the problems the previous payment
restrictions might cause when they drafted the lottery statutes,
Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no winners (to learn from),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. George Bense (R-Panama City),
creates several safeguards, such as requiring winners to get a
spouse's consent and a judge's approval before selling future
lottery payments to third parties.

A SIXTH SUSPECT SAID TO BE LINKED TO BIN LADEN IS IN CUSTODY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Texas)  (rk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Under cloak of secrecy, the government has taken
another suspect into custody in the investigation of Osama bin
Laden, the Saudi exile charged in the bombings of the U.S.
Embassies in East Africa last year, according to several people
knowledgeable about the case.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Ihab M. Ali, was charged on Wednesday with perjury
after he came to New York City. It appears that he was charged in a
closed hearing in U.S. district court in Manhattan soon after he
was asked to testify before a federal grand jury that has been
investigating the bombings and what the government has described as
a worldwide terrorist conspiracy led by bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Few details could be learned about Ali, who is said to be from
Orlando, Fla. Charges against him are not listed in public court
records, and his phone is unlisted. A court-appointed lawyer
assigned to represent some defendants charged in the U.S. district
court on Wednesday refused to respond to any questions about
whether Ali might be her client.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that Ali, said to be in his 30s, was being
investigated in connection with the broader look at the activities
of bin Laden, and was not necessarily tied directly to the embassy
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Both Herbert Hadad, a spokesman for Mary Jo White, the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, and Joseph A. Valiquette, a spokesman for
the FBI, refused comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It is known, however, that the terrorism investigation by Ms.
White's office has been focusing increasingly on the role of U.S.
citizens and others in this country. The government has charged
that bin Laden specifically recruited Americans into his
organization, in part because they were able to travel more freely
around the world on their U.S. passports.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. citizens are already in custody. They are Wadih
el-Hage, an Arlington, Texas, man who has pleaded not guilty to
charges of conspiring with bin Laden to kill Americans abroad; and
Ali A. Mohamed, a Californian indicted this week, also for
conspiracy. Both have also been accused of lying to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   A federal prosecutor has also said in a court hearing that a
Muslim figure in Texas, an imam identified as Moataz al-Hallak, has
been involved with members of bin Laden's organization, although
the man has not been charged and has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   It is extremely unusual for anyone to be charged in secret. The
case of Ali may be following a similar track to that of Mohamed,
who was held secretly for eight months after his arrest last
September as prosecutors sought to win his cooperation in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, those talks failed, and Mohamed was indicted
publicly. His lawyer, James Roth, said his client would contest the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Ali, whose citizenship status could not be
learned, brings to six the number of people known to be in custody
in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York in the
investigation of bin Laden. Another eight suspects, including bin
Laden, have been charged but not apprehended. Another suspect is
awaiting extradition from Britain.

COMMENTARY: IMAGES SHOW THE REALITIES BEHIND LABELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ivelisse Reyes once thought designer labels conferred
instant status. Now she has been thinking about the status of the
people behind the labels. She realized that some big-name labels
rely on poorly paid, no-name workers to make shoes and shirts
coveted by her classmates at Manhattan's High School of Graphic
Communication Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' Ivelisse said. ``Image is such a big deal. How you
look. What you wear. Inside every one of us is some little vanity.
We like to look good. We're just concerned about what we wear and
we forget who made it and where it came from.''
</P>
<P>
   It has become harder to forget, thanks to the images she and 41
other high school students recently created. With help from
teachers and union officials, they visited several local sweatshops
to find the grime behind the glamour. The results of their own
labors now hang inside a gallery at the headquarters of 1199, the
health-care workers union, which helped create the show.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, as people packed the gallery for the show's
opening, some of the students recalled the factories they had seen
a few streets away in the garment district. The thought of one
factory that Lisa Bertorelli visited made her grimace at the
recollection of worn-out workers and decrepit, stench-filled
hallways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down one block is Modell's or Nike,'' said Lisa, a student at
Art and Design High School. ``Up the block you have a sweatshop.
You see where the money is. Then you see the people making the
clothes aren't making the money. Everybody comes here for a
so-called better life. Then they end up in a sweatshop.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience was not new for several students, who had met at
the gallery before the opening reception. Clement Gomes, who
attends Art and Design, reminded his friends that if they thought
what they saw in New York was bad, they should see working
conditions in his native Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how in one town he saw workers sitting in an
open-air pavilion sewing clothing whose spotless white fabric was
in stark contrast to their own ragged, dirty clothing. Still, some
of the places he visited in New York were unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incomprehensible to think something is made in America
like that,'' he said. ``I have no words to explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as difficult to explain for some of the young artists was
the appeal of high-priced gear made by companies that have long
been criticized for their overseas labor practices. Nike, a
perennial target that has tried to respond to its critics with a
series of reforms, was mentioned often for its Michael Jordan line
of sneakers.
</P>

   ``We're not buying clothes, we're buying names,'' said Analisa
Biel, a student at Washington Irving High School. ``We're dumb for
buying them. Everybody knows Michael Jordan comes out with the same
pair of sneakers. Same style. Different color. Now they're coming
out with a pair at the end of the summer that are just like the
first ones. We had those when we were 11. Jordan doesn't care. Now
he's making mad dough. It's all about money.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklyn Pelaez's mother, Gilma Paredes, understands that, since
she spent eight months in a Brooklyn sweatshop in the early 1990s,
sewing collars on blouses for 10 cents a dozen, 12 hours a day, six
days a week.
</P>
<P>
   She had no other choice, since she was both father and mother to
the boy, now a student at Washington Irving. Nor did she have any
child care, so she took him to the factory, where he played with
the fabric scraps piled up on the floor, bundling them together
into make-believe igloos.
</P>
<P>
   Franklyn recreated that makeshift playroom for the exhibition.
At the opening reception, his mother stood in wonder before his
drawing, which he had stitched onto a sweatshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes me remember everything,'' she said. ``Thank God, I
don't have to work there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   She now has a better-paying job as a fur finisher. Franklyn
wants to go to college and become a commercial artist. As visitors
complimented him on his artwork, his mother only hoped he would
find a good, secure profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask God each day for the strength to keep working,'' she
said. ``I tell my son: `Franklyn, look how hard I had to work. I
don't want you to go through that in your future. You have to
study.' He thinks I'm crazy. But he will understand later.''
</P>
<P>
   She stood near Franklyn's study of her old workplace, a sad
scene of cracked walls, cramped tables and weary faces. Every
single detail proved that he understood her better than she
suspected.

TAKE MY SHOWS, PLEASE: NETWORKS PEDDLE FALL TV LINEUPS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Irwin Gotlieb was being up front about the up-fronts,
the television networks' annual May ritual that is one part Madison
Avenue salesmanship, one part Las Vegas-style showmanship and one
part revival-meeting discipleship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many more components to manipulate now,'' said
Gotlieb, sounding like an advertising executive who had gone
through this ritual before, which he had; 28 times, every year
going back to 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The up-fronts _ called that because advertising agencies commit
themselves to buying commercials up front, rather than waiting
until after the television season begins in the fall _ used to be
so much smaller, he said. Just a handful of advertising agency guys
on one side of a conference table and a single network executive on
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Those days, like ``Love, American Style'' or ``My Three Sons''
or ``Gunsmoke'' and other programs that were first seen at
up-fronts back then, are gone forever. As the networks demonstrated
this week, the up-fronts have evolved into presentations as slick
as the prime-time sitcoms and dramas they introduce.
</P>
<P>
   With big-screen graphics more elaborate than the ones their own
news anchors stand in front of every night, network executives
summarily dismissed the notion that network television has become a
dinosaur in an era of who-knows-how-many cable channels and
ever-more-powerful computers. Even so, it hardly seems accidental
that the up-fronts have become carefully choreographed stage shows
that play once and only once (no reruns, thank you very much) in
some of the great cultural temples of New York: Broadway theaters,
Lincoln Center, even Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after network executives had spent long hours sharing the
stage with high-kicking dancers and a magician in a coffin, or
poking fun at their rivals with a parody of ``Star Wars,'' the
crowds adjourned for canapes under canopies, brie in Bryant Park,
Tanqueray and tonic at Tavern on the Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's turned into a week of party time,'' said Robert P. Walsh,
a vice president with R.J. Palmer Media Services. ``Mardi Gras
time.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was a week of hype and hoopla, with scores of agents,
stars, producers and financial analysts under the up-front tent.
Literally, in the case of NBC and Fox, which rented the same tent
at Lincoln Center on different nights, and ABC, which covered over
a part of Bryant Park. (CBS rented Tavern on the Green.)
</P>
<P>
   But the old-timers do not sound terribly comfortable about
rubbing elbows with all those newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This party's not for us now,'' said Gotlieb, the president and
chief executive of the company responsible for arranging to run
commercials for companies like Procter &AMP; Gamble, under the ABC
tent. ``We are the least of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks disagree, of course. They say the four-day
extravaganza was all about executives like Gotlieb and the huge
advertising budgets he commands. But it was also about that most
valuable of commodities in New York, buzz; about what people like
Gotlieb say, and how that can contribute to the success or failure
or a single program or an entire schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really about glitz,'' said Tom Kenney before the ABC
up-front began. Kenney is the president of For Kids Entertainment,
a company that produces programs, arranges licensing agreements and
buys commercial time. ``No one's going to make a big decision on
the basis of this presentation. It's strictly feel-good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But the up-fronts can be headache-inducing, and there are no
commercials to give one time to go to the kitchen and grab a beer
or to the medicine cabinet for an over-the-counter drug. Up-front
watchers see snippets of more shows in a few days than most couch
potatoes see in a month of channel surfing. How can one keep the
new shows straight?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all meshing into one program in my head,'' said Walsh
of R.J. Palmer. ``But I know the programs by network.''
</P>
<P>
   Another vice president from R.J. Palmer, James E. Watson, said
that even that was difficult this time around. ``ABC had WB-like
shows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the up-fronts are confusing: six essentially similar
presentations, by each of the major broadcast networks, are packed
into four days. Like a sitcom or a murder mystery, they tend to
follow a formula: the same old projections of younger and younger
audiences (because advertisers like younger and younger viewers),
followed by the same old promises of higher and higher ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year at this time I tell you I'm excited,'' began Marvin
Goldsmith, the president for sales and marketing of the ABC
television network. ``This time, I'm really excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Drew Carey put it at the same presentation, ``Isn't it
amazing how every year, the world gets saved by a prime time
schedule?''
</P>
<P>
   Wait. This is television, so miracles do happen. CBS, which once
broadcast the New York Philharmonic from Carnegie Hall, rented
Carnegie Hall for a presentation that included an elaborate parody
of ``Star Wars'' that included the destruction of NBC by CBS
programmers.
</P>
<P>
   NBC rented Avery Fisher Hall and had the instantly recognizable
voice of Don Pardo booming through the loudspeakers. He sounded, as
he always does, as if he had just finished a Christmas pudding, and
all he was saying was, ``Ladies and gentlemen, our show is about to
begin. Please take your seats.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks were ``investment spending, shall we say,'' said
Tim Spengler, a senior vice president who is the general manager of
the national television division of Western International Media
Corp. From his chair in a box in the first tier at Carnegie Hall,
he looked down at the red-velvet orchestra seats as the CBS
presentation began and said, ``There's a lot of money in the seats
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the money was in the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat up in the balcony,'' J. Andrea Alstrup said after the
ABC presentation. ``I could care less where I sit.'' She is a vice
president for advertising of Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the pharmaceuticals
maker, which is the third-largest advertiser on network television.
</P>
<P>
   But others sounded dismayed at having been relegated to
second-class status in nosebleed seats at the ABC presentation.
Take the man in Row D, Seat 14: Kenney of For Kids Entertainment
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked at the card and it said `balcony seating,' I
knew there was caste seating,'' he said. ``They cater to the bigger
agency shops. The treat the little guys as second class, and they
try to please all those big agencies with the big media money.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the presentations even joked about the money. NBC
prefaced one part of a night-by-night rundown of its schedule with
a jingle that said: ``Get out your checkbooks, it's Thursday.'' The
audience giggled. But no one in Avery Fisher Hall needed to be
reminded that NBC'S powerful Thursday night lineup includes
programs like ``ER,'' which draw the biggest audiences and command
the highest prices for commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alstrup, who said that she has attended up-fronts since
1976, said there was a kind of etiquette for watchers. ``You don't
laugh too loudly, and you don't applaud,'' she said. ``You don't
want the price to go up if the network thinks you like it.''

PENTAGON BACKING BUILDUP OF NATO TROOPS AT KOSOVO BORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd through 4th paragraphs to clarify; inserts new 16th
through 25th graphs to add details of administration's position on
ground forces.)  (rm) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration announced Friday that
the United States would press its allies to move quickly to deploy
what was described as a peacekeeping force of about 50,000 troops
on the borders of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After days of public debate and private planning, NATO is
expected to take up the issue as early next week. The forces are
intended to be used to help return the Kosovar Albanian refugees
and to police any agreement reached with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO and the Pentagon have left open the possibility that
the troops could enter Kosovo without the permission of President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. In that sense, the Pentagon's
announcement of support for such a force, which would include about
7,000 Americans, represented an effort to try to put pressure on
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, officials said the United States was
negotiating with Russia on concessions that would allow Milosevic
to keep some forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic talks in Moscow between Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott and the Russian envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, Thursday
and Friday have centered on the NATO peacekeeping force going into
Kosovo in exchange for permitting some forces, under the control of
Slobodan Milosevic, to stay, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That would represent a significant shift from one of NATO's key
conditions for a peace agreement, that Milosevic must agree to his
soldiers and police leaving Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said as recently as
Thursday that one of NATO's war objectives was the departure of
``all'' of Milosevic's forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But a Clinton administration official suggested this position
would be finessed by ``all'' Yugoslav Army and Serbian police
forces having to leave the province as part of a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Serb soldiers and police would then be allowed to
return in designated numbers to protect Serb religious sites, serve
as tax and customs officials at the border and perhaps, to work in
limited numbers in a newly formed Kosovo police force.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott ended a round of talks with the Russians Friday and left
Moscow to spend the weekend in Washington. He said he would return
next week.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my talks here in Moscow this time have been
significantly constructive and serious to justify my coming back
yet again next week,'' Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, he met with Igor S. Ivanov, who was reappointed
by the new Russian government as foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On NATO's military front, the alliance's chief decision-making
body, the North Atlantic Council, is expected to meet early next
week to authorize the expanded peacekeeping force of about 50,000
and its earlier than expected formation.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain will argue that time is running
out for the positioning of the force if it is to be effective
before the winter arrives in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said the U.S. forces,
together with other NATO country soldiers, would initially move
into Macedonia. They would go ``as quickly as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration made the announcement after NATO's commander,
Gen. Wesley Clark, spent a day at the Pentagon this week outlining
the need for acting now.
</P>
<P>
   The acceleration of the peacekeeping force, officials here
emphasized, did not signal any change in the willingness of the
United States or NATO to mount a land war to drive out Yugoslav
forces. Bacon said Clark had discussed the possibility of ground
troops for an invasion force as one of several options he had been
asked to reassess. He cautioned the leaders at the Pentagon on
Thursday that such a force would have to be larger, and would take
considerable time to assemble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just said that if you look down several months out into the
future, and you reach a point in August or September or October
where we might want to deploy ground troops, what is the type of
planning time frame that would be necessary in order to position
NATO to do that,'' Bacon said. ``He wanted to make sure that no
decisions were made by default, and that everybody be aware of the
type of planning and, potentially, training that would be required
for a future movement of forces. '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even for the smaller peacekeeping force, if NATO waits on
deployment, it could take several weeks to build up, potentially
leaving a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take some time to move them down there,'' Bacon said.
``To the extent that some countries could move in relatively
quickly, light forces in the area, such as the 26th Marine
Expeditionary Unit from the United States, it could be done
rapidly. If people decide to move in very heavy forces from other
parts of Europe, it will take more time.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that NATO's leaders still needed to approve the exact
size, composition and mission of the force before setting a date
for the troops to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of diplomatic activity was accompanied by deepening
divisions among NATO members, reflecting a growing nervousness that
the air campaign has not achieved the alliance's goals and dismay
over mistakes like the bombing of the Chinese Embassy and missile
attacks that have killed civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Britain kicked off the public feuding at the beginning of the
week with its renewed promotion of ground troops that could invade
Kosovo once Serbian forces are weakened. Those sentiments were
flatly rejected by Germany, which said it would veto ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   And Britain's push apparently irritated President Clinton, who
tried to patch over the NATO differences by saying he had not ruled
out the use of ground troops as an option but preferred to allow
the air campaign to continue. By week's end, Italy had called for a
bombing pause, Greece was refusing to allow Turkish planes taking
part in NATO air strikes to fly over its air space and the German
Foreign Minister appealed to the alliance to avoid civilian
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has argued that Congressional approval would not be
needed if he decided to send in ground troops, although the White
House said recently that he would seek Congressional support for
such an operation.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives voted last month to bar the White
House from sending ground troops without its approval, but the
administration said such approval raised a host of constitutional
questions. Both the House and the Senate approved an emergency
spending bill of $15 billion in part to pay for the Kosovo
operation, and Clinton signed it into law Friday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has said that 7,000 American soldiers would
participate in the force. Before the air strikes began, the
Pentagon announced 4,500 Americans would be included in a smaller
peacekeeping force of 28,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   About 13,000 NATO troops, largely French and British, are
already in Macedonia as a vanguard for the peacekeeping force that
NATO wants to patrol Kosovo once the air strikes end.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 American troops are in Albania accompanying a fleet
of Apache helicopters and 8,000 Italian soldiers are also based in
northern Albania, working mainly on helping the ethnic Albanian
refugees expelled from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In tandem with the military moves, the administration appeared
to be pushing the diplomatic talks along.
</P>
<P>
   The White House wants to have a peace settlement on hand that
the Yugoslav leader will acquiesce to once he ``cries uncle,'' as
administration officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   To make this strategy work, the White House has bet on bringing
the Russian government as close as possible to NATO's demands and
then taking an agreement worked out with NATO and the Russians to
the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution passed by the Security Council would give a United
Nations mandate to a Kosovo peace agreement and isolate Milosevic,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants to have the United Nations resolution
passed in time for the summit of the leaders of the seven
industrialized countries and Russia _ known as the G-8 _in Cologne,
Germany, on June 18.
</P>
<P>
   The concession by the administration on allowing some Serb
forces in Kosovo hinges on the recognition by NATO at its summit
three weeks ago that after the war is over Kosovo would remain part
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sore point for the ethnic Albanians, on whose behalf
NATO has largely conducted its air war.
</P>
<P>
   For the ethnic Albanians who made up more than 90 percent of the
population of Kosovo before the air strikes and about half of whom
have been forcibly expelled by the Serbs, a goal of the air strikes
is the eventual independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians argue, according to an administration official,
that since NATO has agreed that Kosovo will remain a part of
Yugoslavia, Milosevic must be allowed ``expressions of
sovereignty'' within the police, military and border guards working
in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott was attempting to keep the scope of Milosevic's Serb
military presence on ``more of a model of park rangers than the
VJ,'' an administration official said, referring to the Yugoslav
Army.
</P>
<P>
   It would be unacceptable for NATO for Serbs to serve as border
guards, the official said. But there were other functions at the
border _ such as customs and tax collection _ that the Serbs might
be able to do, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians were ``trying to save face out of all this'' for
Milosevic, the official said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But for Milosevic to be allowed to keep some military or police
in Kosovo would present a major obstacle to one of NATO's war aims:
the return of the more than 700,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who
have been expelled from Kosovo by the Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has repeatedly stressed that an unnegotiable goal of the
war was for the ethnic Albanians, now stranded in Albania and
Macedonia, to return home.
</P>
<P>
   But the refugees, many of whom have been radicalized by the
terror and brutality of the Serbs, would be deterred from returning
if armed Serbs remain in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the presence of Milosevic's forces, no matter how
minimal, would make it highly unlikely that the guerrillas of the
Kosovo Liberation Army would agree to such a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership of the guerrillas have already said that they
will not disarm, a demand laid down by the group of seven
industrialized countries and Russia in Germany two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The basic aim of the guerrillas is the independence of Kosovo
and an agreement that solidifies Kosovo in any way as part of
Yugoslavia would represent a repudiation of those aims.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks Friday, Cook said the shape of the peace
settlement being fashioned has as its base line the agreement from
Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   In that agreement, the Serbs were allowed to have 2,500 police
and 2,500 soldiers of the Yugoslav Army. The administration wanted
to keep the number of Serb and Yugolsav forces below those figures,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Kosovo Liberation Army signed onto an agreement that
permitted even a minimal number of lightly armed Serbs or Yugoslav
soldiers in Kosovo, there was a high potential for violence between
the two groups, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a concern on our part that you don't put people there
as invitations for retaliation,'' the official said. ``We would
like to have as few as humanly possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping force would probably have a role in protecting
the Serb and Yugoslav forces and keeping them apart from ethnic
Albanians, he said.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, May 21 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: SHOW1
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, May 14, the Senate approved, 48-47, an amendment to
the juvenile justice bill that would require mandatory background
checks on private sales of firearms gun shows. Supporters said the
measure would ensure that guns did not get into the wrong hands.
Opponents said the measure was filled with loopholes, such as
limiting the background checks to 24 hours and enabling people to
redeem guns they had dropped off at a pawn shop without subjecting
them to a background check. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: LOCKS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 78-20, an amendment to the
juvenile justice bill that would require handguns to be sold with
child safety locks or storage devices. The measure also limits the
liability of handgun owners who properly use child safety devices
in the event of an injury or death. Supporters said it would help
restrict access of guns to children. Opponents said the law was
unnecessary because safety devices are already available at gun
shops. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: MINORITY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday failed to pass a measure that would have
required states to develop strategies for dealing with the
disproportionate imprisonment of minority juveniles. Voting 52-48,
the Senate tabled, or set aside, the amendment to the juvenile
justice bill. Supporters of the measure said it was about fairness
and would help eliminate the problem of discrimination in the
juvenile justice system. Opponents said there is no proof of the
problem, and it would need further study before Congress could pass
legislation. A ``yes'' vote favors setting aside the measure.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: SHOW2
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 51-50, an amendment to the
juvenile justice bill that would require background checks at gun
shows. After the senators registered a 50-50 vote, Vice President
Al Gore cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of the Democratic
proposal. The measure, which is only slightly different from a
measure that was rejected by the Senate last week, requires
criminal background checks for all private sales at gun shows and
for people who try to claim their own guns at pawn shops.
Supporters said the legislation would close the loopholes that make
it too easy to buy guns at gun shows. Opponents said the measure
would be expensive and create more loopholes. A ``yes'' vote favors
the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: S.KOSOVO
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 64-36, the final version of a
$15 billion emergency spending bill that will provide funding for
the conflict in Kosovo and send aid to farmers and victims of
natural disasters. President Clinton is expected to sign the bill,
which passed the House earlier in the week. Supporters said the
bill sends a clear message to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
about the commitment of NATO. Opponents said the measure was filled
with too many additional non-emergency provisions that never would
have passed through the normal budgetary process. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   6) BILL NUMBER: COPS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 48-50, an amendment to the
juvenile justice bill that would authorize $1 billion a year for
the next five years to expand and extend the Community Oriented
Policing Services (COPS) program to hire 50,000 more police
officers. Supporters said the program has proved vital in
decreasing crime rates throughout the country. Opponents said the
program is flawed and needs to be more fully examined before it is
reauthorized. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   7) BILL NUMBER: JUVENILE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 73-25, a juvenile justice bill
that seeks to prevent youth violence by making it easier to
prosecute violent juveniles as adults, and includes provisions that
require background checks on all gun sales, and that handguns be
sold with child safety locks or storage devices. Supporters said
the bill was a first step toward controlling the prevalence of guns
and making the country a safer place for children. Opponents said
the bill fails to adequately address the problems that led to the
school shootings that have troubled the country for the past year.
A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: H.KOSOVO
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday approved, 269-158, the final version of a
$15 billion spending bill that will provide funding for the
conflict in the Balkans, money for disaster relief and farmers, and
a military pay raise. Supporters said the bill sends a clear
message to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic about the
comittment of NATO. Opponents said the measure was filled with
additional, non-emergency provisions that never would have passed
through the normal budgetary process. A ``yes'' vote favors the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: EARTH
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday agreed, 259-168, to provide $42 billion
to fund NASA for the next three years. Included in the bill was the
elimination NASA's Triana satellite project, a program that would
have beamed images of Earth 24 hours a day as it is seen from outer
space -- an initiative suggested by Vice President Al Gore.
Supporters of eliminating the Gore project said it was unnecessary
and too bureaucratic. Opponents said eliminating the program was an
attempt to embarass Gore and his presidential campaign. A ``yes''
vote favors funding NASA.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 345-71, a bill calling for the
installation, when technologically possible, of a system capable of
defending the United States against a ballistic missile attack.
President Clinton is expected to sign the bill, which passed the
Senate earlier this year. Supporters said the United States needs
to find a way to defend itself against the growing ballistic
missile threat. Opponents said the bill is irresponsible because it
does not address the costs of such a defense system and does not
clearly define what would constitute a technologically capable
defense system. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

FOUR-YEAR EXTENSION KEEPS LEETCH WITH RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the specter of free agency looming, Brian Leetch
and the New York Rangers were not playing games during contract
negotiations. So, Leetch will be wearing a Blue Shirt for at least
the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a resurgent 1998-99 season in which he finished fifth
among defensemen in scoring and first in body checks and blocked
shots, Leetch, the 31-year-old captain, will earn between $8
million and $9 million a season on a four-year contract extension.
The Rangers were originally offering about $7 million and Leetch
was seeking about $10 million. The length of the contract is
probably shorter than Leetch preferred, however.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract has not been signed by Leetch, who is out of
town, and will not be announced until he returns. People close to
the negotiations said that Leetch would sign the contract this
weekend and that there would be a news conference on Monday or
Tuesday at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   By not signing Leetch last summer, the Rangers may have cost
themselves millions of dollars, because the value of a player of
Leetch's caliber only increases as the deadline approaches. His
salary next season will be a record amount, both for the Rangers
and for National Hockey League defensemen. (Wayne Gretzky made
$6.75 million for the Rangers in 1997-98, and Ray Bourque of the
Boston Bruins will make $6 million next season.)
</P>
<P>
   Rangers president and general manager Neil Smith declined to
comment Friday. Jay Grossman, who represents Leetch, also declined
comment.
</P>
<P>
   By getting the deal done before the July 1 deadline for free
agency, the Rangers avoided the possibility of losing Leetch _ the
way they almost lost goalie Mike Richter last summer, and the way
they did lose Mark Messier, then the Rangers' captain, two summers
ago when he wound up with Vancouver. So quick and decisive moves
toward resolving Leetch's contract were essential to Smith's
credibility with fans and his own Rangers players.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the circumstances surrounding the negotiations with
Leetch were different from those with Richter and Messier. Richter
and his agent, Herb Pinder, played coy until the bitter end,
attempting unsuccessfully to drive up the goalie's price. Messier
did not have support from everyone in the Rangers' organization.
</P>
<P>
   But with Leetch, the lines of communication between Grossman and
Smith were open from the day the season ended. Recently, they had
several face-to-face meetings. And there were no internal whispers
questioning Leetch's ability to lead the Rangers into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Rangers can focus on other things, like pursuing other
teams' free agents.  &QL;

TO STOP SPREWELL, ROADBLOCK IS NEEDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two games too late, Latrell Sprewell finally showed up
on the Hawks' radar screen Friday. And that was during a film
session at practice.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell has been almost unstoppable coming off the bench for
the Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinals. He has poured in
62 points in a series that will shift to Madison Square Garden for
Games 3 and 4 on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks, desperate after losing the first two games at home,
must control the scoring sprees of the potent sixth man. It has
become a win-or-clean-out-your-locker proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to guard him,'' Mookie Blaylock, the Hawks' struggling
point guard, said. ``That's pretty much it. He's not trying to get
anyone else involved. The job is just to stop him and get the ball
out of his hands. In two ball games, we've just been letting him do
what he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been running out in the open court and beating us down
the floor. It's not like other people are hurting us. In fact,
sometimes you think he's out there playing by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith, who is slumping with 8-for-33 shooting in the
series, said: ``The thing he's doing smart is when the shot is
going up, he's just taking off. Whoever is guarding him has got to
be smart enough not to go rebound, but stay back with him. Stay
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys are acting like he's been a role player all his life.
He's a guy that's been an All-Star and all-pro.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoring 31 points in each game, Sprewell has become a
basket-hanging player at the park waiting for the fast break to
begin. He gambles defensively and sprints upcourt ahead of the
fray. Many of his points have been scored in transition.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Wilkens, the Hawks' coach, is hoping to limit Sprewell's
effectiveness by making him work harder on defense and also by
having his players remember where Sprewell is on the floor on
offense. More double-teaming is also expected. Anything to control
the tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the Hawks needed to do about Sprewell, Dikembe
Mutombo said, ``I don't guard him.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter replied, ``Nobody guards him,'' Mutombo nearly
bent over laughing from the remark. Half-kidding, he added, ``Oh,
don't be so cold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to try to force him to beat us from the outside,''
Mutombo said. ``I think that's what we have to do. I don't think he
can beat us from the outside. He's playing a West Coast game where
it's just put your head down until you hit something. Try to go
straight to the basket. If you don't feel nothing, go ahead and
finish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell has found nooks and crannies in Atlanta's defense and
exploited them. His play has the Knicks within two games of playing
for the right to go to conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have predicted that last month?
</P>
<P>
   ``No great adjustments,'' Blaylock said. ``We just have to guard
him.''
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   DIKEMBE MUTOMBO is drawing on experience to help his team
recover from it 0-2 deficit. When he played for Denver, the Nuggets
trailed Seattle, 2-0, before becoming the first eighth-seeded team
to knock off a No. 1-seeded team in the first round. ``I've been in
a situation against Utah when we were down, 3-0, and I ended up
pushing a Game 7,'' he said of a Western Conference semifinal with
Utah. ``I don't look at myself as a finished guy. Anything is
possible. I believe we will come out with a win in New York.''

 &HT;    Scholarship program honors Texas POW
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Army Spc. Steven Gonzales, one of three
Americans held captive by Serbian forces, on Friday told Texas
lawmakers he will pursue his dream to be an engineer if they
approve a state scholarship program in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great honor that is going to help me fulfill a dream of
mine,'' said Gonzales, accompanied by his parents from Huntsville.
``I do plan to return to Texas A&AMP;M and major in engineering. I
can't wait to get back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old specialist, who grew up in Palestine, was
captured March 31 by Serbian forces along the Yugoslavia-Macedonia
border. Staff Sgts. Christopher Stone and Andrew Ramirez were
captured with him. All were freed May 2.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Eddie Lucio (D-Brownsville) said he sponsored the Steven
Gonzales Prisoner of War Higher Education Act ``to send a clear
message to the people of Texas and our country that we appreciate
the dedication and perseverance our American men and women go
through in service to our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would create a scholarship allowing released prisoners
of war to attend college for free. Gonzales is the only person who
would currently qualify under the bill, which is applicable to POWs
taken captive after Jan. 1. The scholarships would be financed
first by private money before using state dollars. Twenty-six
senators co-sponsored Senate Bill 1902 with Lucio, and it is now
under consideration by the House.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative policy group, the Texas Public Policy Foundation,
opposes the bill, saying it creates a bad precedent.
</P>
<P>
   But Lt. Gov. Rick Perry said the idea is a good one. ``I support
these efforts because those who have served and sacrificed for this
nation should be recognized for their bravery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales said he left college to join the military for the
Army's educational benefits and because he wanted to travel. His
tour of duty ends in March 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In a quiet voice, Gonzales told lawmakers of his fears, as well
as the lessons he learned from captivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I remember the most is the fear of the unknown. It was
one of the biggest factors throughout our captivity,'' he said.
``It's really important to take notice of everything that's
important to you.''

 &HT;    House votes yes to parental notification bill
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a vote belying the intensity of the debate,
House lawmakers on Friday tentatively decided 111-30 to require
Texas doctors to inform parents that their minor daughters are
seeking abortions before proceeding with the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over parental notification never hinged on whether
parents should be involved in the decision facing their young
daughters. Even those who voted against Senate Bill 30 largely
support that.
</P>
<P>
   The four hours of intense and emotional debate instead focused
almost exclusively on how girls could get around having their
parents notified, especially girls who come from families that
aren't ``perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   As tentatively passed, the bill would allow girls to go to a
judge to bypass the notification requirement. The judge would have
two days to determine whether the girl was mature enough to make a
decision on her own, whether notifying her parents or guardian
wouldn't be in her best interest or whether notifying her parents
or guardian would lead to abuse. If a judge didn't decide within
two days, the girl would be allowed to have the abortion without
her parents being notified.
</P>
<P>
   The bill faces a final House vote today before going to the
Senate to consider House changes. The Senate is expected to approve
the House changes, sending the bill to Gov. George W. Bush as early
as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, is
certain to tout the passage of a strict notification law in his bid
for the presidency, should he decide to run. He said he believes
the bill will reduce the number of abortions and better involve
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to final legislative approval and the
opportunity to sign parental notification into law,'' he said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill argued that the judicial bypass is the
only exception necessary. Opponents said getting through the
judicial system is too difficult for scared teen-agers. They said
girls from abusive or neglectful families need other alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Several attempts to allow notification to be made to any adult
family member _ or adult family members older than 25 in limited
circumstances _ failed.
</P>
<P>
   The debate and votes largely split along party lines, but some
Democrats, particularly those with religious convictions against
abortion, voted against expanding the avenues around notification
and voted for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who pushed additional bypasses said opponents were
ignoring reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``These girls need support and sometimes cannot get that from
their parents,'' said Rep. Helen Giddings, D-Dallas, who voted
against the bill. `` `Leave it to Beaver' is gone. This parental
notification bill is not going to cause abortions to be fewer or go
away. Abortion simply goes underground.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters argued that the bill doesn't stop girls from getting
advice and assistance from other family members who could help them
navigate the court system if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   They also argued that to allow other family members to be
notified would invite girls to have friends pose as adult family
members.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Debra Danburg (D-Houston) said that invitation also comes
from the bill as it was voted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict that before this House of Representatives adjourns
today, most of the sexually active teen-agers will know that they
just have to have a fake name and address (to which the
notification will be sent),'' said Danburg, who voted against the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires doctors to give parents notice by telephone or
in person and then wait two days. If a parent or guardian can't be
reached, the doctor would have to notify them by letter and wait
two days after mailing the letter.
</P>
<P>
   In a change to the bill, affidavits given by doctors stating
that notice had been given wouldn't provide conclusive proof of
notification. Without the affidavit being conclusive proof, doctors
could more easily be sued over whether they provided notice, some
Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   Danburg said with the change, abortion opponents could pressure
district attorneys to prosecute doctors over whether they provided
notification. To perform an abortion on a minor without notifying
her parent or having judicial authority to bypass the notification
would be punishable by up to a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there is public pressure out there to
prosecute,'' said Rep. Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, author of the
change.
</P>
<P>
   Twice during the debate, Democrats unsuccessfully tried to
remove the bill from House consideration by raising technical
errors in the process by which it was brought up. Such an error
killed a similar bill two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Rep. Harold Dutton (D-Houston), successfully
raised a technical issue that forced the bill back to committee.
The State Affairs Committee quickly convened Wednesday afternoon,
fixed the technical error and got the bill back before the House.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton, who raised another point of order Friday, said he
opposed the bill because it didn't allow girls enough avenues
around notifying their parents. He also said the bill was given
special treatment and rushed back to the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bastardizes our process,'' he said, questioning why the
bill was pushed ahead of others awaiting House consideration. Today
is the last day for the House to consider Senate bills for the
first time. Hundreds of bills aren't likely to be heard and were in
line before Senate Bill 30, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a governor who is running for president. Maybe that's
why we have to vote on this bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The session ends May 31. Substantive work on all bills must be
completed by May 30.

ENTHUSIASTIC STARS COACH STRIKES HEALTHY BALANCE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (rk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the recent Stanley Cup playoff series against St. Louis,
coach Ken Hitchcock of the Dallas Stars grew displeased with the
play of Brett Hull, one of his sharpshooters. So he demoted Hull to
a checking line and cut his ice time.
</P>
<P>
   And when Sergei Zubov turned over the puck to help create a
winning goal by the Blues in overtime, Hitchcock was publicly
critical of the defenseman who quarterbacks his power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have that,'' Hitchcock said of the mistake. ``He
knows it. We all know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many coaches would be less harsh with their top players,
particularly at such a sensitive time of the year. But Hitchcock is
not a stereotypical NHL coach, and his team is not an average team.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 27 franchises, only four remain, and Hitchcock's team is
one of them. The Stars will face the Colorado Avalanche in the
best-of-7-game Western Conference final series that begins Saturday
night in Dallas. The winner will move to the championship round to
play the Toronto-Buffalo winner from the East.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock never played professional hockey, which makes him rare
among his peers, and there are other unusual things about him. No
other coach has reduced his weight from almost 500 pounds a decade
ago to about half that today.
</P>
<P>
   No other coach, especially one from Canada, has been known to
dress up in the blue uniform of a Union soldier to participate in
battlefield re-enactments of the U.S. Civil War. And how many men
would consider his wife's ex-husband as ``one of my best friends''?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a unique family situation, which I really treasure,''
said Hitchcock's wife, Nancy Bruce, who was a television news
anchor in Kalamazoo, Mich., where she met Hitchcock in 1994. ``My
ex-husband, David, is part of the package because we work very hard
to be good friends and create a situation for our children that
makes us both accessible. I made that clear when I met Hitch.''
</P>
<P>
   They were married in 1996. Hitchcock and his wife agree that
family life with her children has helped him curb his tendency to
become obsessed with his job and his hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   ``His life had become lopsided in many ways before he kind of
integrated into a family atmosphere,'' his wife said. ``Hitch gets
carried away with life.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of his life is devoted to hockey, and Hitchcock's season
runs longer than most. This is the second consecutive season that
his team has reached the NHL final four after winning the regular
season championship. Last season, Dallas lost in the third round to
Detroit, which went on to win its second consecutive Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, 47 years old, is from Edmonton, Alberta. He dropped
out of college to pursue a coaching career. One of his first
players was 14-year-old Mark Messier.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hitchcock has matured, he does not apologize for his
personality. ``Obsession is fine; we're all obsessed,'' Hitchcock
said. ``But to be a good coach, you have to have balance in your
life. My wife has brought me into that reality.''
</P>
<P>
   As a coach, he admits he has a voracious appetite for knowledge,
devouring it from people he meets in his job. He started doing this
25 years ago, at clinics, even when he was still selling hockey
equipment at a sporting-goods store in Edmonton while coaching
youth teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been an information gatherer,'' he said. ``I've
always asked tons of questions. I've always wanted to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock spoke early one morning at the practice facility in
suburban Dallas, hours before his players would arrive. He flipped
off a television showing videotape from the previous night's
victory. He spoke with vivid facial expressions, hand movements and
the persuasive vocal cadence of a salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hitchcock said he does not like to compare coaching
hockey with waging warfare, because war involves great loss of
life, the analogies are irresistible when he starts discussing the
similarities between his two passions. He played the part of a
soldier until 1996 at battle re-enactments; now he attends summer
historical conferences about the Civil War. When asked who he would
like to emulate from that conflict, Hitchcock cited Ulysses S.
Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went about it methodically,'' Hitchcock said of Grant.
``When they lost a lot of men, in the Battle of the Wilderness,
pretty dramatically, he just dusted his army off and pointed it
south again. I feel that's how you have to be as a coach. You have
a lot of tough times. How does a coach deal with tough times? Does
he dust his players off and go back into the fight again with even
more passion? Or does he wallow?''
</P>
<P>
   Of his own team, with its core of veterans and stars in their
prime, he said: ``Our team has tremendous resiliency. We're really
going to need it as we go along in the playoffs. There are going to
be lots of bumps. Lots of adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock often says that a coach does not have to be liked and
that a player does not have to be happy, and he certainly seems to
have established both as policies in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano, the alternate captain and star center, said
anything less than full effort ``is unacceptable'' to Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   Derian Hatcher, the captain and star defenseman, was asked early
in Hitchcock's tenure if the players respected him. ``He tends to
yell a lot and get on guys' cases,'' Hatcher said, ``and, from time
to time, guys don't like it. But, obviously, it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock is in his fourth season with Dallas, his first NHL
team. He worked his way up methodically by coaching in the minor
leagues, by serving as an assistant in the NHL at Philadelphia,
and, before that, by building a powerful junior team at Kamloops in
the Western Hockey League from 1984 through 1990.
</P>
<P>
   People respected his record, but some had a hard time taking him
seriously because of his appearance. His father died when Hitchcock
was 14, and the teen-ager gradually became estranged from his
family. His weight gain began then and never stopped until he was
almost 40 and a doctor friend took him on a golf course for a long,
hot day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no carts,'' Hitchcock said, recalling the day. ``He
made me walk the course. I think he did it on purpose. I was dying
at the end. And he said: `You ain't gonna make it if you don't
change your life. You won't make two more years.'''

   Hitchcock said he altered his habits, giving up fatty, fried
foods and alcohol while beginning an exercise program of about two
hours a day. He uses machines in the gym and goes for outdoor walks
of four to six miles when his team is on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it to be the best time of the day for me,'' he said.
``I'll walk at a hard pace. I find, with the solitude and the
thought process, I can visualize and think as I do this exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Another change in his life came in 1994, when he was coaching a
minor league team in Kalamazoo for the Dallas farm system. While
doing charity work in the community, he met Bruce, who was divorced
with three children. She holds master's degrees in literature and
history from Western Michigan University.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about what attracted her to her husband, she chuckled
and replied: ``He's not the cutest guy that walks the earth. But
you know what? He's such an optimistic, positive person who just
really regards life as an adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce said that, as a former television journalist, she
understands why stories about Hitchcock use the obvious hooks of
his weight loss and his Civil War interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make him an interesting person and they are easy to latch
on to,'' she said. ``But they are small parts of the person. He's
very, very energetic. His sense of competition is unnatural. It
just drives him to want to be the best or maybe drives him to
extremes.'' &QL;

PATAKI'S BIG ANNOUNCEMENT IS SAID TO BE BUSH ENDORSEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No, it seems, Gov. George Pataki is not going to
resign. He apparently is not going to declare his candidacy for the
U.S. Senate, either. He won't announce that former Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato is getting back in the game, or even endorse the Long
Island congressman who may fight Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the
Republican Senate nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery that Pataki built around a political announcement
scheduled for Monday morning melted away Friday, as people planning
the event said he intended to do precisely what many Republicans
have expected him to do for months: to join the long list of
Republicans who have endorsed the presidential bid of Texas Gov.
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   As political events go, it is hardly the earthshaker Pataki and
his aides hinted at in the five days since the governor disclosed
that he had summoned Republican leaders to Manhattan for a major
political announcement. Indeed, the only surprise is that Pataki
managed to keep it secret so long, and that he managed to stir such
frenzied speculation among other politicians and in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Barring some last-minute change of heart or other unlikely
twist, Pataki will become the 16th Republican governor to support
Bush's presidential bid. The Texas governor has become something of
a consensus choice for much, though certainly not all, of the
Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
   So Pataki is jumping onto the back of a very crowded train.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's aides refused to confirm the decision Friday, and
were clearly upset that what they had viewed as a major event for
Pataki had apparently leaked out on a Friday night for publication
in Saturday newspapers. (As a rule, the Saturday newspapers, which
are not particularly well-read, are a favorite repository for news
that politicians  &UR; don't &LR;  want to get much attention.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to comment on any of the scenarios that are
being discussed,'' said Zenia Mucha, the governor's senior adviser.
``The governor will make his announcement on Monday as planned. He
has the right to make his announcement on his own timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   From a national perspective, Pataki's announcement is likely to
fuel the sense, encouraged by Bush's advisers, that his nomination
is inevitable even though Bush has yet to announce officially that
he is running. For Pataki, the announcement will be seen as an
unofficial concession that he will not emerge as a long-shot
candidate for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki still has hopes of being considered as Bush's
running-mate, and the extensive staging of the event seems designed
to impress the Texas governor. Pataki has summoned Republican
leaders from across the state to the ballroom of the New York
Sheraton, suggesting that Pataki is hoping to deliver the party of
the nation's third largest state to Bush. There are even plans for
a balloon drop.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, though, how well the upstate Republican
leaders will take to the announcement. They responded eagerly to
Pataki's invitation, many of them paying their own way to New York
City for what had promised to be a dramatic announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything except that the governor has asked us to
be present, so I am coming down,'' David W. Brenner, the chairman
of the Otsego County Republican Committee, who is bringing his wife
for the 370-mile round-trip drive from Oneonta, said before news of
Pataki's intentions began to emerge. ``And that's that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said they had no comment on Pataki's big
announcement. But unlike Brenner, Bush is going to be spared the
expense and time of a trip to New York for the big Pataki speech,
according to people planning the event. Bush will be able to accept
the endorsement via a satellite television-hook-up that will beam
his image into the hall.

OSCAR REVERTING TO HIS TAKE-CHARGE STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Oscar De La Hoya fidgeted incessantly as others
spoke at a news conference to promote his title defense here
tonight, obviously dying to take care of pending business.
</P>
<P>
   That business? Oba Carr.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the WBC welterweight champion from East L.A. is
particularly interested in beating !ital!Carr.!off! Oba Carr,
Obi-wan Kenobi ... the champ doesn't care who he defeats at the new
Mandalay Bay Events Center.
</P>
<P>
   It's how he gets the job done that matters tonight.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, self critical about his tentative fighting style the
past few years, promises to thrill his fans by tearing through his
opponents like the Golden Boy of old from now on.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with Carr.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be the first to witness the old-but-new Oscar De La
Hoya,'' he said in such an intensely serious manner that it's
difficult to doubt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going back to my old style. Enough of this (technical)
boxing stuff ... I'm gonna go in and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   And, if that's not enough motivation for De La Hoya, the fight
also officially became a prelude to the matchup he and the boxing
world have long yearned for: Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter,
announced Friday that De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad have come to
terms on a Sept. 18 bout in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, the only thing standing in the way of the dream fight,
won't spoil the moment if De La Hoya picks up where he left off.
</P>
<P>
   In his last fight against Ike Quartey in February, De La Hoya
(30-0, with 24 knockouts) fought defensively before finally
abandoning caution and outslugging his challenger in an
unforgettable 12th round to win the fight and drive the crowd into
a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, the champion realized he should never have
allowed his handlers to hold him back and decided to revert back to
the aggressive fighter who won an Olympic gold medal in 1992 and
knocked out 20 of his first 22 opponents at lower weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my style all my life, an aggressive style'' De La
Hoya said. ``I've never been a boxer, fighters have never made me
move backward like they have recently. I've lost respect in the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have big punching power. I should use it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, should Carr (48-2-1, 28 KOs) be pitied?
</P>
<P>
   If utter lack of respect is an indication, yes. He's a 10-1
underdog, he's being paid only $350,000 (to De La Hoya's $5
million) and he's been almost entirely overlooked amid the talk of
a De La Hoya-Trinidad fight. He isn't even on the official fight
poster plastered all over town, which has photographs of De La Hoya
and WBC super featherweight champion Floyd Mayweather, who also is
fighting on the card.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not everyone is ready to dismiss Carr.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Steward, the only one to have worked with both fighters,
believes the challenger is not the pushover everyone seems to think
he is.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, only 27, was a marvelous amateur fighter before turning
pro at only 17. At that time, Steward, who worked primarily as his
manager, predicted greatness for the quick and highly skilled
Detroit native.
</P>
<P>
   However, he strayed from his roots and never evolved into the
fighter he might have been.
</P>
<P>
   First, he left Steward and handed the reins to his career to
trainer/father Eddie Carr. Then he left his !ital!father!off! for
Mike Tyson's handlers when Don King waved a bundle of money in
front of his face, a move he realizes now he should never have
made.
</P>
<P>
   Carr got two title shots with King _ he was knocked out by
Trinidad in the eighth round in 1994 and was outpointed by Quartey
in 1996 _ but was lost without his dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me everything I know,'' Carr said. ``It was like
being half a man without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr left King after the Quartey fight and returned to his
father. He also found God and stability, which he believes makes
him a better man and a better fighter than the one who lost to
Trinidad and Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   Since he left King, he's 9-0-1. He easily beat former champion
Frankie Randall in his last fight to earn a shot at De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned about being overlooked,'' he said. ``Those
are the two champions (on the fight poster). In order to have my
picture up there, I have to prove myself. It doesn't bother me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I beat De La Hoya, the whole town will have pictures of
Oba.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward won't make that prediction but gives Carr a chance.
</P>
<P>
   He said Carr's hand speed could confound anyone and has more
courage than people realize. He might go down tonight but he won't
do it willingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oba will fight all the way to the wire,'' Steward said. ``That
right there means you gotta give him a shot in this fight, more
than people give him credit for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that Oscar is as fast as Oba and he's much
stronger. His strength and power give him a definite edge.''
</P>
<P>
   That and a few other things.

 &HT;    Officials promise park will be tops for players, affordable for
fans
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Hamilton County and Cincinnati Reds officials made
several important promises Friday after announcing a 30-year lease
agreement on a new $297 million riverfront ballpark due to open in
2003.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the best stadium in Major League baseball, capable of
generating enough additional revenue to help make the team a World
Series contender. And coming to the park will be affordable for
fans.
</P>
<P>
   At a sun-splashed news conference near home plate at Cinergy
Field, county Commissioner Bob Bedinghaus, commission President Tom
Neyer, Reds Managing Executive John Allen and team General Manager
Jim Bowden trumpeted the ``rebirth of the riverfront'' with the new
venue for baseball's oldest franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The yet-to-be-named ballpark will have 45,000 seats, 51 luxury
boxes, 3,500 parking spaces and a grass playing surface. It will
slightly overlap Cinergy Field and be located just east of the
Bengals' $403 million Paul Brown Stadium, due to open for the 2000
NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've struck a deal that works not just for the team, not just
for the government of Hamilton County, but most importantly for the
citizens of Hamilton County and this entire region,'' Neyer said.
``It will provide prosperity for the Reds, pride for the community
and a home for the fans who have been following Cincinnati baseball
for more than a century.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedinghaus is credited with conceiving the idea of two new
stadiums from the kitchen table of his Delhi Twp. home four years
ago, then selling the idea to county voters, who approved a
half-cent increase in their sales tax in March 1996 so the stadiums
could be built.
</P>
<P>
   He said the riverfront's rebirth ``serves as a catalyst for
taking this community a giant step forward. We are truly the envy
of cities our size and much larger. People are coming here to find
out how we get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Although architects are still working on the ballpark's design _
the final drawing is expected this summer _ Allen set a high
standard for the Reds, who will contribute $30 million to the
project on top of the county's $235 million. The Reds annual rent
will be $2.5 million for the first nine years and $1 per year the
next 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reds are committed to working hard to design and build the
best stadium in all of baseball.'' Allen said. ``We want a stadium
that will make us all proud. As the oldest franchise in baseball,
we'll be able to combine the best of modern technology along with
our wonderful history and tradition to build the best stadium there
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said keeping ticket prices affordable is a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reds organization does not want to scare people away,''
Allen said. ``It's very important that we have a tiered price
structure so that it's affordable for everybody. You'll see that
tradition we've had for years _ of being an affordable family
entertainment facility _ continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (private seat licenses) are used at all, it will be on
ultra-premium seating. Your average seat ticket holder that's
supported us all these years will not have to pay a fee just for
the privilege to buy a season ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is excited by the prospects of the new stadium bringing a
reported $24 million per year in additional revenue to help the
Reds field a quality team in one of baseball's smallest markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is big,'' Bowden said. ``If you don't have a new stadium,
you won't be able to compete at all, so this gives us a chance to
compete. I can see Cincinnati turning into what Cleveland is now. I
can see sellout crowds every game down the road. It's a very
exciting time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never asked to be able to put the same payroll on the
field that Atlanta does or the Yankees, but just put us in the
ballpark. Give us a chance to be two or three players short of what
they can do financially and not 15 players short.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said fans can expect a ``short right field porch.'' He
wouldn't reveal any other cosmetic aspects of the ballpark except
to say that everyone in Reds' baseball operations from coaches,
players and player development personnel has had direct input with
architects and designers.

STATE SAYS POTENTIAL PITFALLS PLAGUE HMO INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ State officials, fresh from the chore of
cleaning up the bankruptcy and liquidation of HIP Health Plans of
New Jersey, said this week that the rapidly evolving
health-insurance industry could still present new problems.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying Thursday before the Senate Health Committee, Jaynee
LaVecchia, the commissioner of the Department of Banking and
Insurance, said that she was beginning to see deals that were
disturbingly similar to the one that brought on the demise of HIP,
which had been the state's fourth-largest health maintenance
organization.
</P>
<P>
   And, she said, even some of the new regulations and legislation
that state regulators have proposed in the wake of HIP's failure
may not be enough to prevent future problems. ``It's evolving and
we haven't seen by far how creative the industry can be,'' said Ms.
LaVecchia. ``Right now the law is not ready or able to keep pace
with the changes.''
</P>
<P>
   At hearings this week, Ms. LaVecchia and other state regulators
publicly discussed the HIP debacle in detail for the first time.
They acknowledged that they had neither the legal authority nor the
staff to prevent what happened to HIP. They said their overriding
desire had been to save an insurer that looked as if it had ``lived
past its nine lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. LaVecchia said that her agency had ``tried valiantly'' to
get HIP to improve management practices, but did not have the
enforcement and monitoring tools to do so.
</P>
<P>
   So when the for-profit company Pinnacle Health Enterprises came
forward with a merger plan that promised to infuse new capital into
the sagging insurer and institute more efficient screening and
management techniques, she said, regulators jumped at the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   HIP, said Acting Attorney General Paul Zoubek, ``was an entity
in financial distress, and that framed the whole consideration of
the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar problems and frustrations were expressed by state
officials in interviews last December with The New York Times. At
that time, the merger arrangement was unraveling into insolvency
and bankruptcy, imperiling the coverage of 194,000 policyholders.
HIP Health Plans of New Jersey closed its doors on March 31, and
most of its policyholders switched to other insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Its problems began more than two years earlier, when its system
of clinic-based care was having trouble competing with the networks
of private doctors offered by newer HMOs. Revenues declined, and
HIP cut premiums to well below costs in an effort to hang on to
policyholders. It also began shopping around for a merger partner.
</P>
<P>
   That partner turned out to be Pinnacle, which paid HIP $73
million to acquire its clinics and policyholders. Pinnacle proposed
new management systems and said it would create a network of
private doctors, lower costs and improve services.
</P>
<P>
   The deal received the blessing of state regulators despite their
inability to examine Pinnacle's finances carefully. It was also
approved even though Pinnacle was not licensed by the state, so it
could not be compelled, as other insurers were, to maintain
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of future situations like the failure of HIP, the
administration of Gov. Christie Whitman has proposed new
regulations that would prohibit licensed insurers from transferring
so much of their responsibilities to unlicensed companies. The
Assembly has begun to examine the parts of the proposals that
require legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony, Ms. LaVecchia cited recent actions by the
state that prevented United Health Care, a Medicare HMO, from
transferring management to Heritage New Jersey Medical Group.
Heritage is a subsidiary of a national company that specializes in
medical management of elderly Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the experience with HIP and American Preferred,'' said
Ms. LaVecchia, referring to another insurer that became insolvent,
``I haven't allowed that anymore and I have only allowed those
companies to be third-party administrators. But the industry is one
where, increasingly, slivers of the HMO responsibilities are being
delegated out to other entities.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thomas Nagle, executive director of Heritage New Jersey, a
subsidiary of a 21-year-old medical group founded in California,
confirmed that the state had blocked its deal with United Health
and had limited an arrangement that it sought last September with
Oxford Medicare Advantage, another HMO in the state.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the commissioner had unilaterally changed state
law. And while he said he understood the sensitivity wrought by the
HIP experience, Nagle said it was unfair to assume that Heritage,
which he said had a good record in four states, would present
problems for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Langenvin, the executive director of the New Jersey
Association of Health Plans, which represents HMOs, said that some
of the state's proposed changes were unfair, and singled out the
ban on a practice known as transferring risk.
</P>
<P>
   That involves a company taking on, for a flat rate, patients or
services that could end up costing more than the flat rate pays.
The company bets that it will earn profits anyway by shifting those
costly patients. For example, diabetic patients could be
transferred to a medical group that specializes in diabetic care.
That group's experience with diabetics would, in theory, allow it
to provide more efficient care than an insurer could.
</P>
<P>
   Langenvin said that without risk transfers, the industry would
be robbed of one of its main cost-control measures. ``The theory is
that these groups understand these medical and management issues
better and that they are the experts in the area,'' Langenvin said.
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony, Ms. LaVecchia also seemed to have concerns
about how the state's reaction to the HIP insolvency has led her
department to tamper with market forces. But she also sounded as if
she had no choice. ``I don't know whether we can continue to do
what we are doing in New Jersey and keep the state competitive for
HMOs,'' she said. ``But the law in New Jersey has to change,
because it permitted what happened with HIP.''

NEXT UP: DE LA HOYA-TRINIDAD
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Oscar De La Hoya finally has his big fight.
</P>
<P>
   He will face Felix Trinidad in a title unification bout and the
biggest non-heavyweight matchup possible Sept. 18 at the Mandalay
Bay Events Center, it was announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, the WBC welterweight champion, will earn at least a
career-high $15 million; Trinidad, the IBF champ, at least $11
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``What other alternative does (Trinidad) have?'' said Bob Arum,
De La Hoya's promoter. ``Who else can he fight and make this kind
of money?
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wins, he's on top of the world. If he loses, he'll
probably not be marketable for (promoter) Don King anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the fight would materialize until the
Friday deadline promoter Bob Arum had set.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Trinidad Sr., the fighter's father, would not accept
Arum's offer of $10 million plus $6 for every pay-per-view buy over
1 million.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Arum, with help from Time-Warner, HBO's parent
company, raised the ante to $11 million and lowered the number of
buys to 850,000.
</P>
<P>
   That was good enough for Trinidad's camp, which agreed to the
deal Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, De La Hoya's take also will rise. Arum now says his
fighter is guaranteed $15 million and could make as much as $20
million if the fight does well on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a while for (Trinidad's people) to realize that Oscar
was going to make the lion's share of the money,'' Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   The bout, like De La Hoya-Ike Quartey matchup in February, is a
throwback to the days of Sugar Ray Leonard, Tommy Hearns, Marvin
Hagler and Roberto Duran. And it's one that De La Hoya, eager to
enhance his legacy, desperately wanted.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya and Trinidad are a combined 64-0, with 53 knockouts.
De La Hoya is 30-0, 24 KOs. Trinidad is 34-0, 29 KOs.

HOME RUN IN 11TH LIFTS ST. JOHN'S OVER WEST VIRGINIA IN BIG EAST
TOURNAMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Dzurilla's teammates describe him as a pure hitter, and
like most pure hitters he was not interested in cluttering his mind
with details when he stepped to the plate with two runners on base
in the bottom of the 11th inning Friday in Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   If he had, he might have known that Billy Biggs, the West
Virginia reliever, had not surrendered a home run all season and
that the freshman pitcher's best pitch was a slider. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With St. John's tied with West Virginia, 6-6, and facing
elimination from the Big East Conference tournament and the end of
its season, Dzurilla just looked for a pitch that he could handle.
He drilled the first pitch, a hanging slider, over the left-field
wall at Waterfront Park to lift St. John's to a 9-6 victory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The home run erased the third baseman's frustration over
mishandling a bunt in the eighth inning, which had allowed West
Virginia to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm will face Seton Hall Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dzurilla, a junior, tied the school record for home runs in a
season with his 15th, and he added to his own school record for
hits with three Friday, giving him 89 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up big,'' St. John's coach Ed Blankmeyer said. ``You
want your best hitter up in a situation where you can win a ball
game.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the second game, Seton Hall stayed alive by handing
top-seeded Notre Dame its first loss of the tournament, 11-3. Alec
Porzel, Notre Dame's shortstop, hit his third home run to tie the
tournament home run record set by Scott DeMarrais of St. John's in
1986 and matched by Mo Vaughn of Seton Hall in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Ponce De Leon picked up the win and John Bravette had
three hits and two runs batted in for Seton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers and Providence met in the final game of the day.  &QL;

 PANEL SAYS AGENCY LAGS IN ASSESSING CHILDREN'S NEEDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City's child welfare agency often fails to
assess the needs of abused and neglected children promptly and to
find the most appropriate foster homes for them, a panel of
national experts responsible for evaluating the agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which released its findings in a 30-page report, said
child abuse investigators often neglected to gather and pass along
crucial information about the children, their needs and their
relatives to workers responsible for finding foster homes. The city
too often failed to rely on relatives as caretakers or supports for
children who must be removed from their parents.
</P>
<P>
   But the child welfare specialists commended the agency, the
administration for Children's Services, for recognizing the
problems and working to correct them. Hoping to improve the flow of
information and to assess initial foster care placements promptly,
the city last year began bringing together workers, parents,
relatives and foster parents to discuss each individual case three
days after a child is placed in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings, known as 72-hour conferences, now take place in
Queens and Manhattan, city officials said. The experts urged the
city to expand these conferences citywide by December, and to hold
additional meetings 30 days after each foster care placement by
April.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, created last year to resolve a federal lawsuit
against the city, cannot compel the city to follow its
recommendations. But under the agreement that resolved the lawsuit,
it can find that the city has acted in bad faith, which would allow
lawyers for foster children to renew litigation, using the experts
as witnesses. The lawyers had sought to replace the city, which
runs the Administration for Children's Services, with a
court-appointed receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which focused on the placement of the roughly 11,000
children who enter foster care each year, was the second of five
studies to be issued this year by the panel of former child welfare
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The panel includes Doug W. Nelson, president of the Annie E.
Casey Foundation; John Mattingly, a senior program associate at the
Casey foundation; Judith Goodhand, a consultant at the University
of North Carolina, and Paul Vincent, who works with a nonprofit
child welfare group. The first report assessed the city's efforts
to find permanent homes for the 40,000 children now in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   In the study released Friday, the child welfare specialists
urged the city to provide counseling and other services to
stabilize and support children once they land in foster care. They
emphasized the importance of promptly involving parents in their
children's lives, urging city officials to permit visitation
quickly when appropriate and to tell parents promptly what they
need to do to get their children back.
</P>
<P>
   The specialists also urged the city to rely more on
well-trained, well-supervised workers _ and less on computers _ to
find good foster homes for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the panel's recommendations build on initiatives that
ACS has already begun,'' Nicholas Scoppetta, the commissioner of
the Administration for Children's Services, said in a statement.
``Some of the panel's other suggestions for improving services will
require further study by ACS, and we look forward to working with
the panel as we focus on how best to address their
recommendations.''

BENCH PLAYERS FOR KNICKS IMPROVISE WAY TO SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chris Childs is glad for the company. For so long, he
was alone in performing an improvisational act on the floor that
was frowned on by a Knicks team that was once as stuffy as a
butler.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are the free-spirited Marcus Camby and Latrell
Sprewell to ad lib with him. Now, there are partners to sprint
ahead as he pushes the ball up the court without a map. The three
did not need one during Game 2 in Atlanta as they wore on the
patience and will of the elder Hawks and took a commanding 2-0 lead
in their second-round series.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of Thursday night, Steve Smith, Dikembe Mutombo and
Mookie Blaylock were like frazzled parents shouting to the Knicks'
threesome: ``Turn down the music!'' Childs, Camby and Sprewell just
rocked on as a part of a bench that has been vital to the Knicks'
playoff success. In Games 1 and 2, the Knicks' bench outscored the
Hawks' bench, 84-54, and outrebounded them, 38-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps when those guys can come off the bench and do the
kind of damage they did,'' said Don Chaney, an assistant coach.
``It says something about our depth. If we want to win, we have to
have depth.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would want to look ahead of the Hawks, particularly not
the Knicks' squeamish coach, Jeff Van Gundy, but the Knicks' bench
may be as thick as that of the Indiana Pacers. In fact, the Knicks'
bench may be even better than the Knicks' starters. At least in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The starters don't even want to play us anymore,'' Camby said,
joking. ``The second unit always wins. Jeff has to call us off.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has to calm them down during games, too. Sometimes,
they are so energized on offense, they get careless on defense.
Sprewell is prone to make a spectacular shot one minute, miss one a
little later and be slow to get back on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they just throw caution to the wind and play without
regard to a plan, for better or worse. Childs can spot Camby
cutting to the basket for an alley-oop but is still prone to
getting frazzled with some of his decision making. Faults aside,
the bench has delivered when the starters have not, as it did when
the Knicks began Game 2 in a 13-2 hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we come off the bench, we pick up the pace,'' Childs
said. ``As soon as we take the ball off the rim, we fly down the
court. We just play basketball. We go out and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of that fun begins by getting a defensive stop or grabbing
a long rebound off a Hawks miss. Then they attack an Atlanta
defense that needs to set up to be effective. If the Knicks can
beat the Hawks down the floor, that's when the playground shots
begin.
</P>
<P>
   During Game 2, Childs stripped Smith for a steal, caught
Sprewell out of the corner of his eye sprinting down the floor and
found him in stride for a vicious fast-break dunk. A few minutes
later, Camby lifted off on a mark nine feet from the basket,
levitated above the elbows of the finger-wagging Mutombo and threw
down a one-handed dunk that deflated the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus had that one bottled up for some time,'' Larry Johnson
said. ``It was good he was able to get it out of his system.''
</P>
<P>
   All three of the bench stars have felt restrained at some point.
Childs signed as a free agent with the Knicks three years ago and
was labeled their point guard of the future. But that outlook grew
hazy when Charlie Ward, a point guard better suited for Patrick
Ewing, took over as the starter last season. Camby and Sprewell
also arrived with expectations of starting only to end up waiting
impatiently on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to start,'' Sprewell said. ``It's just
something you have to deal with when you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sprewell has been vocal about his distaste for the
situation, Camby has taken his disappointments quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 15 or 20 games, Marcus didn't get a whole lot of
playing time,'' Johnson said. ``But during the last month or so
that I've seen him, he's been the MVP of this team. I think he's
grown a hell of a lot. In order to get to where we want to get, No.
23 is going to have to be a cornerstone for us. He's done his job
and done it well. What he did on that dunk over Dikembe, that was
unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of play seldom seen from a player in Knick blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``What New York doesn't understand is that what they're seeing
just scratches the surface,'' Camby's agent, Alex Johnson, said.
``The rest hasn't been let out, yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is left to tap from Camby, Childs and Sprewell, the
Knicks will need it for Games 3 and 4 Sunday and Monday at Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be hungry, so we can't let up,'' Camby said.
``We always thought we were a good team. Now we're showing it with
everything jelling, especially in transition. We're getting easy
buckets. That's something I've never seen a New York team have
since I've been watching basketball. But the look is definitely
changing, especially with our bench.''
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks trail a playoff series, 2-0, for the 14th time. They
have never recovered from such a deficit. But Knicks coach JEFF VAN
GUNDY was taking little comfort in his team's commanding position
with a chance to sweep the series with victories in Games 3 and 4
at the Garden. ``I've been on a team that was up, 2-0, and gotten
beat,'' said Van Gundy, alluding to the Knicks' 1993 playoff series
with Chicago. ``I'm one of the statistics. I know how that can
happen.'' &QL;

 &HT;    NRA chief gets OK to speak from GOP
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ After a day of soul-searching, Georgia Republican
leaders decided today's speech by a top official of the National
Rifle Association will go on as planned, despite concerns that it
might inflame tensions following the school shooting this week in
Rockdale County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right thing to do,'' state GOP Chairman Rusty Paul
said of continuing the speech by NRA Executive Vice President Wayne
LaPierre. ``We can't be panicked into making a decision. We need to
have this discussion more than ever now.''
</P>
<P>
   Party officials were told to expect several hundred NRA
supporters in the Augusta Civic Center's guest area to hear
LaPierre's five-minute address.
</P>
<P>
   Paul was wavering on the issue Thursday after a Heritage High
School student opened fire on campus, injuring six. Several key
congressional leaders said they were prepared, if asked, to
recommend that the speech be canceled for a variety of reasons. But
after consulting other GOP leaders, Paul said LaPierre can add to
the search for solutions and should not be muzzled.
</P>
<P>
   The speech that has divided the Georgia GOP ranks comes amid a
growing national debate over guns and school violence, one destined
to spill over into Georgia following Thursday's shooting. But many
Republicans, including fomer House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who built
a dinner speech around the topic, said blaming guns is ``a very
nice self-serving smoke screen for liberals who don't want to face
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a decay in the land, but the elite liberal media
can't look honestly at the mess its values have created, so they
yell `gun control' to block thinking,'' Gingrich said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of attacking guns, Gingrich said leaders should focus on
cutting taxes, getting back to school basics and holding Hollywood
and the makers of violent video games responsible for corrupting
the youth.
</P>
<P>
   Two presidential candidates who addressed the GOP's sparse
turnout Friday condemned the incident at Heritage High as part of a
long string of shootings. But former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander
and Christian activist Gary Bauer blamed parents who spend too
little time with their children and on a society that's shunned
religious values such as the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing for kids to read `Thou shalt not kill,'''
Bauer told the applauding crowd. ``How many more bullets have to
fly before we can agree on that?''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates paused for 30 seconds out of respect to the Conyers
families involved in Thursday's shooting. But several Republicans
said the party's sensitivity to the issue should have extended to
canceling LaPierre's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy's come to Georgia,'' said former state Sen. David
Ralston of Blue Ridge. ``For us to give such prominence to a group
that has such a special interest in that issue is a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the controversy for Georgia Republicans isn't just about
guns. As much as anything, it's about how the NRA, with a powerful
constituency in Georgia, treated key candidates in last fall's
elections. Ralston, a candidate for attorney general, and the GOP
nominee for governor were both bypassed by the NRA, which endorsed
Democrats for those seats.
</P>
<P>
   Binding up those sore spots will be among the first tasks a new
state chairman of the GOP will have to tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, who served for four years, leaves today after up to 2,000
convention delegates select his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Far more pressing than the intraparty rift and possible public
relations fallout from the NRA appearance, though, is the task of
reinvigorating a party that until last fall appeared poised to make
good on promises to seize control of the state's power seats.

FUGITIVE PODIATRIST ARRESTED AFTER SISTER-IN-LAW'S BODY FOUND IN
COOLER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J., Conn.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Jersey City, N.J., podiatrist whose sister-in-law's body was
found stuffed into a plastic cooler this week was arrested Thursday
night on a fugitive warrant in Pennsylvania, and the authorities
said they were investigating her in connection with the death.
</P>
<P>
   The podiatrist, Dr. Elain Witterschein, 48, was arrested by the
Pennsylvania State Police at a substance abuse clinic in
Wilkes-Barre, said Edward DeFazio, an assistant Hudson County
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Witterschein was admitted to the clinic last week after she
was arrested in Jersey City on a stolen-passport charge. A judge in
New Jersey Superior Court allowed her to check into the clinic as
an alternative to bail, DeFazio said.
</P>
<P>
   The body of her sister-in-law, Mary Ann Witterschein, was
discovered Monday in a vacant lot across the street from Dr.
Witterschein's apartment. The body was handcuffed and zippered
inside a garment bag that had been placed inside a cooler.
</P>
<P>
   DeFazio said that, according to police reports, the cooler had
previously been kept for months in a storage area accessible only
to the podiatrist and her live-in companion, Stanley Eldrige, in
the basement of their apartment.
</P>
<P>
   DeFazio said Eldrige moved the cooler into the vacant lot on
Monday and called the police to report it.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy determined that the woman died between six and nine
months ago from a blow to the head and asphyxiation. She was the
widow of Edward Witterschein, a retired Jersey City police
lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   DeFazio said that neither Dr. Witterschein nor Eldrige, who
could not be reached for comment, had been ruled out as a suspect
in the death.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Tom Jordan of the Pennsylvania State Police, who
arrested Dr. Witterschein, said officials of the clinic, Clear
Brook Manor, called a nephew of hers to report her missing about 3
p.m. on Thursday. The nephew called the police, who began looking
for her as a missing person. But the search intensified and a
fugitive warrant was issued after officials learned through a
computer databank check that she had been charged in the passport
case.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Jordan said clinic officials later called the police
when Dr. Witterschein returned after spending several hours in a
wooded area near the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``She walked out on her own and basically just stayed in the
woods,'' Trooper Jordan said. ``She just told me she was
depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFazio said Dr. Witterschein was also charged Thursday night
with trying to use the stolen passport to cash forged checks. He
said the passport did not belong to the dead woman. Dr.
Witterschein was being held in the Luzerne County, Pa., jail on the
fugitive charge. Bond was set at $500,000. DeFazio said his office
would seek her extradition to face theft and fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   DeFazio said Dr. Witterschein had not practiced medicine for
some time. Her lawyer, Brian Stapleton of Stamford, Conn., is not
listed in the phone book, and has no telephone number in the state
bar's directory.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, May 21 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: SHOW1
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, May 14, the Senate approved, 48-47, an amendment to
the juvenile justice bill that would require mandatory background
checks on private sales of firearms gun shows. Supporters said the
measure would ensure that guns did not get into the wrong hands.
Opponents said the measure was filled with loopholes, such as
limiting the background checks to 24 hours and enabling people to
redeem guns they had dropped off at a pawn shop without subjecting
them to a background check. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: LOCKS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 78-20, an amendment to the
juvenile justice bill that would require handguns to be sold with
child safety locks or storage devices. The measure also limits the
liability of handgun owners who properly use child safety devices
in the event of an injury or death. Supporters said it would help
restrict access of guns to children. Opponents said the law was
unnecessary because safety devices are already available at gun
shops. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: MINORITY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday failed to pass a measure that would have
required states to develop strategies for dealing with the
disproportionate imprisonment of minority juveniles. Voting 52-48,
the Senate tabled, or set aside, the amendment to the juvenile
justice bill. Supporters of the measure said it was about fairness
and would help eliminate the problem of discrimination in the
juvenile justice system. Opponents said there is no proof of the
problem, and it would need further study before Congress could pass
legislation. A ``yes'' vote favors setting aside the measure.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: SHOW2
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 51-50, an amendment to the
juvenile justice bill that would require background checks at gun
shows. After the senators registered a 50-50 vote, Vice President
Al Gore cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of the Democratic
proposal. The measure, which is only slightly different from a
measure that was rejected by the Senate last week, requires
criminal background checks for all private sales at gun shows and
for people who try to claim their own guns at pawn shops.
Supporters said the legislation would close the loopholes that make
it too easy to buy guns at gun shows. Opponents said the measure
would be expensive and create more loopholes. A ``yes'' vote favors
the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: S.KOSOVO
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 64-36, the final version of a
$15 billion emergency spending bill that will provide funding for
the conflict in Kosovo and send aid to farmers and victims of
natural disasters. President Clinton is expected to sign the bill,
which passed the House earlier in the week. Supporters said the
bill sends a clear message to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
about the commitment of NATO. Opponents said the measure was filled
with too many additional non-emergency provisions that never would
have passed through the normal budgetary process. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   6) BILL NUMBER: COPS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 48-50, an amendment to the
juvenile justice bill that would authorize $1 billion a year for
the next five years to expand and extend the Community Oriented
Policing Services (COPS) program to hire 50,000 more police
officers. Supporters said the program has proved vital in
decreasing crime rates throughout the country. Opponents said the
program is flawed and needs to be more fully examined before it is
reauthorized. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   7) BILL NUMBER: JUVENILE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 73-25, a juvenile justice bill
that seeks to prevent youth violence by making it easier to
prosecute violent juveniles as adults, and includes provisions that
require background checks on all gun sales, and that handguns be
sold with child safety locks or storage devices. Supporters said
the bill was a first step toward controlling the prevalence of guns
and making the country a safer place for children. Opponents said
the bill fails to adequately address the problems that led to the
school shootings that have troubled the country for the past year.
A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   HOUSE VOTES:

<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: H.KOSOVO
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday approved, 269-158, the final version of a
$15 billion spending bill that will provide funding for the
conflict in the Balkans, money for disaster relief and farmers, and
a military pay raise. Supporters said the bill sends a clear
message to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic about the
comittment of NATO. Opponents said the measure was filled with
additional, non-emergency provisions that never would have passed
through the normal budgetary process. A ``yes'' vote favors the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: EARTH
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday agreed, 259-168, to provide $42 billion
to fund NASA for the next three years. Included in the bill was the
elimination NASA's Triana satellite project, a program that would
have beamed images of Earth 24 hours a day as it is seen from outer
space -- an initiative suggested by Vice President Al Gore.
Supporters of eliminating the Gore project said it was unnecessary
and too bureaucratic. Opponents said eliminating the program was an
attempt to embarass Gore and his presidential campaign. A ``yes''
vote favors funding NASA.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 345-71, a bill calling for the
installation, when technologically possible, of a system capable of
defending the United States against a ballistic missile attack.
President Clinton is expected to sign the bill, which passed the
Senate earlier this year. Supporters said the United States needs
to find a way to defend itself against the growing ballistic
missile threat. Opponents said the bill is irresponsible because it
does not address the costs of such a defense system and does not
clearly define what would constitute a technologically capable
defense system. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

NYC COUNCIL SPEAKER SAYS LOSS OF COMMUTER TAX MONEY COULD FORCE
LAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City Council Speaker Peter Vallone warned Friday that
the loss of up to $360 million a year in commuter tax revenue could
force the city to lay off workers at some point in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a group of labor leaders, Vallone said the state
Legislature's decision last week to abolish the income tax paid by
nonresidents who work in the city had created a ``perpetual hole''
in the city's $35 billion budget. The impact could be more serious
in future years, he said, when the economy might be weaker and the
city might not have a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quickest way of saving money is not to hire,'' Vallone, a
Democrat, told about 50 labor leaders, who had invited City Council
members to a luncheon to discuss concerns about Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's spending plan. ``And who gets hurt first? The little
person gets hurt first.''
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Vallone told reporters that the repeal of the
commuter tax _ which was 0.45 percent of taxable income for most
wage earners _ had forced the mayor and the council to reconsider
their spending priorities as they figure out how to make up for the
anticipated loss of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is back on the table,'' Vallone said, adding that
council members would discuss spending priorities Saturday in a
special meeting at City Hall. ``We were able to get through the
worst of times without laying people off, but we were never faced
with this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, aides to both Vallone and Giuliani said
layoffs in the coming fiscal year were highly unlikely, because the
city had a record $2.1 billion surplus. A more likely strategy for
dealing with the lost commuter tax revenue would be to abandon some
of the tax cuts that the mayor and the speaker had proposed, the
aides said. Giuliani has proposed $405 million in tax cuts, while
Vallone has called for more than $800 million in cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year there is a surplus, so we're just going to have to
make some choices regarding the tax cuts,'' said Carolyn Daly, a
spokeswoman for Vallone. ``But in years where there is no surplus,
those are the years where you will start considering layoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, said Vallone was
justified in worrying about the long-term effects of the commuter
tax repeal, because the city anticipates sizable budget deficits in
the next few years. The Giuliani administration is predicting a
$1.6 billion budget gap in the 2001 fiscal year, and a $1.7 billion
gap in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the size of our out-year gaps, layoffs are an option,''
Lhota said. ``It's one of the many things we will consider as we
move forward to close the budget gaps.''

SCHOOL OFFICIAL CHARGED WITH MOLESTING STUDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An assistant principal at Stuyvesant High School was
arrested Friday and charged with molesting a student who was
working as his assistant, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Plass, 55, who has worked at Stuyvesant for the last 16
years and taught in the city school system for 33 years, was taken
into custody Friday morning at his home in Queens, said Edward
Stancik, the special commissioner of investigation for the New York
City schools. Plass was charged with sexual abuse and endangering
the welfare of a child, Stancik said.
</P>
<P>
   The student, a 15-year-old girl whose name was not released, was
assigned to Plass' office and given administrative tasks,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The abuse, they said, took place last year, while the student
was working alone with Plass in his office at the school, in
Battery Park City in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   During the first alleged encounter late last year, Plass
conspicuously viewed pornography sites on the Internet while the
girl was in his office, Stancik said. Later Plass rubbed her leg
and then tried to hug her, Stancik said. The girl told
investigators that she consistently rebuffed Plass' advances.
</P>
<P>
   On other occasions, Stancik said, Plass masturbated in the
girl's presence and tried to touch her genitals.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators learned of the incident from a teacher who read a
journal that the girl was keeping as part of a class. In her
entries, which were made last February, the student wrote about the
incidents as if they were happening to a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, an investigator posing as the student's older brother
confronted Plass and asked him whether the stories he had heard
from his sister were true. With a hidden device recording the
conversation, Plass admitted to the conduct, and said the girl had
instigated the sexual encounters, the authorities said. Because of
her age, they said, it would not matter whether the girl consented
or not.
</P>
<P>
   Plass had no previous arrest record, Stancik said, adding that
his office was investigating previous complaints about Plass made
by students at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators seized a computer in Plass' office on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who answered the phone at Plass' home in Queens on
Friday night declined to comment on the allegations. Plass is
married to a mathematics teacher who works at a public school in
Queens. The couple have two sons.
</P>
<P>
   Most students interviewed Friday night said they had just
learned of Plass' arrest and were stunned by the news. ``If the
allegations are true, they should be dealt with, but I hope this
doesn't overshadow all the great things about the school,'' said
David Meadvin, 18, a senior who is president of the student body.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Plass, who is also a biology teacher, is best known for
encouraging students to enter the annual Westinghouse science
competition, recently renamed the Intel Science Talent Search. For
the past 16 years, he has pushed students to enter the contest and
then shepherded their projects through the entry procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Stuyvesant High has long been known for producing a trove of
finalists each year, helping to fortify its reputation as one of
the finest public high schools in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Although some students described him as a caring, nurturing
mentor, others said Plass was not always approachable. ``He was not
someone that people felt comfortable going to with their
problems,'' said Micah Lasher, 17, a senior. ``Most students did
not look to him as a friend or someone who could be supportive of
their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The school's principal, Jinx Cossi Perullo, could not be reached
for comment Friday night. Chiara Coletti, a spokesman for the Board
of Education, said that Plass would not have any contact with
students until the investigation was completed. ``Everyone took the
appropriate action, and now we have to wait and see what the
investigation bears out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 interview with The New York Times, Plass talked about
his passion for education and his devotion to his students. ``This
is the best job in the country,'' Plass said. ``I am really doing
what I want to do.''

LITES BREAKS THE MOLD AS TEAM EXECUTIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ There was a time when the Detroit Red Wings
stunk.
</P>
<P>
   The hockey franchise made great by Gordie Howe and Ted Lindsay
had hit rock-bottom in the early 1980s when Jim Lites took over as
club president. They had missed the NHL playoffs in 10 of the
previous 11 seasons, most of the talent was old and worn out, they
had traded away No. 1 draft picks and they didn't have much money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a pretty bad franchise,'' Lites said. ``For all
intents and purposes, an expansion franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Wings came up with a daring plan, one that would
bring out the no-holds-barred competitiveness within Lites. The Red
Wings decided to sneak behind the Iron Curtain and see if they
could steal away some of the best amateur hockey talent in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were with the Red Wings, and even here with the Stars,
we always thought a little out of the box,'' Lites said. ``You do
whatever it takes to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of man that owner Tom Hicks has picked to
replace Tom Schieffer as the Rangers' president, someone who won't
let something as trivial as the Soviet Union's communist empire
stand in the way of making his hockey team better.
</P>
<P>
   After all, why worry about an international incident or a run-in
with the KGB when you can snatch away a guy with a ferocious slap
shot.
</P>
<P>
   So the Red Wings drafted 18-year-old Czechoslovakian Petr Klima,
a superstar on the Czech national team, in the fifth round of the
1983 draft, deciding he was as good as any first-round pick that
year.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Jim Devellano made that assessment, not Lites.
What Lites did was physically go get Klima, taking the same
attitude he did in Dallas when Stars general manager Bob Gainey
recommended signing free agents Ed Belfour and Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim was not the one reading the scouting reports,'' said Jeff
Cogen, marketing boss for the Stars and the Rangers and Lites'
right-hand man for more than 13 years. ``But when it comes time to
get something done, he's a can-do guy. He says, `I'll get it done.'
He has a very aggressive mind-set.''
</P>
<P>
   In Klima's case, Lites said bluntly, ``We decided we'd do
whatever it took to get the guy to jump. We made contact with Klima
clandestinely through an interpreter we hired, and he indicated to
us a willingness to jump.''
</P>
<P>
   It took 18 months, but Klima finally agreed to come to the
United States during a late-night meeting with Lites deep in the
woods of the Bavarian Alps in West Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary because they were traveling with armed Russian
guards. It was the first time the Czech team had ever trained
outside Czechoslovakia,'' Lites said. ``We were right over the
border in West Germany. We made contact with him on a Friday night
in the middle of the woods, as scary as can be. He said, `I'll meet
you here Sunday night, same time, if you can get my girl friend out
of Prague in those two days.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We had met _ for lack of a better word _ some Czechoslovakian
profiteers who were basically smugglers. We gave them $5,000, and
they drove into Prague, got the girl and moved her to Budapest. She
called Klima on Saturday, told him she had left _ we didn't know it
at the time _ and he went back on Sunday, said you got her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left with us that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Klima has been a good player in the NHL but nothing exceptional.
The Red Wings had much better success seven years later with Sergei
Federov, the Russian star whom Lites helped sneak out of a hotel
room during the middle of the Goodwill Games in Seattle in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same thing,'' Lites said. ``Hire funny people, get
them to make contact with the player, then I went over and met
them, did all sorts of things to facilitate him leaving. Cash
payments ... you do what you've got to do to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings did. Federov and two other Russians, Slava Kozlov
and Vladimir Konstantinov, helped the Red Wings win the past two
Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty cutting edge,'' Hicks said. ``But you look
what he did with the Stars as well. When he came here six years
ago, he didn't know anybody, and he pretty much had to start all
over. But he helped promote the franchise, sell more tickets, more
advertising and sponsorship and really built things up. I thing
he'll bring some of those same things with the Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lites was named Rangers president, he insisted that general
manager Doug Melvin would be in total charge of the baseball
operation, just as Gainey runs the Stars' hockey operations.
</P>
<P>
   But club presidents who sneak through Bavarian forests with
sacks of money trying to lure Czechoslovakians to defect don't
appear to be the kind of executives who sit back and let others do
the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really the facilitator of what the general manager wants
to do,'' Lites said. ``In Bob's case, he tells me what he needs,
and I think I have a pretty good understanding of hockey. I know
the players. I know the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``In baseball, I don't know the players, but what I have to do
is work with Doug Melvin to try and protect the development of our
young players, which is the key to our success. But my main role
here is to run the business. I do run the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Lites immediate concern is not to parachute into Cuba and kidnap
international superstar Omar Linares but to get more people to The
Ballpark in Arlington. The Rangers finished their last homestand
averaging 34,478 fans per game, trailing the Cleveland Indians
(44,828 through Thursday), the Baltimore Orioles (40,358) and the
New York Yankees (36,674).
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we need to do is fill more seats,'' Hicks
said. ``Attendance has been very good, but it can be better. If it
gets better, that helps us get more resources to put a better team
on the field. Right now, we don't have the resources of our main
competitors, Cleveland or Baltimore or the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Lites acknowledged that the best marketing plan can't make up
for a bad team. It's Melvin's job, he said, to supply the talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think we can be more aggressive in the way we promote
the team,'' Lites said. ``I think we can make the show better, jazz
it up a little, make the entertainment experience seem quicker. I
don't like dead time. I don't think people come to sit. I like to
fill it up without becoming hucksterish.''
</P>
<P>
   Lites is not a baseball novice coming in from hockey without a
clue about the sport's ancient traditions. He was a Detroit Tigers
fan growing up in Michigan. His favorite players were Al Kaline and
Bill Freehan, and he played catcher through high school. He and his
father spent many afternoons together at Tiger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't kept him from introducing a taste of The Late
Show with David Letterman to The Ballpark in Arlington, music
bursts between pitches, sound bites while the opposing manager
visits the mound and the sound of glass shattering when foul balls
go flying into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   He was told when he came into hockey that you had to have an
organist. He didn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear that all the time,'' Lites said. ``Where's the organ?
Every old hockey team has an organ. Every new hockey team doesn't.
Hockey has changed itself, modified itself completely. The
experience in Dallas is as hip as you can get. People like it, they
like the action and what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighteen- to 40-year-old men and women are used to a lot of
stimuli. They grew up with television, rock videos, computers.
They're used to a lot of stimulation, and baseball has to react to
the fact that's how people are now. Baseball has to recognize that
or become a dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars general manager Bob Gainey, as old-school as they come in
hockey, wasn't thrilled with all the marketing innovations
introduced by Lites and his assistants.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged, ``We had to find some new things,
especially when we came down here. We have a group of people whose
job it is to try and judge what our fan base enjoys. There are
compromises that we all have to make. The league is different than
it was 10 years ago. It's different than it was five years ago, and
anyone who wants to stay in this business better be ready to adapt
and compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Lites still realizes he must tread lightly on hallowed ground.
The Red Wings were terrible when he took over in Detroit. The Stars
had just arrived in Dallas when he took over six years ago, and
relatively few people in North Texas knew anything about hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't even understand the rules,'' Lites said. ``You
could be as irreverent as you wanted because you didn't have a
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are different. They have been here 28 years, won two
division titles in the past three years and drew almost three
million fans last season. Certain goals haven't been reached, most
notably a World Series title, but this franchise is also one of the
strongest in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is certainly bigger than hockey,'' Lites said. ``It's
a bigger part of the community and probably draws from a greater
cross-section of the community. Television numbers are higher. For
every person who comes to a Stars game, there are probably four or
five people who come to a Rangers game. You have three million
people coming to the game. They must like it or they wouldn't come.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I'm a little reluctant to perform major surgery. So,
you've got to walk a fine line between respecting the sport and
knowing you've got to reinvent yourself or fall off the cliff. But
you also can't just sit back and think just because three million
people came last year, they'll come again this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lites rarely sits around, unless it's on a tree stump in the
middle of a Bavarian forest trying to convince a Czech teen-ager
that Detroit is really the place he wants to be. \Ntagtop:T.R.

JACKSON'S ONCE-BRIGHT FUTURE DIMMED, BUT NOW HE'S SHINING AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Four years ago, Jim Jackson's future in
Dallas seemed so simple, so perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a breakthrough season in which he averaged 25.7
points per game, scored 50 points in one game and earned All-Star
consideration, he was the Mavericks' starting shooting guard and an
integral prong of the Three J's foundation that was poised to lead
Dallas back to the playoffs. Jackson had a popular local radio
show, a national television commercial and prompted Dallas Mayor
Ron Kirk to proclaim a ``Jim Jackson Day'' in appreciation of his
tireless charity work.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Jackson has finally made it to the postseason _ but
without the high scoring average, the national respect, the
starting job, or his original employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't exactly how I first envisioned it,'' said Jackson,
now a key reserve for the Portland Trail Blazers. ``Like everybody
else, I thought we'd grow together and make the playoffs in Dallas.
It's been like a roller-coaster ride. I wasn't always sure how I'd
get here, just that I would get here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the way to a dynasty in Dallas, there was a gruesome ankle
injury in '95, a controversial feud with Jason Kidd in '96 and,
finally, an unceremonious dumping in '97 by new general manager Don
Nelson. Traded three times in a year to lottery regulars New
Jersey, Philadelphia and Golden State, the former No. 1 pick in '92
was a mediocre free agent looking for work last summer when Trail
Blazers general manager Bob Whitsitt had a flashback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a borderline All-Star in Dallas, and if the team would
have had success, he probably would have been an All-Star,''
Whitsitt said. ``We saw a player who is still young (28), still
physically gifted, and who has his head on straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Accepting a job as Isaiah Rider's backup, Jackson signed a
three-year, $5.7 million contract that required him to reinvent
himself. Instead of a crunch-time shooter, Jackson has become the
team's defensive stopper at small forward and a second point guard
on the floor focusing on passing to Rider, Walt Williams or post-up
scorers Brian Grant and Rasheed Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Suns in the first round, it was Jackson who harassed
Phoenix sharp-shooter Rex Chapman into 23-percent shooting. And in
last Thursday's crucial Game 2 victory in Utah, it was Jackson who
bothered John Stockton's potential game-tying layup in the final
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a mature, experienced pro,'' said Portland coach Mike
Dunleavy. ``He can do a little bit of everything for us from bring
the ball up, to posting up, to taking big shots, to shutting down
Bryon Russell. Best of all, he won't complain. I think he's seen
enough of losing situations and he's really enjoying winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he still lacks his preinjury explosiveness and had only
two 20-point games this season, Jackson quickly evolved into a key
ingredient of Portland's mix. With him on the court in the regular
season, the Blazers outscored opponents by 291 points compared to
only 46 with Rider in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Dunleavy and Whitsitt give Jackson credit for
Rider's improved behavior and play, highlighted by a career
playoff-high 27 points in the Game 2 victory. A player who for
years held his team hostage via irrational behavior, tardiness and
legal troubles, Rider has been a better person and a better player
with Jackson pushing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't measure what he's done for Isaiah,'' said point
guard Damon Stoudamire. ``If \RRider\S screws up, we know and he
knows there's a veteran waiting in the wings.''
</P>
<P>
   A career 19-point scorer, Jackson said it hasn't been easy to
turn into an eight-point role player.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not in a winning situation, people often don't
recognize your good qualities,'' said Jackson, who has played for
nine head coaches including Richie Adubato, Gar Heard, Quinn
Buckner, Dick Motta and Jim Cleamons in Dallas. ``I'm scoring less
than ever, but I'm happier than ever. Some people in Dallas were
convinced that wasn't possible, so they traded me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson still bristles at how he was shipped from the Mavericks
to the Nets in the nine-player swap. Nelson, after just two weeks
on the job, said Jackson was a locker-room distraction who didn't
play hard and was a ``crybaby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wanted to clean house, it's his prerogative,'' Jackson
said of Nelson. ``But he didn't have to taint the guys he traded in
order for a trade to look good. And that's what he did. He tainted
the five guys by saying the locker room and the practices were in
disarray. But Don Nelson never attended a practice and didn't come
to the locker room when we were there, and he didn't sit down and
talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   From the supposed tug-of-love with Kidd over singer Toni Braxton
that he still says never happened, to his one-two scoring punch
with Jamal Mashburn, Jackson says memories of his days with the
Mavericks have grown foggy. Thinking he's finally found a home,
Jackson even chose No. 19 with the Blazers _ 1 the beginning and 9
the end _ and got a Chinese proverb tattooed on his right arm: ``He
who knows a man is wise, he who knows himself is enlightened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, when I look back at it, I'm glad I went through it,
because I never had to struggle with basketball my entire life
until the last two and a half years,'' said Jackson, who still
splits the off-season between Dallas and his hometown of Toledo,
Ohio. ``It's taught me a lot. It's taught me how to handle things
the right way, and now I'm in a situation where I'm finally on a
great team.''

PAVIN'S 64 LEADS RUN OF SUB-PAR ROUNDS AT COLONIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ Pity the poor folks who put in a half-day at work
before heading to yesterday's second round of the MasterCard
Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived in time to see plenty of birdies, but missed any
meaningful shots by the leaders. That's because the dew-sweeping
duo of Corey Pavin and John Cook secured their spots in today's
final group of the third round in time to grab a late lunch and
watch a matinee movie.
</P>
<P>
   Pavin rolled home the last of his seven birdie putts in a round
of 64 before the 2 p.m. group teed off, boosting himself to 7 under
par for the tournament. He stands a shot ahead of Cook (6 under),
who finished 10 minutes before Pavin and collected six birdies,
including a chip-in from a greenside bunker at No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Scott Hoch, a fellow morning starter who stands at 5
under, they did it the old-fashioned way, at least in terms of the
1999 Colonial: They survived 20 mph wind gusts that subsided as the
day progressed.
</P>
<P>
   As wind speeds diminished, so did the Colonial scoring average.
After yielding only 15 sub-par scores in Thursday's opening round,
players logged 51 yesterday _ the biggest one-day increase in
tournament history. Most of those were collected in the afternoon,
when Phil Mickelson blistered the course for the tournament's
lowest score (63) and moved to 5 under, two strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Mickelson marveled more at the scores posted by Pavin
and Cook than at his own 22-putt round or 336-yard driving average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who teed off early were at a disadvantage, yet our
leaders are from that group,'' Mickelson said. ``That just shows
you how well they played.''
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, no one played better yesterday than Pavin. The
two-time Colonial champ proved to be an early starter in more ways
than one. He collected birdies on his first three holes, draining
consecutive 20-footers at No. 2 and No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, Pavin had split 13 of 14 fairways and
found 15 of 18 greens in regulation. He saved pars from both sand
traps he visited and drained four birdie putts of 12 feet or
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just played very solid golf. There wasn't very much I did
wrong out there,'' said Pavin, whose 64 marked his second-best
round on the PGA Tour since the 1996 season. The best came last
week, when Pavin shot a 63 in the opening round of the GTE Byron
Nelson Classic en route to finishing 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, when I shot 7 under, I thought, `Wow, where did
that come from?' '' said Pavin, who has not cracked the top 155 on
the season money list since 1996. ``That was a pleasant surprise.
This was not. I put myself in position to make birdies, and I
thought my way around the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Cook, who collected four birdies on the back nine,
including a bunker blast at No. 10, a 30-footer at No. 12 and two
short birdie putts at No. 16 (4 feet) and No. 18 (8 feet).
</P>
<P>
   Cook checked in with a second-round 66 on a day when the
Colonial scoring average (69.93) was more than two strokes per
player lower than Thursday (72.38). Cook was joined in the
turnaround by playing partner Hoch, who emerged from a bogey-free
tour of Colonial bemoaning the birdies that got away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wasn't in jeopardy of making a bogey out there,''
said Hoch, who made only one birdie putt longer than six feet.
``The wind was a lot more consistent. It was much easier to pull
the right club. The last two holes, if I'd hit my putts harder, I
had them right in the jar.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, Hoch is one of 29 players under par through 36
holes and one of 79 players who survived the weekend cut of 4-over
144. Those seemed like unlikely figures after only 15 players broke
par in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Pavin, until recent weeks, seemed like an unlikely
leader at a PGA Tour event. Now, he's making noises about picking
off his third plaid jacket and breaking a three-year victory
drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectations are a little bit higher now,'' said Pavin, who
ranks No. 68 on the season money list ($270,029). ``They're not
through the roof or anything. That's one thing I still have to be
very careful about. When your expectations get really, really high
and then you don't have great rounds, you feel kind of bad about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavin, however, was all smiles after yesterday's 64. Just like
most of his fellow competitors who extracted second-round revenge
after opening-day struggles at Colonial.

EDITORIAL: THE MAYOR STONEWALLS, AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, May 22:
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's instinct is to stall
investigations into any aspect of his administration. He has
already lost court battles to deny information to Public Advocate
Mark Green and State Comptroller Carl McCall. Now he is refusing to
cooperate at this time with state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's
investigation into the stop-and-frisk policies of the New York
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Corporation Counsel Michael Hess makes the lame excuse that
Spitzer's probe is burdensome and redundant. There are indeed
several probes about the department's practices going on. But
Spitzer, who is responsible for enforcing the state's civil rights
laws, has a right to seek answers, regardless of who else may be
asking questions.
</P>
<P>
   When Spitzer announced in March, after public protests over the
Amadou Diallo shooting, that his office would conduct an
examination of the police stop-and-frisk record, the mayor
recognized his right to do so and the police department pledged to
cooperate fully. Now, when the political heat has been lowered, the
administration is brushing off Spitzer's request for basic data
about police searches on the street. Spitzer wants to review forms
that officers fill out on those searches to see whether proper
guidelines were followed.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, Hess claims he is not actually denying Spitzer's
request, only putting it off indefinitely. The Giuliani
administration would serve itself and the public better by
cooperating instead of turning this dispute into another showdown
in court.

SEUSS LANDING IS TRULY `SEUSSIAN' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By BILL DEAN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ Like Horton who heard a Who, Dr. Seuss himself
might have heard a ``snort'' _ if he could have visited Seuss
Landing, says the widow of Theodore Geisel, Audrey Geisel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was pleased with something, he didn't laugh as perhaps
you or I would laugh, he would sort of `snort,''' Geisel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a thing in the back of his throat. And so,''
she said as tears welled in her eyes, ``when I walked into Seuss
Landing, I think I heard a snort.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``snort'' at Islands of Adventure, however, almost wasn't to
be.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Geisel was as opposed to the idea of her
husband's characters taking up residence at a theme park as Horton
was about giving up the Whos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally, `Thank you, but no thank you,''' Geisel said.
Finally, she agreed to fly from her home in La Jolla, Calif., to
Orlando to hear exactly what the creative team of Islands of
Adventure wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than just set up the Cat in the Hat, Sam-I-Am and the
Grinch in tacky, ultra-commercial settings, they wanted no less
than to create a total Dr. Seuss environment: Everything would be
``Seussian'' _ from the wavy lampposts and bent palm trees to the
Green Eggs and Ham Cafe, and the Sneeches-on-the-beaches beach.
</P>
<P>
   The team showed her detailed drawings and three-dimensional
models of everything from the Cat in the Hat ride to the
Caro-Seuss-el.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted guests to feel like they just walked into all the
books that they'd ever read,'' said Lisa Girolami, show producer of
Seuss Landing. ``And we won her over by getting really serious
about it and showing her that we could do it, and do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   When Geisel saw that Seuss Landing would be a painstaking
creation true to the spirit and zany reality of the books, she
began to be impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I was saying `You can do this?' And they were saying
`we can do this,''' Geisel said. ``They showed me sections, and the
sections were absolutely Seussian; they had a complete handle on
it.
</P>
<P>
   Once Geisel gave her approval for the park itself, then she had
to consider the merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   That was another big ``no'' _ at first. Why, the Grinch would
rather stop Christmas from coming after all than have Sam-I-Am
reduced to an ashtray.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the merchandising, I was a problem,'' Geisel said. ``But
their know-how in doing this was so fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to be Seussian. It had to be in excellent taste and it
had to be quality controlled; no jim-cracky things. And so,
everything coming out of Seuss Landing is very, very special.''

DUNCAN LEARNED THE FUNDAMENTALS FIRST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The day after Utah eliminated San Antonio
from the 1998 playoffs, Spurs rookie forward Tim Duncan received a
call from Jerry Wainwright, an assistant coach at Wake Forest in
Duncan's freshman season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Timmy,'' Wainwright began. ``I can't tell you how proud I
am of you. You did a fabulous job this year. You did yourself and
your family proud.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, coach Wainwright, I don't think so,'' Duncan replied. ``I
suck so bad compared to these guys. I've got so much to learn, so
far to go.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Duncan was named first-team All-NBA _ the
first rookie so honored since Larry Bird in 1980. He was also named
Rookie of the Year and second-team all-defense.
</P>
<P>
   He was awful, all right. Awfully spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation was typical Duncan in that it was atypical of
his hoop generation. Imagine Allen Iverson bemoaning his
shortcomings? Or Kevin Garnett? It's even tough to imagine Kobe
Bryant, respectful pup that he is, showing such self-deprecation.
There simply is no one like Duncan, no one with his attitude, no
one with his skill, and no one with his background.
</P>
<P>
   Especially the background.
</P>
<P>
   Born and reared on St. Croix, a United States territory in the
Virgin Islands, Duncan was a freestyle swimmer with Olympic dreams
until Hurricane Hugo and his mother's death deflected his attention
to basketball at age 14. Although he didn't know it at the time,
learning the game late would be the secret to his success.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone talks about what Duncan has, and it's an impressive
list, for sure. He has huge, strong hands, beautiful footwork, a
soft touch, Swiss timing and exquisite skills. But what separates
Duncan from his peers _ what makes him the best player to enter the
NBA since Michael Jordan in 1984 and the best young big man since
Bill Walton 25 years ago _ is what he doesn't have.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have bad habits.
</P>
<P>
   Watch him this weekend at the Forum, where the Spurs and Los
Angeles Lakers collide for Games 3 and 4 of their Western
Conference semifinals. He does not pose and he does not posture. He
does not taunt or talk. He does not take bad shots.
</P>
<P>
   He never relaxes on defense, never forces passes, never holds
the ball below his chest in congestion _ a mistake even veteran big
men commit _ and he rarely misses free throws (78 percent in the
playoffs).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like Hakeem (Olajuwon),'' Spurs forward Sean Elliott
said. ``Hakeem learned the game late, and Tim learned it late. The
advantage to that is you start under a coach, not on the
playground. Tim never had the chance to develop the bad habits that
are so hard to break.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Croix is a parcel of beach and beauty just east of Puerto
Rico, and it served as Duncan's basketball vacuum. He never played
in the ragged high school all-star games and summer tournaments
that cultivate bad habits, where top recruits take the first
available shot, force wild passes and loaf on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've developed a lot of good habits because of the
coaching staffs I've played for,'' said Duncan, whose speech is as
efficient as his game. ``I was raw when I got to Wake Forest, but
they worked with me to develop my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan learned by practicing, not playing, a trait acquired
during his childhood in the pool. For each competition, he swam
thousands of laps and spent hundreds of hours refining his stroke,
honing his breathing. At 13, he was one of the top 400-meter
freestylers in the U.S. His older sister, Tricia, a backstroker,
participated in the 1988 Olympics for the Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in Sept. 1989, Hurricane Hugo slammed St. Croix and ruined
the Olympic-sized pool where Duncan trained _ the only pool of its
kind on the island. His team was forced to the ocean. Duncan wanted
no part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later _ a day before Duncan's 14th birthday _ his
mother, Ione, died of breast cancer. She had been his No. 1 fan, a
volunteer timer whose cheers could be heard underwater. When she
died, so did his passion. He has not swam competitively since.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball became his life, courtesy of his brother-in-law,
Ricky Lowery, a former guard at Capital University, a Division III
school in Columbus, Ohio. Lowery taught Duncan the basics on the
family's outdoor hoop. Mostly, he taught Duncan the perimeter game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim learned the fundamentals first, without seeing it played
at a higher level,'' Wainwright said. ``Lots of times, kids try to
imitate what they've seen rather than concentrating on the
rudiments. When we got him at Wake Forest, he hadn't been
prostituted by the summer leagues and 18 coaches and 700 people
telling him what to do. He wasn't a product of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the system didn't know anything about Duncan until
1992, when Chris King, a former Wake Forest player, toured St.
Croix with a team of NBA rookies. When King returned to the
mainland, he told Deacons coach Dave Odom about a gangly
16-year-old who had held his own against Alonzo Mourning.
Wainwright quickly tracked down Duncan's name, school and coach,
and Odom bolted for St. Croix faster than he could say Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The best basketball player of his generation was recruited by
Wake Forest, Providence, Hartford and Delaware State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what kind of background Tim had,'' Wainwright
said. ``On his recruiting trip to Wake Forest, we were eating a
meal. When we got up, I told Tim that it was on the school. He
said, `You mean you guys pay for the food?'''
</P>
<P>
   In his first college game, Duncan was scoreless in 10 minutes _
against Alaska Anchorage. But he progressed at warp speed, his
roundball rasa absorbing every morsel of coaching the Deacons
mustered. It was like he had first mastered Latin, and that made
his English all the better.
</P>
<P>
   At Wake Forest, he developed a plethora of low post moves,
refined his ballhandling and passing, used the backboard for jump
shots _ yes, !ital!the backboard!off! _ and snared rebounds with
his enormous hands.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, NBA scouts were salivating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very impressed with Duncan,'' Olajuwon said. ``He's a
very clever player. He understands the game. He does not take bad
shots, and he has good moves. He never does anything out of
character. He's very patient. He's very fundamentally sound. He
learned the game properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan averaged 21.1 points last season as a rookie, 21.7 points
this season. If there's a difference, he says, it's his postseason
demeanor: he's playing with more confidence in the playoffs.
Wednesday in Game 2, he made the game-winning shot, a short hook
over Lakers forward J.R. Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything feels good,'' Duncan said. ``I've got to get it
done for the team. They keep coming to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd better get used to it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration announced Friday that
the United States would press its allies to move quickly to deploy
what was described as a peacekeeping force of about 50,000 troops
on the borders of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After recent days of public debate and private planning, NATO is
now likely to take up the issue as early as next week. The forces
are intended to be used to help return the Kosovar Albanian
refugees and to police any agreement reached with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO and the Pentagon have left open the possibility that
the troops could enter Kosovo without the permission of President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. In that sense, the Pentagon's
announcement of support for such a force, which would include about
7,000 Americans, represented an effort to put pressure on
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   About 13,000 NATO troops in the region are considered the
vanguard of a possible peacekeeping force. But thousands of other
troops are also in Macedonia and Albania, including 5,000 Americans
attached to a fleet of Apache helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO weighs the new deployment, officials said the United
States was negotiating with Russia on concessions that would allow
Milosevic to keep some forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic talks in Moscow between Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott and the Russian envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, Thursday
and Friday have centered on the NATO peacekeeping force going into
Kosovo in exchange for permitting some forces, under the control of
Slobodan Milosevic, to stay, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That would represent a significant shift from one of NATO's key
conditions for a peace agreement, that Milosevic must agree to his
soldiers and police leaving Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said as recently as
Thursday that one of NATO's war objectives was the departure of
``all'' of Milosevic's forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But a Clinton administration official suggested this position
would be finessed by ``all'' Yugoslav army and Serbian police
forces having to leave the province as part of a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Serb soldiers and police would then be allowed to
return in designated numbers to protect religious sites, serve as
tax and customs officials at the border and perhaps, to work in
limited numbers in a newly formed Kosovo police force.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott ended a round of talks with the Russians Friday and left
Moscow to spend the weekend in Washington. He said he would return
next week.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my talks here in Moscow this time have been
significantly constructive and serious to justify my coming back
yet again next week,'' Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, he met with Igor Ivanov, who was reappointed by
the new Russian government as foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On NATO's military front, the alliance's chief decision-making
body, the North Atlantic Council, is expected to meet early next
week to authorize the expanded peacekeeping force of about 50,000
and its earlier than expected formation.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain will argue that time is running
out for the positioning of the force if it is to be effective
before the winter arrives in October.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the U.S. forces, together
with other NATO country soldiers, would initially move into
Macedonia. They would go ``as quickly as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration made the announcement after NATO's commander,
Gen. Wesley Clark, spent a day at the Pentagon this week outlining
what he saw as the need to act now.
</P>
<P>
   The acceleration of the peacekeeping force, officials here
emphasized, did not signal any change in the willingness of the
United States or NATO to mount a land war to drive out Yugoslav
forces. Bacon said Clark had discussed the possibility of ground
troops for an invasion force as one of several options he had been
asked to reassess. He cautioned the leaders at the Pentagon on
Thursday that such a force would have to be larger, and would take
considerable time to assemble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just said that if you look down several months out into the
future, and you reach a point in August or September or October
where we might want to deploy ground troops, what is the type of
planning time frame that would be necessary in order to position
NATO to do that,'' Bacon said. ``He wanted to make sure that no
decisions were made by default, and that everybody be aware of the
type of planning and, potentially, training that would be required
for a future movement of forces. '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even for the smaller peacekeeping force, if NATO waits on
deployment, it could take several weeks to build up, potentially
leaving a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take some time to move them down there,'' Bacon said.
``To the extent that some countries could move in relatively
quickly, light forces in the area, such as the 26th Marine
Expeditionary Unit from the United States, it could be done
rapidly. If people decide to move in very heavy forces from other
parts of Europe, it will take more time.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that NATO's leaders would have to approve the exact
size, composition and mission of the force before setting a date
for the troops to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of diplomatic activity was accompanied by deepening
divisions among NATO members, reflecting a growing nervousness that
the air campaign has not achieved the alliance's goals and dismay
over mistakes like the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
and missile attacks that have killed civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Britain kicked off the public feuding at the beginning of the
week with its renewed promotion of ground troops that could invade
Kosovo once Serbian forces are weakened. Those sentiments were
flatly rejected by Germany, which said it would veto ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   And Britain's push apparently irritated President Clinton, who
tried to patch over the NATO differences by saying he had not ruled
out the use of ground troops as an option but preferred to allow
the air campaign to continue. By week's end, Italy had called for a
bombing pause, Greece was refusing to allow Turkish planes taking
part in NATO airstrikes to fly over its air space and the German
foreign minister appealed to the alliance to avoid civilian
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has argued that congressional approval would not be
needed if he decided to send in ground troops, although the White
House said recently that he would seek congressional support for
such an operation.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives voted last month to bar the White
House from sending ground troops without its approval, but the
administration said such approval raised a host of constitutional
questions. Both the House and the Senate approved an emergency
spending bill of $15 billion in part to pay for the Kosovo
operation, and Clinton signed it into law Friday.
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has said that 7,000 U.S. soldiers would participate
in the new force. Before the airstrikes began, the Pentagon
announced 4,500 Americans would be included in a smaller
peacekeeping force of 28,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   About 13,000 NATO troops, largely French and British, are
already in Macedonia as a vanguard for the peacekeeping force that
NATO wants to patrol Kosovo once the airstrikes end.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 American troops are in Albania accompanying a fleet
of Apache helicopters and 8,000 Italian soldiers are also based in
northern Albania, working mainly on helping the ethnic Albanian
refugees expelled from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In tandem with the military moves, the administration appeared
to be pushing the diplomatic talks along.
</P>
<P>
   The White House wants to have a peace settlement on hand that
the Yugoslav leader will acquiesce to once he ``cries uncle,'' as
administration officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   To make this strategy work, the White House has bet on bringing
the Russian government as close as possible to NATO's demands and
then taking an agreement worked out with NATO and the Russians to
the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution passed by the Security Council would give a U.N.
mandate to a Kosovo peace agreement and isolate Milosevic,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants to have the U.N. resolution passed in
time for the summit of the leaders of the seven industrialized
countries and Russia _ known as the G-8 _in Cologne, Germany, on
June 18.
</P>
<P>
   The concession by the administration on allowing some Serb
forces in Kosovo hinges on the recognition by NATO at its summit
three weeks ago that after the war is over Kosovo would remain part
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sore point for the ethnic Albanians, on whose behalf
NATO has largely conducted its air war.
</P>
<P>
   For the ethnic Albanians who made up more than 90 percent of the
population of Kosovo before the airstrikes and about half of whom
have been forcibly expelled by the Serbs, a goal of the airstrikes
is the eventual independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians argue, according to an administration official,
that since NATO has agreed that Kosovo will remain a part of
Yugoslavia, Milosevic must be allowed ``expressions of
sovereignty'' within the police, military and border guards working
in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott was attempting to keep the scope of Milosevic's Serb
military presence on ``more of a model of park rangers than the
VJ,'' an administration official said, referring to the Yugoslav
army.
</P>
<P>
   It would be unacceptable for NATO for Serbs to serve as border
guards, the official said. But there were other functions at the
border _ such as customs and tax collection _ that the Serbs might
be able to do, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians were ``trying to save face out of all this'' for
Milosevic, the official said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But for Milosevic to be allowed to keep some military or police
in Kosovo would present a major obstacle to one of NATO's war aims:
the return of the more than 700,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who
have been expelled from Kosovo by the Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has repeatedly stressed that an unnegotiable goal of the
war was for the ethnic Albanians, now stranded in Albania and
Macedonia, to return home.
</P>
<P>
   But the refugees, many of whom have been radicalized by the
terror and brutality of the Serbs, would be deterred from returning
if armed Serbs remain in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the presence of Milosevic's forces, no matter how
minimal, would make it highly unlikely that the guerrillas of the
Kosovo Liberation Army would agree to such a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership of the guerrillas have already said that they
will not disarm, a demand laid down by the group of seven
industrialized countries and Russia in Germany two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The basic aim of the guerrillas is the independence of Kosovo
and an agreement that solidifies Kosovo in any way as part of
Yugoslavia would represent a repudiation of those aims.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks Friday, Cook said the shape of the peace
settlement being fashioned has as its base line the agreement from
Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   In that agreement, the Serbs were allowed to have 2,500 police
and 2,500 soldiers of the Yugoslav army. The administration wanted
to keep the number of Serb and Yugoslav forces below those figures,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Kosovo Liberation Army signed onto an agreement that
permitted even a minimal number of lightly armed Serbs or Yugoslav
soldiers in Kosovo, there was a high potential for violence between
the two groups, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a concern on our part that you don't put people there
as invitations for retaliation,'' the official said. ``We would
like to have as few as humanly possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping force would probably have a role in protecting
the Serb and Yugoslav forces and keeping them apart from ethnic
Albanians, he said.

 &HT;    Florida man charged with abuse, torture of children
 &HT;    By Brian D. Crecente and Thomas R. Collins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ A Port St. Lucie woman whose children
were allegedly tortured and raped for almost two years by her
live-in boyfriend was afraid to report him to police because she
feared he would be free to come after them again.
</P>
<P>
   He told her he had avoided conviction on more than a dozen
previous criminal charges, according to police and court records.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, police in Tennessee charged Steven R. Jentsch, 36,
with six counts of aggravated child abuse through malicious
punishment and torture and capital sexual battery. The capital
charge allows prosecutors to seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Jentsch, who moved to Seymour, Tenn., with the woman and
children prior to his April 30 arrest, was extradited Tuesday to
the St. Lucie County jail, where he is being held without bail.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of my years of police work, this is probably the most
callous case of child abuse I've ever heard of,'' said Port St.
Lucie police spokesman Chuck Johnson. ``Had he not been taken into
custody, there is a good chance someone might have been killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jentsch beat, kicked and systematically tortured the five
children who lived with him, according to an arrest affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who is the mother of three of the children, told
police that Jentsch abused her and said police couldn't help
because he had gotten out of all of his previous charges. He told
her if she went to police, he would hunt her down and kill her and
the children.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, Jentsch was charged with five
misdemeanors and 10 felonies, including several sexual battery and
kidnapping charges, over the past 15 years. He was found guilty of
only a 1997 driving under the influence charge.
</P>
<P>
   A former neighbor told police Jentsch bragged about convictions
he avoided. Police say he told his wife that he had a 40-year
sentence for a 1993 charge of sexual battery and kidnapping removed
from his record.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, Jentsch pleaded guilty to the 1993
charges, partly because of the testimony of his then-wife and a
videotape which showed the two of them engaging in bestiality and
bondage and Jentsch apparently torturing her. He was sentenced to
serve 40 years with all but eight years of the sentence suspended.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, Jentsch's wife recanted her testimony and the
judge released Jentsch and purged the plea from his record.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half later, Jentsch moved into a Port St. Lucie
house with two of his children, a girlfriend and her three
children.
</P>
<P>
   Police say his abuse of the group started shortly after that,
including incidents where Jentsch allegedly:
</P>
<P>
   _ Grabbed the 9-year-old girl by the hair, whirled her around
and slammed her into a refrigerator, tearing a ``huge'' clump of
her hair out of the back of her head.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forced the 9-year-old girl to sit in a large red ant hill
until she was covered in ant bites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lifted the 9-year-old girl above his head and threw her, head
first, into a wall. The force of the blow dented the wall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forced the 4-year-old to eat a hamburger covered in hot sauce
until he threw up and then forced the child to eat the vomit.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents continued until an investigator with the
Department of Children and Family Services inspected the home in
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jentsch told investigators he lined the children up and spanked
them with a belt, but because there was no longer any evidence of
abuse, the investigators closed the case, according to police
reports. The woman told police Jentsch stopped his attacks on the
children after that because he was afraid of another inspection.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, Jentsch moved the woman and children to Tennessee
where, police say, the abuse resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Jentsch bought a trailer home on a hill with only one way on and
off the property in case the police came. Police say he placed
55-gallon drums filled with gasoline around the trailer and trained
the children to act as human shields to thwart any attempts to
arrest him. He told the woman that he wouldn't go peacefully if
they came for him.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the woman escaped with her children.
</P>
<P>
   and went into hiding at her sister's home in Port St. Lucie.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the sister went to police and reported the abuse.
Tennessee authorities were able to arrest Jentsch without incident.
His two children were placed in the care of their grandmother,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Lead investigator Detective Todd Schrader said Jentsch didn't
manipulate the system; he was just lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no one's fault,'' he said. ``He just slipped through
the cracks.''

KNOBLAUCH TRIES TO WORK THROUGH SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Chuck Knoblauch remembers the day, remembers the play
and remembers the player. It was May 6, it was a crushing collision
at second base and it involved Minnesota's Corey Koskie. How could
Knoblauch forget?
</P>
<P>
   When Koskie roll blocked Knoblauch while trying to break up a
double play two weeks ago, the second baseman crumbled to the
ground and Yankees initially feared that he might miss an extended
period. Miraculously, Knoblauch only had a seriously bruised lower
left leg and he returned to the lineup after missing three games.
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch, who was slumping before Koskie rumbled into him,
thinks he is still feeling the effects of missing four days because
he has slumped even more since the play occurred. Knoblauch is
searching for reasons why a season that looked so rosy has
deteriorated and his search curiously settled on that memorable
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is not like riding a bike where you get off it and
get right back on,'' said Knoblauch. ``I think it did have some
effect on me. When you're on a roll, the last thing you want to do
is miss three games in four days. It certainly didn't help me. It
definitely wasn't a good thing for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch and the Yankees have to wait until Saturday to
play the White Sox because Friday night's game was postponed by
rain. Roger Clemens, who has not started since April 27 because of
a strained left hamstring, will oppose John Snyder in the first
game of a doubleheader at 4:05 p.m. and Andy Pettitte will face
Mike Sirotka in the second game.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has won 17 straight decisions and is aching to pitch,
but he said one more day of waiting is inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to talk about,'' said Clemens. ``Just go out
there tomorrow. It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Knoblauch rejoined the Yankees, he is 4 for 36 with seven
strikeouts, two runs scored and no runs batted in. Knoblauch was
already 1 for 15 before the play so he has been mired in a 5 for 51
drought that has dropped his average from a league-leading .381 to
.274.
</P>
<P>
   The 107-point plummet is precipitous and Knoblauch claimed that
it could be related to missing time and disturbing his continuity.
``I came out of that all right, but from a baseball standpoint it
wasn't good,'' said Knoblauch. ``You get out of that rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's troubles have extended to defense. He has already
committed seven errors in 35 games after making 13 in 150 games
last season. When Knoblauch was asked if the jarring collision had
influenced him mentally and contributed to his slides, he said,
``It was all physical. I didn't get caught up in any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have scored only 14 runs in their last eight games
and manager Joe Torre has emphasized how critical it is for
Knoblauch to remain patient and consistently reach base because the
leadoff man must be an energizer. Despite batting .265 last year,
Knoblauch was important to the Yankees because he usually took
several pitches and set the tone for the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important because if he gets on, all of a sudden,
pitching to the middle of the lineup is not so easy to the
opposition,'' said Torre. ``There's no place to put them. When you
have hitters that are anxious and you don't have to pitch to them,
it's going to prolong their problems. So the top of the order is
very important to us or to any team for that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Knoblauch has shown mild signs of emerging from his
prolonged funk with three hits in his last eight at-bats, including
a modest three-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   Torre gushed about how Knoblauch got on base three times in a
3-1 victory over the Red Sox on Thursday, acting as if Knoblauch
had belted three homers. It was a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to stay away from driving yourself nuts,'' said
Knoblauch. ``Sometimes it's hard in this game. That's the last
thing you want to do is flip on the TV and see the guys running
around the bases and doing their thing and we're trying to score
one run.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 2, no one in the American League had a higher average
than Knoblauch. Less than three weeks later, Knoblauch is trying to
discover what he once had.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to try and right everything,'' explained Knoblauch.
It's a long season, individualized and team-wise. You really can't
get hung up in today. You have to focus on today, but there's still
a big picture of so many games left and so much work to be done.''

TEXAS HOUSE BACKS PARENTAL NOTIFICATION BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After a tense and often emotional four-hour
debate, the Texas House voted 111-30 Friday to require parents be
notified when minors seek abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to kill the bill with the parliamentary procedure known
as a ``point of order'' were overruled by House Speaker Pete Laney,
D-Hale Center. The measure is a high legislative priority of Gov.
George W. Bush, who said he intends to sign it to ``reduce the
number of abortions in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 30 faces a final vote Saturday before being sent
back to the Senate, which approved the measure in March.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Florence Shapiro, R-Plano, the measure's sponsor, said she
will accept the House version, which is similar to her own bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud that the House overwhelmingly agreed with the
Senate bill. I think it's a great day for the parents of Texas. The
parents are well served because they are now back in the loop,''
Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   While opponents cast the issue as part of a socially
conservative effort to eventually stop abortions altogether and
even contraceptives, supporters say they are trying to restore
parental rights.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said she accepts a change that would waive a two-day
waiting period in cases where a parent brings a girl for an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the focal point of the House debate was whether to
allow other adult relatives to be notified instead of parents. In
the end, the chamber struck that idea down, but not without
powerful speeches in which Democratic members railed against the
bill for giving girls the only other option of appearing before a
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barry B. Telford, D-DeKalb, hushed the chamber with a
speech in which his voice literally shook as he imagined his own
daughter becoming pregnant and being afraid to tell him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am far more concerned that if my daughter gets into this
situation, she goes to someone who gives a damn,'' Telford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would it surprise you to know that it's a lot more important
for me that my daughter gets love and forgiveness and support
instead of condemnation? For once we've got an opportunity to adopt
something that has some semblance of family values.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the debate Rep. Debra Danburg, D-Houston, told of her
teen-age son having major problems, which he shared with an aunt
rather than tell his parents.
</P>
<P>
   The aunt managed to find a way to let the parents know without
breaking the teen's confidence, but Danburg said if he hadn't
gotten that help, ``he would have committed suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, those opposed to allowing adult siblings, aunts, uncles
and grandparents to ``bypass'' the parents question whether a
grandparent in a nursing home or sibling just a few years older or
uncle in a distant location could truly offer the help a parent
might otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill, the way I see it, is about parental notification,''
said Rep. Fred Hill, R-Richardson. ``The parents still have rights.
The right is nothing more than to be notified. They don't even get
a chance to make a decision. They just get a chance to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to notify other relatives failed, but another to
let relatives be notified in special cases cropped up.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patricia Gray, D-Galveston, had argued that in cases where
children had not lived at home for 30 days, often because the
parents are abusive or just don't care, another relative could be
told.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual twist, the conservative Republican Rep. Warren
Chisum of Pampa, backed Gray's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a reasonable additional bypass to the
courtroom. It doesn't throw it wide open,'' he said, arguing with
those who are often allied with him.
</P>
<P>
   Although that proposal also went down, two others succeeded. The
bill now no longer includes a jail term for doctors found guilty of
violating it. Instead they will face a maximum $10,000 in fines.
Meanwhile, affidavits placed in patients' files to establish a
defense for the doctor would no longer prove a ``conclusive''
defense but rather a ``presumed'' one.
</P>
<P>
   In a move highly disturbing to abortion rights advocates and
family planning groups, the House also changed committee wording of
how an abortion is defined. That wording, by Rep. Steve Wolens,
D-Dallas, had made clear the definition did not apply to
contraception and also deleted language defining what a fetus is.
By returning to Shapiro's language, argued Danburg, the bill could
be interpreted to outlaw contraception such as the IUD or the
``morning-after'' pill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Talmadge Heflin, R-Houston, who brought the amendment that
anti-abortion groups had sought, said Danburg is wrong. He also
denied criticism from Rep. Domingo Garcia, D-Dallas, that he was
``trying to make this into an abortion bill.'' Heflin said he
simply wanted wording that the U.S. Supreme Court had judged
constitutional in another state's law.
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote on the bill itself, Rep. Irma Rangel,
D-Kingsville, talked of the days when she handled rape and incest
cases as an assistant district attorney. She spoke of seeing
horrible things, such as the body of a young woman who had killed
herself by attempting an abortion with a coat hanger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know their parents,'' she said of the types of girls
who might be endangered. ``We don't know anything. How dare we go
and try to intrude on a family we know nothing about? We know
little and yet we have the audacity to tell a young child what to
do.''

CERNER DESERVES THE UPTURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a hectic time for Cerner Corp. lately, and frequent,
candid communication has been chief exec Neal Patterson's key
defense against sagging staff morale. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A missive he particularly prizes, however, was one he received
rather than sent. It was from a relatively new employee describing
a medical crisis involving her 84-year-old grandfather and his
chaotic emergency room visit. He was treated by three different
nurses, all of whom asked the same questions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not believe how unorganized it was,'' she wrote.
``Here was an older man trying to hang on, and they couldn't get
his paperwork right ... All I could think about (was how they
needed) a Cerner system.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The testimonial sheds light on why Cerner was chosen by Fortune
as one of the 100 best companies in America to work for. This was a
mission statement as well as an expression of employee devotion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who's suffered an extended bout with myriad health-care
providers can appreciate Cerner's mission. It has spent two decades
developing information management tools to make medical facilities
work better for both patients and caregivers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A facility using a Cerner system doesn't force its users through
the rigmarole of providing the same information during each initial
contact in the process. Physicians, nurses and clinicians are all
able to tap into needed data on new and old patients alike. As
pressures intensify to contain health-care costs, demand for
Cerner's wares is bound to soar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Cerner occasionally falls victim to the same
unkind marketplace vagaries that invariably befall all
entrepreneurial ventures. In early February, for instance, the
company's stock plunged nearly 30 percent in one day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When something like this happens, Cerner is particularly
vulnerable to morale problems because of its somewhat unusual
practice of offering stock options to every category of employee,
no matter how far down the pecking order. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things were looking up, though, during a visit to the corporate
campus Thursday. Wall Street apparently is now viewing Cerner's
situation with more equanimity. This was reflected in the stock's 3
5/8-point pop that day, which lifted it to 23 1/2, or about where
it was in early February. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patterson had warned analysts that 1999 would be a year of
shrinking markets, because existing and prospective clients would
focus more on fixing Y2K problems than buying new stuff. That
wasn't what Wall Street wanted to hear, so when these caveats
proved prescient, Cerner's stock got hammered, along with other
industry players. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things are improving. Not only is the core business regaining
its strength, but Cerner also has initiated strategic moves to
broaden its revenue base. Patterson is acutely aware of the need to
rebuild shareholder value, but he's confident the restructuring of
recent years will ensure this. Moves that previously slowed growth
will turbocharge Cerner's results entering the next millennium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A critical component, in fact, is dubbed the HNA Millennium.
It's the result of more than $130 million in capital outlays since
1993, all made in the name of Cerner taking medical information
management to new levels. &QL;

FIVE BOYS CHARGED WITH RAPING TWIN 6-YEAR-OLD GIRLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN T. DAUNER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four 13-year-old boys and an 11-year-old boy were charged Friday
with multiple counts of aggravated criminal sodomy and rape in the
sexual assault last Saturday of twin 6-year-old girls at a Kansas
City, Kan., day-care facility.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday afternoon, police had four of the boys in custody
and were seeking the fifth. A sixth boy who was present but not
involved was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Wyandotte County District Attorney Nick Tomasic said the boys
repeatedly assaulted the girls in the early afternoon while the
day-care operator, 55-year-old Margaret Hardridge, was on the
premises.
</P>
<P>
   One of the twins was severely traumatized, the other less so,
the district attorney said. The girls were treated Sunday evening
at the University of Kansas Medical Center after being picked up at
the day-care center for the second time in two days. They did not
tell their mother about the assault until Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasic said he had seen many cases over the years where
children were the victims of serious crimes and added, ``This is as
bad as any I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the five boys has serious juvenile records, said
Assistant District Attorney Vicki Meyer, chief juvenile prosecutor.
Two had been charged with shoplifting and went through a diversion
program.
</P>
<P>
   The boys are charged as juveniles, but under a 1998 law, youths
10 and older can be ordered to stand trial as adults. ``We haven't
decided, but it is a possibility that one or more of the boys will
be waived to adult status,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tomasic released the names of the children who were
charged, The Kansas City Star generally does not publish the names
of alleged offenders younger than 14. The newspaper's policy allows
for naming juveniles in selected cases, such as when public safety
is threatened, or if further developments in a case warrant
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasic said the twins were at the day-care facility, located in
large, side-by-side houses at 926 and 930 Ann Ave. from 6 a.m. to 4
p.m. Saturday. The assault occurred in the afternoon, first in a
shed in the backyard and then in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a day after the alleged assault was reported in the
media, some parents continued to take their children to the
day-care facility. On Wednesday, however, the state Department of
Health and Environment ordered the facility closed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The house at 926 Ann is a two-story brick structure; the one at
930 is a two-story frame house, with shingles on the sides. Slides
and swings and other playground equipment are in the back yards. On
Friday afternoon, there was no sign of activity outside either
house.
</P>
<P>
   Tax records show that Margaret Hardridge owns 930 Ann and the
other is rented.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasic said that before the assaults, the boys were playing
basketball in the back yard and the girls were swinging. About a
dozen children were in Hardridge's care, Tomasic said, and
Hardridge might have been indoors when the girls were assaulted in
the shed.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasic said it was possible that another adult was somewhere on
the premises but that no one was supervising the children outside.
</P>
<P>
   Police Detective J.B. Smith, who interviewed the six boys
Wednesday and Thursday, said, ``Two were remorseful and knew
something very bad had happened. One couldn't have cared less. He
was a smart-aleck teen-ager. The others ... answered our questions
politely.''
</P>
<P>
   Once arrested, the boys will be held in juvenile custody until
detention hearings next week. At the hearing, Meyer said, the
district attorney's office will ask that they be detained as
dangers to the community.
</P>
<P>
   When the girls told their mother Sunday that they had been
attacked, she took them immediately to the medical center, which is
near their home in the Armourdale area of Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   They were examined and treated by a doctor, who called police.
Physical evidence of rape and sodomy was recovered during the
examination.

MISSOURI MAN SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR SEXUAL ENCOUNTER WITH
13-YEAR-OLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY RIZZO  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As supportive family members looked on and his wife sobbed, a
Belton, Mo., man was ordered to prison Friday for a sexual
encounter with a 13-year-old girl he met on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   John Michael Wells, 30, will have to serve about five years of
the 70-month sentence before he can be released.
</P>
<P>
   He will also be required to register as a sex offender after he
leaves prison and provide a DNA sample for police files.
</P>
<P>
   The victim and her family were not in the Johnson County, Kan.,
courtroom Friday, but Brenda Cameron, assistant district attorney,
said the ``cheerful, bubbly, kindhearted'' girl had to be
hospitalized because of the emotional trauma of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her father wants you to know the complete devastation this
man's actions have had on the family,'' Cameron told District Judge
John Anderson III.
</P>
<P>
   Wells and the girl developed a relationship through Internet
chat rooms last year. He drove to her Overland Park, Kan., middle
school to meet her in October.
</P>
<P>
   They drove to a nearby parking lot, where the sexual activity
occurred. The girl's friends told police, and Wells was arrested
when he returned to the area to meet her again.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty in March to felony charges of aggravated
indecent liberties with a child and aggravated indecent
solicitation.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Carl Cornwell, said Wells had never evaded his
responsibility or tried to shift blame to the victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will do whatever he can to make sure this problem is not
going to happen again,'' Cornwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Wells choked up as he apologized to everyone he had hurt. ``I'm
here to accept that responsibility,'' he told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson followed plea negotiations in imposing the sentence.
Cornwell and Cameron recommended the 70-month sentence. Cornwell
did not request probation for Wells, who had no prior criminal
record.
</P>
<P>
   Wells could have faced more than 16 years in prison if he had
been convicted of the rape charge originally filed against him.
Cameron dismissed that charge in exchange for his guilty pleas to
the other charges.

SCHOOL SHOOTINGS CHANGED A SENATOR, AND A CRUCIAL VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As someone who once had to carry an assault rifle
in his job, losing an arm and both legs when he was a soldier in
Vietnam, Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., has always thought deeply about
the role guns play in American life.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, he tended to view the issue in Second Amendment
terms, giving heavy weight to the rights of gun owners in the
debate over how much blame easy access to weapons ought to shoulder
for mindless violence.
</P>
<P>
   But the succession of school shootings that have left dozens of
students around the country dead or wounded in the last year and a
half has recast the terms of the argument for many people,
including, Cleland said in an interview Friday, himself.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a strong conservative base in Georgia that opposes
new restrictions on gun ownership, his shift in outlook ultimately
led him to change his vote Thursday to support a measure that would
require background checks on all people who buy firearms at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   The vote by Cleland, a first-term Democrat who opposed similar
legislation just last week, set up a 50-50 tie on the measure,
allowing Vice President Al Gore to cast a tiebreaking vote in favor
and making the provision an amendment to the juvenile-crime bill
that the Senate passed Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened has touched a raw nerve, and people have
reached the point where enough is enough,'' Cleland said Friday,
referring particularly to the shootings last month in Littleton,
Colo., and on Thursday morning in the senator's own state, where a
high school sophomore in the town of Conyers wounded six students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate connected with that nerve,'' Cleland said, ``and
found the courage and the momentum to deal with it. The normal gun
politics of pro-gun, anti-gun are not going to be looked at as
connecting with anyone. Now we're talking about children getting
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   When the background-check amendment was first offered last week
by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., it was defeated by 51-47, with
Cleland and Sen. Max Baucus of Montana the only Democrats against
it. Cleland said Friday that he had found the mandatory nature of
the background check ``too heavy-handed'' and felt it would drive
guns into a black market and the unregulated sales venue of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, proposed voluntary
background checks, which Cleland preferred. But Cleland opposed
other provisions of Craig's proposal, like one that would have
shortened, to 24 hours from 3 days, the length of time given the
seller to perform the check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Craig had loopholes that turned the law backward,'' Cleland
said. ``I never intended for that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Craig amendment passed Thursday, only to be overtaken later
that day by a newly shaped Lautenberg proposal, backed by Cleland.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said it was the tightening of the Craig proposal's
loopholes that had won his support for the Lautenberg amendment.
But he acknowledged that news of the shooting in Conyers, less than
10 miles from where he was reared in Lithonia, Ga., had been a
clincher, leaving him in no doubt that the Senate had to do
something to tighten gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was absolutely taken aback by something like this happening
so close to where I grew up _ that made it solid for me,'' said
Cleland, who must use a wheelchair because of his war injuries.
``When I went into the Senate, rolling down the aisle, I caught the
eye of the clerk and realized I made up my mind. I knew I had to do
the right thing. When the vice president voted, I felt an epiphany
because this was an issue I was struggling with.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said more needed to be done to control the flow of guns,
and a hard fight is ahead, he said, with the growing popularity of
the Internet. A measure introduced this week by Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., that would have regulated Internet sales was
defeated. But Cleland said Schumer had drawn attention to an
important issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty percent of the country is online now,'' Cleland said.
``In 10 years, it will be 60 percent. We have to do more than just
look at gun shows; they're a convenient target. The Net _ that's
where the problem in the future lies, with the unregulated sales of
guns, explosive devices, you name it. That's something we're going
to have to get a handle on.''

OF COURSE RICE WANTS BALL MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The question almost didn't need to be asked,
and the answer came as predictably as it has for the last four
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Glen Rice thinks he needs to be more involved for the Los
Angeles Lakers to reverse their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Rice has made this plea before. After a three-game losing streak
in late April. After a loss to Houston in the first round of the
playoffs. Truth is, he's grown weary of making the point.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is, he's right. The Lakers were 12-4 in
regular-season games in which Rice took at least 14 shots. And Rice
plays at his best when the Lakers' ball and player movement is at
its best.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers' offense has been stagnant in two straight losses
to the San Antonio Spurs, and though Rice is averaging 15 shots a
game, the lack of movement and screen-setting has him slumping at a
40 percent clip. He scored just 16 points in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone back to the point where I'm just standing, buried
out on the wing or buried deep in the corner,'' Rice lamented
Friday. ``I think we're making (the Spurs) job a lot easier than it
should be. I think anytime you put a defender on me and he has to
just guard me when I'm just standing, it's going to make their job
a lot easier. And we don't want to make anyone's job easy.''
</P>
<P>
   With Shaquille O'Neal blanketed by 7-foot defenders, the Lakers
need an offensive jolt from Rice and Kobe Bryant to get back into
this best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to get him the ball,'' O'Neal said, referring to
Rice.
</P>
<P>
   As for a greater role in Games 3 and 4, Rice said: ``You would
hope so.'' But he's not going to ask coach Kurt Rambis to change
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we're not talking about it. I'm done talking about it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for why the Lakers have reverted to a stand-around-and-watch
offense, Rice said, ``I have no idea. That's a question for the
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Spurs have noticed the lack of plays for Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they're going to get Glen Rice involved a little
more,'' said Mario Elie, who has been guarding him. ``It's been
surprising to me that they haven't been going to him more.''
</P>
<P>
   No excuses: J.R. Reid said there was some confusion in the
huddle before the play in which Tim Duncan sank the game-winning
jumpshot in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Reid was guarding Duncan on the play and failed to foul him,
even though the Lakers had a foul to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many things were said. I remember (coaches) saying we have
a foul to give, but we didn't know when we were gonna use it or
whatever,'' Reid said. ``But I should have done a better job of not
letting him catch it so deep in the paint.... You can always go
back and say things should have been done differently, but it's
just the way it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry knows the reason for the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That comes from when you've got too many people in the huddle
talking,'' he said. ``The last couple games, we've been having too
many people talk, saying stuff.... The communication is not
heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie, a nine-year veteran, said the Lakers' mental mistakes were
typical of a young team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've just gotta concentrate for a 48-minute game. They
played a terrific 46-minute game, but the last two minutes is where
you've gotta get it done,'' he said. ``If they keep making the
mistakes, that's fine with me. They'll be out of the series.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Kobe: Just how rare were Bryant's two missed free throws
in the waning seconds of Game 2? Pretty rare.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant has generally been at his clutch-shooting best late in
games. This season, he made 86.2 percent of all second-half free
throws _ 87.3 percent in the third quarter, 85.6 percent in the
fourth. By comparison, he hit only 79.6 percent of first-half free
throws.

LEE'S SUMMIT FACILITY TO HOUSE IMMIGRATION RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The paper trail on all immigrants in the United
States will lead to Lee's Summit, Mo., when the federal Immigration
and Naturalization Service opens a huge underground records center
in September.
</P>
<P>
   The service will send 25 million immigration files from 80
offices around the country to a new facility in limestone caverns
south of Interstate 70 on Lee's Summit Road.
</P>
<P>
   The General Services Administration signed a 20-year lease with
Space Center Kansas City Inc., for the 200,000-square-foot
location. A formal announcement is planned for early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Locations nationwide were considered for the records center,
generating some strong competitive pitches from congressional and
local delegations in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great news for the Kansas City area,'' said Bob
Marcusse, president and chief executive officer of the Kansas City
Area Economic Development Council. ``The 400 new jobs will
reinforce our area's position as the Midwest's fastest growing job
market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a big opportunity for us,'' said Curt Wenson,
assistant to the Lee's Summit city administrator. ``For one thing,
having a positive relationship with the federal government is
always a plus. The jobs are what we are really excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   About 150 people will work at the center initially, involving 80
federal employees and about 70 contract labor employees, federal
officials said. Within a few years, the total staff is expected to
number 400, most expected to be from the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican, and U.S. Rep.
Karen McCarthy of Kansas City, a Democrat, both took partial credit
Friday for the selection of Lee's Summit as the site. Ashcroft
serves on a committee that oversees the immigration service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Ashcroft has been closely involved in this for a year and
a half,'' spokesman Steve Hilton said. McCarthy also has been
involved in meetings on the center, spokesman Phil Scaglia said.
</P>
<P>
   The central location of Kansas City and the underground storage
capability worked strongly in favor of the Lee's Summit proposal,
immigration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Space Center Kansas City has about 1.4 million square feet of
underground space in Lee's Summit and 4.5 million more in
Independence, Mo., company vice president Charlie Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County, Mo., the state of Missouri, the National
Archives and the Social Security Administration have records stored
underground with Space Center, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a constant temperature and humidity control, so
operating costs are very, very cheap,'' he said. Underground
storage gives records greater protection from decay, natural
disaster or theft, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The new records center mostly will house records of living or
recently deceased immigrants, but records dating back to the 1950s
are being sent to the National Archives storage center already in
Kansas City-area caverns.
</P>
<P>
   Counting the archives files, 50 million immigration files will
end up in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, records kept on people's entry into the United
States, their marriages, naturalization proceedings or other
changes in status are kept in offices in the region where the
people live.
</P>
<P>
   Finding records on people can be difficult when they move around
a lot, said Elaine Komis, spokeswoman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. Sending all records to one place will be
much more efficient, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means we will cut retrieval time to a matter of a few days,
and now it can take months or weeks,'' Komis said. ``That will
result in a more timely application process.''
</P>
<P>
   The records center will not be a public facility where families
can do genealogy research, Komis said. Records are restricted to
internal use, but people may seek records on themselves and
relatives through written requests, as they do now.

HEALTH GROUP DEFERS ERADICATION OF SMALLPOX STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Rewrites 1st 3 grafs. Minor changes in wording elsewhere.)  (lb) 
 By JUDITH MILLER and LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Prompted by fears of a new outbreak of one of
the world's deadliest scourges, a World Health Organization panel
in Geneva effectively decided Friday to postpone eradicating the
world's known remaining stocks of the smallpox virus until at least
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all member countries said they remained committed to
the elimination of the smallpox stocks as soon as possible. But the
recommendations of the World Health Assembly, the organization's
governing body, reflected widespread agreement that more time is
needed to study smallpox before it is irrevocably destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly's recommendations are to be officially adopted next
week, a step that officials of the organization said was usually a
formality.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate Friday, many of the 25 national representatives
who spoke affirmed reluctantly the need for a stay of execution for
the virus, the third it has received since the 191-member
organization decided in 1980 to destroy the declared stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's resolution also calls for the creation of an
international committee of experts to advise on the need for
further research and to devise an eradication timetable. It further
specifies that the research should be conducted in an ``open and
transparent'' manner.
</P>
<P>
   The decision reflects a major shift in scientific thinking about
the virus since 1996, when the Assembly decided it should be
destroyed at the end of June 1999. It highlighted the existence of
increasingly rare political common ground between the United States
and Russia, the two remaining repositories of the deadly stocks.
Both Washington and Moscow have publicly opposed eradication of the
virus, at least until more research is done.
</P>
<P>
   Though smallpox was officially declared eradicated as a disease
in 1980, most officials now acknowledge that there are probably
clandestine smallpox stocks throughout the world, and that
retaining the virus could speed the development of new drugs to
fight an outbreak that occurred either naturally or as a result of
bioterrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shalala, the U.S. secretary of health and human services,
who led the U.S. delegation at the assembly, said that the threat
of bioterrorism, which was ``obscure'' only a few years ago, had
emerged as among ``the thorniest problems of the post-Cold War
era.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalala, who critics say was somewhat slow to recognize the
threat and the value of postponing eradication, said that the
growing bioterrorism threat required international health officials
to ``change and adapt our response'' and to coordinate efforts to
``prepare for an incident that we hope will never happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A turning point in official U.S. thinking about the virus's fate
came in March, when an independent scientific panel concluded that
research on the deadly smallpox virus could provide important
scientific and medical opportunities that would be lost if the
virus were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   While the committee was not asked whether the virus should be
kept or destroyed, its conclusions strongly influenced President
Clinton's decision to fight for at least temporary retention.
</P>
<P>
   Though almost none of the resolution's 27 co-sponsors mentioned
bioterrorism in their public remarks, fears that the virus might
once again trigger an epidemic in a now largely unvaccinated world
helped produce the new consensus, Western and foreign officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Western and foreign officials said fear of a possible epidemic
in a now largely unvaccinated world and a recent report from a
senior Soviet defector had helped produce the new consensus against
immediate eradication. The defector said the Soviet Union had
secretly filled warheads of some of its intercontinental ballistic
missiles with smallpox virus, violating a treaty it signed in 1972.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview this week in Washington, Lev Sandakhchiev, the
director of Russia's State Research Center of Virology and
Biotechnology, known as Vector, where smallpox strains are stored,
would not comment on the former Soviet Union's germ weapons
programs. But he said he was certain that North Korea, among other
states, was secretly keeping smallpox stocks. Destroying the virus
would complicate efforts to develop new anti-viral drugs to counter
an outbreak, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandakhchiev said that an outbreak of monkey pox, a virus
closely related to smallpox, last year in Congo had prompted Moscow
to redouble its efforts to defer eradication.
</P>
<P>
   The policy implications of the outbreak of more than 300 cases
of a disease that occasionally strikes humans but has not
traditionally spread quickly among them as smallpox once did, has
been debated by scientists within and outside Russia. The outbreak,
he argued, showed that a new form of smallpox might be evolving and
that it would be ``dangerous'' to conclude that the disease had
been eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Henderson, a former deputy science adviser to the White
House, who led the campaign to destroy the virus, did not agree
that the outbreak in Congo suggested that smallpox was making a
comeback in a milder form. Many of the cases in Congo, he said,
turned out to be not monkey pox, but chicken pox.
</P>
<P>
   He and other advocates of immediate smallpox eradication vowed
Friday to ``continue fighting'' for the virus's destruction. He and
other advocates of smallpox destruction argue that while the virus
has been kept in tight security at both Vector and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta for many years,
relatively little research has been done since the disease was
eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   They discount the notion that governments will spend precious
research dollars on studies of a disease that no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they say, even if the committee of experts that the
World Heath Assembly is supposed to create recommends new
experiments on smallpox, they will be funded at the expense of
research on other lethal diseases like tuberculosis, which is
spreading rapidly in the former Soviet Union, among other places.

SITUATION IMPROVING FOR CERNER CORP. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a hectic time for Cerner Corp. lately, and frequent,
candid communication has been chief exec Neal Patterson's key
defense against sagging staff morale. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A missive he particularly prizes, however, was one he received
rather than sent. It was from a relatively new employee describing
a medical crisis involving her 84-year-old grandfather and his
chaotic emergency room visit. He was treated by three different
nurses, all of whom asked the same questions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not believe how unorganized it was,'' she wrote.
``Here was an older man trying to hang on, and they couldn't get
his paperwork right ... All I could think about (was how they
needed) a Cerner system.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The testimonial sheds light on why Cerner was chosen by Fortune
as one of the 100 best companies in America to work for. This was a
mission statement as well as an expression of employee devotion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who's suffered an extended bout with myriad health-care
providers can appreciate Cerner's mission. It has spent two decades
developing information management tools to make medical facilities
work better for both patients and caregivers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A facility using a Cerner system doesn't force its users through
the rigmarole of providing the same information during each initial
contact in the process. Physicians, nurses and clinicians are all
able to tap into needed data on new and old patients alike. As
pressures intensify to contain health-care costs, demand for
Cerner's wares is bound to soar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Cerner occasionally falls victim to the same
unkind marketplace vagaries that invariably befall all
entrepreneurial ventures. In early February, for instance, the
company's stock plunged nearly 30 percent in one day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When something like this happens, Cerner is particularly
vulnerable to morale problems because of its somewhat unusual
practice of offering stock options to every category of employee,
no matter how far down the pecking order. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things were looking up, though, during a visit to the corporate
campus Thursday. Wall Street apparently is now viewing Cerner's
situation with more equanimity. This was reflected in the stock's 3
5/8-point pop that day, which lifted it to 23 1/2, or about where
it was in early February. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patterson had warned analysts that 1999 would be a year of
shrinking markets, because existing and prospective clients would
focus more on fixing Y2K problems than buying new stuff. That
wasn't what Wall Street wanted to hear, so when these caveats
proved prescient, Cerner's stock got hammered, along with other
industry players. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things are improving. Not only is the core business regaining
its strength, but Cerner also has initiated strategic moves to
broaden its revenue base. Patterson is acutely aware of the need to
rebuild shareholder value, but he's confident the restructuring of
recent years will ensure this. Moves that previously slowed growth
will turbocharge Cerner's results entering the next millennium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A critical component, in fact, is dubbed the HNA Millennium.
It's the result of more than $130 million in capital outlays since
1993, all made in the name of Cerner taking medical information
management to new levels. &QL;

CAN CLIPPERS PULL OFF REPEAT IN LOTTERY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chris Ford can be seen on national TV today,
performing a duty that seems as impressive as becoming
valedictorian of summer school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm the guy,'' said Ford, sounding very much like a guy
who would have preferred to be the guy somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Clippers coach happens to be in Secaucus, N.J.,
assigned as a representative for his team in the NBA's draft
lottery derby, an upgraded-for-TV event that will occur at halftime
of the Spurs-Lakers playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Clippers didn't qualify for the playoffs, they and
12 others are eligible to acquire the first pick in the NBA Draft,
held June 30 at Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who selected center Michael Olowokandi with the
first pick last year, hope to equal this season's high-water mark
for consecutive victories by winning their second lottery in a row.
Ford said he will not be toting any good-luck charms.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there's not much to see. The 13 poor souls
representing the non-playoff teams will be introduced by
commissioner David Stern. Then the process of using Ping-Pong-ball
combinations to determine the first three picks will be explained,
and simulated drama may be whipped up before the draft order is
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Ping-Pong balls numbered 1 through 14 are loaded into the hopper
with 1,001 four-ball combinations divided up and issued to each
team, the number of possibilities corresponding to the franchise's
1999 on-court futility. The Vancouver Grizzlies, eligible for the
No.1 pick for the first time, have 250 four-ball combinations. The
Charlotte Hornets, best among the NBA's bad teams, have just five.
That's five chances out of 1,001 to score the first pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers have 200.
</P>
<P>
   A statistic that could make the process a bit more dramatic:
</P>
<P>
   In this decade, only two teams with Ping-Pong supremacy going
into the lottery came out with the top pick _ Philadelphia in 1996
(Allen Iverson) and New Jersey in 1990 (Derrick Coleman).
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Boston Celtics and new coach Rick Pitino
seemingly had a lock on No. 1, but slipped to No.3 when the
Ping-Pong dust settled. Tim Duncan was taken with the top pick that
season by San Antonio.

BATS STAY HOT AS METS HOLD OFF PHILLIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For most of this season, the New York Mets have been
the opposite of what they were a year ago. Their revamped offense
has been productive, but their starting pitching has yet to come
around.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night at Shea Stadium, however, almost everything came
together for the second consecutive game, everything, that is,
until the bullpen provided a little scare.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not only did an offense led by John Olerud, Mike Piazza
and the rookie surprise Benny Agbayani pound out 13 hits against
five Philadelphia pitchers, but Orel Hershiser turned in his
strongest performance of the season in a 7-5 victory over the
Phillies _ one that needed to be saved by Armando Benitez and John
Franco after Turk Wendell allowed three eighth-inning runs without
getting anyone out. Benitez and Franco struck out five of the six
batters they faced, with Franco picking up his 13th save.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud drove in three runs with a single, home run and double to
extend his hitting streak to 11 games. Piazza homered in his fourth
consecutive game, a feat last accomplished with the Mets by Bobby
Bonilla in 1992. Agbayani was 3 for 4 with a stolen base, a run
scored and a run batted in and now has 13 hits in his last 17
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   And then, after the Phillies had rallied from 7-0 down to 7-5
with a runner on third and none out in the eighth, Benitez came on
to strike out Mike Lieberthal and Desi Relaford, before
pinch-hitter Alex Arias grounded to second to end the threat. Then
Franco finished.
</P>
<P>
   After a 4-9 slide, the Mets (24-18) have won three straight
games to pull two games ahead of the third-place Phillies in the NL
East.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, meanwhile, tossed six scoreless innings before tiring
in the seventh. In his longest outing of the season, Hershiser
(3-4) allowed two runs and six hits in 6 2-3 innings with three
walks and four strikeouts. He departed after 110 pitches, 67 of
them strikes, and with a 7-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   His last time out, Hershiser tossed five scoreless innings in
Philadelphia only to surrender four sixth-inning runs in what
turned into a 5-2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Hershiser took a 7-0 lead into the sixth inning.
But only when the Phillies loaded the bases with two out did
manager Bobby Valentine have somebody up in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's faith in Hershiser paid off when Hershiser caught
Ron Gant looking at an 87 mile-an-hour 1-2 fastball for the final
out. And when the Phillies finally knocked Hershiser out in the
seventh, the pitcher made his way to the dugout to a strong
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser even helped himself at bat, singling in a run and then
hustling home from first on an Edgardo Alfonzo double for the final
run of a three-run third that gave the Mets a 6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had taken a 3-0 lead in the third on consecutive home
runs by Olerud and Piazza off Philadelphia right-hander Carlton
Loewer. Roger Cedeno had opened the inning with a single and then
his hard slide at second helped foil an attempted double play.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud then hammered Loewer's next pitch off the base of the
scoreboard in right for his eighth home run. Three pitches later,
Piazza homered to the opposite field in right _ his eighth of the
season, too _ to become the sixth Mets player to homer in four
consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, things were busy for the Mets, too. They will
most likely activate Rickey Henderson from the disabled list before
Saturday afternoon's game, Valentine said before Friday night's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has been out since May 3 with a right knee sprain. He
said his leg feels about 85 percent. ``I've been with other clubs
that have said my 85 percent is better than someone else's 100
percent,'' Henderson said Friday before running the bases during
batting practice. ``But the way Roger and Benny are playing, they
really have given us a chance to let it heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cedeno, whose favorite player while growing up was
Henderson, began Friday night's game tied for the N.L. lead in
stolen bases with a career-high 21. Agbayani, meanwhile, has been
an even bigger surprise. The former replacement player is batting
.529 since his contract was purchased from Triple-A Norfolk on May
12. In nine games overall, he is 18 for 34 with three home runs and
seven runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing the job,'' Henderson said. ``So I don't have to
rush it too much.'' &QL;

DEFENDING CHAMP WATSON MAKES COLONIAL CUT, DELAYS SENIOR SWITCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ Tom Watson, the once freckled youngster who knocked
off the Golden Bear, is entering the Golden Age. Unfortunately, his
erratic game looks to be following him.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Watson dazzled fans and proved, at 48, he could still
win on the PGA Tour by winning the MasterCard Colonial. Now
approaching 50, Watson's announcement on Wednesday that this
Colonial will be his final regular PGA Tour event before joining
the Senior PGA Tour in September seems a rational decision.
</P>
<P>
   Watson finished yesterday with an even-par 70 to go 4 over par
for the tournament. Near the bottom of the leader board, he found
himself on the brink of elimination. Four hours after Watson walked
into the clubhouse he learned his two-day total of 144 was good
enough to qualify for the final two rounds of the 53rd Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   Watson struggled in shooting a 74 during Thursday's gusty
opening round, then used a tip he received during dinner with Byron
Nelson to shave four strokes yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Byron said he noticed something on TV about my swing. So he
gave me a quick lesson, and it helped a little bit on some
swings,'' Watson said. ``But I'm still struggling to make cuts.
That's not good.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson plans to compete in two major championships, the U.S.
Open and British Open, before becoming a full-time player on the
50-and-over circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Watson tried to downplay the sentimental angle after completing
yesterday's round when it appeared he had played himself out of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking that this would be my last tournament,''
Watson said. ``I'm still going to be out here some. This isn't like
a real goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   While Watson tried to stay alive down the stretch by shooting a
33 on the back-nine, he watched his two playing partners, John Cook
and Scott Hoch, contend for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cook shot 66 and finished at 6 under, one stroke behind leader
Corey Pavin. Hoch also shot 66 to move to 5 under par and into a
four-way tie for third.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the playing partners never focused on the possibility
of it being Watson's final round at a regular tour event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played a lot of my best golf when I've played with him,''
Cook said. ``To have another chance to play with one of the
greatest players of all time was really special. We'll all miss
him.''
</P>
<P>

 FANS OF 76ers SEE HOPES SLIP AWAY  
(rk) 
 By   IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ While the hometown fans were jubilant with
anticipation of being host to a home playoff game, it was no secret
that a 76ers defeat Friday night would put them into a terrible
bind. It would sink them to 3-0 against the Indiana Pacers and put
them one step from elimination, with Game 4 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And Philadelphia's worst fears were realized.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the frenetic waving of white handkerchiefs from the
sellout crowd of 20,930 and Allen Iverson's 21 points in the first
half, the Pacers led from the outset and defeated the 76ers, 97-86.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson finished with 32 points, and Reggie Miller led the
Pacers with 29. But while Miller was not as acrobatic as Iverson,
he was a more effective scoring machine. Iverson took 33 shots and
made 13, including 2 for 10 from 3-point range. Miller hit 9 of 14
shots and was 4 for 6 on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were coming into a hostile environment,'' Miller
said after the game, ``but we wanted to make a statement with our
defense, and of course our focal point was stopping Iverson.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work too well in the first half, because Iverson lit
up the First Union Center arena, hitting 8 of 20 shots. But he
obviously tired in the second half, and the hounding of both Miller
and Mark Jackson on Iverson took its toll on the 76ers' young star.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, meanwhile, have made a strong impression on Iverson.
``These guys took the Chicago Bulls to seven games last season,''
Iverson said. ``They have a great defense, and they play with a lot
of confidence, even in our building.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his performance, particularly late in the game when he
missed several shots in a row after the 76ers narrowed the Pacers'
lead to four points, 77-73, with 9 minutes 38 seconds to go in the
last quarter, Iverson said: ``I kind of got caught up in the game
and I tried to do too much. And they just kept coming at us.'' And
it seemed that in a flash the Pacers had taken a 10-point, a
12-point, a 14-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers offense revolves around Iverson, who led the NBA in
scoring, the shortest player, at 6 feet tall, ever to do so. But it
is still striking when one player takes more than half the shots
and winds up scoring more points than all of the rest of his
teammates combined.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Pacers, just like all the other teams, cannot
contain his swift moves. So the trick is to give him the outside
shot rather than allow him to drive to the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   To start the third period, the 76ers went on an 8-0 run and tied
the score at 49-49. But the Pacers held on, with Chris Mullin
scoring 10 points, including two 3-pointers, in the period. At the
end of the third quarter, the Pacers led 75-66.
</P>
<P>
   What was unusual for the veteran Pacers was that they made 20
turnovers, nearly twice as many as the 76ers, with 11. But they
made up for it by shooting 50 percent to Philadelphia's 37.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sunday, Miller understands that Philadelphia will show
up, and then some. ``Allen is capable of scoring 50 points,'' he
said. ``This series is still far from over.'' He did admit however,
that ``we probably have more weapons than they do.''

 &HT;    Homers in 9th batter Braves
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The biggest Turner Field crowd of the year showed up
Friday night to watch the Braves and rookie Bruce Chen see what
they could do with the Cubs, while John Smoltz watched from the
dugout on the disabled list with a sore elbow.
</P>
<P>
   What the crowd of 48,315 watched ended up looking a lot like
what the 38,588 fans saw the night before _ a late rally by Chicago
for a 8-4 win _ and another loss credited to Atlanta rookie Kevin
McGlinchy.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves clawed back from a scary first inning for Chen and
evened the score 4-4 on a two-run homer by Brian Jordan and
run-scoring doubles from Chipper Jones and Javy Lopez. But a
leadoff walk to Tyler Houston on four McGlinchy pitches to start
the ninth inning, followed by a two-run homer by Henry Rodriguez
had the Cubs beating Atlanta for the fourth time in the five games
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This club is battling their rear-ends off, we could easily
have two wins,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``We needed to rest
some guys. Obviously, it looked like McGlinchy could have used some
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Three batters after Rodriguez, Jeff Blauser slammed a two-run
homer to left field to insure the Cubs of their fourth consecutive
win in Atlanta dating back through last July's two-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We match up against the Braves pretty well for some reason,''
said Blauser, who had his first home run since last August and
second ever against his former team. ``It's nice to hit a home run,
the fact that it came against the Braves is secondary. All the
credit goes to Henry.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the same Cubs lineup that's given Greg Maddux, Tom
Glavine and Smoltz fits over the seven days, Chen found his own set
of problems when Gary Gaetti welcomed him back to the big leagues
with a grand slam in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Chen retired 16 of the next 19 batters he faced, giving up only
a walk and two singles, and used some well-placed fastballs to
match his career-high with seven strikeouts.

DODGERS LOOK FOR WINNING FORMULA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In order for the Los Angeles Dodgers to put
together an impressive winning streak they must first put together
a winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers may have entered Friday's game with the St. Louis
Cardinals a game behind first-place San Francisco in the loss
column, but they also went into the three-game series looking for
back-to-back wins for the first time in May.
</P>
<P>
   It's got management shaking their heads, namely because the
Dodgers are losing games in so many ways.
</P>
<P>
   One loss could be blamed on baserunning. Another on poor
starting pitching. Another on fielding. Another on a lack of timely
hitting. Another on poor relief pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, it's something different each night,''
Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. ``If it was one thing,
we could fix it. At some point, it's got to end. This team cares.
It wants to win. We'll figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone was careful to mention that there were still more than
120 games to play. But he also said he wasn't pleased with the way
the Dodgers, who were 21-19, were playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As poorly as we've played at times, we're still in the hunt,''
Malone said. ``Maybe that's a cheap perspective. (But) it's a true
statement. I think we can only play better. If we stay healthy, we
have to play better than we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Individually, the Dodgers' position players have performed well
offensively. Raul Mondesi's 15 homers led the NL, Gary Sheffield
and Adrian Beltre were hitting above .300 and Eric Young has 20
stolen bases. And Young and Mark Grudzielanek have been sharp
defensively through the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves the pitching. The bullpen has been above average
but the starters, outside of Kevin Brown and Ismael Valdes, have
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put it all together and it should equate to more wins,''
Malone said. ``We haven't played up to our capabilities ... We
haven't played our best baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to make us tougher in the long run. We're not
content. We're not pleased with where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   A look back: Lost in the Dodgers' 4-3 loss Thursday to Houston
was the outing of right-hander Chan Ho Park, who allowed one run in
seven innings and eased his psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Admonished by Dodgers manager Davey Johnson for not using, nor
trusting, his fastball in his past few starts, Park mixed his
mid-90 mph fastball with offspeed pitches to hold the Astros, the
NL's best hitting team, to five hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw a little more offspeed pitches early and then the
fastball,'' Park said. ``They're good fastball hitters. I threw
offspeed for a lot of strikes. If I throw a strike with the
offspeed pitches, it's really easy to get confidence with the
fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   Keepin' the faith: When the Dodgers sent outfielder Trenidad
Hubbard to the minor leagues the day before the season began, it
stunned him. Hubbard, who hit .298 with the Dodgers last season and
thought he had the fifth outfielder's job won, said it took a lot
of gumption to remain focused at Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of talking to myself to keep the right
mindset, the right focus,'' said Hubbard, who was recalled Tuesday.
``It was difficult to muster up energy to play at (that) level.''
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: The weekend series with the Cardinals is
sold out, which should increase the Dodgers' standing as the NL's
leader in attendance. They drew 797,715 in their first 21 games....
Todd Hundley threw out Joe McEwing trying to steal second in the
fourth inning. It was the third of nine would-be base stealers
Hundley's thrown out after beginning the season by allowing 26
steals in 28 attempts.
