<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- World basketball governing body FIFA
has decided Friday to move its headquarters to Geneva, Switzerland
from Munich after staying in the German city for nearly half a
century.
</P>
<P>
The move will be completed by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
The decision to move came at a two-day meeting of FIBA's policy-
making Central Board in Munich.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the session gave no reason for the
move.
</P>
<P>
FIBA has been based in Munich since 1956. It will now return to
Switzerland, where it was based in Bern from 1940 to 1956. Before
that, the headquarters had been in Rome, Italy, for eight years.
</P>
<P>
Munich was one of the eight cities that presented bids for the
new headquarters. Berlin was also in the race, along with another
Swiss city, Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates were Madrid and Badalona in Spain, the Czech
capital of Prague and the principality of Andorra.
</P>
<P>
The FIBA also decided the new dates for the 2002 World
Championships. The men's tournament will be held in the U.S. city
of Indianapolis August 29 - September 8, while the women's event
will be staged Septmenber 15 - 26 in four Chinese cities _ Suzhou,
Changzhou, Huaiyin and Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
The world federation also decided to expand its anti-doping
regulations to provide for out-of-competition drug tests.

<HEADLINE> Turkish State Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Mehmet Irtemcelik, a state minister of
the Turkish coalition government, resigned his post on Saturday to
protest Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's attitude towards the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a written statement, Irtemcelik, a member of the ruling
partner Motherland Party, said that he was not satisfied with
Ecevit's activities during the presidential elections, which had
concluded with the election on Friday of Ahmet Necdet Sezer, chief
judge of the Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the aborted constitutional amendment
proposal launched by Ecevit for extending the tenure of outgoing
President Suleyman Demirel and then Ecevit's positioning Sezer as
the joint presidential candidate of the three ruling parties and
two main opposition parties in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Irtemcelik said "the nation will remember my stance towards
Ecevit's tendency, which is unacceptable with reference to the
clear provisions of the Constitution and against the will of our
deputies."
</P>
<P>
Disagreeing with the result of the presidential election, he
said he could not maintain his post in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Mesut Yilmaz, leader of the Motherland Party,
said on Saturday that the resignation of Irtemcelik was "nothing
strange," because the minister gave his resignation petition 15
days ago.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said "I told him that it wouldn't be appropriate to put
it into process before getting the result of the presidential
election. As the election ended, he asked me to put his resignation
into process."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the resignation of a state minister from one of
ruling coalition parties might clear the way for Yilmaz to enter
the cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Clark Says He Fell Out With Pentagon: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Former NATO allied Europe commander
Wesley Clark told a Dutch newspaper that he had fallen out with
his Pentagon superiors over the use of ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch evening newspaper NRC Handelsblad on Saturday quoted
the four-star general as saying that he would not deny that the
work of a commander and that of the Pentagon had friction during
the 78-day NATO air strikes against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"I don't deny it. It is the work of a commander to weigh
things up but it is the work of the Pentagon and the political
leaders to control," said Clark who handed over the command of the
NATO Supreme Allied Command Europe to Joseph Ralston on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There will always be friction in this sort of circumstance,"
he told the newspaper during one of his last working days.
</P>
<P>
As NATO air campaign dragged on, Clark wanted the authorities
to consider sending ground troops into the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The American army general said that he was given authorization
to work out contingency plans if the air strikes failed. He
presented the plans for ground invasion to the Pentagon in mid-May
last year.
</P>
<P>
"No one disputed them but I never got approval from the
Pentagon or other NATO member states to begin with real planning
for ground forces. The decision was never taken because Slobodan
Milosevic gave in."
</P>
<P>
Clark said that people could conclude that his superiors in the
Pentagon were not very enthusiastic about beginning a ground war."
But no one within NATO wanted to start a warfare on the ground,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Clark was the first commander to have led the western military
alliance into a fighting war in NATO's 50-year history.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian president-elect Vladimir
Putin said Saturday that his priority after Sunday's inauguration
would be "perfecting the state structure."
</P>
<P>
He told a meeting of the heads of regional election commissions
that he would set forth in a concise form his program for the
country's further development in his message to the Federal
Assembly, the upper house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, he revealed some points of that program: the
improvement of democratic institutions, and the elevation to the
living standards of the "rank-and-file working people," the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The state should honor its social obligations, but instead of
spreading its aid thin it should reach with it the really needy
persons. All the other citizens should be given a maximum of
economic freedom," he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin, who was elected president in the March 26 elections,
will be sworn in Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He again warned against permitting the democratic institutions
to be used by "criminal elements".
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is that they should be used for the good of
society, not in any group or corporate interests," Putin said.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Cubans Demand Elian's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 70,000 Cubans demanded
Saturday, under a persistent rain, the immediate return of raft
boy Elian Gonzalez, who remains detained after more than five
months in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The mass demonstration, carried out in the eastern locality of
Puerto Padre, more than 600 kilometers east of Havana, was
presided over by the first vice president and minister of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces (Defense), Raul Castro.
</P>
<P>
The forceful demand occurs at the moment in which Elian
continues detained in the United States awaiting for the decision
of the Atlanta Court of Appeals about the request of political
asylum for the boy filed by his many-times-removed relatives
residing in Miami.
</P>
<P>
Elian, six years old, has been retained by those relatives
since the day he was rescued from the Atlantic Ocean waters, where
he was floating on an inner tube, after the sinking of a makeshift
raft off the U.S. coast, in which his mother Elizabeth Brotons
drowned.
</P>
<P>
An entering and search federal operation made April 22 released
the child and made possible his meeting with his father Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, his step mother and his seven-month-old baby
brother, who now live in a Wye Plantation residence, in Maryland,
United States, until they can definitively return to their country.
</P>
<P>
The speakers in the open forum also demanded the elimination of
Cuban Adjustment Law, which privileges the residence and assures
employment to Cubans who by any means land on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
Young people, students, and representatives of other sectors of
the population also demanded the suspension of the Helms-Burton
and Torricelli laws, enacted to intensify Washington's economic
blockade against Havana.

infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad
Al-Jaber Al-Sabah condemned in a press statement the Israeli
threats that it will deal Lebanon more cruel and severe blows than
those carried out by its warplanes earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
He wished the international community would stop these attacks
which targeted the Lebanese infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Arab League would come out with a
decision that would help Lebanon and its people.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League is convening an emergency meeting at its
premises in Cairo on Saturday to discuss the Israeli attacks.
</P>
<P>
The continued Israeli aggressions on Lebanon jeopardize the
security and stability in the region and tamper with the
international agreements and conventions, said the Kuwaiti

These raids negatively affect the proceeding of the already

<HEADLINE> U.S., British Planes Bomb Iraq Civilian Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi air defense artillery on
Saturday drove back the U.S. and British warplanes which bombed
civilian and service installations in southern Iraq, an Iraqi
military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA),
the spokesman said that at 11:25 local time (0725 GMT), the U.S.
and British warplanes, in nine formations, flew over the southern
provinces of Basra, Misan, Thi-Qar, Qadissiyah, Wasit, Muthana and
Najaf, and bombed civilian and service installations.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did not say if there were any casualties or
property damage.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi anti-warplane missiles challenged the hostile planes
and forced them to flee back to their bases in Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's flights have brought to 20,869 the total number of
armed sorties of U.S. and British planes from Turkey, Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait since December 1998, when the U.S. and Britain launched
the four-night air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British aircraft use bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
to mount their patrols of the southern no-fly zone which was set up
after the 1991 Gulf War, with the so-called aim of protecting the
region's Shiite Muslims from being attacked by the Iraqi government
troops.
</P>
<P>
A similar no-fly zone was imposed over northern Iraq to protect
the Kurdish community there as claimed.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has never recognized the no-fly zones, which are not
directly covered by any U.N. resolution.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM on Developments in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt was in incessant contact with
Lebanon over the latest escalation of conflicts between Israel and
Lebanon, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa disclosed that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will meet
with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, whose country is the main
power broker in Lebanon, in the coming few days.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a press conference, Moussa affirmed that the Arab
stance towards the Lebanese-Israeli conflict will be always steady.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon is the focal point to
ending the Israeli occupation of Lebanon, he was quoted by Egypt's
Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops should withdraw from all the occupied
Lebanese territories, Moussa noted, adding that until this was
achieved, the Arab stance would not change.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed a joint Egyptian-Saudi-Syrian stand that the
United Nations peace-keeping force should be deployed into south
Lebanon after the Israeli pullout no later than July.
</P>
<P>
The stance was expressed in a joint statement issued after a
meeting earlier this week in Syria between Moussa and his Saudi and
Syrian counterparts, Saud Al-Faisal and Faruk Shareh.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining the security of Lebanese-Israeli borders after the
planned Israeli withdrawal will be the responsibility of the U.N.
force, said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Israel's security could never be secured by violating other
countries' sovereignty, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes bombed two power stations in Lebanon and a
guerrilla ammunition depot early Friday in retaliation for rocket
attacks by Lebanese Hezbollah on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah rocketed northern Israel Thursday afternoon to avenge
the deaths of an 80-year-old woman and her 40-year-old daughter and
Israel's earlier air strikes against the Lebanese civilian targets
which wounded at least 12 Lebanese.

BOGOTA, May 6 (Xinhua) --  Colombia's northwest city
Sabanalarga's Mayor Francisco Holguin and other four persons
kidnapped several days ago, were rescued by the army, military

The troops were directed to the guerrilla checkpoint after the
arrest and then the hostages, including Holguin, his wife, two
relatives and his driver, were released.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Call on People not to Believe in Cults </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
called on residents of Kanungu in Rukungiri District and all the
people of Uganda to reject and stop believing in prophets of
doom-cults who tell lies about the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the remarks after laying a wreath on the mass
grave of the followers of a Ugandan doomsday cult on Saturday,
according to a press release from the President's Office.
</P>
<P>
"The cult leaders who were misleading them using religion were
teaching a message very contrary to the message of the government
of National Resistance Movement which stresses continuity,
development and uplifting of standards," the president was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
A total of 530 believers of the cult, the Movement for
Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, were burnt to death
in Kanungu on March 17. Since then mass graves were discovered in
the properties of the cult leaders, bringing the total number of
death to over 1,000.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said the government will continue to investigate those
 individuals and groups who mislead the population using religion.
</P>
<P>
"The government is going to be more vigilant about religious
groups especially those which preach messages of doom," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the president said, the government did not like to
 interfere in the activities of religious organizations. But now,
something must be done since some of these organizations
interfere with society, for instance, by making people sell their
property, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Drought Affected People in Ethiopia Up to 10.6 Million: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said Saturday that the
number of drought-affected people in the country has come up to
10.6 million, accounting for about one sixth of its population.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia said early this year that over eight million people
were affected by drought that has been prevailing in many parts
of the country  for three years.
</P>
<P>
Teshome Erkineh, a senior official of the Disaster Prevention
and Preparedness Commission (DPPC), said that 2.5 million people,
who are likely to face food shortage earlier, have now been
exposed to drought due to failure of small rainy season crops.
</P>
<P>
The number of drought-affected people in various parts of the
country is likely to increase although it is difficult to know by
now the exact number of victims, Teshome said.
</P>
<P>
The DPPC and international donor organizations have agreed to
launch a detailed study on the situation of drought in May that
will enable to know the exact number of drought-stricken people
in Ethiopia by next June, he said.

HARARE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has made great strides in
the area of education by achieving a literacy rate of 85 percent
which is the highest on the continent, a noted academic said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This was said by director-general of the Scientific and
Industrial Research and Development Center Christopher Chetsanga,
when he was addressing 403 graduate teachers from Belve ere
Technical Teacher Training College in Harare.
</P>
<P>
He also challenged the curricula at the college not only to
gear students for employment, but also to create employment.
</P>
<P>
"The curricula should be derived from the needs, not only from
the schools and industry, but also from the informal sector," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said active participation of employers in designing the
courses was essential to ensure that training programs were
relevant to needed skills.
</P>
<P>
He said in the curriculum design, there was need to be
sensitive to the technological needs of the small scale, medium
as well as large industries.
</P>
<P>
"Greater effort should be exerted on standardization of skills
training so that all technical and vocational colleges can turn
out artisans and teachers with the skills to meet the demands of
the millennium," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Keeps All Options Over Border Conflict With Eritrea: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia will keep all its
options in dealing with its border conflict with Eritrea, Foreign
Minister Seyoum Mesfin said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Seyoum, who came back Friday
night from Algiers proximity talks with Eritrea, said that
Ethiopia has right from beginning to reserve self-defense, but
Ethiopia has opted peaceful settlement to the Ethio-Eritrean
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Noting "Ethiopia has spared no effort to seek peaceful solution
to this crisis," Seyoum accused Eritrea of delaying the peace
process by presenting the side issues at the indirect talks which
was held in Algiers, Algeria, between April 30-May 5.
</P>
<P>
The proximity talks, sponsored by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) , was supposed to discuss and negotiate indirectly on
the technical arrangement, which is part of the OAU package of
peace plan, and has been a major obstacle toward settlement of
Ethio-Eritrea conflict.
</P>
<P>
However, Seyoum said, Eritrean representatives refused to
discuss any substance of the agenda set by the OAU, instead "they
wanted Ethiopia first and foremost as precondition sign a
ceasefire and framework agreement and modalities."
</P>
<P>
Stressing that was a side issue, Seyoum said "Ethiopia made the
position very clearly since July 1999 that Ethiopia is ready to
sign these documents (the framework agreement and modalities),
but not as peace agreement."
</P>
<P>
The proximity talks failed to get any result simply "because
Eritrea wanted them fail", Seyoum said, adding one can not hope
much to see Eritrea changing its current positions.
</P>
<P>
When asked any chance to hold a new round of proximity talks
between Ethiopia and Eritrea before the OAU summit due in July,
Seyoum said that depends on the OAU and facilitators.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the outbreak of Ethio-Eritrean border war, the OAU
has been playing a key role in mediating the regional conflict.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Convert Tanzanian Debt Into Joint Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran intends to convert the
160 million U.S. dollars debt owed by Tanzania into joint ventures
aimed at accelerating the country's economic growth pace.
</P>
<P>
The debt conversion plan is among several plans currently
negotiated by Iranian and Tanzanian officials in a bid to
strengthen the two countries' relations following a visit to Iran
by the Tanzanian former Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation Emanuel Mwambulukutu in January this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian ambassador in Tanzania Seyed Ali Sagheian said in
Dar es Salaam recently that the sectors his country is considering
to form joint ventures with Tanzania include cement factories,
tourism, pulp and paper production, leather processing and
fishery.
</P>
<P>
"During the past 21 years of the existence of the Islamic
Republic of Iran, we have worked closely with Tanzania and we have
noted that there are several economic potentials in Tanzania
which, if utilized, will be of immense benefit to our people," the
envoy observed.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran is ready to extend support to Tanzania to enable
the country register rapid development in the listed sectors.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy that Tanzania and Iran have maintained excellent
diplomatic relations since 1979. We have special regards to the
late Father of the Nation, the late Mwalimu Nyerere for the
support he rendered to Iran during the February Islamic revolution
in 1979," Sagheian noted.
</P>
<P>
He called on Tanzania especially the business community to
visit Iran and explore various sectors which can be identified as
key to closer commercial links between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Negotiator Rules out Resumption of Eilat Negotiations on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, MAY 6 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in
the Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat will not be resumed on Sunday
as was previously agreed on, said a Palestinian senior negotiator.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the "Voice of Palestine" radio on Saturday,
Saeb Erekat, chief Palestinian negotiator in the interim phase,
said U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross is now on a shuttle tour
between the Palestinian and Israeli leadership in a bid to overcome
the obstacles that resurged in the Eilat negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Ross' efforts are aimed at pressing Israel to respect the peace
process and the relevant international resolutions, said Erekat.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, who is also a member in the Palestinian negotiation team
to the final-status talks, said the next steps will be set later,
noting that Ross will be back to the table by mid of this month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy held a string of meetings with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in a bid to
bring the stances of the two sides in final-status issues closer.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have failed to achieve any progress over the last
Israeli redeployment in the West Bank, let alone the thorny final-
status issues such as Jerusalem, borders, Palestinian refugees,
water and settlements.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said the talks have sunk into a dilemma after the Israeli
side presented the map outlining the future borders, which slices
the West Bank into three disconnected parts, a proposal that was
absolutely rejected by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side urged the Israeli side to withdraw to the
June 4, 1967 borders.
</P>
<P>
The Eilat talks were pre-designed to take 10 days in order to
achieve this month a frame-work agreement on the final status and
complete the final stage of the Israeli withdrawal by next month.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects U.S. Warning Over Trial on Iranian Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday rejected the U.S.
warning over the ongoing trial on the 13 Iranian Jews on espionage
charges, stating that Iran's domestic issues would not be
influenced by opinions of foreign officials.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi turned down the
warning of the United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
as "legally unacceptable," the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Albright warned on Thursday that the outcome of the Iranian
trial on the Jews on espionage charges could have international
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
Non-interference in the affairs of other countries is mutual and
the U.S. must also respect this principle, Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
Following two sessions of court hearings, three of the 13
Iranian Jews have confessed to spying for Israel, which Tehran has
refused to recognize and branded as a threat to the Islamic world
and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The 13 Iranian Jews were charged with espionage, acts
endangering national security, collaboration with the Israeli
intelligence service Mossad and leaking information to a foreign
country resulting in damage to the state.
</P>
<P>
Israel has denied that the Iranian Jews were spying for it and
condemned the confession as "coerced."
</P>
<P>
Iranian judicial officials have promised a fair and impartial
trial for the 13 Jews who were arrested in March and April last
year with eight Muslims in Shiraz, Fars province, the center of
Iran's 35,000-strong Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
The West expressed grave concern on the trial after the U.S. and
Israel denied any links between their intelligence services and the
Iranian Jews. But Tehran has rejected any "foreign interference" in
the trial.

The National Association of Software and Service Companies (
NASSCOM) said that new variants of "love bug" virus continued to
hit Indian users though no major damage has been reported during
the day.
</P>
<P>
The virus, which is unleashed when e-mail readers open an
attachment promising "Love Letter For You" and spread through the
address book, first hit computers worldwide Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said though the bug hit some 100,000
computers in the country, only 20,000 -- 25,000 computers were
actually damaged as others did not open the e-mail containing the
bug.
</P>
<P>
They said that some internet service providers were also
affected but managed to clean the systems very fast.
</P>
<P>
The NASSCOM asked businesses with computer network to set up
filters that can screen out e-mails with the incriminating subject
line and file attachment.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Leaders Welcome IRA Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The political leaders in Northern
Ireland Saturday welcomed the Irish Republican Army's announcement
that it was ready to put its weapons "completely and verifiably"
beyond use.
</P>
<P>
Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP) leader John Hume
described the IRA offer as "very positive" and urged a positive
response from all related parties.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is making it very clear that the gun has been taken
out of Irish politics for ever," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The most significant part (of the statement) is that they are
going to put their guns beyond use, and they are going to have
that verified."
</P>
<P>
He added that he would tell Ulster Unionist Party leader David
Trimble that this was what they had been waiting.
</P>
<P>
The IRA offer came shortly after Britain and Ireland, co-
sponsors of the 1998 Good Friday peace deal, announced a new plan
aimed to revive the Northern Ireland peace process, which stalled
after London last February suspended a power-sharing government
between Protestants and Roman Catholics in the British province
over the issue of IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
London's new plan extends the deadline for a handover of IRA
weapons to June 2001 from originally agreed May 22 and allows the
resumption of the power-sharing home rule in Northern Ireland by
May 22 with the IRA's reaffirmation of commitment to disarming.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's Protestant leader Trimble said the IRA offer
to lay aside its weapons appeared to break new ground and "there
were some quite positive elements in it".
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart
Bertie Ahern also welcomed the IRA's statement.
</P>
<P>
In the latest development, Britain and Ireland announced that
former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and former secretary
general of South Africa's African National Congress, Cyril
Ramaphosa, would lead the inspections of the IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The IRA said that it would put its weapons into storage areas
with the supervision by two international statesmen.

Department with the State Environmental Protection Administration
of China (SEPA), listed the bilateral agreements China recently
signed with Canada, Japan and Germany as examples.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Canadian governments have agreed to start a
nature reserve protection project in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, Wang said in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
China has also signed preliminary agreements with the Japanese
and German governments to initiate projects protecting the
environment at areas surrounding the headwaters of the Yellow
River, said the director.
</P>
<P>
The river, China's second longest, is notorious for its muddy
water in flood seasons, as its upper and middle reaches repeatedly
suffer serious losses of water and soil caused by massive
deforestation over the past several centuries.
</P>
<P>
In an agreement China signed with the United States last month,
the U.S. will offer 13.44 million U.S. dollars in preferential
loans to China so that China can buy air quality monitoring
equipment from the American company Dasibi Environmental
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The deal says that 33 major Chinese cities will use the
equipment to make daily reports and forecasts of their air quality.
</P>
<P>
Wang said China and Norway are expected to reach an agreement
soon on a joint research project for acid rain prevention and
control.

<HEADLINE> China Hails Progress in Int'l Cooperation in Environmental Protection (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past four years, China has absorbed about 4 billion U.S.
dollars-worth of foreign funding needed for some of the country's
1,591 environmental protection projects, which are the first batch
of projects in the 15-year environment protection program launched
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The program targets the country's widespread water and air
pollution and rising mountains of solid waste.
</P>
<P>
The elimination of water pollution, the emission of sulfur
dioxide and emission of auto exhaust in urban areas, along with
the creation of an environment data system have been priorities in
China's work with other countries and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
"China will continue to promote the cooperation in
environmental protection with individual countries and
international groups while improving non-governmental cooperation
to facilitate its national environmental protection," Wang added.
</P>
<P>
Successful environmental protection work in China, an
influential country with a population of 1.2 billion, would be an
important contribution not only to the country itself but also to
neighboring countries and the rest of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral and multilateral areas, Wang said China is working
to sign agreements on environmental protection with some
individual countries in South America and Africa.
</P>
<P>
China also wants to actively participate in multilateral
environmental protection cooperation by improving its own
environmental protection policies and complying with international
conventions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said SEPA aims to secure more overseas funding and
technology for China's projects involving pollution control,
environmental protection infrastructure and ecological protection.

KUWAIT CITY, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Fund for Economic and

in the first stage of a bid to support private sector projects in
the Arab world, said the fund chief.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the fourth meeting of the Arab Business Forum which

al-Hamad said the step marks an implementation of the amendments
which have been added to the statutory bill of the fund.

<P>
Hamad underlined the importance of encouraging the private
sector so that it can assume a principal role in the production and
export.
</P>
<P>
The process would be carried out along with the increase of
finance needed for the large investments in order to develop the
services sector whose privatization is almost sought by most of the
Arab states, according to Hamad.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from Zambia, Rwanda and

aimed at creating a north-south corridor for the Great lakes
countries.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Communications and Transport Minister Nkandu Luo
presided over the meeting and Rwandan Public Works, Transport and
Communications Minister Dieu Ntiruhungwa and Ugandan Works
Minister Andruale Awuzu attended the meeting. Burundi did not send
its minister to the meeting but indicated that it supports the
project.
</P>
<P>
The ministers took note of the fact that in order to promote
trade and other interactions with central and southern Africa,
Burundian and Rwandan governments formally requested South African
government to assist in the development of a through transport
network to connect them to the southern African railway network.
</P>
<P>
Following the request the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) carried out initial exploratory work on
the Great Lakes region and produced a discussion document.

<P>
The document proposes setting up an integrated transport
network to provide the required linkage and foster socio-economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The linkage may consist of a combination of rail and lake
transport infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed that the COMESA secretariat will continue to
 facilitate the activities leading to the successful
implementation of the project.

<P>
PARIS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The stewards and hostesses of air
France went on strike for a second day on Saturday, disturbing
nearly half of the flights of the air company.
</P>
<P>
Two leading trade unions of the air company, the National
Syndicate of the Commercial Flight Personnel and the Union of
Flight Crew of Civil Aviation, said that more than 90 percent of
the stewards and hostesses followed the order of strike of the
unions.
</P>
<P>
However, Air France said that it still kept the schedule of 60
percent of its flights on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The unions said that the supplementary days of rest and pay
compensations for the reduction of work time which resulted from
the 35 hour work week law are not sufficient.
</P>
<P>
All the Air France flights will return to normal on Sunday,
said the unions.

last year, will be worse than that in 1984, which was recorded as

SHANGHAI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's seven-day Labor Day holiday
has not only coaxed tourists to the country's prime scenic spots,
it has also tempted many travelers with the pleasures of shopping
in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing Road, a commercial center in the east China
municipality with boutiques and department stores lining both
sides of the street, has seen an endless flow of customers.
</P>
<P>
A shopper surnamed Zhao, together with his wife and daughter,
had originally planned to stop briefly in Shanghai on their way to
Putuo Mountain in east China's Zhejiang Province. But one look at
the bustling shops prompted them to stay overnight to take
advantage of all the sales.
</P>
<P>
"The last time I came to Shanghai was in 1992, and great
changes have taken place in the city in the past eight years.
There are more quality and brand products and the service here has
improved a lot," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Isetan, Parkson, Pacific, and Hualian shopping plazas on anther
commercial street, Huaihai Road, have experienced 25 percent
increases in trade volume in the first three days of the holiday,
according to store officials.
</P>
<P>
To make the biggest profits possible during the week-long
holiday, many Shanghai department stores have cooperated with
travel agencies to create TV and newspaper advertising that would
attract more people to the city.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Auctioneers Upbeat on Coming Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's leading auction house is
eager to start the bidding for its large spring auction May 7-9,
after learning of the pre-auction excitement from collectors
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Kou Qin, vice president of China Guardian Auctions Co., Ltd.,
said that while most of the customers at the sale will be seasoned
buyers who have attended many of the company's past sales, many
new faces are expected to appear as the antiques market is
regaining its popularity among international collectors.
</P>
<P>
Guardian will bring many treasured antiques to the auction
block, including a six-volume set of rare books with the foreword
written by Emperor Qianlong (1736-1795), with bidding set to open
at one million yuan (about 120,500 U.S. dollars), and the only
existing copy of an ancient medical book which dates back to the
Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279).
</P>
<P>
Among other precious lots are a landscape painted by well-known
contemporary artist Li Keran, and an abstract oil painting by Zhao
Wuji.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an extremely rare blue and white "double dragon"
vase from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and a large vase decorated
with 100 deer are expected to fetch up to four million yuan and
800,000 yuan respectively.
</P>
<P>
Also for sale will be a 10.06-carat diamond with an opening bid
of between 1.8 and 2 million yuan; such a jewel has never been
available before at a Chinese auction.
</P>
<P>
After a three-year slump in the international antiques
collection market, Guardian set a sales record in China of 67.5
million yuan at its autumn auctions last year, surprising most of
the company's auctioneers.
</P>
<P>
"We worked to cultivate the market and now have seen the first
rays of hope," Kou said.
</P>
<P>
To further promote the collection of Chinese art and antiques,
Guardian cooperated with Cable &AMP; Wireless HK Telecom (CWHKT) and
Soft Bank China Venture Capital (SBCVC) to set up a comprehensive
auction website, www.guaweb.com.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformists Win Runoff Election for Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Despite intensified crackdown
orchestrated by the powerful conservatives, the reformist allies of
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami won a definite victory in the
second round of the parliamentary elections held on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the final result announced by the Interior
Ministry, the reformist alliance May 23 Front bagged 44 seats out
of the total 66 seats in 52 constituencies while the conservatives
and the independents took 11 respectively, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
About 224 seats were decided in the first round of the sixth
parliamentary election on February 18, with reformers allied to
President Mohammed Khatami bagging more than 75 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
The new Majlis (parliament) has a total of 290 seats. As
stipulated by the election law, those candidates who did not get
the minimum 25 percent of votes went to the second round.
</P>
<P>
The runoff election, held on Friday with a massive turnout, only
strengthened the overwhelming victory of the reformists in the
first-round election.
</P>
<P>
The overall results show that the reformists will absolutely
control the 290-seat sixth Majlis (parliament), which is expected
to convene on May 28.
</P>
<P>
The reformist Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF) said in a
statement,"This is a clear message to all those people who in the
recent months have been resorting to illegal means and seemingly
legal pretexts to defeat this promising movement (reform)."
</P>
<P>
The party called on all the people to accept the vote results so
as to realize the reformist programs of President Khatami under
national unity and calm and within the law.
</P>
<P>
"The fateful presence of the noble Iranian people in the runoffs
once again proved that the process of reform is irreversible and
will go on despite the intolerable pressures and obstructions,"
said the IIPF headed by Mohammad Reza Khatami, young brother of the
president.
</P>
<P>
The powerful conservatives, who suffered a humiliating defeat in
the first round of the parliamentary elections on February 18,
stepped up their grips on the regime by launching unprecedented
crackdown on the reformists in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The conservative-dominated Guardians Council has nullified the
results in 12 constituencies of the first-round elections,
depriving nine reformists of their eligibility and forcing some
others to the runoffs.
</P>
<P>
The conservative-controlled judiciary also jailed a number of
reformist activities and closed reformist publications in recent
weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANG MAI, Thailand, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers of
the ASEAN, China, Japan and South Korea agreed here Saturday on a
bilateral currency swap to strengthen regional capacity to counter
future financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"In order to strengthen our self-help and support mechanism in
East Asia through the ASEAN+3 framework, we recognize a need to
establish a regional financing arrangement to supplement the
existing international facilities," said the joint ministerial
statement of the meeting issued at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held on the sidelines of the 33rd Annual
Meeting of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
"As a start, we agreed to strengthen the existing cooperative
frameworks among our monetary authorities through the 'Chiang Mai
Initiative,'" said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The initiative involves an expanded ASEAN Swap Arrangement and
a network of bilateral swap and repurchase agreement facilities
among ASEAN countries, China, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
To further sustain the stronger-than-expected recovery in the
region, the ministers agreed to strengthen their policy dialogues
and regional cooperation activities in the areas of capital flows
monitoring, self-help and support mechanism and international
reforms.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to use the ASEAN+3 framework to facilitate the
exchange of consistent and timely data and information on capital
flows.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Secretariat was requested to lead and coordinate a
study on other appropriate mechanisms that could enhance the group
's ability to provide sufficient and timely financial support to
ensure financial stability in the East Asian region.
</P>
<P>
An analyst said the Chiang Mai Initiative symbolizes that the
regional economic and financial cooperation has entered a new
stage.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also welcomed the stronger-than-expected recovery
of the member economies and agreed to further sustain economic
growth and strengthen policy dialogues and regional cooperation
activities, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
At the second informal meeting of the ASEAN+3 held in December
1998 in Hanoi, Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao proposed to hold a
meeting of the ASEAN+3 finance and central bank deputies.
</P>
<P>
At the third informal meeting of the ASEAN+3 leaders held in
Manila last November, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji suggested that
the meeting be institutionalized to discuss issues concerning the
regional economic and financial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that an ASEAN+3 finance ministers' meeting be
held consequently as appropriate.
</P>
<P>
The proposal received positive responses from the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Japan and Korea.
</P>
<P>
It was against this background that the ASEAN+3 finance
ministers' meeting was convened.

<HEADLINE> AFTA Pact Boosts Intra-Regional Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN Free Trade Area AFTA)
agreement has played a key role in boosting intra-regional trade
in Southeast Asia since it took first step in 1993, Thai Commerce
Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
The original six members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand -- are now selling more products to each
other, Thai Commerce Ministry officials were quoted by the Bangkok
Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The six original ASEAN member states began in 1993 by reducing
import duties on 15 groups of products and have since steadily
increased the number each year.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the ASEAN Free Trade Area had
encouraged a division of labor within the region. As a result,
parts of specific products were manufactured in different
countries and then assembled in one country to cut production
costs.
</P>
<P>
The next challenge for ASEAN will be to broaden its free-trade
net to create a larger and more attractive market, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN aims to create a full free-trade region with tariffs of
zero to 5% on all goods except the most sensitive farm products by
Jan 1,2003.
</P>
<P>
However, ASEAN's four new members -- Burma, Cambodia, Laos and
Vietnam -- have been permitted to meet all AFTA requirements until
2005.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN member nations have begun talks about accepting Australia
and New Zealand in their Closer Economic Relations trade agreement
by 2010, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Reaffirms Acceptance of OAU Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea has re-affirmed its
acceptance of the three peace documents initiated by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) after six-day peace talks
with Ethiopia in the Algerian capital Algiers, Eritrean Foreign
Ministry said in a press release available here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The release from the Foreign Ministry on Friday said that
Eritrea's Foreign Minister Haile Weldensae reiterated Eritrea's
readiness to sign the documents, the Framework Agreement, the
Modalities of Implementation and the Technical Arrangement, at
the talks which ended on May 5, without success..
</P>
<P>
Eritrean Foreign Ministry said Eritrea also affirmed its
acceptance of immediate cease-fire which the OAU documents call
for as a first step.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, Ethiopia has categorically refused to sign the
Framework Agreement and the Modalities. It also rejected an
immediate cease-fire. This Ethiopian position was communicated to
Eritrea by the OAU special envoy, Ahmed Ouyahia," the release
said.
</P>
<P>
The release added that "Ethiopia refusal to sign the OAU peace
documents and a cease-fire agreement is only proof of its desire
to go to war at a time when millions of people are facing
starvation."
</P>
<P>
The border conflict between the two Horn of African nations
erupted in May 1998 and so far has cost thousands of lives on
both sides.

<HEADLINE> Foot-and-Mouth Disease Spreads in Southeastern Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A deadly disease affecting
livestock has spread around in a southeastern province in Mongolia
and a one-week battle seems fruitless up till now to curb more
outbreaks, a Mongolian governmental committee said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
About 17,700 animals, mostly cattle, are found infected with
the foot-and-mouth disease, 160 of them dead, in the province of
Dornogovi Aymag, the special committee confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The disease is of the type "A-010-0", according to an analysis
based in Russia, said the committee.
</P>
<P>
The foot-and-mouth disease is highly contagious and fatal to
cloven-hoofed animals such as cows and pigs but cannot be
transmitted to humans.
</P>
<P>
When the outbreaks were firstly confirmed in Dornogovi Aymag on
May 1, the provincial administration immediately announced a
quarantine for the whole province, banning all animals, people and
vehicles, except international express, from passing through.
</P>
<P>
More outbreaks occurred afterwards in that area. Mongolian
authorities then announced an alert in neighboring areas.
</P>
<P>
Dead and diseased animals are being destroyed and inoculation
of livestock has been ordered within that area, the committee said.
However, for lack of medicament, it is feared that the disease
might keep spreading despite efforts to contain it.

<HEADLINE> IRA Presents New Offer on Arms Decommissioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA) said
Saturday that it is ready to begin a process that would "
completely and verifiably put its weapons beyond use."
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued in response to new proposals from the
British and Irish governments designed to break the deadlock in
the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
The blueprint envisages a return to power-sharing in the
province within 16 days, although it hinges on a firm commitment
to weapons decommissioning by paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the republican organization also said it will
resume contacts with the independent decommissioning body, broken
off after Northern Ireland's political institutions were suspended
in February.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made following Northern Ireland Secretary
Peter Mandelson's announcement that the government no longer
expects the IRA to decommission by May 22 as stated in the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, the IRA has not promised to destroy weapons as
unionists have demanded, and have only said that their arms dumps
can be inspected by third parties who will report to the
decommissioning body.
</P>
<P>
The IRA also said the process of putting weapons "beyond use "
will be done in such a way as "to avoid risk to the public and
misappropriation by others", adding that it will seek to ensure "
maximum public confidence."
</P>
<P>
British Prime Ministers Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart
Bertie Ahern said Friday that the plan for progress has been
drawn up after intense negotiations with the Northern Ireland
parties this week.
</P>
<P>
It sets out a timetable for the implementation of the other
outstanding elements of the Good Friday Agreement by June 2001.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Further Develop Petrochemical Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar
Zanganeh said here on Saturday that Iran would continue to make
great efforts in developing the country's petrochemical industry in
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's third five-year development plan (2000-
2005), Iran will invest around 7.5 billion U.S. dollars in
petrochemical industry to raise its annual production to about 30
million tons, Zanganeh said at the opening session of a
petrochemical forum titled "Petrochemical Industry in the New
Millennium."
</P>
<P>
To this end, the Oil Ministry is willing to enter into joint
investment schemes for constructing petroleum-related projects
including refineries and petrochemical facilities, the minister
told the gathering, which was attended by representatives from
regional countries.
</P>
<P>
He said considerable legal facilities have also been earmarked
for the petrochemical sector, which is the cornerstone of the
country's industrial development because of its comparative and
competitive advantages.
</P>
<P>
The annual production capacity of the petrochemical industry
registered a three-fold growth to 15 million tons in the past
decade, during which two five-year plans were implemented, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, the share of petrochemicals in the country's
gross domestic product (GDP) and non-oil exports increased to 0.75
percent and 19 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh also called for strengthening regional cooperation in
such fields as joint investment and marketing as well as forming
regional consultative and contracting companies in petrochemical
industry.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Suez Canal revenues Up in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Information and Decision
Support Center (idsc) has said the Suez Canal revenues surged to
152.4 million U.S. dollars in march from 145 million in february.
</P>
<P>
However, it decreased compared to 153.4 million dollars in the
same month year the center was quoted by Middle East News Agency
(MENA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The center said in a report that the number of vessels shuttling
through the international waterway rose to 1,088 in march from 1,
053 vessels in february, including 171 oil tankers and 917 general
cargo vessels.
</P>
<P>
up to 1,150 vessels crossed the canal in march last year,
including 165 oil tankers and 985 general cargo vessels.
</P>
<P>
The 110-kilometer Suez Canal, which earns about 2 billion
dollars each year, is one of the main sources of hard currency for
Egypt, along with remittances from expatriates, tourism and oil
export.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government has been planning to expand the Canal to
enable ships with a draft of up to 62 feet (18.9 meters) to sail
through the waterway by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) announced in 1999 that the canal
will further be able to accept ships with a draft of 66 feet (20.12
meters) by 2005 and 72 feet (21.95 meters) by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The improvements of the lock-free canal will enable it to take
giant oil tankers of up to 360,000 tons, now the largest tanker
weight in the world.

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf Soon to Present Demands for Hostages Release, PNA Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine government negotiator
said Saturday that he may soon receive formal demands for the
release of 21 hostages from the Abu Sayyaf group.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine News Agency (PNA), Nur Misuari,
governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao, said that he
expects to receive the formal set of demands from the rebels
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Misuari was appointed by President Joseph Estrada as the
government's chief negotiator for the kidnap drama, which lasted
for almost two weeks now without a single demand made known so far.
</P>
<P>
The PNA said that Misuari's emissaries Saturday sent for the
third time medicines and assorted foodstuffs to the 21 hostages
being held by Abu Sayyaf members in the mountains of Sulu Province.
</P>
<P>
This developed as Misuari's emissaries have been able to re-
establish contact with the rebel group since the latter broke out
of a military cordon Tuesday, it said.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Malaysian officials Friday, Misuari and
Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Angelo Reyes assured the
respective governments of the hostages that all peaceful efforts
shall be exhausted for the safe release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Among the hostages are 10 Malaysians, two French, two Finns,
three Germans, two South Africans, one Lebanese and one Filipino.
They were seized on April 23 from the Malaysian resort island of
Sipadan and moved to Sulu, the Southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"I don't consider this a difficult task," Misuari said,
referring to the negotiation.
</P>
<P>
He said he has organized his negotiating team during a meeting
with several of his trusted men Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
"I will proceed to Jolo (Sulu) as soon as the plan we have
drawn will be laid in place," he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to elaborate as operational matters are
allegedly involved in the process.
</P>
<P>
Misuari said he will transmit the kidnappers' demands to
President Estrada as soon as "these are made available."
</P>
<P>
He denied reports that the kidnappings in Basilan and Jolo are
linked to the on-going hostilities in Central Mindanao, where
government troops and Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebels have
been engaged in a week-long fighting.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan, Rwandan Clashes Ceased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Ding Qilin, Wang Shangzhi
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The clashes between Ugandan and
Rwandan forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have
ceased, a Ugandan Army Commander told Xinhua Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The fighting has stopped. I have no latest information right
now," said Jeje Odongo, army commander of the Uganda Peoples'
Defence Forces (UPDF). The one day clashes killed at least seven
civilians and wounded nine others.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan commander accused that it is the Rwandans that shot
first, adding that the United National Observer team, MONUC, is
too far away to notice who actually shot the first bullet. U.N.
observers in the DRC blamed on Friday that the fighting was
initiated by the Ugandan forces there.
</P>
<P>
An official statement of Uganda issued Friday also blamed
Rwanda for starting the fighting, saying that the Ugandan forces
(UPDF) were in defensive positions.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA) units
deployed in Kisangani, the third largest city in the DRC, fired at
UPDF forces which were withdrawing from Simi Simi airport at
Kisangani at 4:05 a.m. (local time) Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rwandan Information Office said in a statement that
the Ugandan forces sparked the clashes by shelling the RPA' s
positions.
</P>
<P>
"The shelling was sustained through out the day," it said,
adding the RPA was instructed not to return the fire.
</P>
<P>
UN delegation to the DRC said Friday's fighting was a direct
violation of the Lusaka Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
"The delegation demands that these latest hostilities cease
immediately and that those involved in the fighting at Kisangani
reaffirm their commitment to the Lusaka peace process," the
delegation said.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has requested Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his
Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame to meet on the clashes on May 14,
according to authority sources of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The clashes occurred almost nine months since the last bloody
fighting between Ugandan and Rwandan armies which left about 300
people dead.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Leases Harbor Terminal to Private Operators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Zhang Dacheng
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian government has
leased its container terminal at Dar es Salaam Harbor to a
consortium of two international companies and a local company in a
bid to boost incomes.
</P>
<P>
According to a divestiture agreement signed here Friday by the
Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform Commission (PSRC) and the
consortium, the Tanzania Harbors Authority (THA) will get an
annual lease fee of 3,68 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
THA will also get from the operators a royalty amounting to 13
dollars for each container passing through the container terminal,
THA sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, THA as a landlord will collect wharfage directly
based on the number of ships that call at the container terminal,
which is estimated to be about 10 million dollars during the first
year of operation.
</P>
<P>
The three companies are the International Container Terminal
Service Inc. , the ICTSI International Holdings Corporation of
Manila Philippines, and the Vertex Financial Services Limited of
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
THA expected an improvement in efficiency and aggressive
marketing and promotion by the private operators would increase
the number of containers handled from the present 100,000 units a
year to more than 200,000 units during the tenth year of
operation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement said the private operator would take over and
employ almost all employees now working in the container terminal
under new terms of employment.
</P>
<P>
"In this transaction the government has only privatized the
operation of the container terminal while the ownership of the
terminal itself remains with the government and the THA will play
the role of the landlord," PSRC Acting Chairman Kavishe said.
</P>
<P>
The private operators expected that the Dar es Salaam terminal
as the first to be privatized on the East Africa coastline to
develop a highly efficient maritime gateway to meet the need of
importers and exporters from Tanzania and its landlocked central
African neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Signs Long-delayed Budget Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
on Friday signed into law a 598 billion naira (5.98 billion U.S.
dollars) year 2000 budget, ending a prolonged dispute with the
country's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
The approved budget amount is about 800 million dollar shorter
than that passed by the National Assembly two months ago,
reported This Day, a leading Nigerian newspaper on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The budget was guided by a rule that the total expenditure must
not exceed a deficit limit of 2.5 percent of the federal
government's income, said Obasanjo at Friday evening's signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
That's why he could not endorse the augmentation by the
National Assembly, said the president.
</P>
<P>
However,the National Assembly also passed a resolution earlier
in the day, requiring the two branches of the government to
jointly review the augmentation, and present relevant
supplementary appropriation bill within 14 days.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo submitted the budget bill last November, which was
approved by the National Assembly on March with significant
spending increase.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo had since refused to endorse the increase, which,
according to some critics, will go to the benefit of the West
African country's top legislature in one way or another.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged conflict over the budget has worsened ties
between the two branches of the government and taken toll of the
much needed economic growth in the impoverished country.

<HEADLINE> Rawlings Laments West Discrimination Against Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's President Jerry Rawlings
Friday expressed anger at what he perceived as rampant
discrimination against Africa by the Western world when it comes
to helping the continent consolidate peace and security for the
development.
</P>
<P>
He dropped the blame as reacting to recent developments in
Sierra Leone where former rebels have killed seven UN
peacekeepers and taken dozens hostage, according to the Ghana
News Agency on Saturday
</P>
<P>
He blamed the situation on the failure of the International
Community to keenly support efforts by the West African leaders
to achieve a lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings said it is painful that the the gains brought about in
Sierra Leone through hard work and sacrifice of the people in the
sub-region, are beginning to suffer reverses.
</P>
<P>
For him, "those big Western countries" who waste no time in
dissipating huge resources on wars in countries elsewhere,
should turn their words into deeds to assist the West Africa in
their efforts to block out some of the antecedents that led to
the current upheaval in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
He called for the immediate reinforcement of the UN forces in
Sierra Leone and urged the UN Security Council to take bold steps
to consolidate peace in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
He further called for collective efforts to get the message
across that Africa, which he described as "the cradle of
humanity," is not getting the needed help from the world.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings blamed the poor attention to Africa's problem partly
to negative reports by the western media about leaders in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of criticising objectively and paying compliments
where it is due, they always want the outside world to believe
that African governments never do right," said the president.
</P>
<P>
On issues at home, the Ghanaian President gave the assurance
that this year's general elections in his country will be free
and fair, adding that, the door is open to genuine international
organizations wishing to observe the polls.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Launches Global Children's Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Former South African President
Nelson Mandela, together with child rights champion Graca Machel,
on Saturday launched a new global partnership for children and
pledged to play a direct and personal role in urging other leaders
to join.
</P>
<P>
With UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) Executive
Director Carol Bellamy by their side, Mandela and Machel
announced plans to build a partnership of global leaders who
would be at the vanguard of a "bold new movement to turn the world
around for millions of children".
</P>
<P>
"Over the next few months we will be personally calling upon
leaders from all sectors to work with us to find solutions to the
major problems faced by children and adolescents," Mandela said at
a ceremony at the Afrika Cultural Center in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
"We are not seeking and will not accept vague promises,"
Mandela said. " Our purpose is to get specific commitments from
these leaders and specific results. We will challenge enlightened
government leaders to join us and turn their words into deeds. We
will ask innovators in the business world to put their unique
abilities to work for children. We will call upon leaders in
academia, the media, and other sectors to join with us to ensure
that the world honors its obligation to children."
</P>
<P>
Machel, author of a landmark UN study on children in conflict
and wife of Mandela, called for efforts to tackle the effects of
armed conflict on children and take action to protect children
from violations of their rights in conflict.
</P>
<P>
According to UNICEF, tens of millions of children are lost
within a vortex of poverty, preventable disease, armed conflict
and discrimination that deprives them of their right to basic
health and education.
</P>
<P>
"Protecting children from conflict, defeating preventable
diseases like HIV/AIDS, and dispelling poverty and discrimination
are the challenges we face," Machel said. "We want a world in
which children survive and develop in a caring environment free of
abuse and exploitation, a world that offers every child a quality
basic education, and a world in which adolescents are no longer
invisible but in which they are invited, instead, to participate
in shaping their own futures."
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said the involvement of Mandela and Machel would a
source of inspiration to other leaders. "Together they have the
power to pull people from a wide range of backgrounds; people who
are willing to push beyond the traditional boundaries of what
societies do for children," she said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the promises made in 1990s to solve all the problems
had failed largely because of a lack of leadership, she said.
</P>
<P>
"With this initiative our ambition is to inspire and renew
that leadership, and to get concrete, actionable commitments from
a class of people who have the personal and professional resources
to deliver," Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
She said the advanced communication technologies offer them an
 unprecedented opportunity to reach children and their families,
and place knowledge and power in their hands.
</P>
<P>
Leaders in technology and communication industries would be
among the first to be approached by UNICEF, Mandela and Machel,
according to Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and Machel insisted that, with committed leadership,
major advancements for children could be made within a single
generation, adding that such advancements are the right of every
child.
</P>
<P>
Children are the nucleus of sustainable human development,
there is no doubt about that," Machel asserted.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Renew Call on Israel to Implement U.N. Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian leadership has
reiterated its call on Israel to implement relevant U.N.
resolutions related to solving the Palestinian issue, the
Palestinian news agency WAFA reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This came in a statement issued at the end of a weekly meeting
held on Friday evening in the West Bank City of Ramallah, which was
chaired by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and attended by Speaker
of the Palestinian Council Ahmed Qurei, members of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) executive committee and the
Palestinian cabinet.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Palestinian leadership "categorically
rejects all Israeli attempts aimed at jumping over the
international resolutions and the signed agreements, and we renew
our call for the honest and accurate implementation of the signed
accords so as to reach a just and comprehensive peace based on
these resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership has asserted many times that it
attributed no breakthrough in the three previous rounds of Israeli-
Palestinian talks to Israel's non-compliance with the relevant U.N.
resolutions, particularly U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338 which were
approved by the 1993 Oslo accord and the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum
signed last September, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the third round of final-status talks between
Israel and the Palestinians in Israel's southern resort city of
Eilat, a profound crisis emerged over all issues concerning the
framework agreement on the final peace treaty and the third stage
of redeployment "due to Israel's rejection to carry out resolutions
of international legitimacy," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Eilat round of final-status talks started on April 30 in the
context of the marathon talks launched since last March in
Washington to discuss the last phase of Israeli pullout from the
West Bank and the final-status issues, including the status of
Jerusalem, demarcation of borders, water sharing, refugees and the
fate of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are racing against time in
hammering out a framework agreement on final peace by May, with a
final peace treaty expected for September.

<HEADLINE> Omani Companies to Hold Products Fair in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 30 Omani companies are expected
to hold a products fair in the Iraqi capital Baghdad next Tuesday,
the first of its kind since the U.N. sanctions were imposed on Iraq
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Omani companies will display products of food, medicine,
leather, detergent, perfume and electricity, according to a source
in the Iraqi trade ministry.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first Omani products fair to be held in Iraq
since 1990, and is expected to further strengthen the bilateral
relations, especially trade ties, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been improving in
recent years. Oman, one of the six member states of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC), has reopened its embassy in Baghdad,
which was closed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Omani companies have signed contracts worth 33 million U.S.
dollars with Iraq under the U.N. oil-for-food program, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. oil-for-food deal, which began to be implemented in
1996, allows Iraq to sell a certain amount of oil in every six
months to buy food, medicine and other necessities to help offset
the effects of the stringent U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
A total of six phases of the U.N. humanitarian program has been
implemented and the seventh phase will end in June this year.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformists Claim Victory in Parliamentary Runoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Despite of the intensified
conservatives-orchestrated crackdown on reformists, the Iranian
reformists claimed an overwhelming victory in Friday's second round
of parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Candidates of the reformist "May 23 Front" have bagged over 80
percent of the total votes cast in the runoffs, the reformist
Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF) stated on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a clear message to all those people who in the recent
months have been resorting to illegal means and seemingly legal
pretexts to defeat this promising movement (reform)," the IIPF said
in a statement quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).
</P>
<P>
The party called on all the people to accept the vote results in
order to realize the pure ideals of the Islamic revolution and
implement the reform programs initiated by President Mohammad
Khatami under national unity and calm and within the law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IRNA quoted informed sources as saying that the
reformists won 46 out of the total 66 seats in the runoffs held in
52 constituencies in 22 provinces, while the remaining 20 seats
have gone to the conservatives and independents.
</P>
<P>
The process of reforms is irreversible and will go on in spite
of the pressures and obstructions by the conservatives, said the
IIPF headed by Mohammad Reza Khatami, the younger brother of
moderate President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The powerful conservatives, who suffered a humiliating defeat in
the first round of the parliamentary elections on February 18,
stepped up their grips on the regime by launching unprecedented
crackdown on the reformists in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives-dominated Guardians Council has nullified the
results of 12 constituencies of the first round elections,
depriving nine reformists of their eligibility and forcing some
others to the runoffs.
</P>
<P>
It has yet to confirm the result of the Tehran constituency, the
biggest and most important one in which reformists won 29 out of
the total 30 seats.
</P>
<P>
The conservative judiciary closed down almost all the reformist
mouthpieces, depriving the reformist allies of President Khatami of
a voice in the runoff campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Banking System Stable: Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Saturday that the Philippine banking system remains one of
the most stable in Asia and the economy is on track toward the
path of solid growth.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio-TV program here, Estrada said his
administration continues to take steps to make the banking sector
benefit the people.
</P>
<P>
"To stop all speculations, I would like to assure you that our
economy remains stable. We have survived the Asian crisis, and my
administration continues to keep the economy strong and growing,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In the same program, Justice Secretary Artemio Tuquero said his
department has expanded the task force that will investigate the
Urban Bank case.
</P>
<P>
The task force was created by Estrada earlier this week to look
into the cause of the collapse of Urban Bank, which banking
officials maintained is an isolated case.
</P>
<P>
"We instructed our prosecutors to finish the investigation in
45 days. And we are monitoring these cases," he said.
</P>
<P>
Urban Bank declared a bank holiday on April 27, prompting the
Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. to take over its operations
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
During the program, Central Bank Governor Rafael Buenaventura
also assured the public that the Philippine banking industry is
one of the healthiest in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said the banking sector's non-performing or bad loans
reached only 14 percent at the height of the Asian financial
crisis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
During the crisis, Buenaventura said, bad loans in Indonesia
reached 75 percent while those in Thailand amounted to 45 percent.

<HEADLINE> 5 Killed in Bomb Blasts in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Two bombs exploded inside two
passenger buses in the Caraga region, the southern Philippines,
Saturday afternoon, killing five people and seriously wounding 18
others,according to the Philippine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that police authorities in Camp Alagar and in
the Caraga region are now closely investigating both incidents.
</P>
<P>
A flash report received by the police in Camp Alagar showed
that at about 12:15 (04:15 GMT), a bomb exploded inside an LCI
passenger bus as it approached the bus terminal in Surigao City,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Five passengers -- three women, a man and a child -- were
killed on the spot while six others were wounded, it said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said another bomb exploded inside an Ilema Bus en
route from Surigao City to Butuan City at about 14:00 (08:00 GMT),
when it approached Dalipdipan Bridge in Butuan City.
</P>
<P>
At least 12 passengers were wounded in the Ilema bus bombing
but there was no initial report of casualties, it said.
</P>
<P>
Investigators believed that the suspects in the LCI bus bombing
are the same as those who planted the bomb inside the ILema Bus,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report by the local ABS-CBN television said four
people were killed and more than 100 wounded in the bombings in
the Caraga region.

<HEADLINE> Target Date Set for Returning of Northern Irish Home-Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The British and Irish governments
announced on late Friday that a Protestant-Roman Catholic power-
sharing government would take office in Northern Ireland on May 22
if parties and rival guerrilla groups signed up to a new formula.
</P>
<P>
A deal hammered out by the British and Irish governments also
proposes moving the deadline for paramilitary decommissioning to
resolve the Northern Ireland impasse.
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposals, the target-date for decommissioning
would be moved from the May 22 deadline to June 2001.
</P>
<P>
And the International Commission for dealing with the arms
decommissioning would be told it could develop possible new
methods for dealing with the issue.
</P>
<P>
A response from the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to the British
and Irish governments' joint statement is expected within hours.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that its statement will signal a willingness to
restart contacts with the decommissioning body and to address the
subject of putting down weapons completely and verifiably.
</P>
<P>
British and Irish Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern
made the announcement of their latest initiative to try to put the
stalled peace process back on the rails on Friday night at
Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic announcement came after intensive talks at
Hillsborough Castle between the two prime ministers, the Ulster
Unionists, Sinn Fein and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (
SDLP).
</P>
<P>
Blair said the deal depended on a positive response from the
parties and the paramilitary organizations.
</P>
<P>
"It's now incumbent on the parties and, perhaps, in particular
the paramilitary organizations to give their response to the
proposals we have made," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I very much hope that response is positive and, in particular,
we can make sure that the arms issue is dealt with completely and
verifiably.
</P>
<P>
"So we are going to await the response of the parties and the
paramilitary organizations and subject to that positive response
we will be reinstating the institutions."
</P>
<P>
Ahern said he was very hopeful of a positive response from the
IRA and the loyalist paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
"I'll be very disappointed if the response from the
paramilitaries is not extremely positive," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that a deadline of June next year has been set
for the full implementation of all the provisions of the Good
Friday Agreement signed on April 10, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement of the prime ministers was initially
welcomed by Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a very decisive moment, the two governments
have agreed to reestablish the institutions and have set out the
mechanisms and the steps necessary for achieving the full
implementation of many of the outstanding aspects of the accord,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
SLDP leader John Hume also welcomed the commitment to restore
the institutions and to implement all aspects of the agreement by
"a particular date."
</P>
<P>
"We naturally hope there will be a positive response from all
parties and from all paramilitary organizations to the statement
issued by the prime minister and the Taoiseach (Ahern)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Ahern did not spell out their proposals but called on
guerrilla groups to make clear that they would "put their arms
completely and verifiably beyond use."
</P>
<P>
The proposals were to be fleshed out later on Saturday in a
letter that the prime ministers were due to send to the party
leaders.
</P>
<P>
May 22 is also the deadline set out in the two-year-old Good
Friday peace accord for the handover of guerrilla weapons. That
historic pact raised hopes of a lasting peace after decades of
sectarian violence between Catholic and Protestant groups.
</P>
<P>
Security analysts said the IRA might announce a reopening of
talks with the province's disarmament agency.
</P>
<P>
The IRA is operating a ceasefire after 30 years of violence
aimed at ending British rules and forming a single Irish state.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists issued a terse two-line response to Blair
and Ahern's statement.
</P>
<P>
"For weeks now, we have been calling upon the republican
movement to tell us what they are going to do. We now hope they
will tell us what they're going to do," it said.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was greatly
encouraged by the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
"I urge the parties, and paramilitary organizations, to seize
this opportunity to realize these goals in order to secure lasting
peace for the people of Northern Ireland," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Since Northern Ireland devolution was suspended on February 11,
both governments' meetings with the parties have been overshadowed
by an unbroken impasse between the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein
over IRA arms and power sharing.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Launch New Anti-Forest Fire Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A new action plan to combat forest
fires in Turkey has been prepared, reported the Anatolia News
Agency over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Forestry Minister Nami Cagan in a press release urged anti-
forest fire workers to be more careful and more alert in order not
to get caught unaware again.
</P>
<P>
On April 5 this year, a wave of forest fires broke out, quickly
spreading to nine provinces across the country and destroying a
total of 7,000 hectares of forest.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that it would cost 11.7 million U.S. dollars to
reforest the burned areas under the 84 forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Cagan said bitterly that the April 5 firestorm had lowered the
morale of forestry organizations.
</P>
<P>
The minister stated that he had sent instructions to the various
Forest Ministry commissions directing them to enact the plan firmly
and through all levels of the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
Cagan warned that the so-called "forest mafia" has been seen
from time to time occupying public forest land thus shaking public
trust in the state.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot tolerate forested land that has been burned or in
some way destroyed for private purposes," the minister stressed. "I
want our colleagues to crack down on these flagrant breaches of
regulations."
</P>
<P>
Cagan complained that the ministry is suffering from a budget
deficit which is hampering its ability to fight fires.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the Parliament to quickly pass a bill, the
ministry submitted, allowing the ministry to rent fire-fighting
helicopters and to pay workers' wages from a supplementary budget.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a country with a land-mass of 779,452 square kilometers,
is covered by more forests than most Middle East countries.
According to official statistics, a total of 26 percent of the
lands in Turkey are included under the forestry regime. The total
area covered by good quality, productive forests is 13 percent. The
per capita productive forest land in the country amounts to 0.14
hectares.

<HEADLINE> Australia Makes Counterproposal on Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Howard Saturday
said a tripartite forum between Australia, Indonesia and East
Timor could only take place after Australia first held separate
talks with Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid, Australian
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
After an hour of talks with visiting East Timorese leader
Xanana Gusmao, Howard said, "We are quite agreeable, in principle,
to there being a tripartite meeting between the Indonesian
president, myself and Mr. Gusmao."
</P>
<P>
The idea for the three-way leadership forum was floated by
Wahid during a recent meeting with Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
"However, such a meeting should follow and be separate from a
bilateral meeting between the Indonesian president and myself,"
Howard said.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would write to Wahid, suggesting that they
meet before the tri-nation meeting. It is expected the bilateral
meeting will take place in Australia in July.
</P>
<P>
After Australia's active role in East Timor last year, the
relationship between the two biggest countries in the region fell
to its lowest level in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Australia was actively involved in peacekeeping in East Timor
after East Timorese voted for independence from Indonesia last
year.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Manila Sets Conditions for Truce in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Saturday that the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) should lay
down their arms and release all hostages being held in Mindanao
before the government can accept its truce offer.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly radio-TV program here, Defense Secretary Orlando
Mercado said President Joseph Estrada approved the setting of
these two key conditions recommended Friday night by a cabinet-
level body tasked to tackle political affairs and national
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said the Cabinet Cluster E set these two conditions to
determine if the MILF is sincere in declaring a 48-hour cease-fire,
which took effect early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"So if the MILF wants to show that they have really decided in
carrying out a cease-fire, Cluster E recommended that the group
should first lay down its arms and release all hostages," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said the military has not yet received any order to
halt its operations in the south and would continue with its
efforts to clear the Narciso Ramos Highway, a vital road link in
Maguindanao which the MILF has blocked.
</P>
<P>
Mercado noted that there is already an existing cease-fire
agreement between the government and the MILF and he accused the
rebel group of having repeatedly violated it.
</P>
<P>
Military operations in Mindanao, according to Mercado, are
merely in response to these cease-fire violations committed by the
MILF.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Gen.
Angelo Reyes said the military remains "steadfast and determined"
to carry out its mandate of ensuring peace and order in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"We have not received any order to stop so we will continue.
Our objective is to clear the Narciso Ramos Highway so that it
will become passable to commuters and to trade and commerce in the
area," Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
He said intelligence reports indicate that the MILF had been
forced to call a cease-fire because of the gains made by the
military against them.
</P>
<P>
He said the group may use the 48-hour truce to recover and
consolidate its heavily battered forces.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, President Estrada expressed the hope that the
government and the MILF would return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
He said the government remains committed to extending the hand
of peace to those who seek it, but is also determined to defeat
those who choose war.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between MILF and government troops in Mindanao in the
past week has left thousands of people homeless and at least 80
people dead.

<HEADLINE> ADB Opens Meeting With Focus on Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANG MAI (Thailand), May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development
Bank (ADB) opened its 33rd Annual Meeting of the Board of
Governors here Saturday with focus on poverty elimination in the
Asia-Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the meeting, ADB President Tadao
Chino pointed out that the overarching goal for Asia and the
Pacific and for ADB should be to reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said reducing poverty is a "multidimensional challenge,"
which includes attaining pro-poor, sustainable economic growth,
social development, good governance and globalization, ensuring
that technology will not widen the gap between the haves and have-
nots, and that productivity increases in the real sectors and
preventing environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that ADB is resolved to confront the challenge
squarely and is taking an integrated approach to fight against
poverty.
</P>
<P>
On the faster-than-expected recovery in 1999 in crisis-affected
countries, Chino said, "Asia's developing economies have once
again become major contributors to global growth."
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that this recovery must not blur the lessons
of the past three years.
</P>
<P>
He said the sustainability of Asia's recovery is greatly
dependent on a commitment to persevere with structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
"ADB stands ready to help its developing member countries
accelerate and complete the reforms," Chino said.
</P>
<P>
His concern was echoed by Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai,
who in his speech at the opening session expressed the wish that
the poverty reduction strategy and the private sector development
strategy adopted by the ADB will help promote pro-poor,
sustainable economic growth, thus contributing to the alleviation
of the plight of more than 900 million people living under the
poverty line in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He warned Asian countries not to be complacent and lulled into
a false sense of security.
</P>
<P>
Chuan described the crisis as a "wake-up call" for Asian
countries and said it has reminded them of seeking for "quality"
growth, which is more balanced, more stable and more sustainable.
</P>
<P>
When delivering his speech, Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmannahaeminda, who is also chairman of the ADB Board of
Governors, praised Chino's role in changing the bank's focus and
operations.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said that since taking the helm of the ADB last year,
Chino has shown a determination to focus the bank's energy
entirely on the poor.
</P>
<P>
"The bank can help Asia and the Pacific become more prosperous,
better governed, more ecologically aware, more cooperative and
less divided. Most important of all, it can help its members fight
and defeat poverty by promoting economic growth, fostering
socially inclusive development and encouraging better government,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin also appealed to all governors to give their "fullest"
support to the Asian Development Fund replenishment so that the
bank can have the necessary fund to fulfill its cause.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 representatives from most of the bank's 58 members,
including finance ministers, central bank governors and officials
from banks and international financial institutions are attending
the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Governors, the ADB's highest policy-making body,
comprises one representative from each member and meets annually.
</P>
<P>
The board elects the Board of Directors every two years.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the bank also holds seminars on issues
ranging from poverty reduction and the international financial
architecture to the global networked economy.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1966, the ADB is a multinational finance
institution.
</P>
<P>
With 42 of its members from the Asian and Pacific region, the
bank engages in a wide range of social and economic development
activities aimed at improving the welfare of the people in the
region.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the ADB rededicated itself to the fight by adopting a
new poverty reduction strategy that rests on three pillars: pro-
poor and sustainable economic growth, social development and good
governance.

<HEADLINE> New Drought Alert, Kenyans Told </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's famine is expected to get
worse because of poor rainfall during the long rains season from
March to June, meteorologists have warned.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Meteorological Department Friday said that Kenya is
soon to experience a severe drought over a long spell of time
owing to the current slump in rainfall in most parts of the
country, local newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The department said the severity of the drought, which started
last year,
</P>
<P>
will be worse than that in 1984, which was recorded as one of
the worst in terms of recurrent famine and drought in black
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Evans Mukolwe, Director of the department, said during March,
some locations did not receive a single drop of rain and the
hardest hit areas were in the northwest and northeast of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The same situation prevailed up to April as the same areas
received less than 20mm of rainfall compared to the normal 250mm
in other years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mukolwe attributed the current rainfall deficit to the series
of weather changes, especially La Nina.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the sea surface temperatures over the Pacific,
Indian and Atlantic oceans are indicating that La Nina conditions
are dying out, adding that this could enhance rainfall over some
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in May, rainfall is expected over the western,
central and northeastern parts and that in June and July there is
a probability for enhanced rainfall over western and coastal area.
</P>
<P>
Due to a long spell of drought, there are over 2.7 million
Kenyans facing a famine threat since early this year. The U.N.
World Food Program in February appealed international donors for
43.4 million U.S. dollars for purchasing 75,000 tons of food for
those famine-threatened Kenyans.

The much-anticipated duel between Karl Malone and Seattle's

assists as Utah won the series 3-2 to reach the Western Conference
semifinals.

<HEADLINE> Great Wall Repair Plan Restarts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China is to restart the Great Wall
renovation project which faltered last year, said sources from the
State Bureau of Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that they will repair the sections built during
the Qin Dynasty (221-206 B.C.) in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
This is the first renovation effort on the sections of the
Great Wall built more than 2,000 years ago, said Guo Zhan, deputy
director of the bureau's Relics Protection Division.
</P>
<P>
The section of the Great Wall built in the Qin Dynasty,
zigzagging across north China's Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia,
and Gansu, was built for defense at that time.
</P>
<P>
Exposed to piercing winds and the scorching sun for centuries,
the wall is in critical conditions, said Ha Da, an official with
the local authorities of Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The wall is expected to return to its original appearance with
rocks from mountains. And the Qin Dynasty Great Wall is expected
to be open to tourists after the renovation.
</P>
<P>
Sections of the Great Wall well known to tourists were mostly
built in the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing 1644-1911) dynasties which
remain in better conditions due to the repairs since 1949, said
the bureau officials.
</P>
<P>
The project actually kicked off last year. But a shortage of
funds made only 300 meters of the wall be renovated, said the
bureau officials.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 1,000 meters of the Great Wall in the remote
mountains of Urad Front Banner will be repaired this year, with
the bureau's allocation of 600,000 yuan ( about 72,000 U.S.
dollars), said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
And over the next five years, local relics authorities will
renovate 1,000 meters of the wall every year.

<HEADLINE> Love Bug Attacks HK with Minor Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A computer virus that struck
global computer systems attacked Hong Kong as it did in other
parts of the world, but has just caused minor damage, reports from
various sectors said.
</P>
<P>
The government said on Friday that at least three departments
were hit by the ILOVEYOU virus, but there was no damage because
most used the Lotus Notes E-mail system, which cannot spread the
virus.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Information and Technology department said
the virus failed to penetrate the government computer systems and
the stock exchange was not affected.
</P>
<P>
The Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation said the love bug bite
its E-mail system Thursday afternoon, but the train services were
not affected since they used a closed control system.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Jockey Club said more than 1,000 of its desktops
were attacked on Thursday, though betting systems were not
affected.
</P>
<P>
Internet tycoon Richard Li said his computers took hits in
several countries, but he personally was free from the virus.
</P>
<P>
The love bug, contained in a ILOVEYOU E-mail, took bites
globally and paralyzed some 270,000 computers within hours of its
appearance.
</P>
<P>
So far, damage caused by the virus was estimated at 26 billion
U.S. dollars and expected to reach 100 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The virus is changing its E-mail names, which makes it even
harder to detect, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine police are tracking a 23-year-old unnamed man in
Manila, who is the main suspect behind the computer virus outbreak
across five continents.
</P>
<P>
Experts warned the virus may continue to cause E-mail chaos for
several days. They advised people to delete any suspicious E-mail.

<HEADLINE> Role of Women in HK Society Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a speech delivered to commemorate the fifth anniversary of
the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing, Chan noted
that women have made up almost half of Hong Kong's population and
40 percent of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
Saying the status of women in the Hong Kong society has greatly
improved with the passage of time, Chan cited that about 1.7
million or nearly 50 percent of women in Hong Kong today are
economically active and female unemployment rate is now about 1.7
percent lower than that of men.
</P>
<P>
As regards higher education, female students make up slightly
more than half of the first degree graduates of the programs
funded by the University Grants Committee, she said, adding that
women also make up one-third of the civil service.
</P>
<P>
In terms of serving the community, Chan said that currently
four of the 13 Executive Council members are women, ten
legislators are women and 72 women are now serving on the District
Councils, representing a two-fold increase in the number of women
who served on the District Boards between 1994-97.
</P>
<P>
The number of women serving on government advisory and
statutory bodies totaled over 900 at the end of 1999, which
represented an increase of nearly 100 percent in the past 10 years,
according to Chan.
</P>
<P>
The administrative secretary attributed the increasingly raise
of women's role to joint efforts of the government, service
providers, non-government organizations and pioneer women leaders.
</P>
<P>
The government is planning to set up a Women's Commission to
continually promote the well-being and interests of women, Chan
said.

<HEADLINE> HK to Set Up Women's Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region government is breaking new ground in
promoting the well-being and interests of women by establishing a
Women's Commission, Chief Secretary for Administration Anson Chan
said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The commission would address women's needs and take a broad
overview of women issues that impinge on a wide range of policy
areas, Chan said in a speech delivered Saturday to commemorate the
fifth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women held in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
She said the commission will advise the government on a long-
term vision and strategy related to the development of women and
on policies and initiatives which are of concern to women.
</P>
<P>
"In its formative years, we envisage that the commission will
focus on a number of areas that have already been identified as
priorities for attention," she said.
</P>
<P>
The priorities include the provision of health services, child
support, protection of women against violence, promotion of a
working environment friendly to women and various legal issues
relating to women and the family.
</P>
<P>
The commission would also arouse community concern over women
matters and help eliminate long-standing stereotypes and
prejudices through public dialogue and debate, she said.
</P>
<P>
By setting up the Women's Commission, the government could
ensure that women's concerns are taken into account as a matter of
course when policies and initiatives are being formulated, said
Chan.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Police Probe Suspected "Love Bug" Hacker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The person suspected to be behind the
devastating "I love you" computer virus creating havoc on computer
systems worldwide is a 23-year-old male in Manila, the Philippine
press reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The hacker hid behind a screen of hacked e-mail accounts and
pre-paid Internet user cards," Jose Carlotta, chief operating
officer of Access Net Inc., a Manila Internet company, was quoted
by the Philippine Star as saying.
</P>
<P>
The computer virus, called "Love Bug," first spread through two
e-mail addresses in the Philippines. The virus quickly infiltrated
government and corporate computer systems around the world. Some
estimates have put the cost of the damage at more than 1 billion U.
S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Access Net came up with the profile of the attacker after
comparing notes with other local service providers and police are
now working with the companies, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Daily Inquirer said Philippine Internet service
providers admitted that they were the source of the virus and that
they would eventually identify the hacker based on his or her
record, which could be traced.
</P>
<P>
Among the service providers which the hacker used to multiply
the virus via e-mail were SkyInternet, Accessnet and Impactnet,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said police investigation has begun and two units
under the National Bureau of Investigation have been entrusted
with the task.

<HEADLINE> Botswana to Help Evacuate British from Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said the member states of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) did not seek to economically isolate Zimbabwe to
force it to stop the invasion of white farms by army veterans and
the violence that had accompanied it.
</P>
<P>
"In SADC we do not believe in the economic isolation of
Zimbabwe," he said. "This is not because we like what is happening
there ... it would not help the situation."
</P>
<P>
The SADC was doing what it believed was most likely to persuade
Zimbabwe to do things differently, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I know the Zimbabweans, isolation will not persuade them to
change. Telling them they are wrong will not help, they would
develop a siege mentality," Mogae said.
</P>
<P>
"We know what is happening will adversely affect the region and
the perception the world has of us, but we must explain (to
Zimbabwe) it will hurt them first," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Botswana Foreign Minister Lieutenant-general
Mompati Merafhe, who has just been appointed chairman of the
Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, which is mainly occupied
with the crisis between Britain and Zimbabwe, said it was
unreasonable for Zimbabwe to expect SADC not to express its views
on what was happening.
</P>
<P>
"There is violence and loss of life, the illegal occupation of
land, we have to express our concern," he said.
</P>
<P>
Merafhe said the group had decided the Commonwealth Secretary
General would visit Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"He will interact with the government in Harare and see how
Zimbabwe can be helped," Merafhe said.
</P>
<P>
"We seek to lower the political temperature. We do not want to
be sucked into the dispute. We want to avoid any negative impact
on the negotiations. We want to create a congenial environment for
discussion to resolve the issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possible suspension of Zimbabwe from the
Commonwealth, Merafhe said he hoped it would not go that far.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Zimbabwe will not be considered for such action," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The 14 member states of SADC are: Angola, Botswana, Democratic
Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia,
Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe.

</P>
<P>
Saturday Star:
</P>
<P>
-- Mounting concern over the political crisis in Zimbabwe and

record low of 7.0250 against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Citizen:
</P>
<P>
-- Through the global "I Love You" computer virus, South

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Accuses U.K. for Using Talks to Further Propaganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The British government used last
month's land talks with Zimbabwe to further its own propaganda,
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said in Bulawayo Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters after a two-hour meeting with South African
President Thabo Mbeki, Mugabe said the talks aimed at resolving
the country's land question were deadlocked because the British
representatives were not sincere, the daily Herald reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I briefed President Mbeki on the outcome of the London land
talks. I told him that the talks yielded nothing because the
British government, especially Foreign Minister Robin Cook, used
the meeting for propaganda purposes," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the fact that the meeting took place was a positive
development on itself. The meeting also opened up avenues for
future discussions. We remain open for future consultations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Britain and Zimbabwe on occupations of
white-owned farms in the country stalled on whether London should
pay compensation before war veterans and other land-hungry
Zimbabweans move out of the farms they are occupying.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said he also briefed President Mbeki on preparations for
the forthcoming parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the political situation in the country and farm
occupations by war veterans. I told him that the ex-combatants
were now interacting with commercial farmers and have agreed to a
non-violent disposition. The situation continues to be of farm
occupations until a more positive offer of land is made. Only
then will the war veterans move away from farms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki echoed Mugabe's sentiments, saying the London land talks
failed to resolve real issue, "that is, the land question."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe thanked Mbeki for accepting the invitation to come and
officially open the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair in
Bulawayo, the country's second largest city.
</P>
<P>
"This is a sign of solidarity, cooperation and friendship. It
is a continuation of the friendship of neighbors and freedom
fighters. Once freedom fighters, always freedom fighters, He
said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki left the country for home Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Peacekeepers Held in Sierra Leone: UN Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambian peacekeeping troops in Sierra
Leone have been taken hostage after being disarmed by rebels of
the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Kambia, Times of Zambia
newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted United Nations officials as saying on Friday that
more than 200 Zambian troops, together with 24 other U.N.
personnel had been disarmed and were in rebel hands along with 100
other peacekeepers abducted several days ago.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Echkhard said :"The efforts right now are
political in nature. If that fails, I don't want to speculate,
what happens next."
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Zambian troops numbering about 800
left for Sierra Leone about three weeks ago on the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. official said the fate of held peacekeepers was
uncertain after a firefight on Wednesday that ran into the night.
</P>
<P>
However, Zambian Defence Minister Chitalu Sampa was quoted on
Friday's Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation TV news as
saying that the Zambians were safe and that the government was in
constant touch with the authorities in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Move up to 2nd Round With Deciding Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
O'Neal outrebounded the entire Sacramento team in the first
half and
finished with 32 points and 18 rebounds, while the rest of the
team contributed steady offensive production and superb defense.
Shortly after halftime, it was abundantly clear that the Lakers
would pass their first tough test of character with ease.
</P>
<P>
Another Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant finished with 17 points,
Glen Rice had 14 and the other members of the team - A.C. Green,
Robert Horry, Derek Fisher - who had been playing poorly or not at
all in Games 3 and 4 provided plenty of support. Green finished
with 10, and Horry and Fisher had eight apiece.
</P>
<P>
So lopsided was it that O'Neal and Kobe Bryant sat out almost
the entire fourth quarter, giving the team's two best players some
unexpected extra rest to carry into their second-round series
against the Phoenix Suns beginning Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Kings, meanwhile, who shocked everybody but themselves by
tying the series with a pair of home victories, were borderline
pathetic.
</P>
<P>
Chris Webber finished with 20, but the rest of Sacramento's
starters shot a combined 7-for-22. Vlade Divac scored just four,
Nick Anderson had three and Corliss Williamson eight.
</P>
<P>
The Kings fell behind by 35 less than two minutes into the
fourth quarter after consecutive dunks by Horry and O'Neal, and
never really gave themselves a chance to pull off what would have
been one of the biggest upsets in NBA history by becoming just the
third eighth-seeded team to knock off a No. 1 seed.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Lakers said coach Phil Jackson had made
all the right moves during the fifth and deciding game as the
Lakers rolled past the Kings into the second round of the NBA
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who coached the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships
in the 1990s, was calm, cool and even a little chippy.
</P>
<P>
Jackson said veterans A.C. Green and Robert Horry, the power
forwards, had to shoot the ball more than they had in two losses
in Sacramento that tied the best-of-five series 2-2. And so they
both did.
</P>
<P>
Rather than fret over a dicey situation, Jackson embraced it.
</P>
<P>
At one point before the game, Jackson suddenly flashed a big
grin and said, "I was concerned with a long layoff without a game
and here we are, playing Friday. I think it's better to do it this
way, sometimes."
</P>
<P>
The supercoach believe that it's better to do whatever it is
you're doing. He always puts a positive spin on whatever happens.
</P>
<P>
Jackson, whose 114-43 record in playoff games (.726) is the
best in NBA history, may have had the best players in the Chicago
Bulls, and probably does now in the Los Angeles Lakers, but
certainly he's fulfilled his role.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers now face the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference
semifinals, starting Sunday at Los Angeles Staples Center, where
they've won 20 of their last 21 games.

<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded in a Manila park
early Saturday morning, hurting one man, police said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Supt. Avelino Razon Jr., director of the Western Police
District of Manila said that a man sleeping on a bench at the
skating rink at the Rizal park suffered injuries in the blast at
01:30(17:30 GMT Friday).
</P>
<P>
He said that the explosive device turned out to be a home-made
bomb and two unidentified women were being hunted for questioning
in connection with the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were seen by people suspiciously walking at the
elevated portion of the rink minutes before the explosion, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Razon said investigations show that the blast had nothing
to do with the crisis now going on in some parts of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He added that police forces have been assigned to bus and train
terminals as well as in crowded areas and ports and harbors in the
city to thwart attempts by terrorists to enter the city.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front has threatened to
carry out terrorist activities in the capital city of Manila if
government forces continue military operations against the rebel
group in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, bomb explosions were also reported in General Santos
City in Mindanao Saturday morning.

<HEADLINE> ADB Meeting Opens with Focus on Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANG MAI (Thailand), May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development
Bank (ADB) opened its 33rd Annual Meeting of the Board of
Governors here on Saturday with concentration on the poverty
reduction in the Asia Pacific country.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the meeting, Tadao Chino, president
of ADB, pointed out the overarching goal for Asia and the Pacific
and for ADB should be to reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said that reducing poverty is a "multidimensional challenge",
including attaining pro-poor, sustainable economic growth, social
development, good governance, globalization, ensure technology not
to widen the gap between the haves and have-nots, ensure
productivity increase in the real sectors and environmental
degradation.
</P>
<P>
He vowed ADB has resolved to confront the challenge squarely
and is taking an integrated approach to fight against poverty.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the faster-than-expected recovery in 1999 in
the crisis affected countries, saying "Asia's developing economies
have once again become major contributors to global growth."
</P>
<P>
However, he warned this recovery must not blur the lessons of
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
He said Asia's recovery sustainability is greatly dependent on
a commitment to persevere with structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
"ADB stands ready to help its developing member countries
accelerate and complete the reforms," Chino said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, Thai Finance Minister and
chairman of the board Tarrin Nimmannahaeminda also delivered
speeches.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 representatives from the bank's 58 members,
including finance ministers, central bank governors and officials
from banks and international financial institutions are attending
the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
They all expressed satisfaction over Asia's unexpected rapid
recovery from the crisis, and warned against complacency.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Governors, the ADB's highest policy-making body,
comprises one representative from each members and meets annually.
</P>
<P>
The board elects the Board of Directors every two years.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the bank also holds seminars on issues
ranging from poverty reduction and the international financial
architecture to the global networked economy.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1966, the ADB is a multinational finance
institution and has 58 members.
</P>
<P>
With 42 of its members from the Asian and Pacific region, the
bank engages in a wide range of social and economic development
activities aimed at improving the welfare of the people in the
region.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the ADB rededicated itself to the fight by adopting a
new poverty reduction strategy that rests on three pillars: pro-
poor, sustainable economic growth, social development and good
governance.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military to Continue Operations in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government forces will
continue their military operations in Mindanao despite a 48-hour
unilateral cease-fire declared by the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front(MILF), an army general said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Major Gen. Diomedio Villanueva said in a radio interview that
their operations will continue until they receive orders from
higher authorities although the cease-fire was supposed to take
effect at 06:00 Saturday (22:00 GMT Friday).
</P>
<P>
"From our side, we have not received any corresponding order
for a moratorium. So our plans, insofar as operating elements are
concerned,will be pushed through," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his troops have a tactical objective which they have to
achieve.
</P>
<P>
Villanueva said the MILF probably wants to rest for a while or
re-supply their force, but whatever their reasons government
troops will continue their operations.
</P>
<P>
But MILF Vice Chairman Al Haj Murad, who was interviewed by
radio station DZRH, said their cental committee decided to grant
the appeal of private sectors for a halt in hostilities in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He said the cease-fire was without condition and was a
voluntary one, but MILF forces would continue to maintain a
defensive stance during the 48-hour period.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF, which is fighting for an independent
Islamic state in Mindanao, has been engaged in fierce fighting
with government forces in parts of Mindanao in the past week.

<HEADLINE> Seoul to Donate 200,000 Tons of Fertilizer to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Saturday announced that it
will donate 200,000 tons of fertilizer to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) this year, a move widely expected to
contribute to the preparatory talks for the inter-Korean summit.
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, delegates from Seoul and Pyongyang will hold
their fourth talks at the truce village of Panmunjom for the
summit between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim Jong Il, scheduled
for June 12-14 in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Unification Ministry said Saturday the
fertilizer donation was reviewed and made under humanitarian
consideration and is not linked to the fourth preparatory meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to help North Korea through reasonable means
as long as it needs humanitarian assistance," a government
official said.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said it will give a big boost to the fourth
preparatory meeting Monday, during which the two sides will
produce the first series of agreements for the summit.
</P>
<P>
The announced donation of 200,000 tons of fertilizer, from both
government and private organizations, exceeds last year's 155,000
tons at the request of Pyongyang,
</P>
<P>
Seoul officials said the announcement was made when the DPRK
enters the planting season hungry for fertilizer, showing Seoul's
goodwill and its desire to further build mutual confidence for the
summit.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK is reported to suffer a shortage of 700,000 to 800,000
tons of fertilizer every year, although farming conditions in the
country have apparently improved this year.

<P>
NEW YORK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Top seed the Los Angeles Lakers
and second the Utah Jazz both avoided their first round
elimination from the Western Conference playoffs and advanced to
the semifinals by winning the fifth and deciding game on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone scored 27 points as the Jazz edged the Seattle
SuperSonics 96-93 to win the best-of-five series 3-2 in Salt Lake
City.
</P>
<P>
John Stockton, who had 17 points and 15 assists, hit two free

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Dhaka to Introduce Representative  Committees for Workers in EPZs  (by Pan Xiaozhu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The government of Bangladesh is going
to introduce representative committees for the workers in the
Export Processing Zones (EPZs) in the country despite the labor
unrest in the Dhaka EPZ this week.
</P>
<P>
A draft plan of the proposed welfare committee or workers
council is being considered by the commerce ministry and is
expected to be announced as a guideline for the EPZ workers
shortly, according to the Financial Express Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has been pressing Dhaka for allowing the
workers in the country's EPZs the freedom of association since
June last year on insistence from an American labor rights group.
</P>
<P>
The American Free Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization
asked the U.S. government to cancel Bangladesh's generalized
system of preference unless Dhaka allowed trade unions in the EPZs.
</P>
<P>
Since the United States is the largest export market for
Bangladeshi products, the government of the country agreed to
allow"some sort of trade union activities" inside the country's
two exclusive industrial zones.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a group of people turned violent and clashed with
the police following retrenchment of 33 workers employed in Ring
Shine Textile LTD in Dhaka EPZ at Savar, 30 kilometers off the
capital. The management of the Singapore-Malaysia apparel company
decided to shut down their industrial unit on Thursday after the
incident which left at least two workers killed and scores of
others injured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Ambassador in Bangladesh John C Holzman met
Commerce Minister Abdul Jalil Thursday and inquired about the
progress in allowing workers rights in the EPZs.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the commerce ministry admitted that there had been a
tremendous pressure on them to allow trade unionism in the EPZs,
but the government is unwilling to introduce union activities in
the zones.
</P>
<P>
The government reportedly would introduce representative bodies
for the EPZ workers, considering the well-being of a huge number
of local laborers employed in the EPZs.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's two EPZs, the other one in the port city of
Chittagong, attracted more then 400 million U.S. dollars in
cumulative investment, mainly from South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan,
China and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
But foreign investors in the EPZs have opposed the idea of
introducing trade union activities in their industrial zones,
saying that they had invested in the EPZs because trade unionism
was legally prohibited in those areas.
</P>
<P>
Wali Bhuiyan, Chief of the Foreign Investors' Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, which represents all foreign investors
operating in Bangladesh, warned recently that if the restriction
on trade unionism in EPAs was withdrawn, the existing investors
would shy away. The fate of private EPZs would be in crisis, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The EPZs were established as special economic zones prohibiting
trade unionism for obvious reasons and because of this incentive
the EPZs attracted substantial foreign direct investment.

<HEADLINE> ADB Opens 33rd Annual Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANG MAI (Thailand), May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development
Bank (ADB) opened its 33rd Annual Meeting of the Board of
Governors here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 representatives from the bank's 58 members,
including finance ministers, central bank governors and officials
from banks and international financial institutions are attending
the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai,
Thai Finance Minister and chairman of the board Tarrin
Nimmannahaeminda and ADB President Tadao Chino delivered speeches.
</P>
<P>
They all expressed satisfaction over Asia's unexpected rapid
recovery from the crisis, and warned against complacency.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Governors, the ADB's highest policy-making body,
comprises one representative from each members and meets annually.
</P>
<P>
The board elects the Board of Directors every two years.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the bank also holds seminars on issues
ranging from poverty reduction and the international financial
architecture to the global networked economy.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1966, the ADB is a multinational finance
institution and has 58 members.
</P>
<P>
With 42 of its members from the Asian and Pacific region, the
bank engages in a wide range of social and economic development
activities aimed at improving the welfare of the people in the
region.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the ADB rededicated itself to the fight by adopting a
new poverty reduction strategy that rests on three pillars: pro-
poor, sustainable economic growth, social development and good
governance.

<HEADLINE> Euro to Rebound: ECB Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The exchange rate of euro, the
single currency of 11 nations, will rebound as the price is stable
and the economy maintains a growth momentum in the euro area, Vice-
president of the European Central Bank (ECB) Christian Noyer said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The euro was unlikely to maintain its present exchange rate as
the rate did not reflect the actual economic situation of the 11-
nation euro zone, Noyer said at a conference of the International
Chamber of Commerce in the Hungarian capital.
</P>
<P>
Judging from its state since it came into being 15 months ago,
the euro had promoted economic growth, reduced cost, simplified
the payment system, and speeded up the integration process of the
European financial markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noyer believed that although the U.S. dollar would still occupy
an important place in the world economy, more and more countries
would choose two to three major currencies as their foreign
exchange reserves, and as a result, the position of the euro would
be further strengthened in the international capital market.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the meeting were of the view that the euro had
played its due role as price stability and low inflation were
prevailing in member countries of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
On the devaluation of the euro in the international money
market, they said the ECB should not intervene to stop the slide,
because the strong economic potential in Europe would be able to
push the euro upwards.
</P>
<P>
The euro suffered its heaviest blow recently, registering
record lows against major currencies, falling to as low as 88.85
cents against the dollar on Wednesday, down 25 percent from the
all-time high of 1.19 dollars reached during its first day of
trading on January 4, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Needs More Structural Reforms: WTO Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has made considerable
progress in its economic reforms, but needs to carry out more
structural reforms to reap the full benefits, The New Nation
Saturday quoted a WTO report released in Geneva as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report, along with a policy statement by the Bangladesh
government, served as the basis for a WTO review of the country's
trade policy in Geneva on May 2 to 4.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, one of the leading least-developed countries in the
WTO's 136 membership, has one of the most liberal regimes in South
Asia in terms of investment, offering relatively cheap and
abundant labor, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
But the report also said the trade regime lacked transparency
in its application of trade and trade-related measures such as
customs administration, tariff concessions and subsidies.
</P>
<P>
"Such lack of transparency allows considerable scope for
administrative discretion and even corruption, which in turn
increases the uncertainty and costs of doing business in
Bangladesh," said a summary of the report.
</P>
<P>
The report highlighted World Bank estimates, showing that
annual foreign direct investment in Bangladesh more than
quadrupled from 83 million U.S. dollars in 1994-1995 to 386
million dollars in 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
But it was hampered due to lack of basic infrastructure, the
slow pace of privatization, an inefficient financial system and a
generally uncertain political climate, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Stresses Patriotism in Building Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar military leader General Maung
Aye has stressed the need to uphold patriotism in building the
nation, saying that without patriotism the country will become
weak and will face disintegration.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a graduation parade of military officers here Friday,
Maung Aye, deputy comander-in-chief of the Myanmar Defense
Services and commander-in-chief of the army, said the Tatmadaw (
Armed Forces)will never betray the national cause and accept any
scheme designed to cause disintegration of the union.
</P>
<P>
He warned against attempts to destroy the armed forces by anti-
government organizations inside and outside the country, saying
that "The Tatmadaw's unity could stand the test of the time even
when the nation's administrative machinery came to a stop in 1988
unrest".
</P>
<P>
Maung Aye was quoted by Saturday's newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar as disclosing that 17 anti-government armed groups in
jungles in the country have returned to the legal fold.
</P>
<P>
On national construction, he said, since the present government
assumed office in late 1988, a total of 108 dams and 108 bridges
including eight river-crossing bridges, have been built, adding
that a total of 75 billion Kyats (234.3 million U.S. dollars) have
been invested in construction works.

<HEADLINE> "I Love You" Enters S.Korean Computer Networks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The software virus named "I LOVE YOU"
which crippled computer networks around the world Thursday also
hit South Korea and is likely expected spreading rapidly in the
country.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Ahn's Anti-Virus Laboratories said Saturday that
more than 100 cases of computer were reported paralysis due to the
"love virus" Friday alone.
</P>
<P>
Reports of damage were less than expected because Friday was a
holiday, but are expected to increase when people return to work
or turn on their computers next week, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
The institute warns users to delete any e-mail with a subject
line reading "I LOVE YOU" and a message saying "kindly check the
attached LOVE LETTER coming from me."
</P>
<P>
The "love bug" is a new virus spreading through the e-mail
message "I LOVE YOU" designed to destroy computer files plus
digital pictures, video and music.
</P>
<P>
The virus targets computers running on Windows, attacking the
Outlook e-mail program and the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
It spreads not only through e-mail but also the instant message
system which let people chat on the Internet. Once the virus is
unleashed in computer, it can destroy a complete computer network
in a company.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Holds Workshop on ASEAN Investment Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A workshop on tasks related to ASEAN
Investment Area (AIA) is being held here, aimed at enabling new
members of the organization to understand the opportunities and
difficulties in attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The two-day workshop, which began Friday, is sponsored by the
Directorate of Investment and Companies Administration of Myanmar
and the ASEAN Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Topics covering attraction of direct foreign investment,
regional investment difficulties and cooperation in ASEAN
investment matters are discussed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the workshop, Myanmar deputy
minister of National Planning and Economic Development Brigadier-
General Zaw Tun called for effective implementation of the
Framework Agreement on the AIA.
</P>
<P>
At the Sixth ASEAN Summit held in Hanoi in December 1998,
regional leaders adopted the Hanoi Plan of Action with initiatives
to hasten economic recovery in the aftermath of the Asian
financial crisis which broke out in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that in order to accelerate the implementation of
the AIA agreement, Temporary Exclusion List for the manufacturing
sector be progressively phased out initially agreed, in which
Myanmar will join the first six member countries to do so by the
year 2003 instead of 2015.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the inflow of foreign
investment into Myanmar has dropped steadily due to the impact of
the Asian financial crisis with a fall by 70 percent of investment
from ASEAN member countries. The country received only 1.26
billion U.S. dollars of foreign investment in 1997, 248.26 million
dollars in 1998 and 21.138 million dollars in 1999.

<HEADLINE> AIDs, Poverty, War Remain Major Threats to Children: UNICEF Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Children's medicare has seen
substantial improvement around the world in the past decade but
they still face great threats posed by AIDs, poverty and war in
the new millennium, said Carol Bellamy, executive director of the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The number of inoculated children worldwide now is higher, and
their health conditions better, than ever, Bellamy told a press
conference at the end of her three-day visit to Finland.
</P>
<P>
She cited as examples the complete eradication of Guinea worms-
caused disease which had been rampant in Africa, and the near
vanishment of polio.
</P>
<P>
However, the UNICEF chief said, the goals set in the action
plan adopted at the 1990 U.N. summit on children have not yet been
completely realized.
</P>
<P>
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDs), one of the major
menaces to children's health, is quickly spreading in some parts
of the world, she added.
</P>
<P>
AIDs cases have doubled among the adult in the past decade,
seriously endangering children's health, she said, adding that the
number of orphans with AIDs around the world is expected to rise
from the present 11 million to 13 million by the year-end.
</P>
<P>
Fighting AIDs and reducing the effects of poverty and war on
children are the top priorities for UNICEF in the new millennium,
Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
When the U.N. General Assembly convenes in the next fall, she
said, all heads of state and government will be invited to a
special meeting to discuss the implementation of the action plan
adopted in the 1990 summit and to map out a new action plan to
protect children.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Bellamy held separate talks with Finnish
President Tarja Halonen and Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja, and
expressed thanks for Finland's contributions to promoting the work
of UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF, one of the major recipients of Finland's multilateral
development aid, received 67 million Finland marks (10 million U.S.
dollars) in donation from it.

<HEADLINE> Seoul to Donate 200,000 Tons of Fertilizer to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Saturday announced that it
will donate 200,000 tons of fertilizer to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) this year.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian donation is meant to build up mutual trust
between Seoul and Pyongyang before the inter-Korean summit slated
to open in Pyongyang on June 12-14.
</P>
<P>
"With the inter-Korean summit talks about one month away, the
aid will be made with no strings attached," said a news release
issued by the South Korean Unification Ministry Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of fertilizer is to be shipped to the DPRK in
mid-May to meet planting season. But shipping dates will be
decided through consultations with DPRK Red Cross liaison office
at the truce village of Panmunjom Sunday, one day prior to the
fourth preparatory meeting for the summit, according to the
release.
</P>
<P>
The fertilizer and its transport fee are worth 64 billion won (
some 60 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Last year, South Korea supplied 155,000 tons of fertilizer to
the DPRK at the request of Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The Unification Ministry said the DPRK lacks 700,000 to 800,000
tons of fertilizer every year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Combat Piracy in Malacca Strait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Western Fleet is preparing a special force to tackle
piracy and hijacking problems," Rear Admiral Indroko Sastrowiryono
was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the center will be located on Batam island, just south
of Singapore. It will constantly monitor the movements of hundreds
of ships through the narrow, funnel-shaped waterway between
Malaysia and the Indonesian island of Sumatera.
</P>
<P>
Sastrowiryono said his command would require a total of 15
patrol ships on station at all times in order to guarantee
security.
</P>
<P>
The logistically complex effort is the navy's latest effort to
clamp down on incidents of piracy after a spate of attacks on
vessels plying one of the most congested waterways in the world.
</P>
<P>
Its success will depend on the willingness of all vessels to
report their positions as they traverse the 900-kilometer-long
route, said Sastrowiryono, who commands one of Indonesia's two
naval districts.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage ships passing through the strait to report
beforehand, so that if they encounter a problem, we can
immediately dispatch help," Sastrowiryono said.
</P>
<P>
In its latest survey, the International Maritime Bureau said 19
pirate attacks were recorded in Indonesia in the first three
months of this year. There were 18 cases during the same period in
1999, and 10 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The 19 assaults numbered one-third of all maritime crimes
worldwide from this year, making Indonesian territorial waters the
most dangerous in the world.
</P>
<P>
Pirates typically base their fast boats along the mangrove-
covered coastline of western Sumatera, pouncing on passing vessels
which must slow down as they approach Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Naval officers say the thick foliage and thousands of islets
along the low-lying coastline make it difficult to detect the
bandits even from the air.

thanks to the reduction of customs tariffs according to the
agreement.
</P>
<P>

JAKARTA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports Council
(KONI) has spent 1.59 billion rupiah (about 213,000 U.S. dollars)
as of Thursday to finance the training preparations of 72 athletes,
25 national coaches and four foreign coaches for the 2000 Olympic
Games.
</P>

</P>
<P>
He said the sole table tennis player to qualify for the Olympic

Sudharno said that the amount mentioned above also covered
medical treatment fees and doping tests, which cost 800,000 rupiah
per person.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Rice Supply Ensured in Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Being self-sufficient in rice supply
will continue to be a central part of the government's grain
security policy in the next century.
</P>
<P>
China Daily today quoted an official with the China
Agricultural Economic Research Center as saying that China's
agriculture can still support the government's grain security
policy with 94 percent of it's supply to be domestically produced
in 2005, he said.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jikun, director of the center, said that his conclusion
was based on the China Agricultural Policy Analysis and Simulation
Model (CAPSiM), an academic system set up to analyze the
government's economic policy-making during the development of a
market-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
Based on the CAPSiM, it is estimated that after China's entry
to the World Trade Organization, China will produce 140.75 million
tons of rice in 2005 with 30.95 million hectares of farmland used.
At that time, China will become a net rice exporter.
</P>
<P>
China's rice exports exceeded 2.7 million tons last year, down
27.8 percent year-on-year, while imports reached 168,000 tons,
down 31.1 percent, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) information
center said.
</P>
<P>
With a history of rice production of more than 4,000 years,
China now is comparatively developed in rice breeding and
producing technology.

<HEADLINE> China's On-Line Medical Services to Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A 10-year-old boy suffering from a
rare tumor in his pelvic cavity in east China's Shandong province
finally found the best doctors thanks to the emerging on-line
medical services in China.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese patients have experienced the headache of waiting
for hours just to see a doctor.
</P>
<P>
Simplifying procedures, finding the right doctors for patients
at the lowest cost is what www.jk123.com and a dozen other health
care websites are intended to do, China Daily reported, quoting
Shao Haiyang, president of the Beijing Nanshansong E-commerce
network co., as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the country's health websites now offer only
databases, consultation and "match-making" between doctors and
patients. They have yet to enter medical e-commerce in a real
sense, according to some industry insiders.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the State Drug Administration announced that
on-line sales of over-the-counter drugs would be suspended because
the business mode severs links between customers and drug sellers,
making supervision of sales difficult.
</P>
<P>
The ban put the brakes on drug sales on domestic websites.
</P>
<P>
But Shao said he believes the tough stance by the
administration will not last, since on-line sales of medicine is
the trend.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) has selected
several medicine websites to pilot e-commerce in this field. And
the commission supports on-line transactions among medicine
production enterprises, pharmaceutical circulation firms and
hospitals, according to a source with the commission.
</P>
<P>
In the latest development, the State Drug Administration, the
SETC and the Ministry of Information Industry held a "China
Medicine E-Commerce Forum" to discuss digital medical business.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lifeng, vice-director of the Market Supervision Department
under the State Drug Administration, said the administration is
ready to contribute to the healthy expansion of China's medical e-
commerce.

<HEADLINE> Cyber Love Bug Has Little Impact on Jakarta's Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Jakarta Post Saturday quoted analysts as saying that the
impact of the virus was much smaller here than in other countries
because the use of computer systems here was still low.
</P>
<P>
"It is not that we have a better protection system here, but
mainly because our computer network and e-mail use here are not as
widespread as overseas," said Goenawan Loekito, marketing manager
of Computer Associates.
</P>
<P>
He said information on computer crashes as a result of the
virus in the country was thus far not known.
</P>
<P>
However, he called on Internet users to remain cautious when
operating their computers, especially when checking their e-mail,
since large numbers of files containing the ILOVEYOU virus might
have been sent to computer users in the country.
</P>
<P>
There are currently over one million Internet users in
Indonesia, including nearly 500,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
None of the country's 35 active Internet Service Providers (
ISPs) had reported problems in their computer networks or systems
due to the virus, according to Sanjaya, the secretary-general of
the Indonesian Association of Internet Service Providers.
</P>
<P>
Two of the country's major ISPs, Indosat.net and Indo.net, said
no traces of the virus had been found in any of their computers,
and that their networks and systems were safe.
</P>
<P>
But news portal Detik.com said at least two of its computers
broke down after users opened e-mails carrying ILOVEYOU
attachments.
</P>
<P>
An official at Detik.com said the virus had ruined all the
portal's photo files.
</P>
<P>
"But the portal's operations are not affected at all because
the virus did not affect the other computers. Our computer network
and system are all right," the official was quoted by the Jakarta
Post as saying.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Fight Against Land Invasions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government decided to
revise the agrarian legislation to combat the invasion of lands
rampant in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement released by the government Friday,
the rural properties invaded by the peasants will not be included
in the government's agrarian reform during a two-year term, and in
case of a new invasion, for four additional years.
</P>
<P>
The government would also impose fines and other sanctions on
those who organize false invasions of their own farmland to avoid
the expropriation by the government, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The Landless Movement (MST), one of the most active civil
organization for social changes in Brazil, declared that it would
not stop the invasion of unproductive land, as a way to promote
the agrarian reform of the government.
</P>
<P>
The MST organized impoverished peasants to occupy idle farmland
in recent years. But it stepped up its campaign this week, urging
peasants to invade government buildings like state-owned banks.

MEXICO CITY, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala and the United States

<HEADLINE> General Strike Affect Areas in Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Schools were closed and
transportation was difficult in many parts of Argentina on Friday
as a general strike called by the General Labor Confederation
entered its second day.
</P>
<P>
Most truckers, taxi and bus drivers, educators, state workers
and metro transit employees were on strike to protest the
government's economic policies and a pending labor reform bill.
</P>
<P>
The national stoppage has affected public administration and
caused many schools to close down.
</P>
<P>
Attacks were reported against those transportation units that
were continuing giving service to the public in some cities. Two
persons were detained for throwing hard objects.
</P>
<P>
There were also reports that many routes and roads of access to
cities were barricaded Friday morning by strikers. And some 100
truckers were detained for blocking roads.
</P>
<P>
The strikers are protesting a controversial labor reform bill
approved in a two-thirds majority vote by the Argentine Senate on
April 26, which earlier had triggered several demonstrations
against the measure around the country.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which the Chamber of Deputies will debate next
Thursday, gives companies greater latitude in negotiating labor
agreements and maintaining work conditions.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Inflation Rate Down to Record Low in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's inflation rate dropped to
its record low in April, said the Economic Research Institute
Foundation (FIPE) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate was down to 0.09 percent in April, the
lowest since April, 1947, when it was 0.99 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
The drop is a result of the falling food prices which were down
0.57 percent, FIPE noted.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate was 0.47 percent in April last year,
compared with a 0.62 percent of the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
FIPE's coordinator Heron do Carmo forecasted an inflation rate
of less than 5 percent this year in Brazil mainly due to changes
in exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in Brazil so far this year was 0.66 percent.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Appeal WTO Rulings in Defense of Patent Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government said Friday
it will appeal World Trade Organization (WTO) rulings in favor of
United States in a patent rights dispute.
</P>
<P>
"Canada is committed to meeting its international trade
obligations, but we are not satisfied with the panel's findings
and will appeal the decision to the WTO appellate body," said
Pierre Pettigrew, the International Trade Minister.
</P>
<P>
Under WTO rules, Canada has at least 20 days to formally notify
the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of its decision to appeal
the rulings released earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The United States argues that Canada has not fulfilled its
obligations to ensure that U.S.-based pharmaceutical companies
enjoy 20 years of patent protection under the Agreement on Trade-
Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).
</P>
<P>
Canada insists that it has observed TRIPS by introducing the 20-
year standard under its "New Act," and the dispute only involves
the 17-year standard issued prior to 1989 under its "Old Act."
</P>
<P>
The United States demands all the 17-year patents be extended
to 20 years. Canada fears it could add 200 million Canadian
dollars (about 133 million U.S. dollars) to the cost of
prescription drugs and delay the arrival on the market of cheaper,
generic versions of brand-name pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, dozens of generic drug manufacturers
have been spawned, hoping to reap the benefits of expiring patents
and an aging population in Canada.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Promotes "Green Sale" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai municipal government is
to launch a "green sale" project, which will use recyclable
plastic and paper packaging.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, the city government is to cut down on waste like
plastic packaging, disposable chopsticks, styrofoam lunch boxes
and used batteries, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"The green sale concept combines environmental protection, the
development of enterprises and the improvement of life quality.
When economy is developed to a certain degree, it's time for the
city to have a try," said Xia Bojin, director of Shanghai
Municipal Food Office.
</P>
<P>
Biodegradable plastic which naturally decompose within five or
six months, recyclable plastic and paper will partly replace the
now widely used plastic bags in stores and supermarkets, said Xia.
</P>
<P>
Limits will be placed on the use of excessive packaging
beginning the third quarter of the year as well. And disposable
chopsticks and styrofoam lunch boxes will be banned in downtown
main restaurants and snack stores by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Also, provision for disposable articles used in hotels such as
cups, slippers and soaps are expected to be made subject to limits
according to the international practice, said Xia.
</P>
<P>
"But the green sale project will be no easy task," said Xia.
</P>
<P>
The high cost of producing non-polluting products is the first
hard nut to crack. The cost of biodegradable plastic is about 70
to 80 percent higher than ordinary ones. A lack of awareness among
local residents as well hampers the implementation of the project.
</P>
<P>
A lack of pollution-free resources and raw materials is another
problems, The city will use special technology and equipment to
help grow and package eco-friendly beans, currently very rare in
China.
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, the government has made the decision to launch the
project this year. Now investigations into and formulation of the
scheme are under way," said Xia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese public is paying more
attention to the problem of domestic violence today compared with
five years ago, China Daily said today.
</P>
<P>
Though a unified national law against domestic violence may
still take some time, legislation has already started in some
provinces and cities, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In Liaoning and Hunan provinces, local people's congresses have
passed regulations to curb domestic violence, and Shaanxi Province
is expected to follow suit shortly.
</P>
<P>
So far, 13 provinces, regions, cities and counties in China
have passed local regulations to prevent domestic violence,
according to the Working Group against Domestic Violence in China,
made up of China's leading women's non-governmental organizations
(NGOs).
</P>
<P>
The central government and an increasing number of NGOs have
started to place great importance on fighting domestic violence
since 1995, the year when the Fourth World Conference on Women was
held in Beijing, said Wang Xingjuan, director of the Beijing-based
Maple Women's Psychological Counseling Center.
</P>
<P>
Pioneered by the Beijing Court Scientific and Technical
Certification Research Institute, a number of centers have been
set up in China to assess the injuries of the abused women,
providing evidence if they go to court.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicate that about 90 percent of the
counties, cities and provinces in China have established legal
counseling centers to protect women, provide legal advice to
abused women and assist them with law procedure.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, special courts have been set up in Jiangsu and
Shanxi provinces to handle domestic violence cases.
</P>
<P>
Women's shelters, which provide temporary lodging for abused
women, have also been opened in some areas.

WELLINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government has
sent information about the former Indonesian President Soeharto
family interests in New Zealand to the Indonesian Attorney General,
Marzuki Darusman.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued by the New Zealand Government,
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Phil Goff said Friday that
the known assets formerly held in New Zealand by members of the
Soeharto family are "small in relation to the estimated 8 billion
U.S. dollars"thought to have been pocketed by Soeharto family
members and associates.
</P>
<P>
"However, handing over what we know about Soeharto holdings in
New Zealand may assist the Indonesian authorities to bring to
account those responsible," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, the material that the New
Zealand Government has made available includes information on the
Lilybank Station previously owned by Tommy Soeharto and two
holiday homes near Queenstown previously owned by former President
Soeharto's daughter,Siti Hediyanti Haryadi. The evidence suggests
that these assets are no longer in the ownership of the Soeharto
family.

LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- John Gregory has agreed a new
contract with Aston Villa, which will keep him as manager of the

</P>
<P>
The deal is understood to be worth one million pounds a year

"The Villa board have shown their faith in me," Gregory said.

Gregory, who had an earlier spell as a Villa coach, returned to
the club in February 1998 to replace Brian Little.

<HEADLINE> Anderton out of Euro 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Darren Anderton, who is now playing
for English club Tottenham Hotspur, will not be available for
England's Euro 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
A specialist has ordered complete rest for the Tottenham
midfielder's injured Achilles tendon.
</P>
<P>
The injury-prone midfielder has frequently endured stop-start
seasons before taking part in international campaigns during the
summer.
</P>
<P>
But this time he was told to take a break to allow the injury
time to heal completely in time for next season.
</P>
<P>
Anderton underwent surgery on the injury in September and knows
he must rest if the problem is to go away.
</P>
<P>
"It means a lot to me to be ready for Tottenham and I will have
to pull out of Euro 2000," Anderton told Friday's Evening Standard.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to be involved in the last two league games at
Manchester United tomorrow and against Sunderland next Sunday. But
after that I am going to follow Mr King's advice."
</P>
<P>
England manager Kevin Keegan said he understood Anderton's
problem.
</P>
<P>
"Darren and his medical advisors know best," said Keegan.
</P>
<P>
"He is a quality player and I look forward to him being fit for
selection next season. His welfare has to come first and I wish
him all the best," he said.

<HEADLINE> Wembley Plans set for Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The building of the new Wembley
stadium could begin shortly after Brent Council announced they
were very likely to give approval to the plans for the project by
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week council leader Paul Daisley suggested that
the plans could be scuppered.
</P>
<P>
He wanted cast iron assurances from all relevant parties that
their part of the 470 million pounds deal would be met.
</P>
<P>
Planning officers at the council had initially recommended that
the application should be rejected.
</P>
<P>
They believed there was not enough cash in place to fund a huge
programme of transport regeneration around the ground.
</P>
<P>
The work includes major work at Wembley Park tube station plus
substantial improvements to the north-west London road system.
</P>
<P>
Brent are now happier with the deal, and although they still
want to check through the latest proposals it is not thought that
the work will be put back any further.
</P>
<P>
It has already been delayed twice, but demolition work should
now start immediately after England's World Cup qualifier with
Germany in October.
</P>
<P>
"Following detailed discussions with all the key parties
involved with the development of the new stadium at Wembley, I am
increasingly confident," said Daisley.
</P>
<P>
"After several months of negotiations we now believe that there
is enough money on the table to provide a safe and efficient
transport system for visitors and minimise the negative impact
that the stadium will have on local residents and businesses," he
said. "The planning committee meeting, which was due to take place
on 15 May, has now been rescheduled for Tuesday, May 30. This is
to give our planning officers the time to look at the detail of
what is on offer and ensure that there are no loose ends which
need to be tied."

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Troops Shell Rwandan Positions in Congo: Rwanda Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan troops stationed in
Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on Friday
morning shelled the Rwandan army positions, killing seven
civilians and wounding nine, Rwanda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Seth Kamanzi, an official with the Rwandan Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and Regional Cooperation, said that Ugandan troops
commenced shelling the Rwandan army positions at 4:00 a.m. at
Bangoka Airport and Kisangani town.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan army ground commanders had been instructed not to
return fire for the time being till the government contacted
Ugandan authorities to establish what was actually going on, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reach here, Ugandan and Rwandan forces
fought each other outside the rebel-held Kisangani in the eastern
part of the DRC on Friday, with at least five civilians killed and
nine others wounded in the clash.
</P>
<P>
Shaban Bantariza, Ugandan army spokesman, refused to confirm
the clash in a telephone interview with Xinhua. But he said
further information might be available later. A similar clash
occurred at the same place last August, causing heavy casualties
on the Ugandan side.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have been close allies in the Congolese
conflict. Tensions have steadily increased between the two allies
since March of 1999, for they have been backing rival rebel forces
in the DRC. Both Uganda and Rwanda have in recent weeks
reportedly reinforced their forces stationed at Kisangani, the
third largest city in the DRC.

20 million citizens of this country who work in the United States.
</P>
<P>
It touched the incidents recorded in the last two months in the
state of Arizona, where a group of U.S. citizens have started "a
hunt" of undocumented Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican side stated in the bilateral meeting its
indignation "for the inhuman and violent way in which our
countrymen are treated" in that U.S. state.
</P>
<P>
The head of the U.S. delegation, Jim Kolbe, underscored before
the Mexican delegation had announced its project for a bilateral
agreement for the migratory workers, that he knows "very well" the
problems illegal immigration can cause.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that more than half a million Mexicans "crossed
the Arizona border in 1999 without migratory documents" in the
district he represent in the state House of Representatives and
that "this is a common problem that will have to be resolved with
binational cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Kolbe, who seemed to have previous knowledge of the Mexican
position, remarked that "we must see in the United States that
those persons who cross the border in that manner will not be
damaged by the ill-advised actions of a few."
</P>
<P>
He added that Mexico will have to cooperate to try to control
those who traffic with this movement, and also can take very
decisive measures with economic actions to reduce the weight of
the causes that make Mexicans leave their country.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican delegation said that the effort to counteract drug
trafficking "has been intense but insufficient," so the government
of President Ernesto Zedillo considers that the combat "must
continue."
</P>
<P>
Kolbe said that the two countries combat drug traffic, and
warned that this problem "could very well be the biggest and most
important challenge we will face in the next years."
</P>
<P>
"If we do not defeat it, this scourge that is drug traffic and
the corruption it generates might undermine our institutions and
the very foundations of our two societies," he said.

<HEADLINE> "Love Virus" Fails to Affect Panama Canal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The surprise attack of the so-
called "Love bug" (ILOVEYOU) failed before the anti-virus activity
of the Panama Canal Authority (ACP), despite it affected the
administrative side, the local press reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ruben Reina, manager of the Customers Division and manager of
ACP Informatics Department, said that the canal is operating
normally, in spite of the fact that the users of the ACP
informatics system began to receive an immense quantity of
messages with the title "I LOVE YOU."
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian manager said that the technicians of the Canal
Authority proceeded to interrupt the internal electronic mail
service for four hours to counteract the virus attack and to alert
the users.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the administration made use of other
communication means, such as telephones, cellular phones, fax and
other equipment.
</P>
<P>
The ACP, which has an anti-virus software in its 3,000
computers, has implemented a strategy of two levels to prevent
these virus attacks: at the level of the servers of the electronic
mail itself, and at the level of customers.
</P>
<P>
However, Reina said that none of the anti-viruses was able to
detain the "I LOVE YOU" virus, because it entered the defense
lines of the system.
</P>
<P>
The "love bug" is a new virus spreading through the e-mail
message "I LOVE YOU" designed to destroy computer files plus
digital pictures, video and music.
</P>
<P>
The virus targets computers running on Windows, attacking the
Outlook e-mail program and the Microsoft Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
it spreads not only through e-mail but also the instant
message system which let people chat on the Internet. Once the
virus is unleashed in computer, it can destroy a complete computer
network in a company.

<HEADLINE> EU More Incisive in Foreign Policy, Conference Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) must equip
itself with more incisive foreign-policy tools if it is to play a
role in promoting peace, democracy and development in the
Mediterranean, according to a conference held Saturday in Venice
International University.
</P>
<P>
The political scientists, economists, journalists and opinion-
makers from Italy and Spain, convened by the European Commission
offices in Spain and Italy, said the EU must achieve a common
foreign and defense policy before it enlarges to the East.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the conclusions of the Intergovernmental
Conference on reforms, to be presented at the Nice summit in
December, are crucial, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Today's conference came to the conclusion that the EU was
confined, at present, into a sort of back-up role: it only steps
in to ensure or
finance peace once the United States, mainly, has imposed it as in
the Balkans or tried to encourage it as in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Stefano Silvestri, the vice-president of Rome's Institute for
International Affairs, highlighted that Mediterranean policy had
ceased to be "a residual policy" for the EU and had become a
central one, from the strategic and security standpoint, as well
as from an economic and social one.
</P>
<P>
The risks of clashes exist in the area because of the diversity
of peoples, regimes and religions but the fact that the northern
Mediterranean is for the first time presenting itself united for
dialogue with the south and the evolution of transatlantic
relations on the Middle East are positive signs, Silvestri said.
</P>
<P>
Alessandra Cavalli, a sociology lecturer at the University of
Pavia, said Mediterranean Europe must intensify exchanges, also of
a cultural nature, so as to offer a more homogeneous and better
integrated reference point for the southern rim of the sea.

<HEADLINE> 9 million Internet Users in Italy, Survey Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Italy has over nine million Internet
users who are mostly male and access the web from homes in the
north of Italy, the Italian thinktank Censis found in a survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey found 21.3 percent of its sample used the net,
showing a sharp rise on recent studies but still lagging far
behind the United States where 55 percent of the population have
access to the web.
</P>
<P>
Four million Italians hook up from home and 3.1 million use the
web from their office. Fewer than two million Italians have
Internet both at home and at work, while just 1.1 percent use the
net from public places or friends' houses.
</P>
<P>
Most of the users are male and young, the percentage of under-
35s is 35 percent, almost double that of the over-35s.
</P>
<P>
Another great determinant is the level of education. Over 27
percent of those with just a primary school diploma doesn't even
know what the Internet is, while just 0.2 percent of them are
linked to the web.
</P>
<P>
Among university graduates, 40 percent surf the web but 5.1
percent don't even have access.
</P>
<P>
As for the uses to which Italians put the web, 91.4 percent of
the survey said they used it to get information and only 10.4
percent said they used it for e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Some 72 percent of the survey used e-mail, while only 17.7
percent had created their own web pages.

<HEADLINE> 10 Colombian Teachers Die in Road Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 Colombian teachers died
and 25 more suffered injuries when the vehicle where some 40
teachers were riding fell into a more than 100 meter chasm, the

city of Medellin when the teachers were returning from a meeting,
said the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The injured were taken to several hospital centers in Medellin.
</P>
<P>
The teachers, who were linked to official education centers,
were returning from a convivial gathering in the Sopetran
municipality, a small community located on the road that
communicates Medellin with the banana producing region of Uraba.
</P>
<P>
The causes of the accident are being investigated and the
authorities are trying to determine if the driver was drunk or if
the accident was caused by mechanical failure.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Condemns U.S. Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A Cuban court of justice found the
United States guilty of causing damage and harm to Cuba with the
economic blockade and condemned it to pay 121 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The full text of the sentence appears in an special supplement
published Saturday by the newspaper Granma, which states that 6.
405 billion dollars of that figure correspond to the damages
caused, and 114.595 billion dollars to compensations for damages.
</P>
<P>
The sentence was meted out by the City of Havana Popular
Provincial Court, after a lawsuit for economic damage filed by
eight social and mass organizations on January 3.
</P>
<P>
The text describes in a detailed way the legal procedures
followed in the process of instruction that accepts all the
aggressions carried out by the various United States
administrations since the triumph of the Cuban Revolution in 1959.
</P>
<P>
A lot of documental evidence and testimonies on political
pressures, attempts of diplomatic isolation, spying, economic war,
physical aggressions of various kinds, included subversion,
sabotage and terrorism actions, were presented during the hearings.

<HEADLINE> Italy Hopes to Bring Swiss Closer to EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The expectations with which Italy is
awaiting the upcoming Swiss referendum on accords that bring
Switzerland closer to the European Union were highlighted in
Saturday's meeting between Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi
and his Swiss counterpart Adolf Ogi.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss president also said a "personal link" had been formed
between himself and the Italian head of state.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents' talks ranged widely, from regional security
to Nato, relations between Switzerland and the EU, and the Balkans,
but the main focus fell on the seven accords reached with the EU a
year ago, which could bring Bern closer to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Ogi told Ciampi he was "very optimistic" on the outcome of the
referendum, and stressed that "Switzerland is understood by the
European people and Ciampi confirmed that."
</P>
<P>
The Italian president also spoke of the efforts being made to
bring peace to the Balkans, illustrated the Italian initiatives in
that direction and indicated Switzerland as an example of a
multicultural society.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls IRA's Disarming "Historic" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"For the first time the IRA is clearly committed to
decommissioning and a process to get there. I applaud that,"
Clinton told reporters before a trip to his home state of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the agreement reached after two days
of talks in Belfast between British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern would last.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Saturday, Clinton said in a written statement that
he welcomed the IRA's commitment to put arms "beyond use" and the
its agreement to allow international inspectors into its arms
dumps.
</P>
<P>
"These developments offer renewed hope to the people of
Northern Ireland that politics will once and for all be pursued
through exclusively political means," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The IRA agreed to begin disarming itself after the British and
Irish governments announced ambitious plans to transfer power back
to the province's suspended Catholic-Protestant administration by
May 22 and to extend the deadline for total IRA disarmament from
that day to June 2001.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed his hope that the agreement "will be fully
accepted by all parties," adding, "We never got this far on the
details of implementation."
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report quoted White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart as saying that aboard Air Force One, Clinton telephoned
both Blair and Ahern "to congratulate them for moving the process
forward."
</P>
<P>
Britain suspended Northern Ireland's power-sharing
administration in February after the IRA refused to begin
disarming. The pro-British Unionists will decide whether to accept
IRA's offer.
