<P>
SEOUL, May 1 (Xinhua) -- President of the Korea First Bank Rhee
Chul-soo and Chairman of the Hyosan Business Group Chang Jang-son
were arrested today on bribery charges.
</P>
<P>
Rhee was indicted for receiving 320,000 U.S. dollars in
"commissions" from Chang who, in return, asked for an extension of
an illegal 241-million-dollar loan from September 1993 to March
1994.
</P>
<P>
Rhee only admitted taking 128,000 dollars instead of the
alleged 320,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chang used the loan to buy and build hotels and a ski resort in
and around Seoul, a prosecution official said.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean laws ban provision of loans for use in such
projects unless they are located in government-designated tourist
complexes.
</P>
<P>
Chang was first fingered in the case of former presidential
secretary Chang Hak-ro, who was indicted on graft charges in March
this year.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of giving 77,000 dollars to Chang Hak-ro in
return for his influence in securing a large loan from a
Seoul-based bank.
</P>
<P>
As President Kim Young-sam pledges to rectify the history and
wipe out deeply-rooted corruption in this peninsular nation, two
former presidents, one former finance minister, one presidential
secretary, three parliament members and a dozen of business
leaders have been accused with bribery.

WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua)-- U.S. energy experts today began
removing thousands of spent nuclear fuel rods from a nuclear
facility of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), a
spokesman for the White House said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, after months of technical preparations and discussions,
U.S. energy experts and private U.S. companies began the canning
operations on the 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods at the nuclear
facility in North Korea," spokesman Mike McCurry said at a press
briefing here.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said that the operation is taking place "under the
supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency" and "will
make the world a safer place."
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the U.S. experts are removing the fuel
rods from a cooling pond and placing them in steel canisters.
</P>
<P>
Under an framework agreement signed in 1994 between Washington
and Pyongyang, the DPRK will freeze activity at its existing
nuclear reactor and at a facility for extracting plutonium from
reactor fuel rods.
</P>
<P>
It also agreed to permit regular inspections of its nuclear
program by the International Atomic Energy Agency as called for
under terms of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The United States in exchange agreed to arrange for the
international financing and supply of two light-water nuclear
reactors to the DPRK for electricity production. The project, at
an estimated cost of 4 billion U.S. dollars is underway smoothly,
American officials said.

<P>
Exports grew faster than imports, giving the EU a trade surplus
of 12.4 billion ECUs (16 billion U.S. dollars), double the surplus
of 6.2 billion ECUs (8 billion dollars) in 1994 and a deficit in
1993, figures from EUROSTAT, the EC statistical office, show.
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the improvement was the adoption in 1994
of a series of preferential and protective measures to boost
exports to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of EU exports in the first nine months of 1995
stood at 416 billion ECUs (about 541 billion dollars), nearly 10
percent higher than the same period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The volume of EU imports was 403.6 billion ECUs (about 525
billion dollars), a 6.3 percent increase over 1994.
</P>
<P>
Ten EU member states recorded favorable balance of trade during
the three quarters, especially Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,
Sweden, Belgium and Luxembourg, while five nations suffered trade
deficits -- the United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Portugal and
Austria.
</P>
<P>
Finland's trade volume climbed 28 percent over the same period
last year, the highest in all EU member states, compared with a
6.9 percent growth rate in Britain, which was the lowest.

<HEADLINE> EU Provides Aid to Upgrade Sanitation in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) has
approved a humanitarian aid project worth 600,000 ECUs (about
780,000 U.S. dollars) to improve hygiene conditions in Jalalabad,
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The EC said that civilians fleeing fighting in the capital
Kabul have been heading east for makeshift camps near Jalalabad.
</P>
<P>
The lack of clean water and proper sanitation in Jalalabad has
led to a sharp deterioration in the health of children,
humanitarian aid organizations have said.
</P>
<P>
This project, channeled via the European Community Humanitarian
Office (ECHO), will help improve sanitation for around 55,000
people by providing toilets.
</P>
<P>
ECHO also plans to continue medical aid work in a major refugee
camp in the town of Herat, west of the Afghan capital of Kabul,
benefitting some 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
ECHO's partners are French non-governmental organizations.

<HEADLINE> UK Local Elections Held Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's last local elections before
the general election scheduled next May are being held across
England outside London today amid predictions that the ruling Tory
party is doomed to a defeat.
</P>
<P>
The local elections are considered as the biggest test of
public opinion on party performance before the general election.
</P>
<P>
Over 10 million Englanders would take this opportunity to
signal the mood of voters. It is reported that the Tories are much
worried that they would be betrayed by the middle class, who have
been the staunch supporters of the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,031 seats are being contested in 150 local
councils, of which the Conservatives hold just four.
</P>
<P>
The Tories are defending 1,092 seats; the opposition Labour,
1,256 seats; the Liberal Democrats, 467 seats; independents and
other small parties, 165 seats and the other 51 seats will be
contested.
</P>
<P>
Press here generally predict that the Conservatives face
another disastrous defeat in the local elections as they did last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Times newspaper in an editorial said that the Tories had
virtually given up on these elections before the campaign even
started because they knew that they would lose hundreds of seats.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian said today's polls should be a verdict on Prime
Minister John Major and his conservative government.
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives have undermined local government in a way
which still shocks many of their own supporters, and as a result
it is no surprising that the local elections have come
increasingly to be seen as a judgement on national politicians
rather than as a verdict on local councillors, it said.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times also said that there was little doubt that the
Conservatives would do badly in today's contests. The electorate
would rightly conclude that the conservatives had given up any
claim to remain in office.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper held that disunity and divisions have badly
damaged the tory government.

<HEADLINE> Talks Will Go Ahead with or without Sinn Fein: Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
said today that all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland
scheduled for June 10 will go ahead whether or not the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) declares a new cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Major reiterated his government's position in the parliament
that The IRA's political wing Sinn Fein could only admitted to the
planned all-party talks if there was "an unequivocal IRA
cease-fire".
</P>
<P>
"There is no credible reason for the IRA not to stop their
violence immediately," he told the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
If there was no truce, Sinn Fein could not claim to be
democratic, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a loyalist party in Northern Ireland warned that the
loyalist paramilitary ceasefire was becoming increasingly fragile.
</P>
<P>
The loyalist paramilitary groups, which strongly defend British
rule over Northern Ireland, declared their truce on October 13,
1994, two weeks after the IRA's cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
David Ervine, leader of the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP)
and also a political spokesman of the Ulster Volunteer Force
(UVF), said the mood among the loyalist paramilitary groups was
worse now than after the IRA blast in east London on February 9,
according to a report in the Irish Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Ervine was quoted as saying that hardline loyalists believe
that if the IRA could try to gain political advantage through
violence then loyalist paramilitaries should do the same.

<HEADLINE> US Ad Industry Coming back from Worst Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.ad industry, which
experienced one of the worst slumps in history, has started coming
back strong, according to Investors' Business Daily today.
</P>
<P>
Taking major ad firm Interpublic as example. Over the years, it
has shown consistent double digit-earnings growth. in the first
quarter of this year, it posted a five percent gain in earnings to
17.8 million u.s. dollars, or 23 cents a share. For the whole
year, earnings are expected to rise 14 percent to 2.45 dollars a
share.
</P>
<P>
Quick recovery can also be seen from another major ad firm, New
York-based Omnicom. In the first quarter, earnings leapt 21
percent to 30.5 million u.s. dollars, or 41 cents a share from the
year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
Now, with the Olympics in Atlanta this summer, ad spending
should be more buoyant than ever, ad firms executives said.
</P>
<P>
"The Olympics will stimulate advertising in nearly every
market, but especially autos, beer and soft drinks," Robert J.
Coen, senior vice president of New York agency McCann-Erickson
Worldwide, said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that U.S. ad budget will swell 7.8 percent in
1996 to 174.1 billion u.s. dollars from 161.5 billion last year.

<HEADLINE> WHO Reports Further Decline of Polio Cases Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The world has moved a step closer to
the target of eradicating poliomyelitis by the year 2000 as last
year's reported polio cases worldwide fell to just above 6,000, a
28 percent decline from the 8,600 cases reported in 1994, the
World Health Organization (WHO) said today.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 figures also represented an 82 percent decline of
reported polio cases from the 31,000 cases registered in 1988 when
the eradication target of the year 2000 was set by the World
Health Assembly, the supreme decision-making body of the
Geneva-based WHO.
</P>
<P>
According to data received by WHO as of April 15, a total of
150 countries reported zero cases of polio in 1995. Twenty seven
countries reported from one to 10 cases and 30 countries reported
more than 10 cases. Seven countries failed to report.
</P>
<P>
The American region, covering the whole of the Western
hemisphere, is the only polio-free geographic region where the
last polio case was reported in August 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, because epidemiological surveillance is incomplete in
many polio endemic countries, WHO estimated that approximatedly
80,000 cases of paralytic polio occurred in 1995 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Polio is an infectious viral disease that attacks the central
nervous system, causing permanent paralysis of the muscles and
frequently death.
</P>
<P>
In order to eradicate the disease, the naturally occurring wild
polio virus must be destroyed. Because man is the only host of the
virus which can survive in the environment for about two to three
months, mass immunization is the only tool for breaking the virus
transmission, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve the year 2000 target of eradication, the
WHO, along with some other international agencies, have made
consistent efforts to help countries to maintain the highest
possible immunization coverage.
</P>
<P>
One of their campaigns is to promote the so-called National
Immunization Days (NIDs) during which host countries deliver Oral
Polio Vaccine (OPV) to all children under five years of age.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO estimates, the global immunization coverage
for 1995 was about 83 percent. Coverage in Africa is significantly
below that of other regions, but rose above 50 percent for the
first time in 1994. Last year it climbed to 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1995 the number of countries which conducted at least
one NID rose to 62. Of these, 25 countries had their first NID in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 300 million children, representing 47 percent of
the world's children under five years of age, received OPV during
National Immunization Days. The first half of December 1995 saw
195 million children immunized during NIDs in China, India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated that by the end of this year, all
polio-endemic countries in Europe and Asia and half the countries
in Africa will have conducted at least one NID.

<HEADLINE> UK Threatens to Tighten US Entry Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The British government has threatened
to tighten entry restrictions for U.S. citizens in retaliation
against an American law retaliating against countries to have
business ties with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the United States has recently passed the
so-called Helms-Burton law on isolating Cuba by curbing foreign
investment, after Cuban fighters downed two private U.S. planes
near Havana, capital of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation, the U.S. government would deny visas to
company officers, shareholders and their family members, who have
any business relations with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on the implications of the U.S. law in
London today, British Department of Trade and Industry minister
Ian Taylor said, "the U.S. should not be left in any doubt that
its actions against the UK and other trading partners are likely
to have an adverse impact upon U.S. interests both internationally
and domestically."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the British retaliatory "options include
the use of the Protection of Trading Interests Act, as well as the
possible use of entry permission procedures."
</P>
<P>
"Measures like the Helms-Burton legislation can do nothing for
the attractiveness of the United States as a destination for
overseas investment," he added.
</P>
<P>
Baroness Young, Chairman of the Cuba Initiative, is quoted as
saying,"we are a trading nation and this law is quite wrong."
</P>
<P>
Cuba's Deputy Minister for Foreign Investment Octavio Castilla
told the seminar the institutional investors would be the first to
be hurt by the law, which makes it difficult to classify Cuba as
an investable emerging market.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Britain's exports to Cuba totaled some
19.16 million pounds (about 29 million U.S. dollars) in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Greece Supports Implementation of Dayton Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Greek official today voiced
Greece's full support for the implementation of the Dayton peace
agreement in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very difficult exercise, which Greece supports
because it has greater interest than any other country in the
restoration of peace and stability in the region," the country's
alternate Foreign Minister George Romeos said.
</P>
<P>
Romeos was speaking to reporters after his talks with visiting
international mediator on the Bosnian issue and former Swedish
Prime Minister Carol Bildt.
</P>
<P>
Romeos added that the present phase in the run-up to elections
in Bosnia was the most difficult.
</P>
<P>
"Relative peace and security has been restored by presence of
the peace-keeping force, but we all believe that with the
elections, the process for political stability must be completed
and the Dayton agreement fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
"Greece is participating in all these processes as well as
with a small contingent in the international peacekeeping force,"
Romeos said, adding that Athens would also be contributing funds
"according to our means" for the reconstruction of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said that great progress had been made in Bosnia in
recent months and life in the country was beginning to return to
normal.
</P>
<P>
"Despite this," he said, "there is still a long way to go to
achieve the reintergration of the country and reconstruction of
the economy. This is going to take many years, but a good start
has been made."
</P>
<P>
The international mediator said that the return of refugees and
displaced persons was one of the essential elements of the peace
process "which has really now started in earnest".
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern about the overall situation in Kosovo, Bildt
said developments there had an impact "not only on Bosnia but on
the region as a whole and on the future stability of Serbia".
</P>
<P>
"Serbia can't be stable, prosperous and harmonious if it does
not achieve reconciliation on the issue of Kosovo. Serbia cannot
live as a normal European country in a state of continuous
confrontation and repression in Kosovo," Bildt said.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Protection Law For Africa Launched In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The first model consumers protection
law for Africa was launched here today by European Commissioner
for Development and Consumers affairs Emma Bonino at the end of a
four-day conference on consumers protection.
</P>
<P>
The law, drafted for the Consumers International, by a team of
lawyers from Africa, provides the first detailed information for
African governments on the types of consumers protection they
should consider introducing.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to consumers and government delegates attending the
conference, Bonino appealed to African governments, international
organizations and consumers organizations to make a determined
effort to the break what she called ''the vicious cycle of
poverty'' by adopting a proactive approach to consumption.
</P>
<P>
''Northern countries have to take their responsibilities to
heart and, if measures in the field of foodstuffs and product
quality control are to be sufficiently effective in the importing
countries, the north have to do its part to strengthen them,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
The model law suggests that governments should set up small
claims courts to ensure quick and cheap access to justice for
customers.
</P>
<P>
The model law also provides for regulation of consumers
financial services such as credit cards and insurance, as well as
rules to ensure honesty in advertising.

<HEADLINE> Greek Foreign Minister Visits Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos arrived here today for a two-day official visit to
discuss the Cyprus problem with Cypriot government officials.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival at Larnaca International Airport,
Pangalos said "as long as the Cyprus question is pending, as long
as part of Cyprus remains under Turkish occupation and there are
Turkish military forces in Cyprus, there will be no climate of
trust between Greece and Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Referring to his meeting last week in Bucharest with his
Turkish counterpart Emre Gonensay, Pangalos said the Cyprus
problem was not part of his discussion with Gonensay because the
sole object of their talks was "Turkey's claims on the Greek
Aegean islet of Imia."
</P>
<P>
"I told Gonensay that the presence of Greek military forces on
the islands is the result of the crisis in trust created in 1974
(when Turkish troops invaded Cyprus)," the Greek foreign minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos also warned that any attempt to use Greece's ties
with Cyprus to blackmail Greece into submission to Turkish
offensive designs would "make Greece harden its position as far
as EU-Turkey relations are concerned."
</P>
<P>
"Our position at present is as moderate as can be," the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.S. moves to make headway toward a Cyprus
settlement, Pangalos said "Greece and Cyprus welcome every effort
to bring to the foreground the Cyprus question and every attempt
to contribute to its solution."
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Pangalos, who will visit the U.S. next week,
is expected to have official talks with Cyprus' Foreign Minister
Alecos Michaelides and will have a meeting with President Glafcos
Clerides on the Cyprus problem and the island's EU accession.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, are at odds over this East
Mediterranean strategic island, which has been divided into the
Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north since the
Turkish invasion in 1974 following an abortive coup by some Greek
Cypriots seeking uion with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece agreed to a joint defense pact in November
1993, which provides for joint military exercises and programs.
</P>
<P>
Greece has warned that any further advance of the Turkish
troops toward the government-controlled southern part of the
island would mean war between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Greece, together with Turkey and Britain, were guarantors of
Cyprus' independence under the 1960 treaty of establishment of
the Cyprus Republic.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Trade Unions To Join In Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) today welcomed the government's
decision to include union representatives in a technical
committee negotiating a new trade pact with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
''We can only wish that there will be a breakthrough in the
trade talks although we know there are complications,'' ZCTU
economist Tapiwa Mashakada said.
</P>
<P>
Government's decision to include, for the first time, union
officials in the committee follows a proposal put forward by
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's High Commissioner to Zimbabwe, Kingsley
Mamabolo, said he hoped the inclusion of the labour movement would
assist in the talks.
</P>
<P>
''We sent a proposal to Zimbabwe that in our next round of
talks, we should include the private sector and the union. It
looks like there is light at the end of the tunnel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The trade talks have been stalled for more than four years as
South Africa's private sector and the labour movement opposed
granting of preferences for textile and clothing imports from
Zimbabwe.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 2 (Xinhua)-- South African President Nelson
Mandela today called for drastic steps in fighting against the
increasing violence in Kwazulu/Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters St. Augustine's hospital at Durban after
paying a visit to wounded members from Zulu royal family, Mandela
said the best solution to Kwazulu/Natal violence was a political
solution.
</P>
<P>
Mandela visited Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini's second wife
Queen Buhle Ma-Mathe Zulu and his daughter Princess Sibusile Zulu
who were seriously hurt in an attack on their home at Kwamashu
north of Durban on April 25.
</P>
<P>
When asked about if measures would include the declaration of
a state of emergency in Kwazulu/Natal, the president said he
would discuss the matter with Safety and Security Minister Sydney
Mufamadi, police commissioner George Fivaz and provincial police
commissioner Chris Serfontein.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela declined to comment on who might be
responsible for the attack, adding ''it's clear that a political
organisation is involved. It's not just a question of ordinary
crime''.
</P>
<P>
He said nine men had been arrested and two weapons seized in
connection with the attack.
</P>
<P>
Mandela expressed his support for the calls by the African National
Congress in the province for a one-day strike on May 10 to show
respect for the king.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz held consultations here today with U.S. and French
ambassadors to his country on an international committee
monitoring cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his talks with the two ambassadors, Richard Johns
and Jean-Pierre Lafon, the foreign minister said he was briefed on
the U.S. and French ideas on the formation of a monitoring
committee supervising the cease-fire between Lebanon and the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri also held meetings in his
office today with the two ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz described the ideas delivered to him by the U.S. and
French diplomats as "principle, preliminary and undetailed,"
saying that they were about the ways to reach understandings
through the principle of exchanging messages and about the
mechanism of works for the committee supervising the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
According to the cease-fire agreement mediated by the United
States last week, which put an end to 16 days of Israeli military
operations in southern Lebanon, a monitoring committee
compromising the U.S., France, Israel, Syria and Lebanon would be
established to supervise the enforcement of the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"A crystalization of these ideas needs several days," said
Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister noted that his country was ready
to set up the committee as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
He declined to specify the details on the formation of the
committee, saying that "all the points are being studied by
countries concerned and the members in this committee."
</P>
<P>
On a recent statement made by Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres on Israel's readiness to help rebuild southern Lebanon,
the Lebanese foreign minister described the statement as "words
of more propaganda than serious suggestion."
</P>
<P>
He said that these words were "probably raised to satisfy
the world public opinion rather than to indicate real
intentions."
</P>
<P>
"It was better for those who expressed their readiness to
rebuild southern Lebanon to refrain from destroying the South,"
the Lebanese foreign minister pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Barak Suggests Delay of Israeli Redeployment from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud
Barak today proposed delaying army pullback from the West Bank
town of Hebron until after the May 29 general elections, reported
Israel Television.
</P>
<P>
During a tour of an open market in Tel Aviv, Barak said, "I
personally believe that it makes sense to delay it until after the
elections in order to reduce friction and reduce potential rift
between Israelis and Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
"It is part of our commitment to redeploy ultimately, but the
problem is when is the right time. I believe it is better to do so
after elections than before."
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement on expanding Palestinian self-rule in the
West Bank, Israel should have withdrawn from most parts of Hebron
before the end of March. But Israel unilaterally postponed its
pullback following a series of suicide bombings in Israel in a
nine-day period from February 25 and March March 4.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has come under mounting pressure for
the redeployment before the elections since the Palestinian
National Council voted to revoke all clauses of the Palestinian
National Charter calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
Tensions are escalating in Hebron after a 72-year-old Jewish
settler was stabbed Wednesday night while shopping in the city
market.
</P>
<P>
Settler leaders today traveled to Jerusalem in a bid to delay
army redeployment from Hebron. They have got support from Likud
and other opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who returned home Wednesday from a
trip to the U.S. and France, is due to hold a meeting to discuss
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the army is continuing to move items and essential
equipments out of the Civil Administration Headquarters in order
to be ready for the redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Inflation Rate Falls To 26.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's inflation rate fell
to 26.5 percent in March from 27.4 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
A monthly report issued here today by the Bank of Tanzania (BOT)
attributed the main cause of the fall as a decline in the prices of
food, clothing, water, fuel and power on flash consumer price index
(FCPI).
</P>
<P>
"The March 1996 inflation rate represents an improvement of 9.6
percentage points compared with the inflation rate of 36.1 percent
in March 1995, despite the fact that it remained above the desired
levels," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The FCPI was introduced last July to measure basket of prices in
four key cities in the country in order to produce a more responsive
guage of inflation.
</P>
<P>
The report said, "these developments coincide with the observed
decline in monetary growth resulting from the tight fiscal and
monetary policies."
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Tanzania's extended broad money supply
declined by 5.4 percent during March compared to a 0.4 percent
increase in March last year.
</P>
<P>
The main factor in the contraction of the money supply was a 7.9
percent decline from the previous month in the net domestic assets
of the banking system.  enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa expressed satisfaction today with Turkey's assurances
that the Turco-Israeli military training accord was "not a
military or strategic pact" that would upset the balances in the
volatile Middle East.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here following his talks with
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Foreign Minister Emre
Gonensay, Moussa said, "(We were told that) it was an agreement
like any military training agreement Turkey has signed with other
countries."
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely satisfied with the Turkish explanations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been among the vocal critics of the Turkish-Israeli
agreement which allows Israeli planes to use Turkish airspace for
training purposes.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's neighboring countries have expressed fear that Israeli
planes will use the Turkish airspace to gather intelligence on
Iran and Syria.
</P>
<P>
But the Turkish Foreign Ministry insists that the Israeli jets
will use the Turkish airspace without carrying electronic
monitoring equipment or arms.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that regional agreements should not
"upset the balances in the region" given the fragility of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
He conveyed a message from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to
Demirel. The message dealt with bilateral and regional issues,
among which was cooperation between Mediterranean countries.
</P>
<P>
On relations between Turkey and Syria, Moussa said, "Turkey and
Syria are neighbors. If they have problems, they have to be
discussed at the table."

BEIRUT, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
presided in his office tonight an extraordinary cabinet session
to discuss the situations following an end of the 16-day Israeli
military operations in Lebanon which claimed over 160 lives of
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Farid Mkari announced that the cabinet
studied the stages after the enforcement of a cease-fire between
Lebanon and Israel last Saturday, and the current contacts on the
formation of an international committee monitoring the cease-fire.
</P>

Assembly in New York, as well as his talks with French President
Jacques Chirac in Paris before he returned home Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mkari quoted the president as saying that "the attendance of
Lebanon at the highest level in the U.N. conference helped in
making (the international community) understand the Lebanese
problem and opening the case of massacres committed by Israel
against the innocents."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, on the other hand, informed the

bombardment on April 18 at a military camp of the
U.N. peacekeeping force at the southern Lebanese town of Qana
where some 110 Lebanese refugees were killed and more wounded.

million to 25 million US Dollars for social development programs
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Shib Jhie said that UNICEF had provided an aid of 146 million
US Dollars to Mozambique since 1987, of which 100 million Dollars
were from governmental and private donations while the rest 46
million Dollars were from UNICEF itself.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF assistance mainly contributes to developments of
public health, water supply, environmental maintenance, primary
education, rural development, information and mass media.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The 17th Conference of Africa's Timber
Organization opened in Caminda, northern Angola, today.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Prime Minister Marcolino Moco said at the
conference that more trees should be planted in Africa although
the continent abounds in forest.
</P>
<P>
Angola is rich in forest and other natural resources but
the country has been devastated by a protracted civil war, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, the recovery of the timber processing industry would
make full use of the forest resources of the country, adding
that the country's timber processing capacity would reach 600
cubic meters a day in near future.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be concluded tomorrow. At the conference,
representatives from the member states of the organization are
discussing new policies about timber processing, export and
import. enditem

<HEADLINE> Israel to Help Remove Mines from Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel will join the U.N. effort
in tracing and defusing mines in Angola, which have killed some
70,000 people in that country in the last two years, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak
during his meeting Wednesday night with his Angolan counterpart,
Juoro De Miranda, who is currently paying an official visit to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Barak said Israel was also looking into the possibility of
sending a medical team to fight malaria which has affected members
of the U.N. peacekeeping forces maintaining cease-fire in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, De Miranda had expressed Angola's interest in
expanding its international cooperation projects with Israel in
the fields of agriculture, health and education, the radio
added.
</P>
<P>
Angola also presented an unusual request that Israel send
experts to train their diplomatic corps noting that after years of
colonial rule they had not prepared a cadre of diplomats.
</P>
<P>
De Miranda today also met with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres, and delivered a letter from Angolan President Jose Dos
Santos expressing satisfaction over the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He was expected to give a similar epistle to Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat when they meet in
the Gaza Strip this evening.

<HEADLINE> Alleged International Cocaine Ring Smashed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Federal, state and local law
enforcement officers have smashed an international drug smuggling
and distribution network in the United States, the U.S. Justice
Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
About 130 people have been charged since September in operation
"Zorro II," with the last 15 arrested this morning in Los Angeles,
Chicago, El Paso, Houston and Midland, Texas.
</P>
<P>
Among those arrested since February are alleged key Cali,
Colombia, cartel figures Mauricio Gutierrez, arrested in Los
Angeles, and Hernan Aquilera and Pierre Remy, arrested in Miami.
</P>
<P>
Also arrested in Los Angeles was Rafael Alapizco, the alleged
organizer of the Mexican transportation network. Alapizco and
Jorge Valazquez, the alleged leader of a domestic distribution
network based in Chicago, were also arrested in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
A New York City police officer and a sergeant in the National
Guard were among those arrested in the operation.
</P>
<P>
Justice Department officials said that so far 5,598 kilograms
of cocaine powder, 1,018 pounds of marijuana and 730 grams of
crack cocaine have been seized.
</P>
<P>
The federal agents have also seized more than 17 million U.S.
dollars in cash and property from the drug ring, according to
Justice Department officials.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian cocaine was shipped from Colombia to Mexico where
the Mexican transportation and distribution group smuggled the
drugs across the border to the United States, Attorney General
Janet Reno said at a news conference held in the Justice
Department this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Once the cocaine arrived in the United States, it was stored in
Los Angeles for distribution by cartel agents, who delivered it
"to wholesale and retail buyers in such cities as Miami, Chicago,
Philadelphia, New York, Richmond and Newark (N.J.)," Justice
Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 state and local police agencies, the Drug
Enforcement administration, the FBI and seven other federal
agencies joined hands in the operation.
</P>
<P>
"It is an important example of the excellent work that occurs
when law enforcement agencies work together, and the partnership
that now exists between federal, state and local law enforcement
agencies," Reno said.

<HEADLINE> US Donates 8 Million Dollars for Bosnian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States has decided to
donate nearly 8 million U.S. dollars to help organize and carry
out elections in Bosnia, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Glyn Davies told a press briefing that 4
million U.S. dollars will go to the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which is organizing the elections.
</P>
<P>
The other nearly 4 million U.S. dollars will go to help the
Bosnian government to administer the election, build political
parties and advise the news media, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S.-brokered Bosnian peace agreement signed last
December, the former Yugoslav republic will hold elections in no
later than September this year.
</P>
<P>
The United States has already donated some 3 million U.S.
dollars for the Bosnian elections which are widely believed to be
a key test for the durability of the fragile peace accord reached
after three weeks of intense negotiations in Dayton, Ohio, last
November.

<HEADLINE> US Economy Grows Faster in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy grew at an
annual rate of 2.8 percent in the first three months of the year
as a result of stronger consumer and federal government spending,
the Commerce Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The strong gain in the gross domestic product -- the nation's
total output of goods and services -- was far above expectations
of a 1.5 percent to 1.8 percent rise, despite adverse effects
from a federal government shutdown, crippling snowstorms and a
major auto strike. It represented more than a fivefold increase
from an anemic 0.5 percent growth rate in last year's
October-December period.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commerce Department, the strength came in
renewed consumer spending, particularly for computer products, and
in business investment.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the total
economy, expanded 3.5 percent as compared with 1.2 percent in the
previous quarter. Spending by businesses soared 12.1 percent, way
up from 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter. Federal government
spending rose 6.7 percent after dropping 12.8 percent in the
fourth quarter. It was also believed that the pickups in spending
reflected a recovery of consumer's confidence following a number
of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserves in July, December
and January. Analysts said that as long as GDP growth remains
above 2 percent, the Fed is unlikely to lower interest rates
further.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter's economic performance meant welcome news at
the White House, but it was received in the Wall Street with
worries that rapid growth will lead to worsening inflation.
</P>
<P>
Laura Tyson, chief of the National Economic Council, described
the news as more evidence that Clinton's economic strategy "is
paying off."
</P>
<P>
However, the GDP report triggered a sharp sell-off on the Wall
Street. The Dow Jones industrial average was down nearly 70 points
in afternoon trading while yields on the Treasury Department's
benchmark 30-year bond shot above 7 percent to their highest
levels in a year.
</P>
<P>
"This is a shocking number," a corporation economist said. "It
is hard to know where the strength is coming from."

LUANDA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States will provides
Angola with 2.1 million US dollars for the mines clearance in
the southeastern Province of Kuando Kubango.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by US Ambassador to Angola Donald
Steinberg in the southeastern city of Menongue today.

</P>
<P>
It is reported that the two non-governmental organizations
have trained 70 soldiers into mine clearance technicians. And
50 others are being trained.
</P>
<P>
Kuando Kubango Province is one of the provinces where
numerous mines have been buried during the 19 year civil war.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa To Host World Information Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is to host an
international conference on information society and development
later this month.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by South African Minister of Posts,
Tele-communications and Broadcasting, Jay Naidoo today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria, Naidoo said the conference,
the first of its kind held in South Africa, would focus on
finding ways to use information technology in upgrading the
quality of life of the people across the world.
</P>
<P>
It would also aim at bridging the information gap between
developed and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arts, Culture, Science and Technology Minister Ben
Ngubane said the conference was an important development for the
Southern African region.
</P>
<P>
''Without a proper information system underpinning our
development, South Africa stands to be marginalized vis a vis the
developed world,'' said Ngubane.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad also said the conference,
which was not held in a developed country for the first time, was
an indication of the important role given to South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Still Raging Across Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Huge forest and grassland fires
are still raging across Mongolia, with 16 people dead, 60 burned
and 700 others homeless.
</P>
<P>
But the number of fires still burning has fallen from 75 last
week to 46 as some 24,000 people and more than 500 vehicles were
mobilized to fight the blazes.
</P>
<P>
Foreign aid has started to arrive in the country after appeals
earlier this week by the government for help to put out the fires
which have destroyed 32,900 square kilometers of forests and more
than 50,000 square kilometers of pasture land. But so far no
urgently needed fire-fighting equipment has arrived.
</P>
<P>
Mongolian Deputy Prime Minister Choijilsurengiyn Purevdorj told
a government meeting that 154 felt tents and 358 animal shelters
have also been destroyed by the fires which have been raging for
three weeks. There are still some 11,400 people still battling to
put out the remaining fires.
</P>
<P>
Mongolian President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat and Prime Minister
Puntsagiyn Jasray sent a joint message to the families of the fire
victims, expressing deep condolences to those killed and burned.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide drive to donate money and daily necessities has so
far raised 150 million tugriks (320,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the international community, including the United
Nations Department for Humanitarian Affairs, Britain, the United
States and Germany, have responded to Mongolia's appeal for help.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. DHA has sent an emergency grant of 30,000 dollars,
Britain 50,000 pounds (75,000 dollars), the United States and
Germany some 30,000 dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Red Cross Society has promised to donate 30,000
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Major Vows to Win General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
pledged today that his Tory party would win the general election
scheduled for next May despite its humiliating defeat in the local
elections.
</P>
<P>
It was announced early this morning that in the local elections
across England outside London held Thursday, the Tories lost 560
of the 1,092 seats they are defending.
</P>
<P>
They were dealt a big blow as Labor seized control of Basildon,
northeast of London, viewed as the heartland of Thatcherism in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Now the ruling Conservatives have no representation on some of
England's biggest city councils.
</P>
<P>
Major in a statement admitted that the local election results
were disappointing, but he complained that many Conservative
supporters failed to turn out and that his party would now have to
"work that much harder to capture votes."
</P>
<P>
He said he would stay to the general election and beyond to
allow the economic rewards of Tory policy to come through.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, his deputy Michael Heseltine dismissed speculation that
Major would be replaced as Tory leader because of the defeat.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Major would lead the Tory party to win the
general election and that he himself would help the embattled
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Michael Portillo called for an end to
in-fighting within the Tory party and urged the whole party to
rally around Major.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC TV, Portillo, seen as a right-winger in the
cabinet, said the European issue had to be debated, but the party
should not be divided on this matter.

<HEADLINE> Growth of UK Economy to Pick Up in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The British economy is poised for a
pre-election recovery but will suffer a tightening in interest
rate policy next year, the latest forecast from the London
Business School (LBS) said today.
</P>
<P>
The LBS predicts growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of 2.4
percent this year, well below the government's forecast of 3
percent. But GDP growth will reach 3.2 percent in 1997, thanks to
a big increase in consumer spending, which the LBS forecasts will
rise by 3.3 percent this year and by 3.4 percent in 1997, when the
next general election is due.
</P>
<P>
But the report concludes that this will not signal the return
of a late 1980s style consumer boom, when consumer spending was
rising at a rate of 5 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
The recovery will also coincide with growth in Europe, the
U.S. and Japan in 1997, pushing Britain's export volumes higher
through 1996, though more moderately than in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the LBS forecast says growth in 1997 will cause concern
over rising inflation. It predicts that interest rates will need
to be increased by an incoming government to combat inflation and
this will slow GDP growth in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
The LBS argues that the inflationary pressures of higher growth
next year will be a strong challenge to an incoming Labor
government, although the report does not foresee a large shift in
macro-economic policies.

<HEADLINE> Star Field Hockey Player's HK Career Seems Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The international field career of
talented Hong Kong field hockey player Arfan Pervez seems to be
over due to his poor disciplinary record.
</P>
<P>
The fullback's record prompted the Hong Kong Hockey Association
to bar him from representing Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
However, the 25-year-old Pervez, who was banned for eight
months earlier this year for rough play and bringing the game into
disrepute, will be allowed to play for his club Shaheen after
serving out the suspension.
</P>
<P>
According to Con Conway, president of the association, the
organization would not select him for the Hong Kong team because
of his behavior.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot have a player who had a bad record at an
international level as well as in Hong Kong. So we have decided
not to select him in the future," he said, although he admitted
that Pervez was a "talented player".
</P>
<P>
According to an investigation carried out by the association's
council, the player has received five yellow cards and two red
cards in the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
John Stapley, the Hong Kong team's manager, said he had even
managed to keep him out of the game to let him cool down.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfair for them to do this to me," Pervez said, after
learning of the decision. He would appeal to the association, he
said.

<HEADLINE> US Unemployment Rate Down in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in the U.S.
dropped to 5.4 percent in April, the lowest level since February
1995, the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 5.4 percent unemployment rate for April was an improvement
from 5.6 percent in March and was the lowest jobless rate in the
past 14 months since it was an identical 5.4 percent in February of
1995.
</P>
<P>
But the report said that gain in payroll jobs was only 2,000
and far below the huge increases of 178,000 in March and 631,000
in February, which had been the biggest one-month rise in 12
years.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in April was mainly due to a heavy job loss in
construction and manufacturing sectors. Jobs in service industries
were up only 20,000 in the month, far below the 125,000 average
gain of the previous three months. Some service businesses such as
temporary help firms that normally add workers in spring did not
do so this year.
</P>
<P>
The report on employment came a day after the U.S. government
announced that the overall economy as measured by the gross
domestic product surged upward at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in
the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Economists in the country are predicting the future increase of
interest rates as the U.S. economy is picking up quickly.
</P>
<P>
While some economists said the first rate hike could come
earlier when the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) held its policy-making
meeting on May 21, most of them said rate increases were not
likely until the July or August meetings.

the progress in the ongoing crackdown on crime, and extended his
regards to judicial personnel and the public security officers.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that priority should be given to cracking down on
serious criminal cases and criminal gangs. He added that serious
criminal cases have become endemic in some places, which greatly
endangers the interests of the people.
</P>
<P>
He called on the concerned departments to take every resolute
means possible to curb the rising trend of serious crimes and make
people feel at ease by drastically improving the social order.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision of the CPC Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin as the core to launch a nationwide crackdown on crime
has been welcomed by the broad masses of the people.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that Beijing is the capital, and political and
cultural center of the country, so it is extremely important to
maintain social order and stability here.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the judicial organs and the public
security officers in Beijing would achieve fruitful results in
cracking down on crime, to the satisfaction of the people and the
CPC Central Committee.

<HEADLINE> Indian EC Orders Repolling at 123 Booths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Election Commission today
ordered repolling at 123 polling stations in over 31 parliamentary
constituencies in six states where elections were held Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While repolling would be held in 96 polling stations in Andhra
Pradesh, Rajasthan and Karnataka Saturday, fresh polls would be
conducted in 27 polling booths in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh
and West Bengal Sunday, Deputy Election Commissioner Subas Pani
said here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Repolling has been ordered in view of instances of violence and
poll malpractices including booth capturing, snatching of ballot

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Counterattacks Iraqi Charge of Spying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today again strongly
counterattacked Iraq's claim about establishing a network of
Kuwaiti spies in Iraqi territories.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Kuwait News Agency (KUNA), Kuwaiti
Interior Minister Sheikh Ali al-Sabah said claims made by Iraqis
about the alleged location of a network of Kuwaiti spies in
Iraq "is a new play intended to distract public attention from the
tragic situation of the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah said "such conducts indicate this regime's failure to
respect laws of the international legitimacy and its neighbors."
</P>
<P>
Iraq claimed last month that it had arrested several spies
working for Kuwait and it published photographs and names of the
alleged spies.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait immediately denied that it had sent to or recruited any
espionage personnel in Iraq which invaded the small emirate in
August 1990 and occupied it for seven months.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti interior minister today also criticized attacks by
Iraqis on a Kuwaiti border post last month, saying the incidents
were created by members of the Iraqi intelligence who "desperately
tried to destabilize security in the country."
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors are still locked in the dispute on the
outstanding issue of more than 600 missing kuwaiti
nationals. Kuwait held that these people were detained in Iraq
during the 1990-1991 Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, while Baghdad
categorically denied it.

<HEADLINE> Sotheby's Spring Auction Shows Upturn in HK Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Fine Chinese art objects and
jewelry worth nearly 160 million HK dollars (20.64 million US
dollars) changed hands at Sotheby's Spring auctions in Hong Kong,
which was held here from April 29 to May 2.
</P>
<P>
Julian Thompson, co-chairman of Sotheby's Asia Business, said
today that the grand total achieved for the four-day series of
sales represents an increase of 72 percent over the same sale
series in Spring last year.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The sales which have ended on a very optimistic note
clearly show that the market in Hong Kong is in a decisive
upturn."
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong is still the leading auction center in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong private collectors remain to be the dominant players,
especially in the fields of jewelry, Chinese paintings and
ceramics, but there is also strong bidding from Taiwan, Singapore
and Malaysia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the nine different categories of Chinese art and jewelry on
offer, Chinese ceramics posted the highest total sales, fetching
over 40 million HK dollars (5.16 million US dollars) for the 144
lots sold.
</P>
<P>
The two top lots in the whole series are a fine and rare blue
and white "phoenix" dish from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) which
was sold for 3.76 million HK dollars (485,000 US dollars) to a
Chinese collector, and a double-strand jadeite bead necklace
belonging to an old Shanghainese collection which was bought by a
Hong Kong collector for 3.76 million HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sale of postage stamps realized 21.5 million
HK dollars (2.77 million US dollars), setting the record for the
highest total ever achieved for a stamp auction in Hong Kong.

<P>
CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
returned home this afternoon after concluding a two-day visit to
Turkey, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return here, Moussa told reporters that he would
submit a detailed report on the results of his visit to Turkey to
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the illustrations and assurances given by the
Turkish government on the recently-signed Turkish-Israeli military
agreement unveiled that a sort of distortion and exaggeration has
pervaded the announcement of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
This was asserted by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz, Foreign Minister Emre Gonensay and Defense
Minister Oltan Sungurlu during his talks with them, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
While in Ankara, Moussa expressed his satisfaction at the
explanation Turkish President Demirel gave to him regarding the
Turkish-Israeli military agreement in an interview with MENA
before his departure.
</P>
<P>
On the Egyptian-Turkish relations, Moussa said they are
expected to witness a great improvement in different domains due
to the roles played by the two countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's visit to Ankara took place within the framework of the
consultation mechanism existing between Egypt and Turkey.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plane Spied on French Military Facilities: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The French Defense Ministry has
dismissed allegations that a U.S. spy plane flew over several
sensitive military installations in France in March.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. U-2 spy plane flew over and photographed a nuclear
warhead assembly plant, a tank testing ground and an airbase, a
front page report in the French newspaper Liberation said today,
quoting "reliable military sources".
</P>
<P>
French military officers were angered by the U.S. action,
saying Americans should not believe that they can do whatever they
want in France.
</P>
<P>
The report said the U.S. plane took off from the Fairham
military base in Britain and flew over the nuclear center in
Valduc, where France produces its nuclear warheads, an air base in
Dijon and a tank testing ground Roanive.
</P>
<P>
French air force radars followed the plane for several hours,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
But both the French Defense Ministry and the U.S. Embassy in
Paris have denied the report.
</P>
<P>
Liberation claims U.S. intelligence agencies became interested
in the French sites after they found two British Hercules cargo
planes flew to Dijon on March 16, picked up cargo and flew back to
Britain, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Americans suspected that the cargo might be nuclear
equipment for Trident missiles needed by Britain, which the United
States had refused to supply.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been keeping a close eye on intensified
Franco-British nuclear weapons cooperation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. air force was quoted in the article as saying the
plane's pilots were just burning fuel before landing, but the
French air force was not satisfied with this excuse.
</P>
<P>
France pulled out of NATO's integrated military structure in
1966. But in 1994, France for the first time allowed five U.S. air
refueling planes to be deployed in its Istres air base in southern
France. At the start of this year it permitted three U.S. U-2 spy
planes to be deployed in the base to supervise situations in
Bosnia and Liberia.

<HEADLINE> 3,000 Pakistanis Face End Stage Renal Failure Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 3 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 3,000 Pakistanis
suffer End Stage Renal Failure (ESRF) annually, revealed a
demographic report in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation's (SIUT) latest
news magazine said that the mean age of patients with ESRD in
Pakistan is 32.
</P>
<P>
These patients, with a male to female ratio of 3:1, are
usually diagnosed late and, if not treated, will live miserably
suspended between life and death till an ultimate treatment is
sought in the form of organ replacement.
</P>
<P>
The report said that it was usually the family member who
appear as prospective donor but often owing to various reasons a
suitable donor may not be available.
</P>
<P>
It added that since organ retrieval from the dead is not yet
legalized in the country, the misery of a large number of patients
and their respective families continues unabated.
</P>
<P>
Dialysis, another alternate for treating ESRD, is costly as all
equipment and disposables have to be imported, thus leading a
significant number of patients to be trapped by traditional health
care providers and quacks making the situation more acute.
</P>
<P>
SIUT sources maintained that renal transplantation offers a
cost-effective mode of treatment to end stage renal failure.
</P>
<P>
Despite some possibility of certain complications, the
transplantation largely affords a near normal and dialysis-free
life to successfully grafted patients.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts maintain that there is therefore a definite
place for transplantation for a developing country like Pakistan.
There is need to expand this facility by the use of cadaveric
donors in the future to benefit hundreds of patients in dialysis.
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan a number of centers in major cities such as
Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi are running successful renal
transplantation programs.
</P>
<P>
In one of the centers in Karachi, despite financial and
societal problems, over 400 renal transplants have been performed.

<HEADLINE> Stronger Earthquake in Inner Mongolia Unlikely: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The possibility of a stronger
earthquake occurring in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region, where an earthquake measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale
took place this morning, is small, according to experts from the
State Seismology Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
However, the experts did not exclude the possibility of strong
aftershocks measuring around five on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
At 11:32 a.m. today the quake struck an area near Baotou City.
</P>
<P>
The force of the quake was felt in Beijing, Xi'an, Taiyuan and
Yinchuan cities.
</P>
<P>
It caused eight deaths and nearly 100 people were injured, and
dozens of houses were damaged, according to official figures
available so far.
</P>
<P>
A working group of the SSB headed by Deputy Director Tang Quan
has rushed to the disaster-affected area to investigate the
situation and assist the local government in relief work.
</P>
<P>
Head of the SSB's Analysis and Prediction Center Ding Jianhai
said the focus of the earthquake today was 33 km below the earth's
surface, which is why it was widely felt but caused relatively
small damage in the epicenter area.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the SSB tend to believe that earthquakes stronger
than five on the Richter scale will not occur in the Chinese
capital region in May, and that the possibility of such a quake
happening this year is not big, according to Ding.
</P>
<P>
However, Ding said, experience shows that earthquake activities
in China have been increasing both in frequency and intensity.
</P>
<P>
Up to today China has registered 17 quakes measuring above five
on the Richter scale this year, and six of them measured above six
on the Richter scale, compared to three or four such quakes in an
average year.
</P>
<P>
The whole world has entered a period of active quakes, Ding
said. In 1995 33 quakes measuring above seven on the Richter scale
were reported worldwide, compared to the average of 18 for the
years before in this century.
</P>
<P>
And by May 3, 11 quakes stronger than seven on the Richter
scale had occured worldwide this year.
</P>
<P>
"We are keeping a close watch on the trend, and hope that
further research will be able to yield more information,"  Ding
said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Fights Hepatitis-A Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine has announced emergency
measures to check the spread of hepatitis A and other intestinal
infectious diseases in the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The measures include restoring water supplies damaged by
flooding, improving the quality of drinking water and more
stringent hygiene standards for food products.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2,500 people in the Ukraine suffered from severe
intestinal infectious disease in March alone, figures from the
government commission for ecological security and emergency
affairs.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April, 500 cases of hepatitis A were recorded in
Sevastopol in the Crimea Autonomous Republic.
</P>
<P>
Experts have attributed the outbreak of the diseases to
contaminated drinking water and poor hygiene in food preparation.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey showed that in some parts of the country, only
80 to 90 percent of drinking water complies with hygiene
standards.

HONG KONG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange today dropped 195.66 points to close at 10,734.
</P>
<P>
The sharp decline of Hang Seng Index, a key indicator for blue
chips at the local bourse, was said to be caused by a 70-point
plunging on the Wall Street in the United States.
</P>
<P>
All the four major Hang Seng sub-indices fell today with
finance down 206 points to 9,981, utilities decreasing 177 points
to 10,506, properties plunging 407 points to 19,744, and the
industrials and commercials down 116 points to 8,060.

Meanwhile, today's Hang Seng China Enterprises Index and Hang
Seng MidCap 50 Index dropped 26 and 13 points to 842 and 1,353
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts said that the downward tendency on Hong Kong
stock market were mainly caused by the plummeting of sub-indices
of properties and finances.

<HEADLINE> Ramos' Approval Rating Up </HEADLINE>

<P>
MANILA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos'
rating of approval in running the government reached 42 percent in
a random survey conducted among 500 respondents by Krystal
Research for the period of April 13-14.
</P>
<P>
This was a dramatic improvement by as much as 18 percentage
points from January's approval rating of 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that 25 percent of the respondents
disapproved the way Ramos runs the government.
</P>
<P>
But this was lower than the 34 percent disapproval registered
in January.
</P>
<P>
Simeon Ventura, founder-consultant of Krystal Research, said
today that the uptrend could be attributed primarily to Ramos'
decisive action in accepting the resignation of the health and
tourism secretaries whose appointments were by-passed by the
Commission on Appointments.

<HEADLINE> EC to Harmonize Consumer Credit Cost Comparisons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) plans
to harmonize the way consumer credit costs are compared across
member states to clear up confusion.
</P>
<P>
The change will allow consumers across the EU to compare
different credit offers of varying amounts and duration.
</P>
<P>
The EU's proposal will coordinate the mathematical formula for
calculating the annual percentage rate of charge (APR), which is
the total cost of credit to the consumer, including interest and
other charges, expressed as an annual percentage of the amount of
credit granted.
</P>
<P>
All EU member states, except Germany, France and Finland,
presently use the "Community-formula".
</P>
<P>
The use of different formulas has resulted in different APRs
even though the amount of credit and the repayments are identical.
</P>
<P>
For example, the German method produces a higher rate than the
Community method, while the French method produces a lower one.
</P>
<P>
The EC proposed today to confirm the "Community-formula" for
the calculation of APR; to increase the formula's accuracy by
using a 365 day year and 2 decimal places formula); to use a logo
(a percentage sign surrounded by twelve stars) in addition to the
term APR.

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Slams US for Putting China in Special 301 Slot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China today criticized the
"irrational" action taken by the United States to list China once
again as a priority foreign country under "Special 301" for
intellectual property rights (IPR) in 1996, pointing out that
"China firmly opposes the action".
</P>
<P>
A spokesman with China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC), noted that the US government made
the announcement on April 30, criticizing China as lacking IPR
protection and threatening trade retaliation.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that since China and the US signed an
agreement on IPR one year ago, China has comprehensively and
earnestly implemented its obligations under the agreement
by making more efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
With the publication of a series of laws and regulations in
this field and the improvement of law-enforcement and supervision,
he said, China has strengthened the management over IPR, dealt
with a large number of cases of violation and severely punished
those responsible.
</P>
<P>
While cleaning up the retail market, China also cracked down
on production and distribution centers and closed a number of
enterprises involved, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the past year China has made great achievements in
IPR protection and effectively put IPR violations under control,
said the spokesman, adding that China's efforts in this regard have
won recognition and appreciation worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Facing the unjustified accusation of the US, he noted, China
took into consideration the overall Sino-US situation and
conducted several negotiations with the US side, briefing it on
China's policy and achievements in IPR protection.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is utterly unreasonable for the US to
list China once again as a priority under "Special 301" and
threaten trade retaliation.
</P>
<P>
He said that China holds that a trade threat can not help solve
the problem, but will bring about a serious impact on bilateral
economic and trade relations; it will also harm the US' interests.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that if the US goes so far as to implement
its trade retaliation, China will, according to its foreign trade
law, take countermeasures to safeguard its sovereignty and
national esteem.
</P>
<P>
The US side should bear all the consequences rising therefrom,
he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Worms, Flies Help Research on Human Heart Defects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The hearts of worms and flies are so
similar to those of humans that study of these lowly creatures can
shed light on the cause of cardiac defects that strike one birth
in every hundred, a paper in the journal Science said today.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Deepak Srivastava of Texas University said the nematode
worm has a digestive pump that has a great deal in common with
human heart muscle.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the fruit fly has a simple heart consisting of a
tube that contracts, like the human heart at an early stage of its
foetal development, before the tube folds and loops to form
chambers.
</P>
<P>
"It uses the same genetic machinery to form these heart cells
that pump as we do", he said.
</P>
<P>
"The very earliest events in forming that tube are exactly the
same events that we use. Our heart, at a very early stage, is
exactly like the fruit fly heart, only we go on to develop
further," he added.
</P>
<P>
Identification of the genes involved in the development of the
heart in a wide range of creates will help researchers gain a
better understanding of birth defects in the cardiac system.

VISBY, Sweden, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Countries bordering the Baltic
Sea started a two-day summit in Sweden today on a wide range of
issues from the environment to democracy and international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The heads of government of 11 member countries of the Council
of the Baltic Sea States will also discuss the findings of the
recent Baltic Sea Business Summit.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Lamberto Dini, whose country holds the
rotating European Union (EU) presidency, and Jacques Santer,
president of the European Commission, are also attending the
Summit on the island of Gotland off the south east coast of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The Council of the Baltic Sea States, established in
Copenhagen, Denmark in 1992, groups Sweden, Finland, Russia,
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Germany, Denmark, Norway and
Iceland. The Council has close cooperation with the EU.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, en route to the summit, said today he did not
believe the three Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania
would join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) but ruled
out any military action against them if they did.
</P>
<P>
"We are categorically against the expansion of NATO
(eastwards)," Chernomyrdin said, adding that he had raised what
he called mistreatment of Russians in Estonia and Latvia during
talks with Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson.
</P>
<P>
Both Estonia and Latvia have large Russian minorities who were
mostly denied automatic citizenship of the newly-independent
countries in 1991.

CANBERRA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Australia reaffirmed its aid
support for Papua New Guinea (PNG) as Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer signed a series of new agreements with PNG during his visit
to the country.
</P>
<P>
Downer reaffirmed the Australian government's commitment to
providing a 300-million-Australian-dollar (237-million-US-dollar)
annual aid to the South Pacific island nation during his meeting
with PNG Prime Minister Julius Chan today, the Australian
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
He promised to try to keep aid to PNG intact from the
Australian government's planned 8-billion-Australian-dollar
(6.32-billion-US-dollar) budget cuts over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Downer also signed an agreement with PNG Finance Minister Chris

rose 15 percent to 191 million U.S. dollars in the first quarter
of 1996 against the same period last year, the State Statistics
Bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly caused by a 61 percent rise in imports
from 58 million dollars to 91 million dollars, while exports
increased by just one percent to 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned the government that if exports remain
stagnant, foreign reserves will fall and could lead to a trade
deficit.

Russia remained Mongolia's main trading partner, followed by

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Eight principal culprits in five
serious criminal cases were executed here today, following a
public announcement of their sentences by the First Intermediate
People's Court of the Beijing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Supreme People's Court identified the eight
executed as escapers from jails, ex-criminals or jobless persons
who had committed major burglaries, bank robberies, gang violence
or murders.
</P>
<P>
One of the them, Zhao Duoguo, was a former security guard. He
was found guilty of robbing 248,000 yuan from a bank security van
at gunpoint on November 24, 1995.
</P>
<P>
They were ruthless criminals who posed serious threats to life
and property, and it was imperative to punish them in accordance
with the law, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The executions were part of a nationwide crackdown on serious
crimes launched last month by law-enforcement departments.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- FIFA president Joao Havelange was
believed to firmly oppose European members' proposal that South
Korea and Japan should co-host the 2002 World Cup, reports
reaching here said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"As the president has already stated, co-hosting is against the
rules of FIFA," a FIFA spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The 80-year-old Havelange is expected to try and block any
attempt to have the rules changed before June 1, when the venue of
the 2002 World Cup will be decided in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have launched fierce bidding campaign and
tried hard to convince the 21-man FIFA executive committee to

<P>
Last month, all eight European members of the FIFA executive
committee joined the growing list and wrote to Havelange calling
for co-hosting.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Fine Chinese art objects and
jewelry worth nearly 160 million HK dollars (20.64 million US
dollars) changed hands at Sotheby's Spring auctions in Hong Kong,
which was held here from April 29 to May 2.
</P>
<P>
Julian Thompson, co-chairman of Sotheby's Asia Business, said
today that the grand total achieved for the four-day series of
sales represents an increase of 72 percent over the same sale
series in Spring last year.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The sales which have ended on a very optimistic note
clearly show that the market in Hong Kong is in a decisive
upturn."
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong is still the leading auction center in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong private collectors remain to be the dominant players,
 especially in the fields of jewelry, Chinese paintings and
ceramics, but there is also strong bidding from Taiwan, Singapore
and Malaysia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the nine different categories of Chinese art and jewelry on
offer, Chinese ceramics posted the highest total sales, fetching
over 40 million HK dollars (5.16 million US dollars) for the 144
lots sold.
</P>
<P>
The two top lots in the whole series are a fine and rare blue
and white "phoenix" dish from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) which
was sold for 3.76 million HK dollars (485,000 US dollars) to a
Chinese collector, and a double-strand jadeite bead necklace
belonging to an old Shanghainese collection which was bought by a
Hong Kong collector for 3.76 million HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sale of postage stamps realized 21.5 million
HK dollars (2.77 million US dollars), setting a record for the
highest total ever achieved for a stamp auction in Hong
Kong.

<HEADLINE> UK Tories Routed in Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ruling Conservative party
suffered a disastrous defeat in the local elections, as they did
last year, after voters dumped more than half of their councillors.
</P>
<P>
The Tories lost 560 of the 1,092 seats they were defending and
now have no representation on some of England's biggest city
councils.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's local elections which were held across England,
excluding London, were regarded as the biggest test of public
opinion on party performance before the next general election.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,031 seats were contested in 150 councils, of which
the Tories had control of only four before the vote.
</P>
<P>
The Tories were left with 532 seats but only lost control of
one authority. The opposition Labor Party, defending 1,256 seats,
gained more than 450 seats and took control of a further 11 hung
councils, giving them control of 86 authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democrats, defending 467 seats, gained a further
145 and took control of six previously hung councils, bringing
their total to 25. Independents and other small parties were
defending 165 seats and there were 51 new seats.
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives were dealt a major blow as Labor seized
control of Basildon, northeast of London, viewed as the heartland
of Thatcherism in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The results gave Labor 43 percent of the national vote, the
Tories 27 percent, up 3 percent from last year and the Liberal
Democrats 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
After the results were announced, Deputy Prime Minister Michael
Heseltine dismissed speculation that Prime Minister John Major
would be replaced as Tory leader because of the defeat.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the local election results should not be looked
on as a trend to the general election.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Major would lead the Tories to win the
general election and that he himself would help the embattled
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Tony Blair hailed his party's "spectacular" gains
in the local elections as proof that Major's government was weak
and incompetent.
</P>
<P>
But Blair also warned his party that there was no room for
complacency.
</P>
<P>
"The general election is not over until it is finally won," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The press here generally consider that disunity and divisions
have led the Tories to the defeat and the results of the local
elections could determine the survival of Major's administration
and the timing of the general election which must be held by May
1997 at the latest.

SOFIA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A top Bulgarian soccer club official
said on Friday that corruption and intimidation were rife in the
soccer game in his country.
</P>
<P>
Tomas Lafchis, president of Levski Sofia club, said in a news
conference that the whole of Bulgaria knew how officials or
players at first and second division matches had been bribed.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) of failing to
act against the corruption and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption has already great dimensions and intimidation is
rife in Bulgarian football," Lafchis said.
</P>
<P>
Lafchis ordered his players off the pitch 15 minutes from
the end of Wednesday's Bulgarian Cup final against Slavia in
protest at the refereeing.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the BFU declared Slavia 4-0 winners, adding three
goals to the 1-0 scoreline at the time of the walkout, and
awarded them the Cup.
</P>
<P>
Lafchis was fined 100,000 levs (1,000 U.S. dollars) while his
Levski club were docked 30,000 levs (300 U.S. dollars) and an
additional 30,000 levs for its officials going on the pitch
without permission.
</P>
<P>
Levski were involved in a separate row last Saturday when fans
threw a live snake at a referee. Fighting also broke out in the
players' tunnel.

BONN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- World number two Thomas Muster of
Austria beat Australia's rising star Mark Philippoussis 6-3, 0-6,
6-2 to reach the semi-finals of the Munich Open tennis
tournament on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old French Open champion swept the last three games
to wrap up the first set after the 19-year-old Australian levelled
at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis, who defeated world number one Pete Sampras at
the Australian Open, pressed Muster hard in the second, without
giving the clay-court specialist any chance.
</P>
<P>
But the world 31st ranked Philippoussi faded in the third set
before Muster sealed the win with ease.
</P>
<P>
Muster has not lost on clay since the final at Kitzbuehel last
August, when he went down in five sets to Spain's Alberto Costa.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Bond Index Down in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The HSBC Markets Hong Kong Bond
Index fell in April to 113.91, a drop of 0.06 percent from March,
according to the latest release by HSBC (the Hongkong and Shanghai
 Banking Corporation) Market.
</P>
<P>
The sub-index for Hong Kong Government papers declined by 0.01
percent and that for non-Hong Kong Government papers by 0.09
percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the level at the end of April 1995, the overall
index increased by 10.3 percent, the sub-index for Hong Kong
Government papers by 8.1 percent and that for non-Government
papers by 11.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Compiled monthly and introduced in April, the index is intended
 to provide a broad-based yardstick for fund managers and other
investors to measure investment performance in the rapidly
expanding Hong Kong dollar debt market. The index for December
31, 1993 was set as 100.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the HSBC Market said that early in April, the
Hong Kong bond market tumbled in line with US treasuries. That was
 after the release of stronger-than-expected US March employment
figures, which effectively dampened hopes of a further interest
rate reduction.
</P>
<P>
He said that trading was lackluster and investors remained
interested largely in the shorter maturities. Selling pressures
on longer-dated papers resulted in the local yield curve becoming
steeper and the yield spread between the Hong Kong dollar and US
dollar papers growing wider.

ALMA ATA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kazakh government and U.S. oil
giant Mobil today signed an agreement to exploit the world's sixth
largest oilfield.
</P>
<P>
The government and Mobil will each hold a 25 percent stake in
the exploitation project of the Tengiz Oilfield, the country's

Baldimbaev said at the signing ceremony, which was overseen by
Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazerbayev and Prime Minister
Akezhan Kazhegeldin.
</P>

LAGOS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Federal Ministry of
Agriculture has assured farmers in the country of adequate
fertilizer supply, saying it has no plan to marginalize any state

A statement issued by the ministry yesterday in the capital of

from the on-going distribution.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the current allocation of
fertilizer is being made for the federation of selected agrarian
areas when they require the commodity for this farming season.
</P>
<P>
The method is part of the on-going rationalization of
fertilizer distribution aiming at ensuring that only farmers get

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ships More Heavy Oil to DPRK Under Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States has shipped
another 44,000 tons of heavy oil to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) as part of a 1994 nuclear accord, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The oil arrived at the ports of Son Bong and Cheng Jin in
dispatches on April 22 and 29, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed between the DPRK and the U.S.-led
Korean Peninsular Energy Development Organization (KEDO) in New
York in October 1994, Washington agreed to provide two light-water
reactors and heavy oil as fuel energy to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
In return, the DPRK promised to phase out its graphite reactors
capable of producing materials that can be used to make nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is to ship an annual 500,000 tons of heavy oil to the
DPRK until the first light-water reactor is finished and begins to
generate power.
</P>
<P>
So far the United States has provided 320,000 tons of heavy oil
to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, other reports said American technicians, under
the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency, have
removed some 8,000 waste nuclear fuel rods from nuclear facilities
in Nyong Byon to the north of Pyongyang. The action is also a part
of the New York agreement.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Vice-Chairman Meets HK Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, reaffirmed the stand here today that the core of the
Taiwan question is a matter of whether the "one-China" principle
is recognized or not.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is also head of the United Front Work Department of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, said, "we
believe that if this principle is safeguarded, a solution to the
Taiwan question and to the question of relations across the Taiwan
Straits can finally be found.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came at a meeting with a delegation from Hong
Kong's Tsung Tsin Association, led by its president, Paul
S.W.Wong, here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Wang said, "We will resolutely adhere to the 'one-China'
principle and firmly implement the eight-point proposal on the
promotion of the reunification of the motherland put forward by
President Jiang Zemin."
</P>
<P>
On the Hong Kong issue, he said that there are a little more
than 400 days left before China resumes sovereignty over Hong
Kong, and Hong Kong residents, from all walks of life, want
stability. So does the Central Government, he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Hong Kong, when governed by wise
and intelligent people from among Hong Kong residents from
mid-1997, will surely maintain its prosperity and stability, and
the "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong governed by the Hong
Kong people" principles, as well as a high-degree autonomy will be
earnestly implemented.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Peres Fails to Make Decision on Immediate Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Shimon Peres
appears to be hesitant in deciding on the immediate redeployment
from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Peres conducted consultations with top generals and security
officials this morning on whether to implement the over-due
redeployment or put it off until after the May 29 general
elections.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was to have been held yesterday, took place
amid reports of conflicting views over the right time for
withdrawal. Peres was caught up in two assessments among senior
leaders of the country's security establishment.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio, a statement issued at the end of the
meeting affirmed Israel's commitment to redeployment of forces in
Hebron in accordance with the Oslo agreement.
</P>
<P>
It said Israel will take responsibility for those areas where
Jews reside and for the Cave of Patriarchs and there is no
intention to evacuate Jewish settlers from the city.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Ori Orr told the radio that withdrawal
will probably take place after the elections in order to prevent
violence in the city. Jewish settlers in the city and nearby
Kiryat Arba have threatened to take actions to block the army
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo 2 agreement, Israel should have completed
redeployment from the city by the end of March. But Peres delayed
it indefinitely following the bus bombings in Israel in late
February and early March. He also conditioned it on the
Palestinian National Council changing its charter which called
for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
Peres has second thoughts on Hebron withdrawal apparently out
of consideration of the forthcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
The Peace Now movement reacted sharply to the prime minister's
tendency to postpone Hebron redeployment until after the
elections. In a message to Peres, the group demanded an immediate
implementation of the Oslo agreement.

LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Football fan Matthew Simmons was
released from jail on Friday, 24 hours after being sentenced to
seven-days in jail for attacking a lawyer in court.
</P>
<P>
Crystal Palace fan Simmons assaulted his prosecutor Jeffrey
McCann on Thursday when he was found guilty of using threatening
words and behaviour prior to being attacked by Manchester
United's Eric Cantona last year.
</P>
<P>
But sentencing rules followed by the prison service and
the approaching bank holiday weekend meant Simmons was free to go
after just one day.
</P>
<P>
Prison Service spokesman Len Cockburn explained: "A normal
person in normal circumstances will only ever serve half his
sentence.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, a person sent to prison for a week on Thursday is
due to be released on the Sunday and as we do not release
prisioners at weekends, that person would be free to go on the
Friday."

<HEADLINE> Official on Localization of Macao Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MACAO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official said that pace
of the localization of Macao's middle and senior civil servants
should be quickened.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
said Thursday night that the Macao Government's recent move to
localize all positions of section chief and group head of the
Macao Government by the end of the year is a good sign.
</P>
<P>
"Any move contributing to the localization of civil servants
of Macao is welcomed," he said, while meeting with dozens of Macao
members of the All-China Youth Federation on the occasion to mark
the 77th anniversary of the Chinese Youth Day (May 4th).
</P>
<P>
But, he pointed out that the process of localization of civil
service posts should be conducted in a quicker pace among middle
and senior civil servants, whose positions are higher than section
chief or group head.
</P>
<P>
"The main task of the localization of civil servants is the
localization of middle and senior civil servants," he stressed.
"More servants whose native language is Chinese should enter those
ranks, according to the proportion of local residents."
</P>
<P>
He said that the localization of civil servants will help
promote the localization of law and the use of Chinese as an
official language.
</P>
<P>
China will resume its exercise of sovereignty over Macao in
less than four years, and the task of localizing civil service and
law and the use of Chinese as official language is still heavy,
according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
 Macao now has more than 17,000 civil servants. The
localization process started in 1987 when a joint declaration on
Macao was signed by the governments of China and Portugal.

<HEADLINE> Attempt to Separate Lebanon from Syria Doomed to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
stressed here today that any attempt to separate Lebanon from
Syria is doomed to failure due to emotions of the two peoples and
common interests between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hariri was quoted by the Beirut "Voice of Lebanon" radio as
saying, "Any attempt to separate Lebanon from Syria is one which
will easily fail because it ignores the feelings of the citizens
and the common interests between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that his country had provided martyrs for the
presence and continuity of itself.
</P>
<P>
Meeting a medical delegation of the Syrian ruling Baath party
in his office, the Lebanese premier underlined that the common
interests between Lebanon and Syria "have been existing since a
long time and will continuously exist in the future."
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the political and logistic support of Syria and
Lebanon's other friends, Lebanon managed to thwart goals of the
Israeli aggressions (in this country in the last month)," the
Lebanese prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a cease-fire understanding reached between Lebanon
and the Jewish state last Friday, Hariri hoped that "What had
happened will be the end of the Israeli aggressions against
Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that Syria and Lebanon would recover their
territories from the Israeli occupation "as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Marwan Hamadeh, Lebanese minister of public health who
attended the meeting, thanked Syrian President Hafez Assad and
the Syrian medical team for the efforts they had exerted in order
to assist the Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 Lebanese civilians were killed and some 400
others wounded during 16 days of Israeli bombardments and
air strikes in southern Lebanon last month, drawing international
efforts to successfully mediate a ceasefire, which went into
effectiveness on April 27.

<P>

<HEADLINE> S.Leonean Mining Company To Resume Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, May 3 (Xinhua)-- The American run Sierra Rutile
Mining Company based in Moyamba in the south of the country is to
resume operations in July, the company's Managing Director Brian
Calver said today.
</P>
<P>
The mine was heavily looted and partly burnt down by rebels of
the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) nearly two years ago. Eight
foreign workers, particularly British and Austrians were captured
but were later released. Some 100 Sierra Leoneans, including one
of the current spokesman for the RUF, Mohamed Barrie were among
those conscripted by the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the mines left over 5,000 workers idle and shot
up the exchange rate to an all time high. Sierra Rutile makes up
40 percent of Sierra Leone's foreign exchange earning.
</P>
<P>
Calver met the Vice President Albert Demby on Thursday to
''brief him about arrangements of the mining operations,'' the
state radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Calver disclosed that ''recruitment of workers will commence
soon''. The Sierra Rutile Executive also appealed for
government's approval to provide its own independent security
force for the mines.
</P>
<P>
The company laid off all workers after the rebel attack and a
request to the former military regime for a British firm to
provide security was turned down by Strasser's government.
</P>
<P>
According to Calver, the company has ''reached agreement with
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a
loan of 18,000,000 U.S.Dollars for the expansion of the mines.''
</P>
<P>
Observers say that when the mine reopens it would provide a
much needed foreign exchange base as well as employment for
workers.
</P>
<P>
Another mine which was also shut down after a rebel attack,
the Swiss owned Sierra Leone Ore and Metal Company,is also
working to resume operations, mineral resources officials said
today.

<HEADLINE> Africa Business Conference Continues In S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Liu Yegang and Li Sizhi)
</P>
<P>
Midrand, South Africa, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A major international
business conference continues here today with the aim of boosting
trading and investment deals in Africa.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 participants are attending the conference,
called Africa Connect, which is taking place in parallel with the
ninth session of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD IX).
</P>
<P>
Participants meet in four panels today, to identify business
opportunities in the agro-industry and clothing manufacture and
consumer durables manufacture in one hall, and
telecommunications, power, trasnportation and construction
infrastructure and integrated tourism in another.
</P>
<P>
Opening the event on Thursday, Deputy Minister of Trade and
Industry of South Africa Mrs. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said,
"Africa is probably the last great investment opportunity in the
world; we are the untapped economic potential."
</P>
<P>
The linkage between investment and development was the central
theme of her speech. Investment should serve development
purposes, improve inequalities and help correct the negative
effects of globalization as countries started on an unequal
footing in this new process, she said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that economic development in Africa could not be
disassociated from poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
"Africa Connect is exactly the kind of event that we would
like to see more and more of in UNCTAD," said Rubens Ricupero,
Secratary General of UNCTAD, who attached high priority to
involving the private sector in UNCTAD's work and to promoting
the dialogue between business people and policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Ricupero mentioned various assistance
activities of UNCTAD linked to enteprise development, including
training, advisory services on corporate legislation, investment
and trade policies.
</P>
<P>
European Comissioner J. de Deus Pinhero said more could be
done in Africa with regard to privatization programs and the
improvement of investment regimes.
</P>
<P>
So far such programs have been undertaken only in a limited
number of countries, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Arafat's Visit to Egypt Postponed to Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
will arrive in Cairo early Saturday coming from Washington
following his visit to the U.S., it was announced by Nabil Shaath,
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation in the
Palestinian National Authority, in a departure statement to
newsmen here today before proceeding to Gaza at the end of a few
days visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed Palestinian sources had announced that President
Arafat would arrive in Cairo this evening.
</P>
<P>
Shaath added that President Arafat will brief Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak the outcome of this talks with U.S.
officials.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the meeting of Presidents Arafat and
Mubarak is in line with the Palestinian leadership's policy of
regular consultation with the Egyptian leaders who relentlessly
support the Palestinian rights and the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, due to start Sunday in
the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba, Shaath said the objective is
to reiterate the commitment of the two parties, but there will be
no substantial discussion of the various issues, and the sittings
will be postponed until after the Israeli general elections at the
end of May. The two sides will restrict their talks Sunday on
working out an agenda, and on the formation of bilateral
committees.
</P>
<P>
"Our demands are centered on Israeli withdrawal from all
territories in 1967," he said, "including East Jerusalem, the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem
as its capital, the dismantling of Jewish settlements, and a just
solution of the problem of refugees of 1948."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President had declared at a Washington meeting with
the Palestinian and Arab community yesterday that the final stage
of negotiations with Israel would cover five principal issues,
namely, Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, borders and external
relations.

<HEADLINE> Africa Business Conference Continues In S.Africa </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
Midrand, South Africa, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A major international
business conference continues here today with the aim of boosting
trading and investment deals in Africa.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 participants are attending the conference,
called Africa Connect, which is taking place in parallel with the
ninth session of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD IX).
</P>
<P>
Participants meet in four panels today, to identify business
opportunities in the agro-industry and clothing manufacture and
consumer durables manufacture in one hall, and
telecommunications, power, trasnportation and construction
infrastructure and integrated tourism in another.
</P>
<P>
Opening the event on Thursday, Deputy Minister of Trade and
Industry of South Africa Mrs. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said,
"Africa is probably the last great investment opportunity in the
world; we are the untapped economic potential."
</P>
<P>
The linkage between investment and development was the central
theme of her speech. Investment should serve development
purposes, improve inequalities and help correct the negative
effects of globalization as countries started on an unequal
footing in this new process, she said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that economic development in Africa could not be
disassociated from poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
"Africa Connect is exactly the kind of event that we would
like to see more and more of in UNCTAD," said Rubens Ricupero,
Secratary General of UNCTAD, who attached high priority to
involving the private sector in UNCTAD's work and to promoting
the dialogue between business people and policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Ricupero mentioned various assistance
activities of UNCTAD linked to enteprise development, including
training, advisory services on corporate legislation, investment
and trade policies.
</P>
<P>
European Comissioner J. de Deus Pinhero said more could be
done in Africa with regard to privatization programs and the
improvement of investment regimes.
</P>
<P>
So far such programs have been undertaken only in a limited
number of countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tom Main, President of the South African Council of the
International Chamber of Commerce, spoke about the developments
in the African economy from a business perspective.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Blood Drive in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- One of the first group of people to
donate blood at the beginning of activities encouraging blood
donations in China's five major cities this morning was a
19-year-old girl, Qian Juhua.
</P>
<P>
After making the donation during an opening ceremony in
Wangfujing, Beijing's busiest shopping district, the girl said
with a smile, "It is the first time for me to donate blood and I
was a bit nervous at first, but now I feel very well and I'll go
back to work after a while."
</P>
<P>
The activity's major purpose is to encourage blood donations
and to guarantee the quality of donated blood, explained Sun
Baiqiu, vice-chairman at the Red Cross Society of China, sponsor
of the activity.
</P>
<P>
The quality of the donated blood is always good because donors
give blood when they are in good health and don't try to hide
illnesses or givee blood several times in a short period of time
as some people do just to get money, said Yin Dakui, vice-minister
of public health.
</P>
<P>
He said that the donors must have a thorough check-up before
their blood is taken and the donated blood can be used only after
it has been tested for hepatitis-B virus, hepatitis-C, HIV,
syphilis, and other viruses.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 800,000 liters of blood for clinical use and plasma
used to make 4,000 tons of blood products each year is obtained
from those who are paid to give blood, and donated blood accounts
for less than ten percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
There were 50,000 people who donated blood last year, and about
120,000 since the blood drive was launched in Beijing, according
to the vice-chairman of the Beijing Red Cross Society, Zhang
Xizeng.
</P>
<P>
The activity, which started here today, will also be held in
Tianjin, Jinan, Xuzhou, and Zhengzhou, and is expected to end in
Beijing in mid May.

DAR ES SALAAM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government on
Thursday dismissed claims of human rights violations in Zanzibar
by the opposition.

<P>
A State House statement issued in Dar es Salaam said on
Thursday that a section of the media reported about 600 people
being detained in Zanzibar without trial following President
Mkapa's recent visit to show solidarity with President Salmin
Amour.
</P>

Those reports were fabricated by the opposition, according to
the statement.
</P>
<P>
What was claimed to be human rights violations were measures
taken by the isles government to curb criminal acts by members of
the opposition parties, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Zanzibar government will not hesitate to use all means
available to preserve peace in the isles," declared the
statement.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Marksman to Carry Olympic Torch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Xu Haifeng, a sharpshooter who
netted China's first ever Olympic gold medal at the 1984 Los
Angles Games, will become the country's first torch bearer on
Friday in the Olympic torch relay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Twelve other Chinese representatives, chosen from across the
country, will join the 500-strong torch bearers near the Niagara
Falls near the U.S.-Canada border later in June.
</P>
<P>
Xu, 39, will jump aboard a cable car at about 7:40 p.m. of
local time and travel through some 1,000 meters in the main avenue
of the city's China Town.
</P>
<P>
Xu will be the 150th of the total 164 torch bearers on Friday
but the only one who does not need to run.
</P>
<P>
Organizers explained that the section Xu is to cover is too
uphill and downhill to run. And the cable car, which was put into
service in the city since the 1870s, could show off the local
culture of the region.
</P>
<P>
The torch relay, sponsored by Coca-Cola, started April 27 at
Los Angles. The organizing committee has prepared 10,000 torches
for the 10,000 flame bearers and escort runners on the way to
Atlanta's Olympic Stadium before July 19, the day of the grand
opening.
</P>
<P>
"The route has been carefully designed so that 90 percent of
the U.S. population will be within two hours of drive over flame
at some point across the country," said Brendan Harris, director
of the Torch Relay.
</P>
<P>
"We try to ensure as many people as possible to share the
Olympic spirit," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 1.6-kilogram flame holder -- one of the lightest in Olympic
history and first to be gripped in the center of its Georgia pecan
wood handle -- is made primarily of silvery aluminum with two
gold-plated brass bands engraved with names of previous Olympic
host cities.
</P>
<P>
The flame is to be extinguished during the closing ceremony on
August 4. The flame travels by relay for 84 days and keeps burning
during the 16-day centennial games.

second term of office of presidency.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Yemen Welcomes French Arbitration Plan on Resolving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Yemen has welcomed the French-brokered
accord of principles for the peaceful settlement of
Yemeni-Eritrean dispute over the Red Sea Greater Hanish island.
</P>
<P>
A Yemeni Foreign Ministry official announced this Thursday
evening in a statement to the Yemeni news agency.
</P>
<P>
The official said the accord which was made known Wednesday was
exactly what Yemen had been seeking all through. Ever since the
outbreak of the crisis, he said, Yemen has sought to maintain
bilateral ties with Eritrea and to avert the area any further
tension.
</P>
<P>
He added that the accord on the arbitration plan would soon be
signed in Paris by the Foreign Ministers of Yemen and Eritrea, in
the presence of the French Foreign Minister as well as the Foreign
Ministers of Egypt and Ethiopia, all three to counter-sign as
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
A political analyst, who declined to give his name, has said
that the accord is centered on two principal elements, namely,
non-resort by either party to the use of force, and reciprocal
commitment to international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the French-brokered accord for the
peaceful settlement of the four-month-old Yemeni-Eritrean dispute
through international arbitration constitutes an important step
towards the establishment of security and stability in the Red Sea
region.
</P>
<P>
All parties concerned will be considering as of Sunday the
definition of a date for the signing ceremony at foreign
ministers' level. The text of the accord will be published in
Arabic, French and English languages.
</P>
<P>
Yemen and Eritrea, which face each other across the Strait of
Bab el-Mandeb at the southern tip of the Red Sea, fought a brief
battle on the island of Greater Hanish in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean forces took control of the island before a cease-fire
took effect December 18.
</P>
<P>
The Greater Hanish is one of three islands claimed both by Yemen and
Eritrea. The other two are Lesser Hanish and Zuqar, which remain
under Yemeni control.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Rejects Applicants' Referendum on Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
Thursday rejected the idea that prospective members of the
organization decide their entrance through referendum.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with the left-wing democratic caucus in the National
Assembly of Bulgaria, Solana said he does not agree to the idea
that Bulgaria decides whether to join the North Atlantic
Organization (NATO) through a referendum, as proposed by some
Bulgarians.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who just arrived here from Albania in the afternoon,
also stressed that countries applying for NATO's membership should
not link their NATO entrance with their full membership in the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
The former Spanish foreign minister expressed appreciation over
the stand taken by the Bulgarian government and the ruling
Bulgarian Socialist Party on the country's NATO membership, which
he described as more flexible than that of the Visegrad Group
composed of Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
The stand (of the Bulgarian government) will not put Bulgaria
in an unfavorable position or make it isolated, said Solana.
</P>
<P>
On NATO's relationship with Russia, which has voiced strong
opposition to the alliance's expansion, Solana said the
cooperation between NATO and Russia is necessary because a new
security model for Europe must take into account "the new
conditions of Europe".
</P>
<P>
He added that it would be a historical mistake to create a new
boundary in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Solana met with Bulgarian President Zheliu Zhelev,
Prime Minister Zhan Videnov, and parliamentarian groups of the
ruling party and the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parliamentarian group handed over a memorandum
to Solana on their stand on Bulgaria's NATO membership, and
expressed regret over their disagreement with the NATO chief.
</P>
<P>
Solana is visiting Bulgaria as part of his tour to 12 eastern
and central European countries applying for NATO membership.

In an interview broadcast by Egypt's "Sawt al Arab" (voice of

Ghoushe also said that talks in Washington between Palestinian

Asked about the prospects of an Israeli pull out from the town
of Hebron coinciding with the commencement of negotiations on the
final status, Ghoushe said there were no such indications. He
pointed out that the Palestinian side was used to Israel's
non-commitment to scheduled dates, despite the relaxation in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
The first round in the final status negotiations is due to
start Sunday between the Palestinian and Israeli sides in the
Egyptian Red Sea resort town of Taba.
</P>

Talking with the Turkish reporters in Ankara Thursday night,
Moussa said: "If we can solve our problems with Israel, you can
solve (problems) with Syria. Your two neighboring countries sit at

</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Egypt could be a help if Turkey and Syria need
a third side for the settlement to the problems between the two

The Egyptian foreign minister said that he would bring
Turkey's unsatisfaction over the resources from Syria to the

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry denied
building underground missile bases on the Persian Gulf coasts,
according to an official report here today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi dismissed the claims by U.S. Secretary
of Defense William Perry on this respect.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the aim of the allegations was to
"engage the attention of the simple-minded while Washington sells
its advanced weapons to the Zionist regime."
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the U.S. administration is against the
Iranian policy of making the Middle East free of weapons of mass
destruction and for this reason it tries to distract the
simple-minded from its arming of Israel against Arab and Islamic
countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent U.S. allegations of Iran's supports
for terrorism, he called U.S. foreign policy "self-contradictory,
because it talks of opposition to terrorism, but has no shame in
openly supporting Israeli terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"U.S. support for the recent Zionist crimes against the
defenseless Lebanese people, showed that American foreign policy
backs terrorism," he added.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's economy saw a good growth
rate in this year's first four months, official report here said
today.
</P>
<P>
in agriculture, 2.5 million ha of winter-spring rice were
transplanted, which accounts for 104 per cent of the same crop
compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
By mid-April, farmers in southern provinces had harvested
nearly 1.2 million ha out of the total 1.3 million ha of rice,
while those in northern provinces were concentrating on caring for
rice.
</P>
<P>
Subsidiary crop acreage increased by 11.6 per cent over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output in the period was up by 10.8 per cent
compared with that of last year, with central industrial output
increasing by 12.5 per cent, and locally-run industrial output up
by nine per cent.
</P>
<P>
Products with good growth rate included electricity (more than
5.1 billion kwh, up by 14.8 per cent), coal (more than 2.5 million
tonnes, up by 24.2 per cent), rolled steel (125,000 tonnes, 12.6
per cent), fertilizer (330,000 tonnes, 16.6 per cent) and paper
(70,000 tonnes, 20.7 per cent) .
</P>
<P>
However, some products decreased in their output compared with
that of last year, including crude oil with only 2.59 million
tonnes, down by 5.9 per cent, due to the influence of strong winds
and damaged vessels in April, and cement, down by 1 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The price index for commodities and services in the past four
months increased by 4.3 per cent since December.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Expects Moderate Economic Growth in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to register the
moderate economic growth with an increase rate of about 10 percent
in the GDP this year, Chinese experts predicted here today.
</P>
<P>
The growth of value-added agricultural products will slow down
slightly from last year to four percent this year, while the
manufacturing industry and service trade will rise by 13.4 and 8
percent respectively, the experts, attending the 1996 Spring
Economic Forecast Workshop, say.
</P>
<P>
Investment in fixed assets will jump to some 2.3 trillion yuan,
representing a real growth of 10.5 percent, and the growth in the
retail sales index is to come down from last year's 14.8 percent
to 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The state's revenues and expenditures are headed for balanced
growth. Banking will see brisker business, and imports and exports
will be basically balanced.
</P>
<P>
Analysis shows that China's national economy will continue to
improve this year, with the rates of both inflation and investment
dropping.
</P>
<P>
The experts pointed to two prominent characteristics of China's
national economy:
</P>
<P>
-- There are things that are hampering excessive economic
growth in spite of a high rate of development in the economy.
</P>
<P>
-- Although the inflation rate continues to fall, the decline
rate is likely to be slowed.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that China's growth of retail price index
is to record a drop of four percentage points this year against a
decline of nearly seven percentage points last year, experts
predict that the country will still have difficulties in holding
the inflation rate to a single-digit figure this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 Chinese people are
singing the praises of Wang Wei.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year old who stammered as a boy has helped cure them of
their own speech stammering - with a 100 percent success rate.
</P>
<P>
Now all of his patients can talk perfectly and even sing. Wang
cured his stutter with the help of an acoustics professor in the
late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Wang, president of the Chengdu Stammer Hospital, has helped
the 10,000 people from all over China escape from their speech
difficulties over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Sichuan Provincial Public Health Bureau confirmed
that 100 percent of patients treated by Wang can speak and talk
fluently and freely.
</P>
<P>
Wang says his patients usually recover their normal speaking
abilities after a 10-day course of treatment. They can eventually
totally cure stammering if they continually practice the methods
taught in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Wang not only teaches patients about linguistics and medicines,
but also teaches them talking and singing.
</P>
<P>
Wang has even taken his patients to railway stations and many
other pubic places to talk about their own experiences and to sing
songs.
</P>
<P>
Wang's approach features a combination of psychology,
physiology, education, linguistics and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Almost all patents said that the greatest achievement they got
from Wang's hospital was becoming confident and brave enough to
face difficulties in life.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning to Restrict Aluminium As Building Material </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning Province
is to restrict the use of aluminium alloy as a building material,
according to the provincial construction department.
</P>
<P>
The move is necessary to conserve energy and reduce
environmental pollution, the department said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, half of the residential projects
within the province will use plastic-iron windows to replace
aluminium alloy windows, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China consumes about 100 million tons of
standard coal annually for heating as the bulk of the country
relies on coal as the main winter fuel.
</P>
<P>
As people become better off more Chinese households have opted
for aluminium alloy windows, seen by some families as a symbol of
superior quality when they improve their homes.
</P>
<P>
However experts say that owing to its higher rate of heat
transmission aluminium alloy windows cause great losses of heat,
thus increasing the consumption of coal and in turn air pollution.

<HEADLINE> China to Establish First Joint Venture Insurance Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A giant Chinese conglomerate and a
major Canadian insurer have signed an agreement to set up China's
first joint venture insurance company in Shanghai, China's largest
city.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, Zhong Hong Life Insurance Company, will have
200 million yuan in the first registered capital, according to the
agreement between the China National Chemicals Import and Export
Corporation (Sinochem) and Manulife Financial, Canada's largest
life insurance company.
</P>
<P>
Of the registered capital, 51 percent will be provided by
Manulife (International) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Manulife Financial, and 49 percent will be contributed by China
Trust and Investment Corporation for Foreign Economic Relations
and Trade, a key affiliate of Sinochem.
</P>
<P>
"Zhong Hong has plans to serve Shanghai's residents in life
insurance, medical care, pension benefits, investments and
deposits, among others," said Dominic D'alessandro, chief
executive officer of Manulife Financial.
</P>
<P>
One of China's largest and prosperous markets, Shanghai has
been open to foreign insurance companies since 1992, with two
insurers from the United States and Japan already operating.
</P>
<P>
After contacting several potential Chinese partners, Manulife
Financial started to negotiate with Sinochem on the establishment
of Zhong Hong last December, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's Insurance Law, which came into force last October,
requires that foreign life insurers can only enter China through
organizing joint venture life insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
"We'll hand the agreement to the branch of the People's Bank of
China in Shanghai, and hope to start operation of the joint
venture by the end of this summer," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that of the nine directors of Zhong Hong, five will be
from Manulife Financial, four from Sinochem, and the president may
be from Manulife Financial's subsidiary in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Han Gensheng, vice president of Sinochem, said that Manulife
Financial chose Sinochem because it is China's largest foreign
trade firm and has wide influence in China and across the world.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Manulife Financial is a leading life
insurance company in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Setting up China's first joint venture life insurance company
in cooperation with Manulife Financial will promote the
development in China's insurance industry, bring in advanced
management, business techniques and new insurance products, train
personnel, and standardize China's insurance market.
</P>
<P>
"Zhong Hong is expected to set up branches in cities other than
Shanghai as China is further liberalizing economic policies," he
said. "Sinochem has also filed application to the central bank for
establishing a non-life insurance company."

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong, a prosperous province
in south China, plans to set up a provincial social security
bureau in the first half of this year, in a bid to improve its
social security system.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, social security in Guangdong has
expanded from state enterprises to governmental units, social
institutions and non-state-run enterprises, while some 125 cities,
counties, and districts in the province have combined social
accumulation with personal deposits in the setting up of pension
funds.
</P>
<P>
Last year 500,000 people participated in pension insurance by
opening personal bank accounts, 300,000 more than in 1994, and
pension money saved in personal accounts exceeded 2.3 billion yuan
(about 277 million US dollars), rising one billion yuan over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Four billion yuan in pensions was provided last year by social
insurance institutions, a growth of 600 million yuan compared with
1994, with the average pension amount rising by 16.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The current social security system in China covers pension,
unemployment, job-related injuries, and medical care, and is
expected to be extended to social relief, resettlement, special
allowances, and housing.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the social insurance departments showed that
the unemployment insurance in China in recent years has supported
some 3.5 million jobless people, and helped some two million
people to find new jobs.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Airlines' Nonstop China-US Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Northwest Airlines, the world's
fourth-largest, became the first American airline to provide
nonstop service between China and the US, today.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural flight of the nonstop service from Beijing to
Detroit, Michigan took off from Beijing's Capital Airport.
</P>
<P>
Gary Wilson, chairman of the board of Northwest, addressed an
inaugural ceremony here today, saying that the new service not
only improves the airlines' network but also makes a strong
statement about how economic and trade relationships between the
US and China are expanding, and will give a strong impetus to both
economies.
</P>
<P>
The non-stop service will shorten the former flight, via
Tokyo's Narita Airport, by as much as seven hours. Northwest will
also be able to add two non-stop flights to the current three each
week by 1998, bringing the company's weekly service to China to
nine flights in all.
</P>
<P>
The non-stop service will use the Boeing 747-400. One of these
aircraft, the "Spirit of Beijing" initiated today's flight from
Beijing to Detroit, Northwest's hub and its international gateway.
</P>
<P>
It has been learned that 74 Michigan companies have set up
ventures in China, and Northwest's convenient non-stop service
will further improve this kind of co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Northwest began its flights to the Orient, from Seattle to
Shanghai, in 1947, but suspended them in 1949. In 1984, it
reopened its Shanghai service and added Beijing to its Asian
network in 1992. It has offices in Beijing and in Shanghai.
</P>

Air China and Eastern Airlines of China also provide non-stop
service to the US.

<HEADLINE> China's Materials Market Basically Stable in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Supply and demand of materials and
equipment in China is basically balanced, with the growth of
supply exceeding that of demand in the first three months of this
year, latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures released by China National Materials and
Equipment Information Center indicate that the supply of 16
varieties of materials including steel products, nonferrous metal,
raw chemicals, construction materials and coal increased by 8.5
percent, five percentage points higher in growth as compared with
the same period of last year, while the demand rose by five
percent, also a higher growth.
</P>
<P>
The Center under the Ministry of Internal Trade attributed the
faster growth in the market supply to three main reasons:
</P>
<P>
Firstly to the continued increase in production, especially to
the production of steel products, cement and some chemical
materials. In the first three months, the output of steel products
rose by 5.2 percent, and that of cement by 10.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, to the increase in imports and decrease in exports of
the related materials. The first three months represented a 21
percent rise in imports and a 25 percent decline in exports.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, to slower domestic consumption. The demand for the 16
varieties of materials climbed about six percent, slower than the
growth of supply.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter market also recorded slower price
fluctuations, with overall price level rising by a meager 0.8
percent compared with that for the same period last year. The
prices of some products, including copper, aluminium, zinc, tin,
most chemical materials, and electrical and machinery equipment
even dropped.
</P>
<P>
The price of coal soared 17.2 percent because of a rise in the
direct selling price from coal mines and increases in
transportation and other miscellaneous expenses.
</P>
<P>
The center predicts that overall price level of production
materials will rise by about three percent in the first half of
this year.

<HEADLINE> Severe Power Cuts Scheduled for New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Delhi Electric Supply
Undertaking (DESU) has announced loadshedding in almost all parts
of New Delhi with effect from Sunday as it could not meet the
increasing demand of electricity in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The loadshedding can be to a maximum of four hours a day. The
peak demand at present was hovering near 1,900 mw and it may cross
the projected 2,200 mw-mark by Mid-June, a DESU spokesman said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There is a shortfall of 250-300 mw and DESU has been forced to
resort to loadshedding even before peak summer has set in, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Delhi Chief Minister S.S. Verma has said DESU has been asked to
make an all-out effort to check power theft, which causes around
20 per cent of the power loss.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Committed to Hindu Religion Preservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur
Deuba said his government will preserve the Hindu religion as the
country is clearly declared a Hindu kingdom by its constitution.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a World Hindu Federation (WHF) meeting here
Thursday, Deuba said religious tolerance and goodwill had been
developing as Nepal's national character and that the Hindu
philosophy had also aroused interest among followers of other
faiths.
</P>
<P>
Since no religion could thrive merely through government help,
the religion followers should also take the initiative to preserve
their own religion, Deuba said.
</P>
<P>
An official of the WHF warned at the meeting that a tendency to
tempt or intimidate followers of certain prominent religions to
convert to other religions in the name of human rights had given
rise to various disturbances in today's world.
</P>
<P>
Other officials expressed concern over western culture's
invasion and urged all to observe the next decade as a Hindu
decade.
</P>
<P>
The three-day WHF International Executive Committee meeting is
being attended by Hindu representatives from 24 countries all over
the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Building approvals in Australia
fell 0.7 percent in March after rising 9.5 percent the previous
month, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said today.
</P>
<P>
Building approvals fell to 10,424 units in March from 10,494 in
February. The figure was also 19.1 percent lower than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Economists said today's figures confirmed that the local
housing industry was still in slump.
</P>
<P>
The federal government forecasted that the housing industry
would remain flat until later this year.
</P>
<P>
Today's figures were at the lower end of market expectations.
Local economists predicted a 0.1 percent rise in housing approvals
in March, with various forecasts ranging between a rise of three
percent and a fall of five percent.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures showed the Australian economy was still slowing
down. Earlier figures showed that unemployment rate rose while the
creation of new jobs slowed down.

NEW DELHI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- India's controversial godman

<HEADLINE> Crackdown on Illicit Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- One of China's leading industrial
bases has announced a major crackdown on the collection of illegal
fees from foreign-funded companies.
</P>
<P>
Many firms have unsuspectedly handed over fees to various
provincial departments, even paying for what should have been free
services.
</P>
<P>
But northeast China's Liaoning Province has launched a campaign
to crack down on arbitrary and illegal fee collections from
foreign-funded firms. Officials say they want to improve the
investment environment to attract more overseas firms to
develop in the area.
</P>
<P>
"Collection of illicit fees from foreign-funded firms has
become a problem affecting the deepening of reform and expansion
of opening-up," warned Gao Guozhu, vice-governor of the province,
in a recent telephone conference.
</P>
<P>
Some departments have promulgated fee collection clauses
without approval of the Provincial Prices Bureau or financial
departments, and most illicit fees have been collected in this
way, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some charges are over-collected, some free services have been
turned into paid-for services, some department have misused their
power and some administrative departments have collected
"management" fees, Gao explained.
</P>
<P>
The province will examine the qualification of fee collection
departments, fee collection items, amounts collected and
invoices. Reasonable fee collection clauses will be maintained,
while illicit collections will be scrapped, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the province will investigate fee collection items
in 400 foreign-invested firms.
</P>
<P>
The province will issue a pamphlet giving details of fee items
and collection standards. Foreign-funded enterprises have the
right to reject any irrational collections outside those
highlighted in the pamphlet, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
Gao said foreign-funded enterprises have been a driving force
in Liaoning's social and economic development. More than 5,300
foreign-funded firms have already become operational in the
province, generating an export volume of 2.08 billion US dollars,
accounting for one-third of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
Last year the State Council, China's top governing body,
decided to give priority to the industrial renovation of
Liaoning. The province regards the improvement of investment
environment as a key for attracting foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> German Artist Makes Symbolic Journey to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A German artist has made a journey
to China by proxy by showing 78 pieces of calligraphy and Oriental
paintings here.
</P>
<P>
Some researchers on his work commented, "These art works are
just coming back home."
</P>
<P>
Siegnard Sprotte, now 83, has never visited China, although he
has spent almost his lifetime collecting and practising Oriental
art.
</P>
<P>
His work features a combination of the lingering charm of
Chinese calligraphy and painting with the color effect of Western
impressionism and Fauvism.
</P>
<P>
Sprotte was prevented by poor health from attending this
showing of his works.
</P>
<P>
But his wife came to Shanghai on behalf of her husband and
introduced her husband's interest in Oriental arts.
</P>
<P>
Sprotte is an outstanding modern artist, whose works have been
widely collected by leading museums in the United States, Russia,
Portugal and Germany. And his work, famous for its Oriental
timbre, has been exhibited in many cities across the world.
</P>
<P>
The nine-day exhibition is expected to end May 8.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to File Complaint over U.S. Wild Shrimps Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will file a complaint with
the World Trade Organization (WTO) over the U.S. decision to ban
wild shrimps from Thailand, the Bangkok post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is confident that the complaint will win the WTO
support, a senior Thai Commerce Ministry official was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's International Trade Policy Committee will approve
the final draft of the complaint before the Commerce Ministry
files it with the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has argued that the ban, which went into effect on
Wednesday, is a violation of the WTO agreement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embargo, designed to protect sea turtles, has banned
the import of wild shrimps from any nations whose trawlers are not
equipped with turtle excluder devices that allow turtles to escape
easily from nets.
</P>
<P>
All of the ASEAN nations except Brunei are affected by the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Fisheries Department has come up empty in talks with
U.S. authorities aimed at giving Thai trawler operators more time
to install the equipment.
</P>
<P>
The Thai official said WTO regulations clearly state that
internal legislation cannot be applied to other countries without
international endorsement.

<HEADLINE> Thai FM Backs Myanmar's Attendance at ARF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Kasem S.
Kasemsri has maintained that Myanmar should be admitted, without
conditions, into the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
</P>
<P>
Referring to opposition by certain Western countries to
Myanmar's involvement in the ARF, Kasem said, "Some might object,
but we in ASEAN think it's necessary that all our members and all
those eligible to become members are in the ARF unconditionally."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks on Thursday before departure for the
Philippines for a three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Opening the forum for participation by more countries will be
on the agenda of his talks with his Philippine counterpart Domingo
Siazon.
</P>
<P>
"Who participates in the ARF is a matter for ASEAN to decide,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The seven-member ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) is likely to grant observer status to Myanmar at this
year's meeting of foreign ministers in Jakarta. This status
automatically allows it to participate in the ARF.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Regional Forum was established two years ago as a
loose consultative forum to discuss security in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar will eventually become a member of ASEAN, to make the
regional grouping a ten-member association. Laos and Cambodia have
applied to join as full members next year.

<P>
VIENNA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The final of next year's World Ice
Hockey Championship pool A will be a best-of-three series, the

said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He also announced St. Petersburg in Russia will stage the event

The new format was more reasonable than the current one-game
knockout because most hockey finals were multiple-game series,
Fasel said.
</P>
<P>
"It's usual in our sport even in the national leagues," he
said. "In Canada Cup, World Cup they play a best of three or five
or seven games and for that reason we accepted to change the
schedule in Finland," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the first game of the 1997 finals is scheduled for May
11 and the second game on May 12.
</P>
<P>
A third game, if necessary, will be played on May 14, he said.
</P>
<P>
The pool A World championships are set for Finland next year,
Switzerland in 1998 and Norway in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Punishes 79 Officials for Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 79 officials above the
county level were punished for embezzlement or bribe taking last
year in southeast China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Among them, four were heads of departments at the provincial
level, and 52 held positions as county or district leaders or
heads of public security bureaus.
</P>
<P>
The procuratorial organs in Fujian last year investigated 2,392
economic cases involving 239 million yuan (about 29 million US
dollars), among which 1,683 were cases of embezzlement or bribery,
70.4 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
A procurator pointed out that with the rapid economic
development in the province, the sums of money related to economic
cases is becoming larger and larger, causing huge losses to the
state.
</P>
<P>
Some 77 percent, or 1,843, of last year's economic cases
involved more than 10,000 yuan each, a 10-percent growth over
1994. The number of cases involving more than 500,000 yuan last
year was double that in 1994, reaching 74, with 42 cases involving
sums exceeding one million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The crime rate in areas such as finance, securities and real
estate rose markedly, he pointed out, adding that last year 14
cases involving a total of 39.65 million yuan were reported in
financial and securities departments.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 Fujian procurators probed 181 cases of dereliction of
duty or bending the law for the benefit of relatives or friends.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, 121 investigations were made of 136
judicial employees, 68 of whom faced criminal charges.

<HEADLINE> Ports of Entry Boost Trade and Passenger Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Improved ports of entry are
helping to increase trade and passenger flows between the vast
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and its foreign neighbors, a
national conference held in Guangxi has been told.
</P>
<P>
The meeting on the work of China's open border cities was told
that the Horgos port of entry on the Sino-Kazakhstan border
handled 330,000 inward and outward bound passengers, and 414,000
tons of goods in 1995, respectively, accounting for 51 percent and
22.6 percent of the 11 ports of entry of Xinjiang in northwest
China.
</P>
<P>
Yining City, surrounded by three major international ports of
entry, Horgos, Dolot, and Muzart, which are between 90 and 312
kilometers away, has devoted the most effort in the construction
of Horgos in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-Kazakhstan border trade fair covering 9.466 hectares
which opened in 1992, is drawing thousands of business people from
all over the country and hundreds from Kazakhstan every day,
producing about one million yuan in transactions, and conducting
foreign exchange of over 60,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Over 210 companies and institutions from across the country and
Hong Kong have acquired 4.8 square kilometers of land in the port
area to set up offices. So far 128 of them have began construction
work.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of telecommunication, power and water
supply, storage, education, and cultural facilities, the port is
now capable of handling three million passengers and two million
tons of goods annually.
</P>
<P>
Another focus of construction is the Alataw port, also
bordering Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
As the largest port of entry and the only highway-railway
port in northwest China, the port has injected 520 million yuan
(62.65 million US dollars) in its construction since 1992,
completing power and water supply stations, a 12,000-square-meter
border trade market, a modern highway-railway terminal and new
homes covering 420,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Tacheng City is another port of entry seeing new progress in
construction. Designated as a city further opening to the outside
world by the State Council in 1992, Tacheng has completed the
construction of a 12-kilometer-long road between the city and the
Baktu Port of Entry and facilities.
</P>
<P>
Local economies have benefitted substantially from the
improvement of ports of entry, the conference was told.

<P>
PRAGUE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Sweden won its fifth European table
tennis championship men's team title after crushing defending
champion France 4-1 in Bratislava, Slovakia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sweden was one down when Peter Karlsson lost to Jean-Philippe
Gatien 15-21, 15-21 in the opening match.
</P>
<P>
But the Swedes managed to surge ahead 2-1 after European number
two Jan Ove Waldner beat Damien Eloi 21-14, 21-17 and Jorgen
Persson rolled over Patrick Chila 21-17, 21-6.
</P>
<P>
The two then teamed up to defeat Gatien and Eloi 21-17, 21-16,
giving Sweden a comfortable advantage.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic clash between Europe's top players, Waldner
rallied from one set deficit and saved five match points to beat
Gatien 19-21, 21-13 and 24-22.
</P>
<P>
In the deciding third set, Gatien once led Waldner 20-17 but
could not wrangle the critical point from Waldner.
</P>
<P>
Waldner's accurate and spinning serve plus his tricky forehand
loop proved too much for Gatien to handle.
</P>
<P>
The championships will continue on Saturday as doubles event
starts.

<HEADLINE> Precaution Curbs Skin Cancer Death in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Australia registered a stabilizing
in melanoma deaths in the past decade, thanks to nation-wide
education campaigns and early detection of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Results of 65 years of study by the Anti-Cancer Council of
Victoria in Australia showed that Australia was the first
predominately white-skin population to record a check in shin
cancer deaths, today's The Australian newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The council said in an article published today that the death
rate from melanoma has stabilized after peaking in 1985, 15-20
years earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990-94, death rates fell by 5.2 percent among women
and rose a modest 3.7 percent among men. In comparison, between
1960 and 1989, deaths grew by 6.3 percent a year for men and 2.9
percent for women.
</P>
<P>
"After at least 60 years of steadily increasing mortality from
melanoma of the skin in Australia, there is now clear evidence
that this trend is coming to an end and that the mortality has
fallen in women," the article said.
</P>
<P>
"We can expected in the next five to ten years the death rate
among men to drop as well," Graham Giles from the council said.
</P>
<P>
He said that most pale skin populations in the world had seen
rising incidence and rising mortality from melanoma.
</P>
<P>
Australia's success in arresting the death rate of the cancer
skin was due to the greater awareness of skin cancer generated by
education campaigns. For example, the authorities tried to
persuade people to change their attitude to being in the sun by
putting forward the "Slip Slop Slap" slogan. That means to slip on
a shirt, slop on a sunscreen and slap on a hat.
</P>
<P>
Medical research has proved that radiation from the sun is a
major cause of skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
But Giles said the downturn in mortality was also due to the
large amount of early detection of melanoma in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Men aged 70 and older were the most vulnerable to the skin
cancer, with the death rate rising fastest among this group after
1985, he said.

<HEADLINE> US Post Service Issues Olympic Stamps Despite Organizers' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Post Service unveiled
its 1996 Olympic stamps Thursday to commemorate the summer
Atlanta Olympic Games, despite the disagreement from the Games'
organizers.
</P>
<P>
The 20 stamps designed by Richard Waldrep of Sparks, Maryland,
capture athletes at the height of performance in 20 Olympic
events. Subjects of the stamps are from Men's Cycling, Women's
Diving to Men's Hurdles.
</P>
<P>
However, the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG)
boycotted the ceremony as it said on Thursday it was ready to sue
the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) unless it stopped a line of
T-shirts and other souvenirs bearing images of Olympic athletes.
</P>
<P>
ACOG said it was consulting its lawyers over the post office's
plans to license "Olympic wannabe products" ahead of the Games.
</P>
<P>
"The USPS has declined to provide post offices at key Olympic
venues in Atlanta...(but) while declining to provide these needed
services, the USPS has decided to go into the souvenir business,
selling Olympic wannabe merchandise -- T-shirts, pins and plates,"
ACOG said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Since Atlanta in 1990 won the right to stage the Olympic Games,
ACOG has been extra vigilant in protecting Olympic material.
</P>
<P>
The post office has licensed a company to produce T-shirts and
other products bearing the image of a set of commemorative
stamps.
</P>
<P>
The stamps were approved by ACOG and bear the official
Olympic rings, a symbol which can cost sponsor companies up to
$40 million to use in advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The T-shirts and other memorabilia display the stamps
without the rings, but Olympic organizers say the post office
"would have consumers believe the T-shirts have a direct,
legitimate connection to the Olympic Games and the U.S.
Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
But the Post Service said it had licensed an outside company to
make T-shirts bearing the image of the Olympic stamps and denied
any attempt to mislead the public.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Youth leaders in Beijing are being
told to set a good example to the capital's young people - by
studying the use of computers.
</P>
<P>
In a move to ensure that leaders of city youth organizations
are not left behind in the world of computer technology, cadres of
the Beijing Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League are
required to take national computer examinations and acquire
relevant certificates.
</P>
<P>
This is the first such case ever reported in the country.
</P>
<P>
The municipal committee in the capital has called on all of its
youth league secretaries to pass the exams to earn certificates
on computer knowledge.
</P>
<P>
The committee has advocated that local youth master
more modern scientific and technological skills so they are better
prepared for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by the year 2000, some 500,000 young
people in the capital will have computer knowledge certificates.

<HEADLINE> Powell Urges Politicians to Listen to Voters More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Retired General Colin Powell said
Thursday that politicians, Democrat and Republican, should care
more about what the people want and less about raising money for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
"You've got to start listening to the American people a little
more," Powell was quoted by the Associated Press as saying at a
Great Communicators Luncheon sponsored by the Columbus Speech and
Hearing Center in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
Voters want new leadership dedicated to solving the country's
problems, said the former chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff.
That is why they have turned to such people as Ross Perot, Steve
Forbes and Powell himself, he said.
</P>
<P>
Powell again denied any interest in running for political
office this year, but he did not rule out the possibility of a
future political role.
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old black general, who gained fame during the 1991
Gulf War, denied in March any intention to run in the presidential
campaign after U.S. Senate Majority leader Bob Dole hinted he
would select Powell as his running mate.

BANGKOK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will ask Laos to increase
protection for Thai investors, open up its life and non-life
insurance businesses and liberalize its service industries, Thai
Ambassador to Laos Sophand Kokilanon said in Vientiane Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silapa-archa plans to raise these

Other topics would include avoidance of double taxation, and
ways for Laos to tap a five-billion baht (200 million US dollars)
fund set up by the Thai government to help neighboring countries
in their development, Sophand said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai-Lao Businessmen's Association will invite the Laotian
International Trade Minister and Laotian businessmen to visit
Thailand on May 14 and 15. Thai-Laotian trade last year totaled
10.55 billion baht (422 million US dollars), with Thai exports
worth 8.82 billion baht (352 million US dollars) and imports from
Laos valued at 1.73 billion baht (69 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Passes Bill Against Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate passed a bill
Thursday that would crack down on illegal immigrants at the border
and the workplace and stiffen rules on legal immigrants to keep
them off the public dole.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers voted 97-3 for the bill similar to the one
adopted by the House in March.
</P>
<P>
The measure would nearly double the number of border patrol
guards, now more than 5,000; authorize creation of pilot projects
enabling employers to verify easily whether a worker is eligible
for a job in the United States; increase penalties for document
fraud and alien smuggling; and make it harder for legal immigrants
to qualify for public benefits.
</P>
<P>
House and Senate conferees will have to resolve differences
between the two bills, and both chambers will have to vote on the
compromise measure before sending it to President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased that the Senate has endorsed our strategy with
legislation that answers my administration's call for tougher
penalties for alien smugglers, criminal aliens and manufacturers
and sellers of fraudulent documents," Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill would repeal rules limiting asylum-seeker's
rights to enter the country, a change approved Wednesday, just a
week after those rules became law.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic militants attacked the
women cyclists and officials in a protest against female cycling
in the country, local daily said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The daily Akhbar said a group of 20 young men raided the
Chitgar sports complex on Monday, the only place where women are
allowed to cycle in the country.
</P>
<P>
The attackers beat some women cyclists and insulted officials
there while called-on police failed to intervene in the scuffles.
</P>
<P>
They also insulted Faezeh Hashemi, daughter of Iranian
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, for her role in spearheading
the rights of women to cycle.
</P>
<P>
The group identified themselves as members of the state-run
Basij volunteer militia.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the debate has been triggered off on whether
women have the rights to participate in some sports.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi was a key official to head the movement for woman's
sports by helping to create dozens of sports facilities for women
across Iran, but conservative newspapers and politicians blasted
women's sports as un-Islamic, depicting them as "indecent" and
"provocative".
</P>
<P>
Chitgar park, 10 kilometers west of Tehran, was opened in 1994
as the first public facility to offer separate cycling tracks for
women.

between the workers' union and Codelco (Corporacion del Cobre)
representatives, the biggest Chilean state enterprise.
</P>
<P>
The situation was calm in the city of Chuquicamata, near the
mine, in the Second Region of Chile. No violent incident had been
reported so far.
</P>
<P>
Only the workers in charge of emergencies were permitted to
enter the mine this morning, in agreement with the established
shifts.
</P>
<P>
Labor leaders, as well as Labor Ministry officials have
testified about the regularity of this function.
</P>
<P>
The striking miners are demanding a four percent wage hike, the
building of a new hospital, and a bonus at the end of the strike
worth 1.1 million pesos.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important strikes in the history of Chuqucamata
was that of 1972, which lasted 24 days during the Popular Unity
government.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Authorities Release 4 Croat Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb authorities released
four Croat prisoners today in line with a decision made by the
Hague-based war crimes tribunal calling for the release of
prisoners when there is no evidence against them.
</P>
<P>
Dragan Bulajic, head of the Serb prisoner exchange commission,
said Serb authorities had freed the prisoners to show their
readiness to cooperate with the international community. But he
said the prisoners were still war criminals in the eyes of Serb
authorities which would continue to search for evidence against
them, the Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials say the three ethnic parties in Bosnia -- Serbs,
Muslims and Croats -- are still holding prisoners of war on the
ground that these pows are war criminal suspects.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Serb authorities released two Muslim prisoners
who had been arrested on charges of war crimes. The release has
been confirmed by spokesman of the NATO-led peace Implementation
Force Colum Murphy. On the same day, the Muslim government freed
six Serb prisoners but it was still jailing 11 Serbs in prison,
Tanjug said.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade-Zagreb Highway to Open Next Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Administrator for the Serb
region of Eastern Slavonia in Croatia Jacques Klein announced
today the Belgrade-Zagreb highway would officially be opened on
May 7.
</P>
<P>
Klein said in Erdut, the administrative center of the region,
that the opening ceremony would be attended by representatives
from both Yugoslavia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The Belgrade-Zagreb highway was closed to traffic in 1991
during the Croatian war of secession from the former Yugoslavia.
The reopening indicates that the relations between Yugoslavia and
Croatia are improving.
</P>
<P>
Klein made the announcement on the reopening of the highway,
which partly passes through the region of Eastern Slavonia on the
Yugoslav-Croatian northern border.
</P>
<P>
The region is the only part of the Republic of Serb Krajina
which was not taken by force by the Croatian army in 1995. The
Krajina republic was set up in late 1991 by the Serbs in the
Serb-dominated areas in Croatia after Zagreb seceded from the
ex-Yugoslavia early that year.
</P>
<P>
In January 1996, the region was placed under the U.N.
Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES).
</P>
<P>
Klein said he was extremely satisfied with the cooperation of
all the parties so far, and added that his main goal was for the
U.N. administration to work through the existing infrastructure
and the local authorities who are already in place there.
</P>
<P>
Klein, a reserve U.S. general, said that he had told the
commander of the U.N. peacekeeping troops in the area, Belgian
General Jozef Schoups, that he wanted U.N. troops to be deployed
on the roads day and night "so the population of the region can
see that the troops are there for their security and there is no
reason to fear."
</P>
<P>
He added the setting up of joint Serb-Croat police forces,
which should number 440, was going on well and some of them were
already receiving training in Budapest, Hungary.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs, IFOR Hold Talks on Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Rajko
Kasagic and IFOR Sector West commander British Major-General Mike
Jackson held talks today about further cooperation between the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we have jointly noted that the IFOR's presence is
reducing tensions and a risk of war, although all are confident
that there will be no war any more," Kasagic said after the
meeting in Banja Luka, the largest Serb city in northwestern
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"Britons are great friends of ours and their conduct was
absolutely neutral in this war, backing up the truth," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jackson, headquartered near Banja Luka, also said today that
IFOR Sector Southwest would move from the Muslim-Croat
federation's city of Gornji Vakuf to Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
He said Banja Luka was a natural "central point" of the area
covered by his sector and in this way the command operations would
be facilitated since the offices of a large number of
international organizations with which the IFOR was cooperating
were based in Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent clashes between Muslim refugees who
wanted to enter Serb land to see their old houses and local Serbs,
the British general emphasized that, according to the Dayton
accords, there was freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
"However, if several hundred people get together in one place,
that might spell both provocation and danger." At this time,
therefore, peace and order were more important than the freedom of
movement, Jackson underlined.
</P>
<P>
On several occasions, the Muslims had tried, by force and
without the IFOR's consent, to break into Serb land, causing
incidents with the local serb population. Last Monday, two Muslims
died and seven were injured when they entered a minefield outside
the Serb city of Doboj in the north.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat today called on the United Nations to play a more effective
role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
discussed current developments in the Middle East, including
the forthcoming Israeli-Palestinian "final status" talks and the
situation in Lebanon at a working luncheon today.
</P>
<P>
When he sat down to meet the secretary general, Arafat said,
"We are looking from his excellency to continue to push the peace
process in all the tracks."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, he said that he came here to
express thanks to Boutros-Ghali for the position of the United
Nations for Palestine in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been active in helping Palestinian
refugees and adopted resolutions critical of Israel's occupation
of Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Israeli and Arabs could live peaceful
together, Arafat replied they were neighbors. "Now there will be
two states. A Palestinian state beside its neighbors, the
Israelis."
</P>
<P>
When asked what steps he would take to stop terrorism, he said
that Palestinians stood firmly against any effort from any quarter
that would undermine the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians called for promotion of peace and the
peace process covered the entire region, including Israel and Arab
states.
</P>
<P>
He also described his meeting with President Bill Clinton Monday
as "warm, fruitful and successful."

<HEADLINE> 6 US Cities' Drinking Water Dangerous to Aids People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The drinking water of six major
U.S. cities is dangerous to people with AIDS and weakened immune
systems, United Press International quoted a report from an AIDS
patient advocacy group as saying today.
</P>
<P>
In its report "What's on Tap: Cryptosporidium in U.S. Public
Drinking Water," the National Association for People with AIDS
said it found tap water poses an extremely high risk of
transmitting the hazardous parasite in six cities -- Atlanta,
Minneapolis, St. Petersburg, Dallas, Newark, and Washington, which
never test or don't have a means to alert the public if they do
find the parasite in drinking water.
</P>
<P>
The organization also identified other 22 big cities, including
Boston, Chicago, New York and Los Angeles, at high risk for
outbreaks of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced
it will require monitoring for the parasite in large drinking
water systems early next year. It will require monitoring of
public drinking water systems serving populations greater than
100,000 and that use surface waters as a source of drinking water.

BELGRADE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb authorities have
released two Muslim prisoners of war who were under investigation
for war crimes, the Tanjug news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted peace Implementation Force (IFOR) spokesman
Colum Murphy as saying that the IFOR escorted the two Muslim pows
from the Serb stronghold of Pale to Sarajevo Wednesday. The two
were part of a group of 17 pows held in Pale on suspicion of
committing war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug also quoted a representative of the International Police

from the central prison in Sarajevo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross said that 11 Serbs
are still being held in that prison.

<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders Up in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Orders that U.S. factories
received in March were up 1.5 percent, nearly twice the 0.8
percent increase that many analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said today that orders for durable
and nondurable goods were up 2.5 percent, totaling a seasonally
adjusted 309 billion dollars, up from a revised 304.3 billion
dollars in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Among durable goods, transportation orders rose 14.5 percent
and the gain was mainly due to a large increase in orders for
aircraft, that offset a decline in motor vehicles. Transportation
orders had dropped 12.4 percent in February. Orders for nondurable
goods such as food and fuel gained only 0.4 percent after falling
0.2 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Factory orders are seen as a key indicator of the country's
manufacturing strength since an increase could mean there would be
greater production and more jobs.
</P>
<P>
A survey of U.S. purchasing managers released Wednesday
suggested that the manufacturing sector strengthened in April for
the first time in nine months, though still at a sluggish rate.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Purchasing Management said the
manufacturing index rose to 50.1 percent last month, the first
time it was over 50 percent since last July.

<HEADLINE> UK Tories Turn Wrath on Europe for Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The British government has decided
today to delay its planned slaughter of old cattle as Tory members
of parliament, either the Eurosceptics or pro-European ones, have
been infuriated by the European Unions which refuses to lift its
worldwide ban on Britain's beef exports.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports here today, all Tory MPs made it
clear that their patience with Brussels was running out and they
demanded that the British government take retaliatory action
against the EU.
</P>
<P>
The British government faced calls from Tories to withhold
contributions to the EU or hit back with trade sanctions after the
government failed to secure a date for ending the embargo in talks
with Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The Tories accused the EU partners of disregarding scientific
advice and severely damaging Britain's beef and dairy industries.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major and his senior cabinet members tried
to hold back the growing tide of disillusion with the EU, but they
failed to calm down the anger of the Tory MPs.
</P>
<P>
The government was given a clear warning Wednesday night that
it would be unlikely to get a policy of selective slaughter of
BSE-affected cattle through parliament.
</P>
<P>
Even pro-European Tory MPs criticized the EU's ban as
politically and commercially motivated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British farmers attacked the government today for
its arrangements to cull thousands of cattle.
</P>
<P>
They accused the government of doing too little, too late to
help minimize losses.
