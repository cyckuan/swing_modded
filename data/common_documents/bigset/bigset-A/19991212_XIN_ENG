<HEADLINE> Jordan Gets No Signal From Syria to Host Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has not received any
signal from Damascus asking the kingdom to host its peace talks
with Israel after a ceremonial resumption in washington,
Information Minister Ayman Majali said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Majali told reporters after a regular cabinet session that it
is premature to say Jordan will become the venue for the
Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Jordan welcomed the resumption of the peace talks if they lead
to a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Majali, who is also deputy prime minister, neither denied nor
confirmed local press reports that Jordan is ready to host the
Israeli-Syrian peace talks, if the two sides opt so, after their
ceremonial resumption in Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced that Israel
and Syria had agreed to resume their peace talks in Washington
next week from the point where they broke off in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to touch upon thorny issues like the
Golan Heights, a strategic plateau which Israel captured from
Syria in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Israel said the negotiations will move to Amman
after a symbolic start in Washington by Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa on behalf
of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Amman said they expected the talks to
shift to the Middle East at the end of December or next January,
though they are not sure whether the talks would be moved to Amman.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the second Arab state after Egypt that signed a peace
treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
For years Jordan has been a key player in the Middle East peace
process by trying to bridge the differences between Israel and
its Arab neighbors, including Syria, Lebanon and the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Tehran's Population to Reach 13 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The population of Iranian
capital city Tehran will reach 13 million by end-March, 2005, if
the current immigration trend continues, an Iranian official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Governor General of Tehran province Ali Asghar
Zebardast said that before the 1979 Islamic revolution, the city's
population was 5 million, but with unchecked immigration, the
figure reached about 11 million so far.
</P>
<P>
Zebardast told the Islamic Republic News Agency that the total
area of Tehran province is 18,000 square kilometers, and if there
is no action taken to stop the excessive immigration to the city,
the area will not be adequate to accommodate all the needs of the
citizens.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian Statistics Center, Iran's population
growth rate will jump to 1.7 percent by the end of 2001 from the
present 1.4 percent, because 52 percent of Iran's 63 million
people are below the age of 20.

</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Foreign reserves of Lebanon's Central Bank registered
a monthly increase of 777.3 million U.S. dollars, reaching 7.6
billion dollars by the end of October 1999.
</P>
<P>
The bank's October bulletin issued recently said that the rise
resulted from a balance of payments surplus of 231.5 million
dollars due to an improvement in trade balance and to capital
inflows associated with Eurobond issues.
</P>
<P>
During the first 10 months of this year, the overall deficit
to expenditure ratio stood at 44.81 percent, compared with 42.71
percent during the first nine months of the year.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- A recent visit to Iraq by a high-ranking Lebanese
delegation has laid the groundwork for reviving a multi-million
bilateral trade market, the Ad Diyar newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, made up of two government ministers and more
than 100 businessmen, ended their four-day visit to Baghdad with
Iraq's pledges to make Lebanon once again one of its major trading
partners.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to promote bilateral trade volume to the
threshold of 300 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The annual shopping festival will be held in Lebanon
in February next year, the Daily Star reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Economy and Trade Nasser Saidi said a number of
hotels and car rental companies would be offering 50 percent off
selected services throughout the festival.
</P>
<P>
To attract visitors from abroad, an advertising campaign is
being launched in the U.S. city of Detroit to encourage Lebanese
expatriate community to visit the festival, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 6 percent
in the 1998-99 fiscal year ending in June, up from 5.7 percent in
the previous year, the Al Ahram daily reported on Saturday.

<P>
The current account deficit stood at 1.7 billion U.S. dollars
in 1998-99, down from 2.5 billion dollars in 1997-98, partly
because of a significant recovery of the tourism industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- At least five soldiers of
Uganda People' s Defense Forces (UPDF) were killed by the rebel
Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in western part of the country
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Police Spokesman Asuman Mugenyi told Xinhua in a telephone
interview Saturday evening that the ADF rebels attacked a police
barracks in Bundibugyo district at about 6:00 a.m. local time and
the killed soldiers were among those sent over to reinforce the
police.
</P>
<P>
"Four rebels were killed in the exchange of fire and two
policemen were injured," he said, adding that the ADF rebels have
been repulsed by the government troops.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time the ADF rebels launched attack in
western Uganda within three days.

On Thursday, some 200 ADF rebels attacked a prison in the same
region, abducted more than 300 inmates before making off with some
weapons. This was followed by Friday when they attacked seven
military detaches and killed four government soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Stresses No Change on Cyprus Following EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Despite accepted as a candidate
for European Union (EU) membership, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem still reiterated Turkey's policy consistency on Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Following EU's acceptance as a candidate Friday night, Cem said
that a new page had been opened in the history of Turkey, adding
that "this is a historical day for Turkey," the Anatolia News
Agency Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed "there is no change in Turkey's attitude toward
Cyprus. On the contrary, Turkey has acquired the capability of
defending the Cyprus cause in a new field."
</P>
<P>
He also said that there may be difficulties, but these will be
overcome in a determined attitude, citing that Turkey had some
concerns over the text which was brought to it, but it succeeded
in making some changes.
</P>
<P>
Cem explained "our political and legal objections to the
application of the Greek Cypriot Administration are still valid."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled north
and Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, the long-standing rivals over territorial
dispute in the Aegean and the Cyprus issue, support their the own
ethnic side on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cem stressed Turkey's policy is based on the principle of two
states. If a compromised settlement emerges, Turkey's policy of
two states concerning Cyprus is still valid.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is the only state that recognizes a republic established
by the Turkish Cypriots in 1983 in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"We will defend our Cyprus cause with the same
determination. Of course, a Turkey who is an EU candidate, will
have the opportunity to defend more effectively not only the
problems related to the Aegean, but also our justified Cyprus
cause," the foreign minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Cem went on to say that "we gave priority to national
interests and interests of our people in this candidacy
process. We will carry on with the same sensitivity."
</P>
<P>
"Our basic precondition was that we would not accept any
precondition," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that EU's foreign policy high representative Lavier
Solana arrived in Turkey late Friday to brief the Turkish
Government on the union's decision and formally clarified the
points which were needed to be clarified.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that if the Turkish government formally
decides to accept the EU's invitation, Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit and Cem will fly to Helsinki, the venue for the ongoing EU
summit, to meet the EU leaders and representatives of the other
candidate countries.

JOHANNESBURG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela Saturday urged all conflicting parties in
Burundi to reach a peace agreement as soon as possible to end the
six-year civil war.

<HEADLINE> Left Wing-Parties Stress Federation in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The second Euro-Mediterranean
Meeting of Left-Wing Parties Saturday stressed that a solution to
the Cyprus issue should be based on a bi-zonal, bi-communal
federation.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted at the three-day meeting, which started
Friday in Cyprus' southern coastal town of Limassol, the 46
left-wing parties from 27 countries and regions called on the
U.N. Security Council to "intensify its efforts to promote and
reach a just and viable solution" to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between the two Cypriot
communities on the island are underway in New York to continue the
efforts to reunify the island.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also expressed the strong conviction that the
Cyprus issue "can and should be solved by peaceful means and
procedures within the framework of the U.N.."
</P>
<P>
The solution should be within the framework of relevant
U.N. resolutions on the issue and the 1977 and 1979 High-Level
Agreements and international law.
</P>
<P>
It should provide for a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation
formula and respect the independence, sovereignty, unity and
territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus, the resolution
added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, Secretary-General of Cyprus' left-wing AKEL
party Demetris Christofias briefed the participants on the latest
developments on the Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Flies Through Cave to Make History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHANGJIAJIE, CHINA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Peter
Besenyei talked big and did brilliantly.
</P>
<P>
He had his name on the history books as the pilot became the
first man to fly plane through cavern on Saturday in the 1999
Zhangjiajie Aerial Acrobatics Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Before the eye-popping performance the air hero gave himself a
pep talk, saying that to get his plane through the cave is just a
cup of tea to him.
</P>
<P>
While he did what he said as he hovered before the cave opening
for as long as one minute before he treated the crowds to a
spectacular venture through the impossible odyssey.
</P>
<P>
"It is really exciting. My family are watching the live
television and they must feel very proud of me.
</P>
<P>
"I came here just to achieve the feat, and I am confident of
myself. It is a little windy today and I did have some hesitation,
but I was not feeling nervous," he said after landing from the
impossible to real life.
</P>
<P>
Under the inspiration of his cliff-hanging gallantry, six other
stunt masters managed the same breath-taking feat by needling safe
and sound through the cave, which hung above steep cliff 1,261
meters high above sea level.
</P>
<P>
The cavern, which stands 127.37 meters tall and 279.42 meters
long with the minimum width only 28.03 meters, has posed not only
a challenge to the flying skills, but also put to stern test the
mental toughness of the pilots who hung their life by a hair.
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem for those Brave Hearts are the unsteady
airstream and whirlpool in the cave which results from the
temperatures which varied with height from time to time.

<P>
However, experts said that by the standards of flying skills
nowadays, the feat is within reach as the planes, with a body
length of 7 or 8 meters and wing width of 8 or 10 meters, should
have no trouble getting through on paper.
</P>
<P>
All the 15 participants of the aerobatics grand prix all
revealed their great ardor and confidence in pulling through such
historic feat, but only 7 of them finally gained the chances to
try their luck by drawing lots after the organisers took the live
television into consideration.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Dogged by Disputes Over Charter Change (1)                 By Pan Jiaxu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The last year of this century
has witnessed the ongoing dispute in the Philippines over the
proposed charter revision, which has aroused concerns nationwide
over the nation's future.
</P>
<P>
The controversy erupted as the government vowed to "correct"
the constitutional "flaws" to open up the country to foreign
capital, while opponents warned this will jeopardize the nation's
interests both politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
In his state-of-the-nation address in early July, President
Joseph Estrada made the formal proposal to kick off the drive to
change what he called "obsolete" provisions in the current
constitution.
</P>
<P>
"In the race with the rest of the world market to the coming
millennium, we cannot afford to let our constitution bind our feet,
" Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
"Let us not allow our paranoid fears to block the convening of
an appropriate assembly or convention to rewrite our Charter," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution which went into effect in 1987,
foreigners are not allowed to own land in the country and their
ownership share of the country's industry can not exceed 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
In early August, Estrada gave further explanations on his call
to remove the restrictions to the country's power, water,
telecommunications, transportation, and the like.
</P>
<P>
Noting that these public utilities are highly capital-intensive,
he said the nation's income and savings rate were too low to
generate the huge investments needed for the sectors' development.
"It is only foreign capital that can fill up our investment gap."
</P>
<P>
These sectors are also the "backbone of the future development,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The charter change move weighs even heavier as he recalled the
downturn pace in his country's economic development, comparing
with surrounding neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Economic reforms will make the Philippines at par with its
Asian neighbors that have already forged ahead in the race toward
development, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, "unblocking" investments in the development
of rural areas will help lift the nation's rural population out of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Investments create jobs, and jobs provide both income and
dignity," he explained, adding they are the "decisive eliminators"
of the grinding poverty.
</P>
<P>
In the following months, Estrada spared no effort to call for
economic reforms through the process of charter change, which
reportedly includes allowing foreigners to own land and control
equity in industries.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his inclination to adopt political amendments
to the constitution, which reports said include an extension of
the term limits of elected officials.
</P>
<P>
But he said he approves two-step reforms: economic amendments
should be submitted to a plebiscite in 2001, while political
reforms will be taken up in 2004 when his term runs out.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada's bid for charter change immediately set off a
political storm, which was highlighted by two waves of protest
rallies starting in August.
</P>
<P>
The first occurred on August 20 when some 75,000 people, led by
former president Crazon Aquino and Manila Archbishop Jaime
Cardinal Sin, gathered in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Blasting the charter change bid in their rally speeches, both
Mrs. Aquino and Sin said the government's drive is a challenge to
the democratic rights enshrined in the charter. Citing the rate of
86 percent of rejection, Mrs. Aquino warned Estrada against
picking a fight with people.
</P>
<P>
An expanded wave of protest rallies took place a month later
when tens of thousands of people in at least 32 provinces and
cities nationwide reportedly took part in the mass action. Rally
organizers said this was a stronger message of their opposition.

<TEXT>
<P>
... a stronger message of their opposition.
</P>
<P>
Analysts unveiled their political, economic and social
approaches to the mass opposition.
</P>
<P>
Some opponents fear that the planned charter amendment will set
a dangerous precedent, saying Estrada may later abuse the
procedure to give him a second term.
</P>
<P>
Under the charter, which was promulgated one year after the 20-
year-old Marcos administration was ousted, each elected president
should be given only a six-year term of office.
</P>
<P>
The constitution makers believed that any term extension might
lead to abuse of power and bring about the repeat of what they
called the "dictatorship."
</P>
<P>
Some critics even cited as a warning the failed attempt by
Estrada's predecessor, Fidel Ramos, to extend his six-year term
under the pretext of charter change.
</P>
<P>
After a similar protest rally in September 1997, again led by
Sin and Mrs. Aquino, Ramos dropped his effort.
</P>
<P>
Some opponents, however, did not refuse to reform, but opposed
Estrada's plan to amend the charter by convening Congress into a
constituent assembly.
</P>
<P>
They said Congress, which is dominated by members of the ruling
party, will simply do the president's bidding.
</P>
<P>
The moment Congress convenes as a constituent assembly, they
said, it has the complete freedom to propose and adopt whatever
amendments it wants.
</P>
<P>
They said that only a plebiscite can reflect the purity of the
"will of the Filipino people."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, growing oppositions were heard against the economic
reform.
</P>
<P>
"To allow the foreigners again to exploit our natural resources
means to lose control of our economy, thus leaving it in the hands
of rich foreign capitalists in the long run," warned a critic
called Eddie Vilanueva.
</P>
<P>
Some critics said opening up agricultural land to foreign
ownership will induce social instability.
</P>
<P>
Different from developed countries where the greater bulk of
people do not depend on land, they added, there are 40 percent of
Filipinos who depend on agriculture for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Social instability will force the country to pay a much higher
price for the charter change move, the critics said.
</P>
<P>
As for foreign ownership of public utilities, critics said
Malaysia, Thailand and many other Asian neighbors also impose
similar limitations as the Philippines, but these limitations have
not deterred their attraction of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
If it is to fix up the economy, they stressed, there is no need
to revise the constitution. Only work through legislation will do,
they noted.
</P>
<P>
The protest rallies and mounting oppositions brought down the
rating of Estrada's approval in the surveys conducted in October.
</P>
<P>
Critics said Estrada should take the surveys as a "wake-up call
" to start moving to show that he and his administration were
listening to the public cry.
</P>
<P>
The president, however, reaffirmed his determination in the
charter change bid, describing as "non-negotiatable" his stand on
amending the charter to remove protectionism and open up the
country to foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing to change...," he said in October, adding
that he will continue his effort even if his popularity drops to
zero and blaming the "black propaganda" of his detractors.
</P>
<P>
Defending the charter change bid, Estrada said it is entirely
different from former president Ramos' effort, which, he said, was
political in nature.
</P>
<P>
He reassured the public that the issue on the lifting of the
term limits of elected officials could be tackled after the end of
his term in 2004.
</P>
<P>
He also clarified that the charter change excludes farm lands
from foreign ownership, saying that only nonagricultural land
developed as industrial estates and economic zones would be open.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some business leaders did not hesitate to
give their support to the government's economic effort.
</P>
<P>
Rewriting the charter will give local products wider access to
global market, said Alberto Fenix, head of the Philippine Chamber
of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
"Not only do we lack capital, we also need the technology and
market access to foreign investors," he added.
</P>
<P>
Some observers said the government should handle the procedure
very carefully to avoid political and social instability.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the drop of business confidence and the evasion of
foreign investments triggered by instability will be the right
nemesis, they stressed.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Seizes Fake Dollar Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican police have
seized 859, 000 U.S. dollars in counterfeit 100 dollar bills this
month in the province Sofala in central of Mozambique, Mozambique
News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the director of the Sofala branch of the Criminal
Investigation Police (PIC), Jose Namburete, these are part of a
consignment of four million dollars worth of counterfeit bills,
believed to have been manufactured in Malawi. He said that so far
the police have detained six people, all of them Mozambicans, in
connection with the case.
</P>
<P>
He said the false dollars were mainly circulating in the
countryside. The forgers had targeted the peasantry because the
fake 100 dollar bills are poor imitations of the real thing.
</P>
<P>
The police had received a tip-off in November that the
counterfeit bills were about to enter the country. The bill were
brought over the border on December 1, said Namburete, and the
police made their arrests two days later. The police are now
looking for the rest of the counterfeits.

stressed that the objective of the treaty is to maintain "order
and stability in this region and a friendly Uzbekistan".
</P>
<P>
"Russia has its interests in Central Asia and Central Asia is a
power, whose help is sought in maintaining regional stability and
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
The military cooperation between Russia and Uzbekistan will
include joint military exercises, military personnel training and
cooperation in the military-technical sphere, Putin added.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Karimov expressed concern over terrorism
and extremism. "The Russian presence helps counter this crawling
expansion," he said, adding that Uzbekistan intends "to build
relations with Russia on a bilateral friendship basis."
</P>
<P>
Putin and Karimov also discussed the issue of Uzbekistan's
Russian-speaking ethnic minority and plans to further develop
economic, cultural, scientific and other contacts between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Besides the military cooperation treaty, the Russian premier
and the Uzbek president also signed several other accords, which
include a treaty to step up weapons trade, a long-term deal to
swap Uzbek cotton fiber for some kinds of Russian goods and two
protocols on contacts between the two states' customs services.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Tashkent on Friday, Putin called Uzbekistan
a Russia's "partner for many, many years" and said that the main
purpose of his visit was to prepare a meeting between the Russian
and Uzbek presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Islam Karimov.
</P>
<P>
Putin, who will return to Moscow late Saturday, is also
scheduled to visit Tashkent's Valery Chkalov aircraft-making group
and meet members of Uzbekistan's ethnic Russian community.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: EU Maps Out Blueprint For Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKY, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
summit meeting ended here in Helsinky Saturday with an overall
blueprint on a widened and deepened Europe for future in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
All state and government leaders from the European Union (EU)
members closed their two-day summit with a 15-page document which
include final conclusions about the 15-nation bloc's preparing for
enlargement, common security and defense policy, economic
development targets, citizen-related security, external relations,
and the Northern Ireland issue.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders confirmed the importance of the enlargement
process launched in December 1997 for the stability and prosperity
for the entire European continent. An efficient and credible
enlargement process must sustained, they said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also reaffirm "the inclusive nature" of the EU's
accession process, which now comprises 13 candidate nations
"within a single framework" on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is a candidate State destined to join the Union on the
basis of the same criteria as applied to the other candidate
states," the EU leader said in a conclusion. "Turkey, like other
candidate states, will benefit from a preaccession strategy to
stimulate and support its reforms," they added.
</P>
<P>
Allowing Turkey to be of EU candidate status is the only
decision made by the EU leaders at the summit since all other
issues had been reviewed or cleared at EU Council of ministers'
meetings for the leaders' approval.
</P>
<P>
The enlargement process will promote a "broader Europe", but
the EU has to carry out institutional reforms before embracing
more members in the future. Therefore, the EU leaders set an
agenda during the summit about the Intergovernmental Conference on
institutional reform. They vowed to have "effective institutions"
with transparency, principles of subsidiary and better
lawmaking, as well as enhanced fight against fraud.
</P>
<P>
In order to deepen the European integration, the EU leaders
gave a green light for common European security and defense
policy, showing the EU is beginning its first step to realize its
long-cherished political goal.
</P>
<P>
The EU stressed its determination to develop "an autonomous
capacity to take decisions and, where NATO as a whole is not
engaged, to launch and conduct EU-led military operations in
response to international crises".
</P>
<P>
"This process will avoid unnecessary duplication and does not
imply the creation of a European army," the EU leaders said in
final documents of the summit.
</P>
<P>
The European Union wants to develop its military and
non-military crisis management capability as part of its
"strengthened common European policy on security and defense", but
still fear to speak clearly its mind about the eventual aim of
setting up European defense capabilities because of sensitive
transatlantic relationship.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders cautiously said that cooperating "voluntarily in
EU-led operations", EU members by 2003 must be able to deploy
within 60 days and "sustain for at least one year military forces
of up to 50,000-60,000 persons" capable of carrying out
peacekeeping or humanitarian aid missions in the future.
</P>
<P>
The first step is a substantial one, but the force is neither a
European army nor the permanent EU troops, it is just a symbol for
Europeans to do their businesses by themselves with their own
will, observers believe.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the EU leaders show their resolve to develop
a competitive, job-generating, and sustainable economy in Europe.
They are optimistic about the EU's "sound fundamentals" in
investment, unemployment and public finances. While they also set
strategic targets on other internal policies with a direct impact
on citizens and external relations.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission President Romano Prodi said the summit
meeting has opened a new chapter for EU enlargement and it has
also unveiled a new era for the bloc to deepen its integration.
However, the summit has raised certain questions such as how does
the European Union define its boundary in the future and what will
be the utmost goal for European integration?
</P>
<P>
The summit's future blueprint delivered a message that a wider
Europe will have more difficulties to meet the challenges for
pushing ahead with a more united process.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Opposition Urged to Call off Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Garments
Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) Saturday urged the
opposition to call off their hartals (strike) scheduled on
December 13 and 14 "in the greater interest of the country's ready-
made garments sector."
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led opposition alliance
earlier announced its fresh anti-government programs, including
hartal in Chittagong city scheduled on December 13 and 14 and a
countrywide hartal scheduled on December 13, to compel the
government to cancel the election schedule of Chittagong City
Corporation and accept the one-point demand for holding national
election.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement Saturday night, BGMEA president Anisur
Rahman Sinha pointed out that an unrealistic political program
like hartal would push Bangladesh far backward when the whole
world was preparing to march ahead with new vigor in the coming
century.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Finland Announces International Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKY, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Finnish Prime Minister Paavo
Lipponen said here Saturday that Finland is to introduce an
international Millennium Award for innovation-oriented activities
in promoting quality of life and humane social values.
</P>
<P>
The proposed international award of "extremely high prestige,
significance and prominence" would be made "to an individual,
organization or project for a far-sighted technology-based
innovation with broad potential impact in promoting quality of
life and humane social values," the prime minister told European
Union (EU) leaders who were gathering the Finnish capital for
their final summit meeting in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Award, which means to be set up in the next
century, would be worth one million euros (1.02 million U.S.
dollars) and would be presented annually as of 2000 by the Finnish
president, Lipponen said.
</P>
<P>
The selection criteria would be set by a jury appointed by the
Finnish government, he added.
</P>
<P>
A group of experts planning the award believe that a
high-profile, widely publicized award of this kind "would increase
Finland's visibility in the outside world and generate valuable
international contacts and networks both directly and indirectly,
Lipponen stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Merely the screening of candidates would provide a great deal
of useful information about international developments in
innovative technology," the prime minister said, adding the award
would also promote progress in the field within Finland.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Turkey's EU Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides Saturday welcomed Turkey's being listed "in the ranks of
the candidate countries" of the European Union (EU), the Cyprus
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders on Friday at their Helsinki summit officially
announced that EU members had reached a consensus on offering
Turkey the candidacy for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
But the EU offer was reported to be conditional. European
leaders wanted Turkey to improve its human rights record as well
as relations with neighboring countries, which include Greece and
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have been locked in long-running territorial
disputes over Aegean islets, and 35,000 Turkish troops have been
stationed in northern Cyprus since their 1974 invasion.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel on Saturday welcomed the EU
decision and called it a "positive development."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus started substantive accession negotiations with the EU
in November 1998. It is believed that Turkey's candidacy would
ease Ankara's objection to Cyprus' entry into the European
organization.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said Cyprus will spare no effort in finding an
agreed-upon, just, viable and workable solution to its political
issue, despite that the EU does not consider such a solution as a
precondition to the island's EU accession aspiration.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, who is in New York to attend the proximity talks on
Cyprus between the two Cypriot communities under the
U.N. auspices, said the decisions taken in Helsinki "established
the principle which will guide the decisions of the EU during the
21st century."
</P>
<P>
The EU "makes absolutely clear that the solution of problems
must be by peaceful means and that any candidate country including
Turkey must demonstrate that they accept and implement human
rights as well as they harmonize their laws and institutions with
the acquis communautaire," Clerides added.

WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
on Saturday that the peace talks between Israel and Syria would be
difficult but not as hard as other Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"It id difficult, but not as complex in my view as the
Palestinian negotiation talks with Israel," Clinton told a radio
interview with CBS news in Orlando, Florida.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Shara will start their peace talks next Wednesday and
Thursday in Washington. their talks are expected to focus on the
Golan Heights, the Syrian territory captured by Israel during the
1967 war.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would like Barak and Shara to get to each other
in the first few days of talks, before real negotiations begin.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see them get together, talks together, get to
know each other a little better and agree on an agenda and a
timetable," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And then take a couple of days off, go back meet with their
respective teams, decide where they're going to start and where
they're going to stop, then come back here and work right on
through it -- just keep going till we get the thing done," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the Barak-Shara talks came about now because all
sides felt a sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
"Both leaders for different reasons have a sense of urgency,"
Clinton said. "I think they know the enemies of the peace process
are gearing up and they want to try to derail it.
</P>
<P>
"I think they know there's a sense of hope and possibility now
and I think they know that Prime Minister Barak is committed to
trying to resolve all this just like he said he was ," Clinton

MANAGUA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan army chief Gen.
Joaquin Cuadra said on Saturday that the armed forces are in a
state of previous combat preparation, ready to defend the nation
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"Defensive measures have been taken to support Nicaragua
foreign policy, which fundamentally seeks to resolve the conflict
(with Honduras) through diplomatic and political way," said Cuadra.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Honduras and Nicaragua are tense after the
Honduran Congress ratified last week a maritime limits treaty
signed with Colombia in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua says that the treaty takes 130,000 square kilometers
off its territorial waters in the Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Cuadra said that he agreed with President Arnoldo Aleman and
the National Assembly deputies to add an increase to the army
budget to reinforce some armed units, especially the navy.
</P>
<P>
The military chief will travel next week at the head of a
commission to supervise the combat preparation of the troops
deployed in the border with Honduras, in the north of the country.
Cuadra said that no incident has occurred in the border up to now.
</P>
<P>
However, he confirmed that the Honduran troops have carried out
cleaning work in their bulwarks and trenches.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan army has done the same, polishing its plans,
organizing General Staff officers work teams for their
mobilization in the field, said Cuadra.
</P>
<P>
Honduras and Nicaragua blamed each other again last night of
mobilizing troops to the common border.

<HEADLINE> Panama Hails Chinese Investment in Canal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian Foreign
Minister Jose Miguel Aleman said Saturday that his country is
proud of the Chinese investments in the interoceanic waterway and
considered ungrounded any concern of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Aleman made this statement after some U.S. Republican
congressmen said that China pretends to own the Panama Canal
through investments of the Hong Kong "Hutchinson" port company.
</P>
<P>
"We feel very proud because a company of that level has decided
to invest in Panama. We wish five more like this one would come to
work in our country, because we still have many areas for
development," Aleman told the press.
</P>
<P>
"The Hutchinson company is an international firm whose shares
quote in the London Stock Exchange. If the United States is afraid,
it can buy the firm's stock and take control of the company," said
Aleman.
</P>
<P>
The Hutcinson Hong Kong company administers the Balboa and
Cristobal ports in the Panama Canal entrances.
</P>
<P>
Aleman said that the Hong Kong firm won the bidding for the two
main Panamanian ports respecting and fulfilling the Panamanian
legal requirements.
</P>
<P>
"It has to be considered that this conflict (the controversy
for the presence of Chinese investments in the canal) emerges
mainly as a trade controversy, that became political afterwards,
because of the electoral climate in the United States," said
Aleman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has not questioned the presence of the Hong
Kong enterprise in Panamanian territory, said Aleman.
</P>
<P>
The United States will hand over the Canal to Panama and will
withdraw its troops no later than December 31 this year.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Arab Lawmaker on Israel's Quit of Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Israeli Arab
lawmaker Azmi Bishara said here Saturday that Israeli withdrawal
from the Golan Heights is the precondition for normalization of
relations between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Bishara, the Balad leader, made the remark in his second
meeting in two days with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
Bishara stressed that "only after the last Israeli soldier
leaves the Golan Heights," can the two countries exchange
diplomatic missions and open embassy in each other's capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the strategic plateau of Golan from Syrian in the
1967 Middle East war and annexed it in 1981.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Wednesday that Syria and
Israel have agreed to resume talks next week in Washington from
where they left off, after a 45-month hiatus.
</P>
<P>
Bishara said the U.S. had assured Syria that Israel would
withdraw to the borders before June 4, 1967 on the eve of the
Mideast war, which led to the acceptance by Syria to restart peace
talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Syria and Israel will establish normal ties
within the framework of a peace deal, and security arrangements
will be made to guarantee the security of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Bishara's visit to Syria falls within the framework of keeping
consultation with Syria on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bishara, who arrived here Thursday, also met
Damascus-based Palestinian political faction leaders on the latest
developments in the Palestinian-Israeli final status talks that
would produce a permanent peace deal by next September.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, he urged unity among the Palestinian
factions and their joint efforts to "meet future challenges."
</P>
<P>
The Damascus-based Palestinian factions have recently softened
their opposition to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
peace-making with Israel, following a series of meetings and
consultations with the Palestinian authority.

<HEADLINE> Hot-shooting Bayi Rockets Sinks Shanghai Sharks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The hot-shooting Bayi Rockets
stamped their authority over title challengers Shanghai Sharks 114-
104 in a sixth-round match at the Chinese Basketball Association (
CBA) league in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tagged as one of the most promising title contenders, Shanghai
had the least help from their team star Cheng Chih-lung, the Most
Valuable Player from the Chinese Taipei league, who failed to
shrug off his pace-follower Chen Ke of Bayi and finished with only
6 points and 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Cheng, who joined Shanghai this season due to the lockout of
the league in Chinese Taipei, scored only six points from six
shots in the field.
</P>
<P>
"We played a defensive game and Chen Ke was the best on the
position," Bayi head coach Zhang Bin said. "We forced them to make
turnovers and miss shots while our players shot the ball very well
tonight."
</P>
<P>
Bayi shot 54 percent in the field and 43 percent behind the arc
with the 2.16-meter pivot Wang Zhizhi even sank two three-pointers
on two attempts.
</P>
<P>
Forwards Liu Yudong and Li Nan scored 29 points apiece while
Wang added 26.
</P>
<P>
"Turnovers costed us the game," said Li Qiuping, Shanghai's
head coach. "We had more to learn from the experienced Bayi. We
did not understand how to play with the body and the composure."
</P>
<P>
American importer Michael Jones led Shanghai with 22 points and
Zhang Wenqi and another American center Montreal Dobbins each
added 20.
</P>
<P>
Bayi Rockets leads the 12-team league with 11 points from five
wins and one loss, following by .
</P>
<P>
Another game in Zhejiang saw the home team Zhejiang Cyclone
upset Vanguard Aoshen 100-92 in the capital of Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
American guard Jason Woodard drilled in 34 points to lead
Zhejiang, which had five players in double-digit figures.
</P>
<P>
"Aoshen is a fast team but we managed to slow down their paces,
" said Zhang Dewei, Zhejiang's head coach. "In defense, we held on
the positions to leave little room to their shooters."
</P>
<P>
Aoshen's forward Ma Jian and center Levon Ellis contributed 21
each as they shot 5-22 outside the defense.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Ducks held consecutive home wins, but they almost
squandered a 22-point lead to beat Shandong Flaming Bulls 78-70 in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Stunning the league with a victory over the defending champions
Bayi, Beijing scored just five points in the fourth quarter, the
lowest points scoring in one quarter in the league.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other matches, Jilin Northeast Tigers lost to
Guangdong Tigers 115-106, Nanjing Army defeated Hubei Meierya 113-
100 and Liaoning Hunters cracked down Jiangsu Dragons 102-87 on
the road.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Predicts Low Economic Growth for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The real economic growth of
Zimbabwe this year is projected at 1.2 percent, down from 1.5
percent in 1998, according to a business magazine.
</P>
<P>
"Even with a good agricultural season and a strong gold price,
growth next year is unlikely to exceed two percent," The Megabuck
said in its December issue released here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It drew a pessimistic picture of the country's economic growth
for 1999 on the basis that major sectors of the economy are
expected to post low levels of growth.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output in 1999 is likely to reach low levels of
output ever recorded since 1985, it said, adding that the
depressed world mineral prices would result in a decline of
earnings from the sector by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Despite efforts to devalue the currency, prospects for
increases in the level of exports future are little due to
escalating inflationary and interest rates. Total exports are
expected to be 1.75 billion U.S. dollars at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
It warned that the adoption of a tight monetary policy would
result in an environment of negative real lending rates.

<HEADLINE> People Free to Believe in Catholicism in Post-Return Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Catholicism is expected to
continue drawing a large following in Macao after it returns to
China on Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
"Catholicism will continue to exist in post-return Macao and
retain its influence as a religion with the second biggest
following after Buddhism," said Domingos Lam, the 72-year bishop
of the Macao diocese.
</P>
<P>
Domingos Lam became a priest in 1953 and has been bishop for 12
years. He is the 23rd bishop of the Macao diocese and also the
first Chinese bishop.
</P>
<P>
"Macao people will continue to be free to believe in
Catholicism or any other religion," he said, referring to related
articles in the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Living in an open society like Macao, many people naturally
turn to religions for spiritual sustenance, Domingos Lam said,
adding that Catholic churches will do their best to serve Macao
people in the future.
</P>
<P>
Western missionaries came to Macao as Portugal occupied this
piece of Chinese territory in the mid-16th century. A total of
eight parishes have been established in Macao so far, with 12
grand churches erected. Churches are providing education to nearly
half of all primary and middle school students in Macao in
addition to setting up charity institutions such as orphanages,
homes for the aged and sanitoriums.
</P>
<P>
The number of Catholics in Macao, according to Bishop Domingos
Lam, has increased to the present 30,000 from 10,000 in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
After Macao returns to its motherland, churches in Macao will
become more closely related with their counterparts in the Chinese
mainland, but they will stay independent of one another, said
Domingos Lam, who is going to retire in three years.
</P>
<P>
Local churches will train their own priests in the future, and
more Portuguese-speaking Catholics will learn to pray in Chinese
by then, he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Opposition Party to Carry out Revamp Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's opposition
Democratic Action Party (DAP), which suffered a setback in the
November 29 general election, Sunday vowed to carry out a total
revamp exercise to reinvent the party for a strong comeback in the
next general election.
</P>
<P>
DAP won 10 parliamentary seats in the general election, but its
chairman, secretary-general and deputy chairman were all defeated.
</P>
<P>
The urgent need for the party to carry out the revamp exercise
was highlighted by the catastrophic result in the November 29
general election, its new secretary-general Kerk Kim Hock said
Sunday when addressing DAP parliamentarians and state assemblymen
at the party's headquarters in Petaling Jaya near here, according
to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
"Our survey has clearly shown that the issue of Islamic State
was the main factor resulting in the party's dismal performance,"
Kerk was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that to revamp the party, DAP must increase the number
of its branches nationwide and make them centers of political
influence in their respective areas as well as the centers of
education, organization, publicity and activities.
</P>
<P>
He called upon all party leaders, MPs, state assemblymen and
defeated candidates to show total commitment and prepare
themselves to accept collective and individual responsibility for
any failure or weakness of the revamp exercise.
</P>
<P>
Kerk said the DAP leadership and members must march on to
improve the overall fighting capability of the party and at the
same time beware of the external forces to destabilize the party.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Romaldo Hat-Trick Honors Shandong With Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, China, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Romaldo's hat-trick
soliloquy offered a double victory for the Shandong Luneng of the
Chinese football league and the cup titles, recorded an
astonishing come-back 3-2 win over Dalian Wanda at the final of
the League Cup here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Shandong became the first team to wrap up a title double in the
league and the cup championships, which had the sixth season
called off last weekend.
</P>
<P>
After a 4-0 thrash of bottom team Wuhan Heart K in the final
game last weekend, Shandong edged off Liaoning Fushun, who were
held a 1-1 draw in Beijing by Guo'an, by just one point to win the
league championship for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's clash with Wanda was predicted as a one-sided match as
Wanda, winners of the 1997-98 season, which escaped relegation
after the closing win last Sunday, were no longer on the same
level as the much-improving Shandong.
</P>
<P>
But it was Wanda who opened the mark in the return game when
striker Wang Peng scored in the 28th minutes to give Wanda a 2-1
lead on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguayan striker put the home team ahead with two goals in
the 72nd and 81st minutes to shoot Shandong into the driving seat.
</P>
<P>
But Wanda almost turned the table around with Swede Peter's
strike five minutes later and the northeast city team seemed to
pocket the trophy on away goals rule.
</P>
<P>
The unbelievable Romaldo threw the stadium into ecstasy when he
scored the winner two minutes into the injury time to give
Shandong the most amazing victory of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
"We did not come out in the first half," Shandong's head coach
Slobodan Santrac said. "But Romaldo was the hero and he inspired
the team to fight for the honor."
</P>
<P>
Wanda's head coach Milorad Kosanovic said, "We deserved the
victory but the God of Luck was on their side. I believe we could
make it next time."

<HEADLINE> World's Biggest Container Vessel Stops Over in Malaysia's Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The world's biggest
container vessel "Clifford Maersk" stopped over in Westport in
Klang near Kuala Lumpur Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was among those who
visited the ship, which is 347 meters long, 43 meters wide and has
a load capacity of 6,600 teus (twenty foot equivalent units),
Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Danish vessel is on its first tour of the Far East from
Europe. It is expected to proceed to Yokohama, Japan, and is
scheduled to stop over at Klang Port, some 30 kilometers west of
the capital again on December 29 on its return journey.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the "Clifford Maersk" clearly proved Port Klang'
s capability of handling big ships from all over the world,
Mahathir, accompanied by Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik during
the visit, told reporters, according to Bernama.
</P>
<P>
"We know that some years back Port Klang was just a feeder port.
But now we see mainlines coming here in great numbers including
even large vessels," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Port Klang, comprising Westport and two other ports, saw a 40.8
percent increase in the volume of containers handled this year
while transshipments recorded by the port jumped by 130 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir expressed satisfaction with the current efforts to
promote Port Klang among leading shipping lines, saying that many
of the companies acknowledged that the port offered all the
services and facilities they required.
</P>
<P>
According to Klang Port authorities, Westport, which could
handle 264 containers per hour, would spend 145 million ringgit (
38.157 million U.S. dollar) to upgrade its wharf facilities and
when the facilities were ready, the port would have the capacity
to handle 2.1 million teus of load.
</P>
<P>
Westport has already handled 800,000 teus of cargo this year, a
big rise over the 470,000 teus recorded last year.

<HEADLINE> 3 People Die in S. Africa's Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Three people died in a
plane crash at Plettenberg Bay airport in South Africa's Western
Cape Province on Sunday morning, bringing the total number of
people killed in air crashes this week to 18.
</P>
<P>
The crash happened around 9:40 a.m., police spokesman Eddie
Cronje said. It appeared that the plane collided into power-lines
in dense fog while coming to land at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Plettenberg Bay Aerodrome manager Gerrie Gouws said the ground
control tower did not receive any indication of trouble from the
plane before it crashed. The plane crashed into a field about four
kilometers to the west of the airport.
</P>
<P>
South African Civil Aviation Authority spokeswoman Jackie
Mofeka said a special team had been sent to investigate the
accident.
</P>
<P>
However, she claimed that people should not worry about the
safety of South Africa's airplanes because some urgent measures
would be implemented to prevent further aircraft crashes.
</P>
<P>
Ten people from a computer company died in a plane crash in
Germiston Monday, which was described as the worst single civil
aviation accident in South Africa in almost 20 years.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Springbok helicopter pilot Willem Piso, 38, who
represented South Africa in a competition against Russia some
years ago, was killed when his helicopter crashed on a farm.
</P>

Late Friday afternoon, a Cessna-172 crashed in heavy mist in
Kalmoesfontein, about 30 kilometers east of Lydenburg in

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Asks Maluku's People to Settle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid Sunday called on the Maluku people not to rely
on the government in settling their problem, according to the
Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"Those who should settle the problem in Maluku are the Maluku
people themselves. The central government only supports," Wahid
told a meeting of local public and religious figures in Ambon,
capital of Maluku.
</P>
<P>
Wahid, accompanied by Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri,
arrived in Ambon for a one-day visit to find a solution for a
series of communal clashes that has torn the region since January.
</P>
<P>
The province has been ravaged by a series of communal clashes
over the last few months. According to police records, the riots
have claimed 675 lives and left 975 other local people seriously
injured. On the part of the security agencies, 14 have been killed
and 47 seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said if the people could not settle their own problem,
the consequence is that the regional government and the security
apparatus could interfere in settling their problem.
</P>
<P>
On the proposal to divide Ambon into two regions for Muslims
and Christians, Wahid said it is used for the government's
consideration.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was offered by Chief of the Military General
Affairs Lt. Gen. Suadi Marasabessy recently.
</P>
<P>
Most of Indonesia's 207 million people are Muslim. Maluku is a
pre-dominantly Christian province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Megawati, during a meeting with prominent local
figures in Ambon on Sunday night, called for an end to religious
and ethnic-related clashes in the region, saying that they had
already caused many people to suffer.
</P>
<P>
"Let us stop the human tragedy which has been lasting for more
than 10 months," Megawati was quoted by Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
She asked people to understand the importance of ending the
violence.
</P>
<P>
"Please remember that clashes will never end through violences.
We have to control our emotion," she added.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has ordered the
formation of a supreme committee to supervise the privatization
program in Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The privatization program involves 47 public enterprises and
factories, including the Aden refinery, three cement factories,
pharmaceutical factories, ground services in six airports as well
as the land transport and communications sectors.
</P>
<P>
President Saleh signed the privatization law last October with
a view to intensifying the state's role in administering the
country's economy in line with market economy, encouragement of
private involvement, and establishment of a financial market to
regulate the sale and purchase of shares.
</P>
<P>
The law also defined several investment principles, including
transparency of measures, protection of workers' rights, expansion
of the property-ownership base by prompting workers to own shares
in privatized establishments and freedom of competition among
investors.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- A large number of companies from the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) have confirmed their participation in "The UAE in
Egypt" exhibition, which will be held in Cairo from March 27 to 30.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition aims to improve bilateral trade ties and
facilitates a move toward integrating the two economies to enjoy
considerable competitive edge, the Gulf News daily on Sunday
quoted organizers as saying.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is the third largest Arab investor in Egypt with a
total investment of more than 295 million U.S. dollars spreading
across a wide range of sectors, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Dubai, the regional trade hub of the UAE, will
host the Middle East International Optical and Ophthalmic
Exhibition on February 10-13.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which will draw wide international
participations, is a proof of the rapidly growing demand for
eyewear products in the Middle East, the Gulf News daily said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the Gulf area alone accounts for an
estimated 402-million-dollar share in sales of eyewear products.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia leads the Gulf market, with 164 million dollars in
sales, which is followed by the UAE that records 137 million
dollars in annual sales.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Meet Mubarak Over Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
is to visit Egypt on Monday for talks with President Hosni Mubarak
on the latest developments of the Middle East peace process, the
Palestinian ambassador in Cairo said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Zohdi al Qedra said Arafat will brief Mubarak on the results of
the interim phase of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and the
developments in the negotiations for a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, whose visit comes as part of the constant consultations
between the two leaders, will discuss with Mubarak the Israeli
settlement policy, al Qedra said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Israel's settlement expansion could destroy the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has enraged the Palestinians
by issuing tenders to build 3,196 new houses in settlements since
taking office in July, even more than his right-wing predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu issued in an average year.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demanded all 145 settlements, home to 170,000
Jews in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, be uprooted for peace to be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
Israel's settlement expansion has posed a major obstacle to the
progress of their final-status talks on the toughest issues
including the final borders, refugees, settlement and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat frequently visits Egypt to seek advice from Mubarak, who
as president of the first Arab country to conceive peace with
Israel, plays a key role in mediating the Mideast peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's export sector,
which has been in stagnation for the last decade, is showing no
signs of improvement in the current fiscal year as the trade
deficit is widening unchecked.
</P>
<P>
Figures available for the first five months (July-November) of
the 1999-2000 fiscal year show that Pakistan's trade deficit has
widened to 729 million U.S. dollars as against the full year's
target of 860 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance of the export sector this year follows the
dismal performance last year when exports plummeted to 7.7 billion
dollars compared with the target of 10 billion dollars, a fall of
10.5 percent against a targeted rise of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The export target for the current financial year has hence been
reduced to nine billion dollars with imports targeted at 9.86
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, in the first five months of the 1999-2000 fiscal year,
the long-running trade deficit problem is far from being tackled
as exports rose by a meager 7.9 percent against the target of 15
percent while imports jumped by 11.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Pakistan will still have to face this
chronic problem if the current trend continues.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe that one of the main reasons for
Pakistan's widening trade gap is high petroleum prices in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
The country's total import cost of petroleum products may rise
to 2.5 billion dollars for the whole fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
It will certainly be a heavy burden for the new government
which will be forced to look for diverse radical measures to boost
the flagging foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
As an agriculture-based nation, Pakistan's agriculture has a
direct bearing on the country's export performance.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's exports declined by four percent in 1996-97 due to
stagnation of the economy, while there was a four-percent increase
in exports in 1997-98 due to some improvement in agriculture and
industry.
</P>
<P>
The 10 percent decline in exports last fiscal year was also due
to a significant drop in the growth rate of both agriculture and
industry.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's exports have remained stagnant at around eight
billion dollars in the last four years, and in fact the annual
export target has never been met during the period.
</P>
<P>
To promote the export sector, Pakistan has devalued its
currency rupee by more than 50 percent in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the depreciation of rupee against the U.S.
dollar, the country's export is still in depressive condition.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that this is mainly because Pakistan's
exports are not price elastic. Export surpluses are not available
in the industrial sector to take advantage of the devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Devaluations did not help in any curtailment of imports either,
which became costlier and led to further inflation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf, who came to power
after the military coup on October 12, has stressed the importance
of not simply increasing the physical volume of exports but also
increasing the value-added and ensuring the quality of the exports
through rigorous checks, and looking for suitable markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
Urgent steps are needed to overcome the trade gap problem
through increasing export earnings and improving home remittance
receipts.
</P>
<P>
With a nominal foreign exchange reserve of around 1.6 billion
dollars and huge foreign exchange liabilities expected after the
middle of next year, Pakistan is in for a hard time ahead as the
country's trade deficit is to rise further.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Calls for Proper Use of Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi Sunday called upon the Kenyans to put the country's land to
maximum productivity as Kenya's future is still closely linked
with the land.
</P>
<P>
In most parts of Kenya, land is un-attended, Moi pointed out
when addressing the celebration marking the 36th Independence Day
in the capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Ministry of Agriculture and the provincial
administration to step up campaign for extensive land utilization.
</P>
<P>
"If properly and extensively utilized, our land should yield
gainful employment for many Kenyan youth, who today find it
difficult to get what to do after completion of their studies,"
Moi said.
</P>
<P>
He told the Kenyans to forget the habit of looking outside for
handouts, saying: "We must diversify our economy through external
grants and investments, but our future is still closely linked
with the land."
</P>
<P>
"We look extremely ridiculous when we import eggs, fruits,
juices, vegetables and livestock products, and yet we have some of
the best farmlands in the world", said the president.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in all development countries, the agricultural
sector formed the basis of their industrialization, saying that
"from the crops we produce in our farms, we can develop canning,
weaving and other agro- processing industries."
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that agriculture must therefore be re-
invigorated and urged agricultural experts and extension workers
in rural areas to deliver appropriate advice and seed to farmers.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
signed here Sunday the Pakistan Trade Maintenance Agreement (PTMA)
with eight commercial bank creditors for the rescheduling of 513
million U.S. dollars of short-term trade credits.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is part of the government's strategy for orderly

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebels Claim Capturing Military Camps in S.Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Tamil rebels said on Sunday
that they had captured two key army camps in northern Sri Lanka
after fierce battles.
</P>
<P>
The clandestine Voice of Tigers radio said the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) guerrillas captured the coastal camp
of Vettilaikerni after overrunning Kaddaikadu Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Both camps lie at east of Elephant Pass, a causeway linking the
mainland with the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry has not confirmed the LTTE's claims. But
the ministry said Saturday that heavy fighting raged near the
Elephant Pass army camps with the exchange of artillery and
mortars between the LTTE rebels and government troops.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that over 230 LTTE rebels had been killed,
while the rebels placed their losses at only 15 cadres killed.
</P>
<P>
Military spokesman Sunil Thennakoon said eight soldiers were
killed and another 90 wounded while repulsing the rebels' assaults
on the military defenses.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE is fighting a 16-year-old war in its bid to gain
independence for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between LTTE rebels and government troops has
intensified in recent weeks ahead of the presidential election on
December 21.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, LTTE rebels recaptured large chunks of
territory in the northern Wanni region that government troops had
seized over the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urges More Efforts in Burundi Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Nelson Mandela, the new
Burundi peace facilitator, has urged consultations on the few
outstanding issues be intensified so that consensus among various
parties in the country is reached as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The former South African President made the call Saturday in
his first press statement issued in the northern Tanzanian town of
Arusha, site of the talks, after he became the facilitator early
this month.
</P>
<P>
While wishing the negotiators and the Burundi in general a
happy New Year free of violence and killings, Mandela stressed
that the negotiators should "work harder in order to bring the
ongoing peace negotiations to a successful conclusion at a very
early date in the new year".
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Mandela called on the negotiators
to work hard so that the 17-month-old talks could come to an end
at "a very early date in the coming year".
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to Western European donors to continue
providing financial assistance to the talks, which are reportedly
to have cost at least eight million U.S. dollars since they began
in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 people, most of them civilians, have reportedly
died in six years of civil war in Burundi between Hutu rebels and
the government led by minority ethnic Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations, which have made little headway since they
began, ground to a halt in mid-August when the last mediator,
Tanzania's founding president Julius Nyerere's physical conditions
worsened.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was chosen as the new peace facilitator early this
month at a Great Lakes summit to replace Nyerere who died in
mid-October this year.

<HEADLINE> Syria, Israel May Reach Deal in Months: al-Sharaa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa said on Sunday that a peace accord with Israel
could be achieved within a few months.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after a meeting with visiting Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa that "We think we can achieve
genuine results within a short time if all the parties have the
good intentions."
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel are to resume peace talks in Washington
Wednesday, after a hiatus of nearly four years. The talks stalled
in early 1996 mainly because dispute over the return of Golan
Heights Israel captured from Syria in 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
``We are going to Washington with good intentions," al-Sharaa
said, "We are serious about making peace with Israel and we will
do whatever we can in order to contribute to the success of peace
between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
He said it was a "very important moment in the history of the
peace process," and Syria will be "positive" in negotiating with
the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa will lead the Syrian team while the Israeli side will
be headed by Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports said the two sides have been close to a deal
because most of the details about security arrangements,
normalization of relations and time frame have been worked out.
</P>
<P>
They will have to focus on the core issue of the Golan, with
Syrians adamant on a full Israel withdrawal and Barak ambiguous on
the scale.
</P>
<P>
Barak hoped for a fast track to an accord with Syria to
facilitate Israeli troops pullout from south Lebanon, where they
have been mired in a war of attrition since the occupation 15
years ago. The new Israeli prime minister had vowed to quit south
Lebanon by mid-summer next year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Lebanon, in which Syria has been an
important power broker, is expected to open talks with Israel soon
after the resumption of Syrian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who arrived here earlier Sunday to coordinate stands,
said he believed the resumption of Israeli-Syrian peace talks is a
"very serious and important development."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan's Trade Imbalance Problem Far From Being Tackled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's export sector,
which has been in stagnation for the last decade, is showing no
signs of improvement in the current fiscal year as the trade
deficit is widening unchecked.
</P>
<P>
Figures available for the first five months (July-November) of
the 1999-2000 fiscal year show that Pakistan's trade deficit has
widened to 729 million U.S. dollars as against the full year's
target of 860 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance of the export sector this year follows the
dismal performance last year when exports plummeted to 7.7 billion
dollars compared with the target of 10 billion dollars, a fall of
10.5 percent against a targeted rise of 15 percent.

<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Youth League of
China opened its third plenary session of the 14th Central
Committee here today.
</P>
<P>
An important speech by Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao on the
role of youth was announced at the meeting by Zhou Qiang, the
first secretary of the league's Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, made after hearing the work report of the youth
league, Hu called on league members to be enthusiastic and
creative as pioneers in China's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
League members in state-run factories should ardently support
economic reforms such as the establishment of a modern corporate
system, development of new products, technical renovation, and
improvement in enterprises' internal management, said Hu, who is
also member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and member of
the CPC Central Committee Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Hu pointed out that members in rural areas should equip
themselves with the technological competence to further develop
economic reform in China's countryside.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that it is the league's fundamental task to
inspire China's youth through ideological and political studies.
League committees at various levels should also promote
international and domestic affairs to China's youth.
</P>
<P>
Hu added that the league has the duty to help those who have
financial difficulties and who encounter problems in their study,
work and life.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Qiang also made a speech at the session, which is to
hammer out major tasks for the youth league in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Iran Not Hostile to American Nation: Khatami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami stated on Sunday that Iran has no hostility towards the
American nation, but is against U.S. domination.
</P>
<P>
"We have no hostility towards the American nation, what is
important is the philosophy and the outlook that the Iranian
nation will never surrender to domination," Khatami said in a
meeting with students in the Science and Technology University in
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iranian nation respects all nations in the
world and believes that relations must be based on mutual respect
and shattering of the wall of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that the claim on the existence of a wall of
mistrust between Iran and the U.S. was not a slogan - the Iranian
nation feels that the U.S. had dominated its fate from the 1953
coup to the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S.-led coup on August 19, 1953 which ousted
the government of former Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq was in
fact a prelude to the stabilization of the U.S. domination over
the fate of the Iranian people.
</P>
<P>
But the student movement launched on December 7, 1953 (against
the U.S. domination) opened a new chapter in the political history
of the Iranian people, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Isn't the Iranian nation right to blame all the damage and
humiliation it has been subject to throughout those years on the
incorrect U.S. policy?" argued the Iranian president.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the remark made by the U.S. President Bill
Clinton earlier this year that the U.S. might have mistreated
Iran and Muslims, Khatami said that Clinton's remark was an
important confession.
</P>
<P>
However, if it was a political game, it would solve no
problem, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, several senior U.S. officials made
overtures to Iran for "unconditional dialog" to improve relations
between the two countries which were severed in 1980.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian officials repeatedly claimed that the
U.S. must take positive steps to change its hostile policy towards
Iran, otherwise any talks on relations would be "meaningless."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has not shown a national will to improve relations
with Iran," Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said early
this month.
</P>
<P>
And the contradictory statements by U.S. officials indicated
differences inside the U.S. government towards Iran, he added.

<HEADLINE> Frolander Equals Record at European Short Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Lars Frolander of Sweden
equalled the European 50 meters butterfly record to take the
limelight of the European short-course swimming championships on
Sunday morning while tournament favorite Franziska van Almsick of
Germany made an early exit.
</P>
<P>
Frolander clocked 23.30 seconds to add the 50 meters butterfly
title to his collection which already contained the 100 meters
butterfly title from Friday. His time equalled the listing mark
set by Croatia's Milos Milosevic at the last championships in
Sheffield, England a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Van Almsick, competing only on the final day of the four-day
meeting, finished only, finishing fourth in her heat and 10th
overall in one minute 59.73 seconds in the women's 200 meter
freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Van Almsick, world standard-course champion in her prime at
just 16 in 1994, had pulled out of the 100 meters freestyle long
before the meeting to concentrate on her 200 freestyle speciality
and arrived in Lisbon when the championships were in full swing.
</P>
<P>
Frolander started off with the butterfly semifinals in the
afternoon and moved on to the 100 meters freestyle final as the
fastest qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Marcel Wouda of the Netherlands was the top qualifier for the
men's 200 meters individual medley final, aiming to go one better
than last year's silver in the absence of title-holder James
Hickman, who is not contesting that event here because he did not
swim the British trials for it. Hickman retained his 200 meters
butterfly crown on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Resumption of Syrian-Israeli Talks Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Foreign Minister
Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabir al-Thani has hailed the decision
to resume Israeli-Syrian peace talks in Washington as a positive
step toward activating the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The decision would press the process ahead for the sake of
achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region on basis of
relevant United Nations' resolutions and the land-for-peace
principle," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Kuwait News Agency on Sunday as praising the
role of the United States, which brokered the agreement to restart
talks on the Israeli-Syrian track which stumbled in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Syria and the U.S. announced on Wednesday, one day after
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad met visiting U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright in Damascus, that Syria and Israel will
resume negotiations in Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Barak also asserted Thursday that
"conditions have developed enough for a resumption of negotiations
with Syria," which he believed would also lead to a revival of
talks with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Israel and Syria broke off in February 1996
because of disputes over the return of Syria's strategic Golan
Heights occupied by Israel since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.

<P>
CAIRO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Friday praised Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak for his unswerving support for the peace
process, particularly on the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Arafat praised Mubarak's rejection to the Jewish settlement
expansions while stressing the important role Egypt played in the
peace drive.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister left here Sunday for Syria for
talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, his opposite number
Farouq al-Sharaa on the latest developments in the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will convey a message from Mubarak to Assad. Moussa's
visit followed on the heels of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's tour to the region, the acceptance by Syria to restart
peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Blue Nile basin states Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia have
completed a document on future cooperation to carry out projects
for boosting the water resources which used to be wasted through
evaporation.
</P>
<P>
The set strategy will be reviewed in a meeting in Cairo by the
three states in January.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Japanese officials will intensify their visits to Egypt in
the year 2000 to discuss joint construction projects currently
under way, and to exchange views with their Egyptian counterparts,
said Ambassador Mohamed el-Arab, who headed a delegation to the
Egyptian-Japanese conference that ended earlier this week in

<HEADLINE> Israel, Syria Said to Be Already Close to Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Syria have
already resolved most of the issues to be discussed in the
upcoming negotiations and a final peace agreement could be signed
in a matter of months, a local daily said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Major non-territorial issues such as security arrangement, the
nature of future bilateral ties, and a timetable for measures
taken by the two sides, have been mostly concluded in principle
through quiet diplomacy over the past few weeks, The Jerusalem
Post newspaper quoted a senior government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, as the two sides resume their negotiations in
Washington this week, the debate will mainly focus on the
territorial question, the future of the Golan Heights, a
strategic Syrian plateau seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East
war, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak is to leave for Washington Tuesday
for meetings with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa,
scheduled on Wednesday and Thursday, the first direct talks
between the two countries since their negotiations broke off in
early 1996.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to resume their talks from where they
left off nearly four years ago. There have been reports that many
of the issues had been thrashed out before the talks stalled.
</P>
<P>
The major remaining issue of contention is on to what extent
Israel should hand over the Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists that Israel withdraw from the whole Golan by
returning to the line of June 4, 1967, one day before the
war.
</P>
<P>
Repeating his pledge to make territorial concession in
exchange for peace with Israel's Arab neighbors, Barak is vague
on how much land he would give back to Damascus in a final peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The dispute has prevented the two sides from resuming their
talks on an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
Syria demanded that as a precondition for talks, Israel must
reaffirm what Damascus says was a promise made by late Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in previous talks to withdraw fully
from the Golan. Israel denied the existence of such a promise.
</P>
<P>
While announcing last Wednesday that the talks would be
restarted from where they left off in 1996, Washington has kept
ambiguity over what the point was when the talks broke off.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview with CBS news Saturday, U.S. President
Bill Clinton said that the Israeli-Syrian talks will be tough but
not as hard as other Middle East peace negotiations, referring to
the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks between Israel and the Palestinians,
which deal with the toughest issues including Jerusalem and
Jewish settlements, have made no big headway since they were
officially launched last month.
</P>
<P>
The talks even bogged down last week over the issue of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Also, an Israeli withdrawal from 5 percent of the West Bank,
which should have taken place one month ago under a September
interim agreement, was delayed over a dispute on which side had
the rights to decide which areas would be handed over.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Labor Campaigns for Referendum on Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Labor party has
launched its campaign Sunday morning for a "yes" vote in a
nationwide referendum on peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The referendum will be held after Israel signs its peace
treaty with Syria. Cabinet Justice Minister Yossi Beilin is
preparing a law on this referendum and the bill will be presented
to the Knesset (parliament) soon.
</P>
<P>
Since Sunday morning, young Laborites started their campaign
at the nation's highways and road junctions, offering stickers
and fliers and posting banners in favor of a peace deal with
Damascus. The initial slogan for the campaign is "Israel votes
yes for peace."
</P>
<P>
According a Labor party source, Labor party Secretary-General
Raanan Cohen will issue a tender for a public relations company to
head the publicity campaign, while former Labor Knesset member
Yona Yahav will be in charge of the build-up to any vote on a
peace package with Syria.
</P>
<P>
As announced by U.S. President Bill Clinton, Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Sharaa will meet
in Washington next Wednesday and Thursday to discuss the
resumption of their peace talks which stalled in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks will center on Israel's
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which it occupied in the 1967
Middle East War, water, security arrangement and bilateral
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government officials said that much of the future
peace talks has been mapped out and a final peace deal could be
signed in a matter of months.
</P>
<P>
Israel's withdrawal from the Golan has been a issue of
controversy, with a certain amount of Israel's Golan residents
oppose a total return of the highlands, while the opposition
parties accused Barak of selling the Golan out to the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
To back up Labor's campaign for a referendum, Barak is
re-forming the team that helped win him the premiership in the May
elections.
</P>
<P>
Barak's top advisors will reconvene to discuss strategies
ahead of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Barak would ask the cabinet to support the
peace deal with Syria and then bypass the Knesset on the way to a
national vote.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset's regular business has been put partly on hold, as
some of the week's agenda will be dedicated to the renewed peace
talks with Syrians.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Barak will, before flying to Washington, present a
statement to the house on the latest development, followed by a
reply from Likud leader Ariel Sharon.

<HEADLINE> Barak Asked to Keep Lower Public Profile for Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel's General Security
Service (GSS) has asked Prime Minister Ehud Barak to keep a lower
public profile and it is considering new measures to keep him safe
from possible assailants opposed to his peace policies.
</P>
<P>
According to the Shamgar Commission, which investigated the
GSS's practices for VIP protection after the assassination of
former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the GSS is not allowed to
discount any measures in the protection of Barak.
</P>
<P>
No additional GSS guards around Barak are expected to be
posted, but their deployment may change according to
circumstances, including alerts resulting from both intelligence
assessments and special threats, local daily Haaretz quoted
security sources as reporting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The protest movement against a Golan Heights's withdrawal is
still operating in a low-key manner at the moment, intelligence
estimates suggests that in the coming months, as the diplomatic
talks move forward, and it becomes clear that the Barak
government does intend to withdraw from the entire Golan,
opposition to withdrawal will escalate.
</P>
<P>
Barak will fly to Washington on Tuesday to hold meetings there
with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Sharra to discuss the
resumption of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks will focus on Israel's
withdrawal from the Golan, which it captured from Syria in 1967,
water, security arrangements and bilateral relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government officials said the two sides could reach a
final peace deal in a matter of months, as most of the deal has
been mapped out.
</P>
<P>
The GSS's concern is that right-wing extremists in Israel will
try to harm Barak or other senior government officials in an
effort to disrupt any withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the GSS experts also believe that the right-wing
extremists would also attack on Arabs if the negotiations on
either the Syrian or Palestinian track makes headway.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Welcomes Resumption of Syrian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has expressed welcome to
the planned resumption of the peace negotiations between Syria and
Israel, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa hailed the step as a "new driving force" on the Syrian
track, and expected it to breathe new life into the Mideast peace
process and improve the atmosphere in the region.
</P>
<P>
Syria's agreeing to resume talks indicated that the two parties
have made progress in advance toward Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights to the international borders of June 4, 1967, Moussa
said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced on Wednesday that Syria
and Israel have agreed to resume their peace talks in Washington
in the following week, probably on Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks came to a halt in early 1996 due to
disputes over the future of the Golan Heights that Israel captured
from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Moussa did not rule out the resumption of the multilateral
talks for regional cooperation following the recent progress,
saying it is "possible now to restart the multilateral
negotiations with the resumption of the Syrian-Israeli talks."
</P>
<P>
The multilateral talks, which cover issues including water,
disarmament, environment and Arab-Israeli economic cooperation,
began in 1992 but stalled since 1996 when hardline former Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took power.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has said the Arabs would not resume those talks with
Israel until the Jewish state restarts negotiations with Syria and
Lebanon. With the movement on the Syrian-Israeli track, Egypt has
apparently dropped its objection.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Extension of Oil Program Setback for U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has described the
six-month extension of the U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq as a
setback for the United States.
</P>
<P>
The most influential daily Babel, owned by President Saddam
Hussein's eldest son Udai, quoted Foreign Undersecretary Nazar
Hamdoun as saying "the U.S. administration was forced to accept
the six-month renewal of this program."
</P>
<P>
"Their aim in trying to renew (the oil-for-food program) for a
week or two at a time became clear to everyone. That's why they
were forced to renew for six months," said Hamdoun, a former
ambassador to the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Friday voted unanimously to
extend the oil-for-food program by 180 days, which allows Iraq to
export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars of oil to buy food, medicine and
other infrastructure-related materials for its people reeling
under nine-year-old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Iraq's oil officials told Xinhua that Iraqi
oil ministry has asked foreign companies specialized in oil
business to get ready to sign contracts for purchase of Iraqi
crude oil.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources who asked not to be identified, Iraqi
officials said Iraq will resume oil export "very soon."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has halted its oil export since November 22 in protest of
two shorter-than-usual extensions of the humanitarian program by
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The sixth phase of the program expired on November 20. Security
Council extended the program first for two weeks, then for only
one week. Iraq rejected these two short extensions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain had hoped to pressure other Security
Council members in those three weeks to adopt a British draft
resolution which calls for a resumption of arms inspections in
Iraq in exchange for moving toward a suspension of the sanctions
on Iraq.

<P>
CAIRO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa flew to Damascus Sunday morning for talks with Syrian
officials on the latest development of the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
During his day-long visit, Moussa will hold talks with his
Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Sharaa on the planned resumption of
the peace talks between Syria and Israel, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He is also to hand over a message to Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the news agency
said, without elaborating on the contents of the message.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic-language newspaper Al Akhbar said on Sunday that
Moussa's Syrian visit is aimed at coordinating stances of the two
countries on the whole Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel agreed on Wednesday to resume their peace
talks in Washington in the following week, after a hiatus of
nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
Their talks came to a halt in early 1996 because of disputes
over the Golan Heights Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Moussa on Saturday expressed welcome to the breakthrough
between Syria and Israel, hailing it as a "new driving force" for
the Syrian track and the Middle East peace process as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, plays an active role in mediating the Arab-Israeli talks
and coordinating the Arab stances on the peace process.

DAMASCUS -- Visiting Israeli Arab lawmaker Azmi Bishara said
here Saturday that Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights is
the precondition for normalization of relations between Israel and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Bishara, the Balad leader, made the remark in his second
meeting in two days with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa.
Bishara stressed that "only after the last Israeli soldier leaves
the Golan Heights," can the two countries exchange diplomatic
missions and open embassy in each other's capital. Israel seized
the strategic plateau of Golan from Syrian in the 1967 Middle East
war and annexed it in 1981. (Syria-Israel-Arab Lawmaker)

<HEADLINE> Over 3,000 Cultural Relics Saved from Smelters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese man has saved more
than 3,000 bronze cultural relics from a fate of being smelted
together with scrap copper items.
</P>
<P>
Part of the priceless relics dating back to the Shang Dynasty (
16th-11th century B.C.), include cooking, wine drinking and
measuring articles under top state protection.
</P>
<P>
Lei Yuqi started the relics-rescue project in 1964, after
reading a report in the Shanghai-based Xinmin Evening News which
said that people in that city were saving relics from scrap copper
which was to be smelted.
</P>
<P>
For the past 35 years, a team led by Lei at the Taiyuan Copper
Industry Company has sifted out relics from the tons of copper
articles at the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
From then on, he was on the lookout for used copper pieces in
pawn shops. To learn as much as he could about the subject, Lei
subscribed to several magazines on archaeology and cultural relics,
and questioned experts.
</P>
<P>
Lei and his team salvaged from pawn shops relics ranging from
bronze statues some two meters high to coins. Their efforts
continued through the "Cultural Revolution" (1966 to 1976).
</P>
<P>
In 1972, Lei gave 500 of his pieces to cultural relics
administration departments and donated all of the reward money
given by the government to a kindergarten at his company.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,300 of the pieces were recently put on display at
the Shanxi Provincial Museum in north China, attracting a number
of visitors.

<P>
TEHRAN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian Foreign Ministry
official has denied allegations carried in a U.S. press report on
Iran's industrial espionage, local daily Tehran Times reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the daily, the unnamed official called the
U.S. charges "sheer lie" and "parts of the U.S. intimidation
aiming to tarnish the image of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the
world."
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times newspaper reported on Saturday that
U.S. federal investigators have uncovered an illegal trade network
which has been selling organizational secrets of a company
producing industrial turbine motors to countries including Iran.
</P>
<P>
It said that the three men involved, two from Texas and another
from Lusianne, have confessed to their crime and have promised to
help the government to investigate the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian official said that Iran has never
purchased any of such equipment as alleged by the Washington
Times.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has always made such unfounded accusations against
Iran in order to isolate the country, he said, however, the
U.S. policies against Iran are doomed to fail.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Keep Cultural Diversity After Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Macao will continue to have a
cultural diversity after it returns to China on Dec. 20, a
Portuguese Macao official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zengyang, president of the Cultural Institute of Macao,
said that while the mainstream Chinese culture here will develop
further in the future, heritages of other cultures will receive
active protection from the MSAR government. "As an early outpost
for western seafarers, Macao has had a very unique cultural
pattern that has resulted from the blending of western and eastern
cultures for more than 400 years and should be protected as
valuable treasures of Macao," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang is expected to hold a position in the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR) in charge of cultural affairs.
</P>
<P>
Macao's cultural diversity is sourced mainly in five cultures,
Wang explained. Foremost is its religious culture. Macao used to
be an important religious center for the spreading of Christianity
in Asia and a place from which western technologies were
introduced into the Chinese mainland. Christianity will continue
to coexist with Buddhism and Taoism in post-return Macao, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
Architecture constitutes another important part of the culture
in Macao. The outlook of Macao is different from that of any other
Chinese city in that buildings both of western style and southern
Chinese style can be found here. European-style emplacements,
churches and residences can be seen everywhere in Macao and they
will be protected in the future, the Portuguese Macao official
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The uniqueness of Macao's culture is also reflected in its
diversity of cooking styles, its fairly big population of Macao-
born Portuguese, and its diversity of languages spoken. "These
should all be duly preserved," Wang Zengyang said.
</P>
<P>
The MSAR government is taking active measures to renovate
churches, preserve ancient relics, fund scholars to do research,
publish books on Macao's history and culture, and increase
cultural exchanges to preserve and develop Macao's culture,
according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the great importance Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief
executive designate of the future MSAR, has attached to cultural
development in Macao in his blueprint for the SAR's future, Wang
said Macao will have a glorious future in cultural development
with full support from the MSAR government.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Labor Campaigns for Referendum on Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Labor party has
launched its campaign Sunday morning for a "yes" vote in a
nationwide referendum on peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The referendum will be held after Israel signs its peace
treaty with Syria. Cabinet Justice Minister Yossi Beilin is
preparing a law on this referendum and the bill will be presented
to the Knesset (parliament) soon.
</P>
<P>
Since Sunday morning, young Laborites started their campaign
at the nation's highways and road junctions, offering stickers
and fliers and posting banners in favor of a peace deal with
Damascus. The initial slogan for the campaign is "Israel votes
yes for peace."
</P>
<P>
According a Labor party source, Labor party Secretary-General
Raanan Cohen will issue a tender for a public relations company to
head the publicity campaign, while former Labor Knesset member
Yona Yahav will be in charge of the build-up to any vote on a
peace package with Syria.
</P>
<P>
As announced by U.S. President Bill Clinton, Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Sharaa will meet
in Washington next Wednesday and Thursday to discuss the
resumption of their peace talks which stalled in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks will center on Israel's
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which it occupied in the 1867
Middle East War, water, security arrangement and bilateral
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government officials said that much of the future
peace talks has been mapped out and a final peace deal could be
signed in a matter of months.
</P>
<P>
Israel's withdrawal from the Golan has been a issue of
controversy, with a certain amount of Israel's Golan residents
oppose a total return of the highlands, while the opposition
parties accused Barak of selling the Golan out to the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
To back up Labor's campaign for a referendum, Barak is
re-forming the team that helped win him the premiership in the May
elections.
</P>
<P>
Barak's top advisors will reconvene to discuss strategies
ahead of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Barak would ask the cabinet to support the
peace deal with Syria and then bypass the Knesset on the way to a
national vote.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset's regular business has been put partly on hold, as
some of the week's agenda will be dedicated to the renewed peace
talks with Syrians.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Barak will, before flying to Washington, present a
statement to the house on the latest development, followed by a
reply from Likud leader Ariel Sharon.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Workers are giving finishing
touches to the Macao Forum, venue for the ceremony marking the
establishment of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) and
the swearing-in of the first SAR government on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Remodeling and decorating at the forum started in April, and
the entire project cost more than 30 million Renminbi yuan, which
was covered by the central government of China.
</P>
<P>
Two large screen walls formed by 25 large-screen TV sets each

swearing-in of the SAR government, and the installation of all the
related facilities has been completed, according to Lin Kunli of
the Shenzhen-based Konca Group, one of China's major household
electric appliances producers.
</P>
<P>
The forum was designed by a Portuguese architect and built in
the 1980s. The main hall has an area of more than 6,000 square
meters with a seating capacity of more than 3,600 people. And on
the main platform for the ceremony are three rows of silver color
chairs and the front row has nine big red chairs. On the white
backdrop is "Ceremony for the Establishment of the Macao Special

leaders of the SAR governemnt.
</P>
<P>
Girls are now conducting rehearsals for the ceremony. "I'm very
lucky to see with own eyes the SAR officials swearing-in here, and
hope I won't be too nervous when the ceremony takes place," one
girl, Hong Pingli, said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Much of the future peace agreement with Syria has already
been mapped out, and a final deal could be signed in a matter of
months, a senior government official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The official said that questions of security, the timetable,
and the nature of the peace agreement have been mostly concluded
in principle over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The General Security Service, or Shin Bet, has asked Prime
Minister Ehud Barak to keep a lower public profile and is
considering new measures to keep him safe from possible
assailants opposed to his peace policies.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence estimates suggest that as the Israeli-Syrian talks
move forward in the coming months, domestic opposition to Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights will escalate.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The protest movement launched Saturday by activists
opposing an Israeli withdrawal from Golan showed that Barak will
have to face the domestic front and the Syrian front
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The activists said their first major protest would be a
demonstration opposite the Knesset (Parliament) Monday to coincide
with Barak's leaving for Washington and the resumption of peace
talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The forces opposing an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights have a narrow majority in the 120-member Knesset. A poll
showed that 54 Knesset members are against a future withdrawal, 53
are for it, and the rest have not decided yet.
</P>
<P>
Barak, however, is confident that his accord will get the
support of the cabinet, the Knesset, and finally, the
public.

<HEADLINE> 12 Aftershocks Reported in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said Sunday that it
monitored 12 aftershocks, including a strong one, by the noon time
after a powerful quake hit the Northern Philippines earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
Raymundo Punongbayan, director of Phivolcs, said in a statement
that as of 12:00 (04:00 GMT), Phivolcs monitored 12 aftershocks,
but 11 of these registered have no recorded magnitude because they
were too weak.
</P>
<P>
But he said that one of the aftershocks, which occurred at 09:
11(01:11 GMT), measured 5.5 on the open-ended Richter Scale with
its epicenter in a location 87 kilometers northwest of Lingayen,
Pangasinan.
</P>
<P>
A powerful earthquake rocked the Northern Philippines,
including the capital city of Manila, early Sunday, causing
collapse of several buildings and minor injuries, official reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The Phivolcs said earlier that the strong earthquake, which
occurred at 02:03 (18:03 GMT), was registered at 6.8 on the
Richter Scale.
</P>
<P>
The institute said that the epicenter of the quake was 61
kilometers west of Lingayen, Pangasinan Province. It put the
intensity at VI in Manila.
</P>
<P>
It said that The quake was caused by a movement of the Manila
trench, which runs along the western side of the Philippine
archipelago, adding that damages and more aftershocks are expected.
</P>
<P>
In a report issued here Sunday afternoon, the National Disaster
Coordinating council (NDCC) said: "Reports gathered as of 11:00(03:
00 GMT) indicated that the earthquake, in general, caused minor
damages on public and private structures."
</P>
<P>
The NDCC, headed by Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado,said that
during the earthquake, a 12 year-old boy was injured in Iba,
Zembales Public Market, and a construction worker was also injured
in Magic Mall in Pangasinan Province.
</P>
<P>
Public structures which have sustained minor damages include
the central block building of the Philippine General Hospital in
Manila,the municipal halls of Sta Cruz and Masinloc towns in
Zambales,Balubanon Bridge in Zambales, the NDCC said.
</P>
<P>
"Lifelines were reported to have been restored to normalcy.
These include power sources that tripped during the earthquake,
communication systems, and water sources in Luzon," it said.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC report, which was signed by Secretary Mercado and
submitted to President Joseph Estrada, said that it has dispatched
a team of structural engineers to inspect and assess the damages
on major public infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
As the epicenter was only over 150 kilometers north of Manila,
the earthquake was strongly felt in the capital city. Panic
residents rushed out into the streets. Power supply was
temporarily suspended for about one hour.
</P>
<P>
In Manila, the quake shook trees, rocked buildings and toppled
some electric posts. Many buildings sustained cracks. Patients
were evacuated from at least one hospital.
</P>
<P>
Some customers were reportedly slightly hurt as they fled from
a restaurant in the city, and some were hurt while rushing down
the stairs.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is in the Pacific "Ring of Fire" where
earthquakes frequently occur. About 2000 people were killed when a
strong quake with a magnitude of 7.7 rocked the Northern
Philippines on July 16, 1990.

<HEADLINE> Iran Buys Sniffer Dogs to Fight Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran has bought eight sniffer
dogs from France worth 400,000 U.S. dollars to boost its desperate
combat against drug trafficking, local daily Tehran Times reported
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told the daily that 20 Iranian anti-drug
officials have been sent to France for training in the concerned
field. France has also sent a special trainer to provide a
four-month training for the police, familiarizing them with the
animals' working procedures.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Yahya Azimi, an official from Iran's Anti-Drug
headquarters, said that France has provided Iranian security
forces with five German Shepherd sniffer dogs and would provide
another five in the future.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities had previously been unwilling to use dogs
because Islamic religious traditions consider all breeds of the
animal to be unclean.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a main transit route for drugs smuggled from
Afghanistan, the world's largest opium producer, and neighboring
Pakistan to Europe and oil-rich Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Deputy commander of the security forces Brigadier General
Mohsen Ansari said last month that the country has spent 1 billion
U.S. dollars on combating drug trafficking since the Islamic
revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The security forces have been on the forefront of the combat
with over 2,700 personnel killed in the process, he said. The
forces seized over 137 tons of various narcotics last Iranian
calendar year (ended March 20) and 167 tons in the first eight
months of this Iranian year.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Currency Deposits Grow in Jiangsu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign currency bank deposits
have increased to three billion US dollars in Jiangsu Province, an
economic powerhouse in east China.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangsu Branch of the Bank of China alone had 1.78 billion
US dollars in foreign exchange deposits by the end of November,
430 million US dollars more than early this year, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing, the provincial capital, reports 530 million US dollars
in foreign currency deposits.
</P>
<P>
Authorities attribute the increase in foreign currency to the
development of overseas economic exchange, expanded labor service
overseas, the lessening of the limits that individuals can retain
in foreign currency, and the higher interest rates for foreign
currency compared with the yuan.
</P>
<P>
This has invigorated the foreign currency transaction market,
and statistics show that the foreign exchange transaction volume
has reached 700 million US dollars in the province so far this
year.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Basic Law of Macao SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The most important task facing
China after the signing of the Joint Declaration by Chinese and
Portuguese governments on April 13, 1987, is to draft the Basic
Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
In September 1988, a 48-member committee for drafting the Basic
Law of Macao SAR was set up. The Drafting Committee had five
groups, responsible respectively for drafting the law on the
following topics: relationship between the central government and
the Macao SAR, the basic rights and obligations of inhabitants in
Macao, the political structure, economy, and cultural and social
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by the Drafting Committee, a 90-member basic law
advisory committee consisting of representatives from Macao's
various circles was set up in May of 1989, which held 168 advisory
meetings and 192 plenary sessions in the four years of its work.
</P>
<P>
Drafting the Basic Law of Macao SAR took a total of four years
and five months, which could be divided into six stages for
drafting the structure of the Basic Law, investigation and study,
drafting the articles of the law, consulting and soliciting views
on drafting the law, discussion and revision, deliberation and
adoption by the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The drafting committee called nine plenary sessions, 16
chairmen meetings, two enlarged chairmen meetings, and 60 special
group meetings.
</P>
<P>
On March 31, 1993, the Basic Law of Macao SAR and its relevant
decisions were adopted at the First Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress. On the same day, Chinese President Jiang Zemin
signed a presidential decree ordering the Basic Law of Macao SAR
be implemented as of December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of Macao SAR includes the text of the Basic Law
of the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's
Republic of China, and three annexes which are the Method for the
Selection of the Chief Executive of the Macao SAR, the Method for
the Formation of the Legislative Council of the Macao SAR, and
National Laws to Be Applied in the Macao SAR, and designs of the
regional flag and the regional emblem.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of Macao SAR has nine chapters in 145 articles,
which includes the Preamble and eights other chapters devoted to
relationship between the central and the Macao SAR, basic rights
and obligations of Macao inhabitants, political structure, economy,
cultural and social affairs, external affairs, interpretation and
revision of the Basic Law, and appendices.
</P>
<P>
Drafted in line with the guidelines of the Sino-Portuguese
Joint Declaration, the Basic Law of Macao SAR embodies the
principle of "one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress Standing Committee is entitled
to interpret the law and the National People's Congress is
entitled to revise and interpret the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The promulgation of the Basic Law of Macao SAR provided the
most fundamental and reliable guarantee for the establishment of
the Macao SAR and the implementation of the principle of "one
country, two systems" in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Activities of various forms have since been held in Macao and
many inland cities of China to promote and publicize the Basic Law
of Macao SAR.

<HEADLINE> Zambians Urged to Care for Aged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Population
Fund (UNFPA) urged the Zambians to care for the aged population,
Zambian Sunday Mail newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA resident representative Margaret O'Callaghan made the
call in Lusaka Saturday when addressing the Medical Women
Association of Zambia annual general meeting under the theme "life
after 55 years, what next?".
</P>
<P>
It is sad that only three percent of the Zambian population are
above the age of 60, O'Callaghan said.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia the old are being viewed as a burden and are not
accorded good health service, adequate food and are looked at as
second-class citizens, the UNFPA official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, Director of the Zambian Central Board of
Health Gavin Silvamba said that the Zambians have a role of taking
care of the old.
</P>
<P>
"There is no mechanism of looking after the old once they are
retired," he said.
</P>
<P>
O'Callaghan further called for planning for the aged in
developing countries as developed countries are carrying out a lot
of research on the needs of the old to make their lives more
comfortable.

<HEADLINE> Minor Damages Reported in Philippine Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A powerful earthquake rocked
the Northern Philippines, including the capital city of Manila,
early Sunday,causing collapse of several buildings and minor
injuries, official reports said.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report issued here Sunday morning, the Philippine
Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the strong earthquake,
which occurred at 02:03 (18:03 GMT), was registered at 6.8 on the
Richter Scale.
</P>
<P>
The institute said that the epicenter of the quake was 61
kilometers west of Lingayen, Pangasinan Province, and the
intensity measured VI in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Over 10 aftershocks were recorded so far, but they were not
strong enough to be felt in the Manila area, it said.
</P>
<P>
The institute said that the quake was caused by a movement of
the Manila trench, which runs along the western side of the
Philippine archipelago, adding that more aftershocks are expected.
</P>
<P>
In a report issued here Sunday afternoon, the National Disaster
Coordinating council (NDCC) said: "Reports gathered as of 11:00(03:
00 GMT) indicated that the earthquake, in general, caused minor
damages on public and private structures."
</P>
<P>
The NDCC, headed by Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado,said that
during the earthquake, a 12 year-old boy was injured in Iba,
Zembales Public Market, and a construction worker was also injured
in Magic Mall in Pangasinan Province.
</P>
<P>
Public structures which have sustained minor damages include
the central block building of the Philippine General Hospital in
Manila,the municipal halls of Sta Cruz and Masinloc towns in

</P>
<P>
"Lifelines were reported to have been restored to normalcy.

<P>
The NDCC report, which was signed by Secretary Mercado and
submitted to President Joseph Estrada, also said that it has
dispatched a team of structural engineers to inspect and assess
the damages on major public infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
As the epicenter was only over 150 kilometers north of Manila,
the earthquake was strongly felt in the capital city. Panic
residents rushed out into the streets. Power supply was
temporarily suspended for about one hour.
</P>
<P>
In Manila, the quake shook trees, rocked buildings and toppled
some electric posts. Many buildings sustained cracks. Patients
were evacuated from at least one hospital.
</P>
<P>
Some customers were reportedly slightly hurt as they fled from
a restaurant in the city, and some were hurt while rushing down
the stairs.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is in the Pacific "Ring of Fire" where
earthquakes frequently occur. About 2,000 people were killed when
a strong quake with a magnitude of 7.7 rocked the Northern
Philippines on July 16, 1990.

<HEADLINE> China Applies to Add Ancient Imperial Tombs to World Heritage List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- China has applied to have its
imperial tombs dating back to the dynasties of Ming (1368-1644)
and Qing (1644-1911) included on UNESCO's World Heritage List.
</P>
<P>
The application has been approved by the State Administration
of Cultural Heritage and China's National Commission for UNESCO (
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization).
</P>
<P>
There are many imperial tombs of the last two dynasties of
China's feudal society scattered throughout Beijing and provinces
of Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Liaoning and Hubei. A dozen of them are
famous tourist sites under state protection.
</P>
<P>
The first group named in the application includes Ming tombs in
central China's Hubei and two tomb groups in Hebei in the north.
</P>
<P>
Most of the tombs are well preserved and feature typical
ancient Chinese tomb architecture with majestic structure and
delicate design, according to cultural experts.
</P>
<P>
Since China joined UNESCO in protecting world culture and
natural heritage 14 years ago, some 23 cultural and natural sites
have been included on the World Heritage List. They include the
Great Wall, the Palace Museum, the terra cotta warriors of the
First Emperor of the Qin Dynasty, and Huangshan Mountain.

<HEADLINE> Indo-U.S. Astronomers Claim to Find "Superdisks" in Sky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Astronomers from India and
the United States have, for the first time in the world,
reportedly found evidence of some strange pancake-shaped celestial
objects, called"superdisks", which surround some of the very
distant galaxies.
</P>
<P>
These gigantic "superdisks" represent a completely new and
striking feature of far-away galaxies and may help understand,
among other things, how galaxies came into being billions of years
ago, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The disks have a typical diameter of about 240 light years and
a width of about 80 light years, said Gopal Krishna, one of the
discoverers working at the National Center for Radio Astrophysics(
NCRA) based in Pune, 1400 kilometers south of New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
These massive superdisks, 10 to 100 billion times more massive
than the sun, are oriented around elliptical galaxies, one of the
two commonest types of galaxies seen in the universe, Krishna told
PTI in Pune.
</P>
<P>
"We have found these objects in a dozen elliptical galaxies and
concluded that it is a general phenomenon of radio galaxies," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Krishna and his collaborator, Paul J Witta of Georgia State
University, examined radio images of a number of distant galaxies
collected by several radio telescopes across the globe for about
two years to arrive at the conclusion.
</P>
<P>
"It is very surprising why other astronomers have missed these
giant objects so far," Krishna said.

<HEADLINE> "Sight First" Benefits Over 800 Cataract Sufferers in Qinghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The medical aid program Sight
First China Action has helped restore sight to over 800 cataract
sufferers this year in northwest China's Qinghai province.
</P>
<P>
The program was jointly sponsored by China's Ministry of Health,
the China Disabled Persons' Federation and Lions Clubs
International.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, several national and provincial medical
teams have gone to the province's rural areas to operate on
hundreds of cataract patients, 90 percent of them ethnic Tibetans
or Mongolians.
</P>
<P>
According to officials with the Qinghai Disabled Persons'
Federation, the medical teams have performed 2,500 cataract
operations since 1998, with a 100 percent success rate.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai has one of China's highest cataract rates, together
with Yunnan, Xinjiang and Tibet, because people in those high-
altitude regions are exposed to excessive ultraviolet radiation.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai expects the program to help 8,400 of its cataract
patients regain sight by 2001, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Cataract-related blindness has afflicted some four million
Chinese, with 400,000 people developing the condition every year.
</P>
<P>
Sight First China Action's goal is to help restore sight to 4.
25 million cataract sufferers in China by 2006 and work with 90
percent of the county-level hospitals in the country to set up
ophthalmology departments.

<HEADLINE> 511-Year Temple in Macao Remains Attractive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- When Portuguese first arrived in
the then Haojing, now Macao, in 1553, they asked local Chinese
about the name of the place.
</P>
<P>
Not understanding what the foreigners were asking about, the
natives pointed to a temple, murmuring, "Macao."
</P>
<P>
Macao is the dialectal pronunciation by local Chinese for "Mage
", the Temple of Goddess. For centuries, fishermen in southeast
China's coastal areas had built the kind of temple, hoping that
the Goddess would bless them.
</P>
<P>
The one that stands at the southern end of Macao is known as "A-
Ma Temple" and was built 511 years ago. The temple not only is
where the territory got its present name but also the most
attractive site for pilgrims and tourists from across the world.
</P>
<P>
A tourist from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province in
southwest China, who only gave her surname as Lin, said: "A-Ma
Temple gives me a sense of history and is the symbol of Macao. So
I must visit it."
</P>
<P>
Sources here say that the A-Ama Temple will continue to be a
major tourist attraction in Macao after the Chinese government
resumes the exercise of sovereignty over the region on December 20.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Rate Down to 2.46 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate
continued to decline and dropped to 2.46 percent for the week
ended on November 27 due to drop in prices of vegetables and
fruits.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve bank of India, prices of food articles
recorded a sharp decline resulting in a 0.4 percent fall in the
Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for all commodities for the week.
</P>
<P>
The fall in vegetable and fruit prices of seven and six percent,
respectively, resulted in 0.39 percentage point drop in the annual
rate of inflation to 2.46 percent as against 2.85 percent in the
previous week and 7.73 percent during the corresponding week of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The lower rate of inflation during the most part of the current
year is mainly on account of a comparison with a higher base last
year when overall prices were up following an abnormal increases
in vegetable prices.

<HEADLINE> China Renovates Railway with German Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- China has launched a 15
billion yuan (about 1.8 billion U.S. dollars) project to upgrade a
945-kilometer-long stretch of electric railway line with the use
of German loans.
</P>
<P>
The project, to be completed in 2001, will enable trains on the
line between the cities of Harbin and Dalian in northeast China's
Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces to travel at speeds up to 200
kilometers per hour, thus easing traffic in the region and
promoting Sino-Russian border trade.
</P>
<P>
Renovation of the line, which was built a century ago, involves
360 million German marks (about 188 million U.S. dollars) in loans
from the German government and banks, as well as German equipment
and technology.
</P>
<P>
While launching the project on Thursday, railway officials said
the new line will also enhance northeast China's links to other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, this electric railway line will be the railway
with the highest technology and largest investment in China.

<HEADLINE> 50,000 Autorickshaws Causes Pollution in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- 50,000 autorickshaws (tri-wheel
baby-taxis) are plying in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh,
causing unbearable air and noise pollution in the city.
</P>
<P>
These autorickshaws, mostly having outdated engines, are plying
with the tacit approval of the relevant authorities, newspapers
here disclosed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
About 16,000 autorickshaws running on the city streets have no
route permit and the engine-life of another 5000 autorickshaws
expired at least eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
The government has planned to phase out autorickshaws from
cities in the country. but so far it has not taken any step in
that direction.
</P>
<P>
Every day more tri-wheelers are coming on the streets.
Bangladesh Road Transport Authority has not stopped issuing
registration certificates to new autorickshaws.
</P>
<P>
The autorickshaw market in Bangladesh reportedly has been
monopolized by "Bajaj" automobiles of India. Several cites in
India have already banned the tri-wheel baby-taxis in their areas
to contain air and noise pollution. But Bangladesh has not yet
been able to impose ban on these engines which have already been
identified as a major cause for pollution in the cities.

MACAO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The catering sector is making
the most of Macao, known as "showcase of gourmet paradise", to add
to the jubilant atmosphere for Macao's return to China on December
20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Return and Millennium Banquet" is among the most favorite. The
12-dish banquet, available at Nam Yue Hotel at 1,999 Macao patacas,
for example, is a good collection of Chinese cuisine, and reads
as "warmly welcome Macao's return to the motherland" when the
first Chinese square character for each dish is put together.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese-style cuisine is also joining in the fashion.
The Pinocchio's Restaurant serves courses relating to "farewell",
such as boiled bacalhau (Norwegian cod salted in Portugal).
</P>
<P>
And the Great Fortune B.B.Q. Portuguese Restaurant will offer a
buffet dinner on the eve of Macao's return to China, as well as
souvenirs for each dinner.
</P>
<P>
Macao, a pocket area of only 23.5 square kilometers, is home to
some 1,000 restaurants and teahouses, a mixture of East-West
cultures.

<HEADLINE> Minor Injuries, Damages Reported in Philippine Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A powerful earthquake rocked
the Northern Philippines, including the capital city of Manila,
early Sunday,causing collapse of several buildings and minor
injuries, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology
said.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report issued here Sunday morning, the institute
said the strong earthquake, which occurred at 02:03 (18:03 GMT),
was registered at 6.8 on the Richter Scale.
</P>
<P>
The institute said that the epicenter of the quake was 61
kilometers southwest of Lingayen, Pangasinan Province. It put the
intensity at VI in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Over 10 aftershocks were recorded so far, but they were not
strong enough to be felt in the Manila area, it said.
</P>
<P>
The institute said the quake was caused by a movement of the
Manila trench, which runs along the western side of the Philippine
archipelago, adding that damages and more aftershocks are expected.
</P>
<P>
In Sta Cruz, a church was damaged and at least four people were
injured, said an official of the institute.
</P>
<P>
As the epicenter was only over 150 kilometers north of Manila,
the earthquake was strongly felt in the capital city. Panic
residents rushed out into the streets. Power supply was
temporarily suspended for about one hour.
</P>
<P>
In Manila, the quake shook trees, rocked buildings and toppled
some electricity poles. Many buildings sustained cracks. Patients
were evacuated from at least one hospital.
</P>
<P>
Some customers were reportedly slightly hurt as they fled from
a restaurant in the city, and some were hurt while rushing down
the stairs.
</P>
<P>
Outside Manila, some buildings also sustained cracks, and a
bridge was damaged, according to a local radio report.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Office of the Civilian Defense told Xinhua
that one child was hurt by a falling post near a building, but
damages were minor.
</P>
<P>
He said that his office will issue an official report on
damages and casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is in the Pacific "Ring of Fire" where
earthquakes frequently occur. About 2,000 people were killed when
a strong quake with a magnitude of 7.7 rocked the Northern
Philippines on July 16, 1990.

<HEADLINE> More Use of Natural Gas in China to Help Air Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to speed up
the use of natural gas in the coming years, according to today's
Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
It cited a governmental official as saying that the proportion
of natural gas in the energy consumption is expected to increase
to about 4 percent in 2005 from 2 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to help improve the environment and
enhance sustainable development in China, said Chen Yongwu, deputy
director of the Development and Planning Department of the State
Petrochemical Industry.
</P>
<P>
"In the short run, increasing the use of the natural gas will
be conducive to alleviating pollution triggered by coal burning in
the country's big cities, especially in Beijing, Shenyang, Lanzhou,
Guangzhou and Shanghai," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen told the newspaper that the move can also significantly
reduce China's heavy reliance on oil products in its energy
consumption.
</P>
<P>
To fuel its rapid economic growth, the country's demand for oil
has increased markedly in recent years, making the country a net
oil importer.
</P>
<P>
"Pressure is building on China's energy supply," he said. "
Using more natural gas is a must to minimize the pressure."
</P>
<P>
The use of natural gas has replaced 20-30 million tons of oil
consumption annually in recent years. Gas consumption was 20.5
billion cubic meters last year, most of which was used in
fertilizer production, he said. It will be expanded to a wide
range of industrial sectors and households.
</P>
<P>
China plans to use natural gas from abroad. The project, such
as importing Russian gas into north China and Shanghai and
liquefied natural gas from the Middle East to Guangdong, are under
feasibility study, said Chen.

<HEADLINE> RPT: Macao's Return: Important Step for Reunifying China (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is public knowledge that the Taiwan question falls into the
category of internal affairs of China and has nothing to do with
any foreign government as Hong Kong and Macao issues did. On the
Taiwan question, Chinese leaders have stated that everything could
be put forward onto the negotiation table under the principle of "
One China."
</P>
<P>
Lee Tenghui's characterization of relations across the Taiwan
Straits as being of a "special state-to-state" type has met with
unanimous opposition from all Chinese people including Taiwan
compatriots. It is "a traitor's theory,"people say.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the political disagreement across the Taiwan
Straits is not an argument over social systems. Rather, it is a
struggle over whether or not China is to be splitted up and
whether or not China's national interests should be safeguarded.
History has provided ample evidence that any person who should
challenge national unity and go against the "one China" principle
will meet with an ignominious end.
</P>
<P>
To end the history of Taiwan being separated from the mainland,
numerous civil groups and organizations devoted to China's
reunification have emerged on both sides of the Straits.
</P>
<P>
A complete reunification will instill new life into the Taiwan
economy and allow the Taiwan people to enjoy honor and pride from
being part of a great nation.
</P>
<P>
National unity has always remained an unchanging mainstream in
Chinese history. As China's president Jiang Zemin stressed at a
rally celebrating the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of
China on October 1, China will achieve a complete reunification by
adhering to the principle of "peaceful reunification, one country
and two systems".
</P>
<P>
A complete reunification of China and maintenance of national
security is a fundamental basis for rejuvenating the Chinese
nation and a firm wish of the entire Chinese people, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the return of Hong Kong and Macao to China, the Chinese
people now place high hopes on resolving the Taiwan question and
realizing a complete reunification of their country.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Give Line-Street Welcome to PLA Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 20,000 Macao residents will
turn out to welcome Chinese garrison troops to enter and station
in the region after Macao's handover on December 20.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Committee for Celebration Activities from
All Sectors of Macao told Xinhua today that local residents are
enthusiastic to participate in the welcome activities for the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) garrison troops.
</P>
<P>
They will give a warm line-street welcome to the troops as they
come in, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The General Union of Associations of Macao Residents (GUAMR),
one of the most influential social groups in the region, has
received applications from 3,500 local residents for joining the
welcoming crowd, far exceeding the expected number of 3,000.
</P>
<P>
The applicants include a 93-year-old woman, 1,000-plus students
and Macao-born Portuguese. Some elder residents, who assisted the
PLA troops in Guangdong Province during China's Civil War in late
1940s, said they feel extremely happy and proud to welcome the
troops to Macao.
</P>
<P>
The GUAMR has prepared 79 banners bearing such slogans as "
Warmly welcome the people's army to Macao" and "Heroic army of the
motherland never fails its commission." It has also prepared lots
of slogans and flower balls, as well as props for dragon dance and
lion dance for the historic moment.

<HEADLINE> East Timor's Governing Council Meets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- East Timor's Consultative
Council, the embryo of East Timor's parliament, convened for its
first session in Dili, capital of the territory, on Saturday,
according to the Antara News Agency Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The session was presided over by Sergio Viera de Melo, head of
the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (
UNTAET).
</P>
<P>
The council's members, representing a cross section of East
Timor's society, had been sworn in earlier in the day at a
ceremony at the UNTAET headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Among the various community groups represented in the council
were the East Timor National Resistance Council (CNRT), the
Falintil, the Timor Socialist Party, the pro-autonomy group UDT,
the Catholic church, the Moslem group and UNTAET.
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the council were some of East Timor's well-known
figures such as CNRT leader Xanana Gusmao and pro-integrationist
Salvador Soares.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the session's opening, de Melo said the
council would be the highest political assembly for East Timorese
in preparing their future as an independent state.
</P>
<P>
He urged East Timorese to put aside their political aspirations
and put all their resources into forging a partnership for the
future.
</P>
<P>
The council will be an important step in the process of
reconciliation among East Timorese, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Xanana said he would continue to pursue a policy of
cooperation with the UNTAET and other concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
He would also step up efforts to bring about reconciliation
among various parties in East Timor, particularly between the pro-
independence and pro-integration groups.
</P>
<P>
The UNTAET was set up by the U.N. Security Council in late
October to take charge of overall affairs for the territory in a
period of two to three years before its full independence.

<HEADLINE> Baiyangdian Lake in N. China May Dry up Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- One of China's largest
freshwater lakes, Baiyangdian, faces the risk of running dry again
due to little precipitation and blocking of water by the reservoir
at its upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
In former days the lake had an expanse of water, but now
vessels are seen sailing in the slurry with great difficulty.
</P>
<P>
Covering a space of 300 square kilometers, Baiyangdian, known
as "the bright pearl in north China," provides water to hundreds
of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
Li Yuan, a leader of lakeside Anxin County, Hebei Province,
said that if the lake runs dry, the lifeline of those people would
be threatened. Industrial production, ecology and tourism would
also be affected.
</P>
<P>
An environment official, Zhao Jinmin, said that the warning
level of the lake is 8.4 meters, but by the end of November it had
fallen below 6.8 meters.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that because of drought, water in the lake became
exhausted every three to five years during the 1960s and 1980s. It
dried up during the 1995-1998 period.
</P>
<P>
This year, the upper reaches of the lake had little rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Local officials have appealed to the central government to find
a long-term solution to supplying water to Baiyangdian to prevent
it from drying up time and again.

<HEADLINE> Unicom's CDMA Service to Provide Alternative to GSM in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- China's Unicom is expected to
provide nationwide mobile communications services via a CDMA
cellular network by next summer to give China's mobile phone
customers an alternative to the GSM system, today's Business
Weekly of China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted company officials as saying that the
installation of the CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) network
will begin early next year.
</P>
<P>
Tan Xinghui, general manager of China Unicom's planning and
marketing department, said that the company is evaluating bids
made on projects by 12 domestic and foreign telecom companies
which could produce equipment based on the CDMA mobile system.
</P>
<P>
"Bid winners will be announced in January next year and the
first phase construction will be completed the following summer,"
said Tan.
</P>
<P>
He did not specify final winners, but said as many as five or
six equipment suppliers may be needed nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Foreign suppliers engaged in joint ventures with CDMA
manufacturing capabilities in China will get priority in the
bidding, said Lu Jianguo, vice-president of China Unicom.
</P>
<P>
"We will follow the government's market-for-technology
principle to create the CDMA network," he said.
</P>
<P>
The company announced earlier this year plans to invest 7
billion yuan (843 million U.S. dollars) to establish a nationwide
CDMA network with an initial capacity of 2 million lines. The
construction plan, however, has been delayed.
</P>
<P>
Unicom was recently authorized by the State Council to be the
sole negotiator dealing with CDMA-related matters ranging from
intellectual property rights purchases and joint venture proposals,
according to Lu.
</P>
<P>
The network construction will provide domestic and foreign
telecom equipment manufacturers with a wide market. So far, Nortel
Networks and Motorola have formal CDMA joint ventures in China.
Lucent also has the capability in its local joint venture.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 60,000 Chinese are
now employed in over 13,000 foreign companies and organizations
based in China, according to the China Association of Foreign
Service Agencies.
</P>
<P>
The association was established in December 1989 to meet the
demands of the increasing number of foreign companies coming to
China, and the organization now has 72 member agencies throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
The first foreign service agency opened in Beijing in 1979 when
China began its reform and opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
After ten years of reform and development, the number of
foreign service agencies in China increased to 30 in 1989,
providing over 4,000 Chinese employees for some 2,600 foreign
companies and organizations.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding, the association has promulgated a series of
rules and regulations to coordinate relations between Chinese
employees and foreign companies, protecting the interests of both
sides, association officials said.
</P>
<P>
It has played an important role in promoting economic and trade
cooperation between China and other countries and improving
conditions for foreign investment in China, they added.

<HEADLINE> Panama Canal Makes Big Contribution to World Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Panama Canal, seen by
Panamanians as "the heart of the world" and "the bridge of the
universe," is an important maritime waterway contributing to the
development of world trade.
</P>
<P>
The 80.4 kilometer-long canal cut by more than 10,000
kilometers the maritime distance between the Pacific and Atlantic
oceans, and has benefited 800,000 ships from different countries.
</P>
<P>
Five percent of world trade among the nations of the five
continents passes through this interoceanic waterway, and the
canal has played an important role in the economy of the world
since its inauguration on August 15, 1914.
</P>
<P>
Due to the Canal, Panama has the biggest merchant fleet in the
world with 9,467 ships registered until 1998, according to
Panama's Consular and Ship Direction.
</P>
<P>
In the 21st Century global trade, Panama will take advantage of
its geographic position to promote its role of a bridge country,
which is to be strengthened with the recovery of the waterway to
the Panamanian sovereignty on December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The United States is committed to returning to Panama the
interoceanic waterway in compliance with the Torrijos-Carter
treaties signed in 1977, after 85 years of U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 ships pass along the cannel each year, moving
merchandise between Asia, Europe, Africa and the American
continent.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government started several years ago a process
of modernization of the main ports located on the banks of the
Canal. Two of them, Balboa and Cristobal, are administered by the
Hong Kong maritime consortium Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
This maritime corporation improved considerably the port
services and the efficiency in transportation of containers and
passengers, and in loading and unloading of bulk products.
</P>
<P>
The Canal Authorities have started the widening of the Canal in
the Culebra Cut zone according to the plans of modernization and
improvement of the services.
</P>
<P>
The transit of ships was less than 37 units a day three years
ago, according to the Panama Canal Commission (CCP), a U.S.
federal agency which has run the waterway since 1914.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the implementation of the plans, the average daily
transit now has increased to 50.
</P>
<P>
It is foreseen that the investments in the modernization plans
will almost double, from 52.6 million dollars in 1999 to 100.9
million dollars in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The Canal Authorities will increase the tugboat fleet from 17
to 20 units along with the increase in the transit of ships
through the waterway.

<P>
MACAO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Following are statistics on
Macao's economy:
</P>
<P>
1. Macao, an international free port with a history of more
than 100 years, boasts four pillar industries: tourism and
gambling, export processing, banking and construction and real
estate.
</P>
<P>
2. Macao has established trade relations with more than 100
countries and regions, and is official member of over 30
international economic organizations or institutions.
</P>
<P>
3. In 1998 Macao's gross domestic product was about 55 billion
Pataca, while the per capita average GDP was 16,000 U.S. dollars,
ranking the fifth in Asia.
</P>
<P>
4. By the end of October 1999, the number of Macao-invested
projects in China's inland areas had amounted to 6,357, with a
contracted investment of 9.176 billion U.S. dollars and used
investment of 3.69 billion U.S. dollars, ranking the 10th among
all the overseas capital sources to the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
5. Macao's tourism and gambling industry employed more than 70,
000 people, accounting for one third of Macao's total employed
population. Tourism and gambling contributed as high as 42 percent
to Macao's total output value. In recent years Macao receives
seven to eight million visitors annually.
</P>
<P>
6. The output value of gambling industry makes up two thirds of
Macao's overall tourism income. In 1997 the Macao government's
revenue from gambling taxation reached 6.1 billion Pataca, making
gambling its largest and the most stable source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
7. Macao has some 120 travel agencies, 105 hotels and inns with
a total of 8,300 guest rooms.
</P>
<P>
8. Construction and real estate output value make up 10 percent
of Macao's GDP; residential buildings that are still vacant in
Macao can house another 200,000 people, about half of the existing
population of Macao.
</P>
<P>
9. Macao has 22 banks with official license, including two
note-issuing banks, and 21 insurance companies.

<HEADLINE> China's First "Women's Bank" Opens in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- China's first "women's bank"
which opened recently in Shenzhen, a southern China port city, has
set a good precedent for commercial banks as well as other service
providers in tailoring their services to fit increasingly diverse
social needs, today's China Daily quoted some experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
The paper's Business Weekly reported that the launch of the
first bank that provides financial services particularly designed
for female customers broke new ground for Chinese women in facing
the tough transition from a planned economy to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
The women's bank was unveiled last Wednesday by China
Construction Bank, one of China's four largest State commercial
banks. It offers career women with specialized financial service
packages.
</P>
<P>
"No matter whether it succeeds, it is an innovative effort in
the right direction," said Wu Zhaohua, a researcher of economic
and female issues from the Party committee of southwest China's
Sichuan Province. "And that is enough."
</P>
<P>
She said that the new bank recognized the growing consumer
group because more and more women are calling for support to deal
with pressures. A "women's bank" could do more to help women
operate their businesses and handle financial issues.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jing, deputy director of the women's research center at
the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, echoed Wu, saying that it
suggests women have played an important role in family and social
life in China and that their situation is improving.
</P>
<P>
Observers also notice that concerns over difficulties that may
arise from China's entry to the World Trade Organization give
Chinese commercial banks a strong reason to improve services.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Return: Important Step for Reunifying China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- In another week, China will
resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macao, signaling an end to
the history of foreigners occupying and ruling part of Chinese
territory and western colonial rule in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Macao's return to China has been hailed as a milestone in the
process of China's reunification, which is expected to be
completed with the reunification of Taiwan with its motherland.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan have always been Chinese territory.
Reunification of the motherland, therefore, remains a common wish
of all Chinese people including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
In China's modern history, its people were preoccupied with "
saving the country." With the founding of the People's Republic of
China, the Hong Kong and Macao questions were finally put on the
government agenda in the late 1970s and their settlement was
listed as one of the three principal government tasks in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of China's reform and opening-up
drive, put forward the concept of "one country, two systems" in
the early 1980s as a way to resolve the Taiwan question. It is a
creative principle for resolving international disputes left over
from history.
</P>
<P>
The concept was first applied to resolving the Hong Kong issue.
With the joint efforts of the Chinese and British governments, the
prosperous city, which had been ruled by the British for over 150
years, returned to the embrace of its motherland on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Great successes have been achieved in the implementation of the
concept of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong during the past
two and a half years: Hong Kong has cemented its status as an
international financial center by successfully fending off the
impact of the Asian Financial Crisis; Hong Kong people, as masters
of their own land, have fully enjoyed democratic rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will allocate more
money to the cultural sector next year with the gradual
improvement of its economy, the Brazilian authorities was quoted
as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Four cultural projects across the country will be concluded in
the year 2000, according to the authorities quoted by the press.
</P>
<P>
One of the four projects is the Monumental Program of 200
million dollars for the preservation of the historical heritage in
12 cities across Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The other three are related to the commemoration of the fifth
centennial of Brazil discovery.
</P>
<P>
One of them is the rescue of the documents of the Brazilian
colonial period, recovered by the Brazilian government from
Portuguese archives of the Brazilian states of Minas Geraiss,
Bahia, Ceara, Sergipe, and Mato Grosso.
</P>
<P>
The work will continue next year with the recovery of the
archives from Holland, Spain, England, and France.
</P>
<P>
Another project is the Open Museum of the Discovery in Porto
Seguro, to be concluded next April, and the city will become "a
thematic park."
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian city of Sao Paulo will stage the 2000 Exhibition
next March, with a retrospective review of the Brazilian artistic
development with works that go from the Pre-Cabral Period to the
present days.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Return: Important Step for Reunifying China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While their old lifestyle has remained unchanged after Hong
Kong's return, the Hong Kong people have been able to feel the
warmth of the embrace of the motherland and pride from being
Chinese under the framework of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Successful implementation of the concept represents a good
precedent for a smooth return of Macao to China. The Sino-
Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) has held a total of 37
plenary sessions and 56 rounds of talks between the chief
representatives of both sides during its 12-year existence, and
the MSAR Preparatory Committee held 11 plenums and more than 50
group meetings in one and a half years. All these meetings have
paved the way for the return of Macao, a second step in China's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
China has been unified several times in history, all by force.
Settlement of the Hong Kong and Macao questions by peaceful means,
therefore, has been hailed by the international community as "
pioneering and creative work" and "a great contribution." People
familiar with the political situation in China, however, won't
forget that the concept of "one country, two systems" was
initially put forward to resolve the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
The focus of attention,therefore, is naturally shifted to
Taiwan. Chinese leaders have pledged on many occasions that the
Taiwan question cannot be delayed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Chinese decision makers hold the concept of "one country, two
systems" as a feasible and viable means to resolve the Taiwan
issue since it takes into consideration and respects the present
and long-term interests of the Taiwan compatriots and allows their
wish for peace, security and maintenance of the status quo to be
fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
If Taiwan is reunified with its motherland, more flexible
policies than those applied in Hong Kong and Macao will be
implemented there. For instance, it may maintain its own armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
With the successful implementation of the concept of "one
country, two systems" in Hong Kong and Macao, more and more Taiwan
compatriots are expected to endorse the principle.

<P>
It is public knowledge that the Taiwan question falls into the
category of internal affairs of China and has nothing to do with
any foreign government as Hong Kong and Macao issues did. On the
Taiwan question, Chinese leaders have stated that everything could
be put forward onto the negotiation table under the principle of "
One China."
</P>
<P>
Lee Tenghui's characterization of relations across the Taiwan
Straits as being of a "special state-to-state" type has met with
unanimous opposition from all Chinese people including Taiwan
compatriots. It is "a traitor's theory,"people say.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the political disagreement across the Taiwan
Straits is not an argument over social systems. Rather, it is a
struggle over whether or not China is to be splitted up and
whether or not China's national interests should be safeguarded.
History has provided ample evidence that any person who should
challenge national unity and go against the "one China" principle
will meet with an ignominious end.
</P>
<P>
To end the history of Taiwan being separated from the mainland,
numerous civil groups and organizations devoted to China's
reunification have emerged on both sides of the Straits.
</P>
<P>
A complete reunification will instill new life into the Taiwan
economy and allow the Taiwan people to enjoy honor and pride from
being part of a great nation.
</P>
<P>
National unity has always remained an unchanging mainstream in
Chinese history. As China's president Jiang Zemin stressed at a
rally celebrating the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of
China on October 1, China will achieve a complete reunification by
adhering to the principle of "peaceful reunification, one country
and two systems".
</P>

<HEADLINE> Macao's Rating System for Entertainment Industry to Remain Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The present rating system for
the entertainment industry in Macao will remain unchanged after
the city returns to China on Dec. 20, a Portuguese Macao
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zengyang, president of the Macao Cultural Institute, said
the government of Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR) will
continue to rate films and video products into four groups of A, B,
C, D, and that any promotional posters and pictures that are
regarded as being pornographic or against public ethical standards
will be forbidden by law to be exhibited outside movie houses and
theaters and at other public places or to be carried by newspapers
and magazines.
</P>
<P>
Wang is expected to retain a position in the future MSAR
government in charge of cultural affairs.
</P>
<P>
Under the current rating system, Class A films are suitable for
everybody, old and young; Class B films are not suitable for
children under 13 years old; Class C films are not suitable for
children under 18 and are banned for children under 13; while
Class D films are off-limits for people under 18. Films involving
crimes, drug taking, violence, sex or morally debased activities
are all categorized into Class D.
</P>
<P>
The rating system will be kept unchanged under the principles
of "one country,two systems" and "Macao people administering Macao,
" Wang said.
</P>
<P>
All commercial programs, including films, TV programs and
entertainment shows are subject to rating by a special committee
before being put to public show after Macao returns to China, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the rating system will not be influenced by standards
in inland areas of China, Wang stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the MSAR Basic Law, Macao SAR may formulate its
own cultural policies on literature, art, broadcasting, film and
television programs. This means that the present film rating
system in force in Macao may continue if the MSAR government does
not think it necessary to change it. The central government will
not interfere in the matter.
</P>
<P>
Macao is a big importer of film and video products. A
prosperous entertainment industry is a main feature of Macao's
tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
China is to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macao on
Dec. 20, bringing to an end the 155-year Portuguese colonial rule
there.

strongly rejecting U.S. support of Taiwan's participation in the

</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. President Bill Clinton recently signed two
bills passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate: one
is supportive of Taiwan's participation in the WHO and the other,
the Omnibus Act, contains clauses showing such support.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the move as an attempt to help Taiwan squeeze
into international organizations where statehood is a prerequisite
for joining.
</P>
<P>
"Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- Reforms of State-owned enterprises and State-controlled
holding company in northeast China's Liaoning Province have

This marks the first time the province's State-owned
enterprises reported profits since 1995, according to an official

</P>
<P>
-- An estimated 12 million jobs are expected to be created after
China joins the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The figure is based on estimates that China's entry to the WTO

(GDP) up by 2 to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economic theory indicates that for each percent increase in the
GDP growth rate, 4 million jobs will be created.

<HEADLINE> Mandela, Clinton Discuss Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela came to Orlando, Florida, to discuss with
President Bill Clinton the Middle East peace process just days
before Israel and Syria are to resume peace talks in Washington.
</P>
<P>
In a 45-minute breakfast-time meeting, Clinton "filled
President Mandela in on what's been going on in the Middle East,"
according to White House spokesman Barry Toiv.
</P>
<P>
"President Mandela urged him to really try and accomplish
something in the last year of his presidency because he feels that
President Clinton can really play a vital role," Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
"We agree on the major points," regarding Middle East peace
negotiations, Mandela said after his talks with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said in Cape Town on Monday that he wanted to discuss
his own Middle East peace initiatives with Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Claims Hearty Support For Gore's Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11(Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
claimed Saturday that he endorsed chosen successor Al Gore for his
White House campaign "from the heart".
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that in the history of the country, he is the
most effective and influential vice president who has ever served,
" Clinton said at a Democratic convention in Orlando of the
Florida State.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Gore supported him for every tough decision he
made as president, from guns and tobacco, to Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Clinton praised Gore for "being instrumental" to the economic
success and social progress his administration has achieved.
</P>
<P>
The Florida state Democratic convention was to hear from Gore
himself later Saturday. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival for the
Democratic presidential nomination, is scheduled to speak Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gore has pointedly distanced himself from his official role as
vice president of late, and symbolically distanced himself from
Clinton so as to came out of the shadow of President Clinton's sex
scandal.
</P>
<P>
Gore barely mentions the president in stump speeches, and the
two rarely appear together in recent days.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: Strong Earthquake Rocks Northern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A strong earthquake measuring 6.
8 on the Richter Scale hit the Northern Philippines early Sunday,
causing minor injuries in Manila, the Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology and officials said.
</P>
<P>
In a preliminary report, the institute said that the epicenter
of the quake, which occurred at 02:03 (18:03,GMT), was 61
kilometers southwest of Lingayen, Pangasinan Province. The
institute put the intensity at VI in Manila.
</P>
<P>
It also said that damages and aftershocks are expected. The
possible source of the quake was from Manila trench, it said.
</P>
<P>
As the epicenter was only around 150 kilometers north of Manila,
the earthquake was strongly felt in the capital city. Panic
residents rushed into the streets. Power supply was temporarily
suspended for about one hour.
</P>
<P>
In Manila, the quake shook trees, rocked buildings and toppled
some electricity poles. Many buildings sustained cracks. Patients
were evacuated from at least one hospital.
</P>
<P>
Some customers were reportedly slightly hurt as they fled from
a restaurant in the city, and some were hurt while rushing down
the stairs.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Office of the Civilian Defense told Xinhua
that one child was hurt by a falling post near a building, but
damages were minor.
</P>
<P>
He said that his office will issue an official report on
damages and casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is in the Pacific "Ring of Fire" where
earthquakes frequently occur. About 2000 people were killed when a
strong quake with a magnitude of 7.7 rocked the Northern
Philippines on July 16,1990.

<HEADLINE> Alshammar Beats Second World Mark at European Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LISBON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Therese Alshammar of Sweden
set her second world record for the women's 50 meters freestyle in
two days on Saturday at the European short-course championships.
</P>
<P>
Alshammer, who had broken the 100 meters freestyle short-
course record on Friday, eclipsed a second formidable time
belonging to China's former world champion Le Jingyi in Saturday's
race by clocking 24.09 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Swede, who carved 0.21 seconds from Le's 100
freestyle time with a time of 52.80 Friday, sliced 0.14 seconds
from the 50 record when she won her second individual gold medal
of the championships.
</P>
<P>
Le had set both records at the inaugural world short-course
championships in Palma de Mallorca in December 1993.
</P>
<P>
Having shaved 0.01 seconds from the European record of absent
Dutchwoman Inge de Bruijn in 24.27 in the semifinals, Alshammer
raised the tempo in the final to touch in 24.09, the best part of
a second ahead of fellow Swede Anna-Karin Kammerling and Britain's
Sue Rolph, who shared silvers with matching times of 24.90.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Sandra Voelker won the backstroke in 27.31 seconds,
just outside the 27.27 world mark she set at last December's
edition of these championships in Sheffield, England.
</P>
<P>
the German beat second-placed Russian-born Spaniard Nina
Zhivanevskaya by nearly a second, winning the event for the third
time in a row.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Jana Klochkova added Saturday's 400 meters freestyle
gold to the 400 individual medley and 800 freestyle titles she had
already won.
</P>
<P>
Britain's James Hickman had a day of ups and downs. He was
unexpectedly left without a medal in the 100 meters individual
medley final, which was won by Germany's Jens Kruppa in 53.93,
with the Briton fourth.
</P>
<P>
But Hickman, who lost his 100 meters butterfly title to Sweden
's Lars Frolander on Friday, rallied in the last event of the day
to retain his 200 butterfly crown, overhauling Germany's Thomas
Rupprath in the final 50 meters to touch in 1:53.52 and win
convincingly by nearly a second.
</P>
<P>
Martina Moravcova of Slovakia comfortably retained the women's
100 meters individual medley title, while 19-year-old Russian
Roman Sludnov made sure not everything went Sweden's way when he
beat world short-course champion Patrik Isaakson in the men's 100
breaststroke.
