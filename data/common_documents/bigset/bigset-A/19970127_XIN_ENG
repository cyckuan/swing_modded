<HEADLINE> China to Continue Fight against Separatism in Taiwan: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to fight
against new separatist attempts and activities carried out by the
force for independence in Taiwan, a ranking Chinese official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people will absolutely not sit idly by and remain
indifferent to the separatist activities carried out by some
personalities of the Taiwan authorities who oppose the "One China"
policy, said Wang Zhaoguo, head of the United Front Work
Department of the Communist Party of China( CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wang, also vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, made the
remarks at a function attended by councillors of the Huangpu
(Whampoa) Military Academy Alumni Association and their wives.
</P>
<P>
"Under the unified leadership and planning of the CPC Central
Committee," he noted, "all of the people in our country have
engaged in a mammoth struggle against separatism and the
independence of Taiwan and scored substantial achievements."
</P>
<P>
Any activities attempting to split the country's state
sovereignty and territorial integrity are doomed to end in
complete failure, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, more and more of the academy's alumni have
become to see the true feature of those who want to split China,
and expressed his wish that the alumni both at home and overseas
will continue to safeguard territorial and sovereign integrity of
the motherland and fight against separatism, so as to contribute
still more to the process of the great cause of the motherland's
reunification and the development and prosperity of the Chinese
nation.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Strengthen Positions North of Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
are strengthening their positions north of Kabul by forcing
thousands of non-Pashtoon residents to leave the strategic town of
Gulbahar, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, the Taliban, which are made up of
Pashtoons, have expelled about 50,000 people from districts around
Gulbahar, which is mainly inhabited by ethnic Tajik people,
according to aid agencies in the district.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic student militia seized Gulbahar and Jabul Seraj, 95
km and 77 km respectively north of the capital city of Kabul, from
the forces of ousted Afghan defense minister Ahmad Masood and
northern warlord Rashid Dostum last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gulbahar, lying to the south of now snow-covered Hindu Kush
range, is the gate-way to the Panjsher valley, the stronghold of
Masood, who has dynamited the hillsides in the valley to block the
Taliban advance towards his bastion.
</P>
<P>
According to UN figures, tens of thousands people have left
their homes in Jabul Seraj, Gulbahar, Charikar and other areas the
Taliban militia captured this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China's largest city Shanghai
will strengthen economic ties with Yunnan Province in southwest
China, according to a cooperation outline signed recently by the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
The two have agreed on 30 cooperation projects which involve a
joint investment of more than two billion yuan (about 241 million
US dollars), and another 60 projects the two sides intend to
complete jointly.
</P>
<P>
Last June, the State Council, the country's highest governing
body, decided that Shanghai, with its talented workforce, advanced
technology and abundant investment capital, would come to the aid
of underdeveloped Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Over the next several years, Shanghai and Yunnan will increase
cooperation in fields involving metallurgy, machinery and
electronics, and non-ferrous metals, as well as the chemical
industry, and the light and textile industries.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the two sides will focus on setting up a large
steel plant in Yunnan to promote the growth of some related
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is encouraging some machine, cable and power equipment
producers to find cooperative partners in Yunnan.

<HEADLINE> Railway Bureau and Bank Co-establish Ticketing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- With a new computerized ticketing
system that goes on-line over the weekend, train tickets will be
available at all trading outlets of the China Construction Bank
(CCB) in this capital city of central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The system was set up jointly by the Wuhan Railway Sub-bureau
and the Bank's Wuhan branch. Tickets were previously sold in six
CCB outlets in the city.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 train tickets are sold each day in Wuhan, the
transport hub in central China, and the demand is even bigger
during Spring Festival peak season.
</P>
<P>
To accommodate the rising demand and improve the competitive
edge of railway transport, the Sub-bureau has increased its ticket
offices in the city to more than 60.
</P>
<P>
However, passengers still complain of long lines and other
difficulties in buying ticket during Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, the Sub-bureau reached an agreement with
the Wuhan branch of the CCB at the end of last year to set up a
computer ticketing system connecting all the bank's trading
offices across the city.
</P>
<P>
This year, the Sub-bureau plans to establish another ticketing
system in the city, through working in cooperation with the Wuhan
Telecommunications Administration.

<HEADLINE> UK Insurance Companies to Demand Genetic Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- British insurance companies are
to demand genetic information, revealing a person'a likelihood of
developing certain kinds of disease, as a requirement for new
insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
All applicants for insurance who have previously undergone
genetic tests will be obliged to reveal the results and these
tests are designed to show the propensity to a range of hereditary
diseases, the Sunday Telegraph reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposals, to be published in a code of practice next
month, insurance firms could also deny life cover insurance to
those who refuse to release details to tests.
</P>
<P>
Critics argue that insurance companies could use the data to
charge punitive rates to those who appear to show an increased
risk and they fear the scheme will create an uninsurable
underclass because of their genetic make-up.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts say although genetic tests can reveal a
propensity to disease, these tests are still in their infancy and
are rarely to make a definite forecast.

<HEADLINE> New Stamps on Sale in Hong Kong to Replace Old Designs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A set of new definitive
stamps went on sale here today to replace the old designs bearing
Queen Elizabeth's head.
</P>
<P>
The old designs bearing the portrait of the British Queen were
withdrawn from general sale at the close of business on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Post offices across Hong Kong opened today to sell the new
stamps, which feature Hong Kong Island's famous skyline.
</P>
<P>
The new stamps can be used before and after July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Graphic Designer Kan Tai-keung, creative director of Kan and
Lau Design Consultants, has been designing stamps for the post
office since 1960. He was selected to design the new definitive
stamps two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I feel very honored and happy to be selected to design the
stamps for the new government," he was quoted by the local
English-language newspaper South China Morning Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I chose the harbor because it is one of the most beautiful
scenes of Hong Kong," Kan said.
</P>
<P>
The 13 designs depict Victoria Harbor and Hong Kong Island from
east to west during daylight hours, while the three high-priced
stamps valued at 10, 20 and 30 HK dollars show the Hong Kong
skyline at night.
</P>
<P>
The illustrations are taken from photos and the shades have
been computer-enhanced.
</P>
<P>
A set of Hong Kong's Special Administrative Region stamps are
expected to be issued on June 30 this year to commemorate the
handover.

MOSCOW, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Chechnya, a local republic
trying to break away from the Russian Federation, is ready for
presidential and parliamentary elections, which are scheduled for

<HEADLINE> Supply, Marketing Cooperatives Urged to Serve Expansion of Rural Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Federation of
Supply and Marketing Cooperatives should expand rural markets, so
as to give full scope to the initiative of farmers, a senior
Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Only when farmers can completely sell out their agricultural
products can they have the purchase power to buy more industrial
goods, which in turn helps the rural economy to achieve overall
development, said State Councillor Chen Junsheng, who is also head
of the federation's council.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that in the past, the central government has carried
out a series of policies to ensure the sustained and steady
development of agriculture. Additionally, he said, the state has
raised the purchasing prices of grain on a big margin to benefit
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Consecutive crop harvests and the subsequent growing income of
farmers over the years have provided the supply and marketing
cooperatives with the opportunity for expanding rural markets,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
With their increasing purchasing power, the farmers can buy
more and more industrial consumer goods, and the national economy,
as a whole, can grow in a healthy way.
</P>
<P>
Such supply and marketing cooperatives at various levels all
across the country are obligated to help farmers to promote their
products through expanding their business scope, Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Time for Resuming Israeli-Syrian Talks: Levy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- In the lastest of a
series of peace calls to Syria, Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy said today that now it is time to resume the peace
talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Levy made the remarks during talks with visiting Russian
deputy Foreign Minister Victor Porpvaliuk who is trying to
mediate between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Porpvaliuk said Russia was very interested in renewing the
Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations which have been suspended since
early last year. Russia has maintained good relations with
Damascus and may play a crucial role in getting the
Israeli-Syrian track moving again.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, Levy is expected to meet
late today with European Union (EU) peace envoy Miguel Angel
Moratinos to discuss ways of resuming Syrian talks.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos is to visit Damascus Monday in an attempt to
bridge the gap between the two sides over resuming the peace
process. Analysts here said that the EU envoy is now in a
better position than the leading mediator the United States in
mediating the Israeli-Syrian talks.
</P>
<P>
Syria was recently angered by the U.S. and Israel for
pressuring South Africa to defer a multi-million dollar deal
on selling advanced equipments to computerize Syrian tanks' fire
systems.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, former U.S. Secretary of State Warrent Christopher
also irritated Damascus by saying that the understanding reached
between Israel's previous Labor government and Syria did not
bind the current Likud government.
</P>
<P>
Under the understanding, Israel committed itself to totally
withdraw troops from the occupied Golan Heights in return for
Syria's sealing a peace pact with Israel. Syria is insisting
the talks be resumed on the basis of the understanding and
the "land-for-peace" principle.
</P>
<P>
The Likud government has refused to accept this informal
understanding and called on Syria to resume talks without
preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent Hebron redeployment, Israel has shifted
its attention to the Syrian track. Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu will travel to Washington in two weeks'
time to discuss the matter with U.S. President Bill Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Greek Government Determined to Confront Farmers' Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Government is
determined to confront the planned farmers' protest action, even
by resorting to force, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
"We may probably see riot police in the streets," Agriculture
Undersecretary Vasilis Geranidis warned.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking during a meeting of ruling party officials in
sectors of farming and cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
The Pan-thessaly farmers' coordinating committee announced
earlier that farmers would begin protest action on January 28,
gradually escalating until February 4 when they would resume the
road and rail blockades which caused widespread disruption
nationwide in December. The 25-day blockade cost the country 1.6
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The farmers suspended their action during the Christmas and New
Year holidays but vowed to repeat it if demands were not met.
</P>
<P>
These demands include lower fuel costs and lower value added
tax (VAT) on farm equipment, higher price supports, especially for
cotton, and a 1.3 billion U.S. dollar rescheduling of debts to the
state Agricultural Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Some have chosen the road to blind conflict," Geranidis said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "if they attempt to abolish every sense of a
constitutional state, causing such huge politic and economic cost
for the country, with dramatic consequences on the economy,
tourism, transport and exports, I do not think they leave much
choice to the government but to counterattack on the basis of a
constitutional state."

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A group of Cypriots today
staged a protest against military exercises to be staged by
British troops in Akamas region at the western end of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
More than one hundred people, some members of the House of
Representatives, environmentalists and local residents, gathered
and planted trees in the area, where British military exercises
are scheduled to begin Monday and last until the end of the month
on this Eastern Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The protesters handed a petition to the Episkopi military
base, one of the two bases Britain has on the island since 1960,
asking for an end to exercises in Akamas in protection of its
natural environment.
</P>
<P>
International environmentalist organizations have proposed
that Akamas region should be turned into a national park.
</P>
<P>
President of the parliamentary committee for the environment,
Demetris Eliades and some other MPs addressed the protesters,
expressing their opposition to the performance of military
exercises in the region.
</P>
<P>
A number of environmentalists will tonight camp at the site
in preparations for Monday's direct action against British
military exercises.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the House plenum approved a resolution calling
on the government to intervene to stop the exercises. Deputies
also called for a ban on all future British army exercises
on the island.
</P>
<P>
The former colonial power, Britain, has retained two sovereign
military bases on the island under a treaty in 1960 when Cyprus
gained independence.

LUSAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Flood victims in Lundazi and
Chama districts of Zambia's Eastern Province are receiving 192
tons of maize from the Prevention Against Malnutrition (PAM),
Zambia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Floods devastated the local people's maize fields and other
food crops during the 1995/96 farming season.
</P>
<P>
PAM Eastern Provincial Coordinator Edify Hamukale said in
Chipata, capital of Eastern Province today that the PAM is also
distributing a total of 85 tons of maize, sorghum, cow peas,
groundnuts and sunflower seeds to all districts in the province
on loan to help farmers there invest in food production.
</P>
<P>
However, Hamukale said the delivery of the relief food to
the affected areas should not raise hopes for people living on
the plateau whose food crops were not swept by floods that they
will also be given food by the government.
</P>
<P>
He urged them to take up farming seriously to boost food
production instead of waiting for handouts from the government.

European Union's special envoy to Somalia Sigurd Illing this
week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aidid called on the United Nations Security Council
to condemn the Ethiopian government for "carrying out deliberate

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Bank of
Ethiopia said today that the fund set aside for credit in the
past five years has grown from 364 million to 3.4 billion Birr
(6.4 Birr equal to one U.S.Dollar ).
</P>
<P>
The Assistant Vice-President of the Credit Assessment and
Analysis Department of the bank, Mulugeta Bebremedhin, told the
local press that 834 percent credit growth was attained due to
the rise in the number of debtors following the economic reform
and the expansion of services by the bank.
</P>
<P>
Mulugeta said that demand for credit has grown thanks to
production boosting witnessed in government development agencies,
the need created for more inputs in the agricultural secfor, and
the involvement of enterpreneurs in various sectors of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The betterment in the financial status of farmers has
subsquently contributed for growth in demand for commodities
which in turn has spurred industrial activities aimed at
benefitting from the thriving market, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, credit service for the agricultural
sector has grown from 2 million to 317 million Birr with that of
the industry and domestic trade sectors showing a rise in the
stated period from 80 million to 290 million Birr and 199 million
to 2 billion Birr respectively.

KAMPALA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Uganda held a rally here this
afternoon to mark the 11th anniversary of the formation of the
country's National Resistance government.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the rally, President Yoweri Museveni said the
economiuc situation has been fine in the country, with the gross
domestic product growth rate reaching 6.5 percent in last 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate has droped from 240 percent in 1986 when his
administration came to power, to 5.4 percent at present, Museveni
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said his administration has also made achievements in
education#,health care and social services in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
On fighting in the north last year, he said the insurgency
resulted mainly from the weekness of the state, stressing that it
is imperative to build up its capacity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Museveni recommended that the people make Uganda
or individuals rich through pivatization, noting that those who
get rich through taking away state properties will get nothing in
the final analysis.
</P>
<P>
On Africa's regional issues, he urged the settlement of
problems through serious talks, private or official, adding it is
the only way that will benefit everybody in the continent.

JOHANNESBURG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) today dismissed speculation that
its acting Secretary General Cheryl Carolus intended to stand for
the position of Secretary General.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at its Headquarters in Johannesburg,
ANC's national spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said Carolus had never
officially announced her intention to stand for the top post.
</P>
<P>
Carolus, deputy secretary-general of the ANC, was last week
appointed the acting Secretary-General, a post she would hold
until the next national congress scheduled for December this
year.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa left the post for
the business world early this year.
</P>
<P>
Carolus has resisted all attempts to have herself nominated to
that position, according to the ANC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
However, South African President Nelson Mandela had earlier
expressed his support for Carolus to succeed Ramaphosa who had
quit the post.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Leniency from All Afghan Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today called on all Afghan groups to show some
degree of leniency in their expectations in an effort for a
negotiated settlement of the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president made the statement while meeting with
ousted Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani and Prime Minister
Golbudin Hekmatyar here today.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan leaders came to Tehran for the two-day Afghanistan
Peace Conference which ended here today with the endorsement of a
declaration calling for an immediate ceasefire in the war-torn
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old president said that the longer the war
continues in Afghanistan, the heavier would be the adverse
effects of the war with still graver disadvantages to the
future generations of that country.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is no military solution to the civil
war in Afghanistan, which warranted a sincere effort by all
parties involved in the conflict to agree on peace.
</P>
<P>
"The Afghan government is a sovereign government with
international legitimacy. So, there is no need for the Islamic
Republic of Iran to establish contacts with that government in
Afghanistan at venues unjustifiable by either side," he was
quoted by Iran's official news agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that even the prominent figures among the
Taleban have noted that war would not be a proper solution to the
 present crisis in that country.
</P>
<P>
The Taleban, the main political and military player in
Afghanistan, refused to attend the peace conference sponsored by
Tehran since it enjoy obvious dominance and controls more
than 75 percent of the country.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Iran would continue to offer
humanitarian aid to the people of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani called on regional countries, especially Iran and
Pakistan, to act in harmony in order to bring about peace
and unity among the various Afghan groups.
</P>
<P>
Iran's state-run press today attacked Pakistan for military
support to the Taleban militia in Afghanistan while sending
low-level officials to Tehran for the peace conference.
</P>
<P>
With strong background of the Foreign Ministry, English daily
Tehran Times said that "Pakistan, the main patron of the Taleban
militia, sent a low-level delegation headed by its additional
foreign secretary to the gathering."
</P>
<P>
"It is also regrettable that Pakistan is still sticking to
its unrealistic approach to the Afghan crisis," the daily said
in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
Another English daily, Kayhan International, called the Taleban
"a creation of U.S., Pakistan and Saudi Arabia -- each of them
supporting the extremist group for their own reasons."
</P>
<P>
Persian daily Jumhuri Islami also published an editorial
criticizing Pakistan's move as "in collusion with the United
States over the Afghan issue."
</P>
<P>
Taleban militia seized the Afghan capital Kabul on September 27
1996, ousting the government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Kabul is considered as a major setback in Iran's
foreign policy. As a result, the relations between Iran and
Pakistan have remained cold since then.

<HEADLINE> Group of Ten Governors Approve Regular Collection of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 26 ((Xinhua) -- The governors of the central
banks of the Group of Ten countries have approved to regularly
collect statistics on derivatives markets through reporting by
leading market participants starting from end of June, 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release today by the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) based in Basle, Switzerland, the
framework is based on a July 1996 report entitled "Proposals for
Improving Global Derivatives Statistics" prepared by a working
group of the Euro-currency Standing Committee chaired by Shinichi
Yoshikuni, an adviser at the International Department of the Bank
of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The approved framework, finalized after a period of
consultation with market participants and supervisory authorities,
differs from the the original proposals in ways which will lessen
the burden on reporting institutions.
</P>
<P>
When the report was release last July, the Governors noted that
the implications of the growth of derivatives markets for the
functioning of financial markets have been the subject of
considerable discussion in recent years, says the press release.
They agreed with the evolving public consensus that derivatives
markets serve a valuable role in strengthening the financial
system by facilitating the reallocation of risk to market
participants most able and willing to bear it.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it had become clear that improved information
on the size and structure of derivatives markets is needed to
increase market transparency and there by help central banks,
other authorities and market participants to better monitor
patterns of activity in the global financial system, according to
the press release.
</P>
<P>
"The approved framework envisages the regular compilation of
internationally consistent market statistics on the notional
amounts and gross market values outstanding of broad categories of
foreign exchange, interest rate and equity-based over-the-counter
derivative instruments across a range of underlying currencies,
interest rates and equity markets," says the BIS, adding that the
statistics will also include derivatives-related credit exposures
before and after netting arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The global market statistics will be compiled by national
central banks and published by the BIS, initially on a semi-annual
basis. Now that the content and timing of the reporting have been
agreed to, individual central banks and regulators will develop
appropriate reporting procedures for reporters in their national
markets.
</P>
<P>
The design of the regular reporting framework draws on the
results of the most recent triennial Central Bank Survey of
Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity, conducted in
April, 1995. Although the design of future derivatives surveys has
not yet been settled, it is intended that these surveys be closely
coordinated with the regular reporting framework, so as to create
benchmarks for the regular reporting data through the use of a
broader survey population while reducing overlapping data
requirement on regular reporters as far as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Ten consists of 12 countries of Belgium, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Sweden,
Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denounces Drug Charges from West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Foreign Ministry
today reacted strongly to allegations that Turkish government
officials had been involved in illegal drug operations.
</P>
<P>
A strongly-worded statement from the Foreign Ministry followed
today's reports that British and French officials had made the
charges against the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
The statement complained: "It is noteworthy that such claims
lacking any documentary proof are made through the press and
certain institutions instead of being conveyed to the Turkish
government in the framework of the international cooperation
against narcotic smuggling."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that it is regrettable that some
European countries ignored Turkey's constant warnings that the
drug smuggling was a main source of income for the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is demanding to be shown with concrete evidence and is
rejecting all unfounded allegations lacking such a proof. The
airing of such generalized accusations against our country is
unacceptable," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The incriminating reports from Britain and France followed
allegations by German Judge Rolf Schwalbe in the Frankfurt
State Court that Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister was in personal contact with known Turkish drug
smuggling families.
</P>
<P>
British assistant home secretary Tom Sackville has said that
more than 80 percent of heroin seized in Britain originated
from Turkey and many narcotics operations had failed because of
Turkish leaks.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based Geopolitical Narcotics Monitor has claimed that
drug smugglers enjoy protection by the highest authorities in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish police seized 3 tonnes of heroin in 1996, accounting
for 22 percent of the world's total haul, and 7 tonnes of hashish
in the same year, according to official figures.

<P>
KHARTOUM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's governor of the Blue
Nile province Tayeb Babakr Gaber Kelo said the Sudanese forces
killed 200 Ethiopian soldiers in the fighting today.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the Sudanese News Agency as saying that the
Ethiopian soldiers were killed in fights that took place today in
the Al-Karmak district, south of the province that bordering
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"The battle proved the involvement of the Ethiopian forces in
the Sudanese internal conflict," the Sudanese official underlined.
</P>
<P>
The casualties of the Ethiopian forces were counted by the
Sudanese reconnaissance unit spearheading the Sudanese forces,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The battlefield is now under the full control of the Sudanese
forces," Kelo added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sudanese Interior Ministry issued a statement
today, saying that 3,000 to 4,000 local people in south Sudan
have disappeared or were abducted by the Ethiopian forces.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on the international organizations to set
up a fact-finding committee in order to investigate into the
destiny of those Sudanese citizens.
</P>
<P>
On January 13, the Sudanese opposition forces launched attacks
on a number of towns near the eastern borders of Sudan and the
fights against the government forces are still going on.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government said it was faced by an external armed
aggression from Ethiopia and Eritrea and that the Ethiopian and
Eritrean forces occupied a number of Sudanese border towns.
</P>
<P>
"The Ethiopian and Eritrean governments abducted a number of
Sudanese provincial officials and back up some Sudanese
mercenaries and stooges in order to implement a Zionist
imperialist design against Arabism and Islam," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The plot aims also to enable the Christian minority to rule
Sudan as is the case in Ethiopia and Eritrea," it added
</P>
<P>
However, Ethiopia and Eritrea have repeatedly denied any
involvement of their forces in the Sudanese conflict.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has made more
progress in its privatization drive for the past week than it
did in the whole of last year, the Anatolia news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Within the last week alone, privatization deals worth a total
of 320.5 million U.S. dollars were settled through the sale of
shares in Etibank, Anadolubank and Denizbank.
</P>
<P>
The sale prices of the three banks will reach 342.5
million U.S. dollars with accrued interest when payment by
instalments is completed.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Turkey's total revenue obtained in the
privatization process was 290.8 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Etibank was divided into three banks --
Etibank, Anadolubank and Denizbank -- to facilitate the
privatization program, which was launched in 1995 and has remained
on the government's agenda ever since.

which has hit the city for the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
A press statement issued today by the Ministry of Water, said

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hopes US to Continue to Back Peace Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa expressed the hope today that U.S. President Bill
Clinton would continue to back the Middle East peace process
during his second term of presidency.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks before concluding a two-day visit to
Saudi Arabia earlier today. He called on the U.S. to urge Israel
to comply with the recently signed Hebron deal, reports reaching
here from the Saudi capital Riyadh said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said newly appointed U.S. Secretary of State Madeline
Albright expressed to him her strong desire to continue her
country's role as the Middle East peace process co-sponsor. The
other co-sponsor of the peace march is Russia.
</P>
<P>
On ways of pushing forward the Middle East peace process after
the Hebron deal, Moussa said that "Israel has to comply with the
deal in a frank manner so the PLO-Israeli peace talks and
negotiations between the Israelis on one side, and the Lebanese
and the Syrians on the other side, would resume."
</P>
<P>
He said the deal, signed by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat at the
Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip on January 15,
would help Israel regain its credibility in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt "refuses any Israeli proposals which violate the
spirits of peace and aim at amending the deals or finding new
formula in order to reach a peace in the Israeli way," Moussa
said.
</P>
<P>
The deal which was delayed for 10 months allows the
Palestinians self-rule in 80 percent of the West Bank town of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
On Israeli accusation that Egypt derailed the signing of the
Hebron deal, Moussa said "Egypt doesn't care about the Israeli
accusations because it (Cairo) has its own politicians who draw
the major guidelines to push the peace process, that is why it did
not try to defend itself."
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the role of King Hussein of Jordan in ironing
out obstacles hindering the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who arrived in Saudi Arabia Saturday, delivered a
message from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz which dealt with the peace process, the latest
developments in Sudan and bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Ruling Party Won 2 Seats in By-Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main ruling party won
the last two seats of the lower house in the by-elections for five
vacant seats of the House of Representatives, the Election
Commission announced today.
</P>
<P>
Final results of the by-elections showed that candidates of the
Nepali Congress (NC) party had won in the two constituencies in
Baitadi and Rautahat respectively, the Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The by-elections were held Friday in the country's five
constituencies to elect MPs in order to fill the vacant seats in
the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Earlier over last weekend, the Election Commission had
announced that main opposition the Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) secured three of the five
vacant house seats by winning the by-elections in the Kathmandu,
Sunsari and Rupandehi constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's NC party, which leads the
three-party coalition government, earlier said it wanted to win
all the five house seats to replace the CPN-UML as the largest
party in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the Communist opposition will remain to be the largest
force in the parliament with the three newly elected MPs.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML held 87 seats in the 205-seat lower house while the
NC part held 86 before the Friday by-elections.

<HEADLINE> Manila Reaches Regional Truce Agreement With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) today signed an
agreement ending their recent conflict in a southern Philippine
town.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was forged after two-day talks in Sultan
Kudarat town in southern Maguindanao province, requires both
government troops and MILF fighters from making any provocative
actions in Bulton town, central Mindanao, in the future.
</P>
<P>
The six-point accord demands the dismantling of all the MILF
checkpoints in Buldon and the withdrawal of all the government
troops deployed in the town since January 1.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Maguindanao governor will help Buldon
mayor Makarampat Manalao return to his office, local police force
will continue to maintain peace and order in the area, concerned
government agencies will be sent in to assist in the relief and
rehabilitation of evacuees.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides still disagreed on whether they should
maintain their current positions in Buldon, which they controlled
after their two-day fierce clashes starting on January 16. The
unsettled issue will be discussed at the next meeting on February
9.
</P>
<P>
The clashes broke out after an ambush by MILF rebels against a
convoy of government soldiers escorting Manalao to take his
office. Manalao has been prevented from taking his office by the
MILF after winning the post in the 1995 local elections.
</P>
<P>
The two-day clashes left four government soldiers and 32 MILF
rebels killed and scores of others wounded. Although a temporary
ceasefire was declare on January 22, the two sides clashed again

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Paper Criticizes Decision by UN Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 27 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi influential daily today
denounced a decision by the U.N. Sanctions Committee as "unjust
and non-objective."
</P>
<P>
An article carried in the ath-Thawra, organ of the Iraqi ruling
Arab Baa'th Socialist Party, strongly criticized the committee's
decision to block Iraq's import of badly needed consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
The committee turned down Iraqi requests to import consumer
goods like cotton yarns, pesticides, hospital linen, textiles and
pencils, etc., according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper said it is "unjust and non-objective" to block the
United Nations Development Program's (UNDP) request to carry out a
seed improvement project in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the UNDP worked out a project to improve
crop seeds for Iraq, but the sanctions committee blocked it under
the pretext that such goods may contribute to enhancing Iraqi
industry.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that after six years of sanctions, the
committee is "still making unfair decisions and acting in a manner
that has considerably harmed the Iraqi people and denied them the
simplest legitimate rights."
</P>
<P>
A preliminary report released last December by the Food and
Agricultural Organization said there is a drastic deterioration in
Iraqi agriculture, and lack of good seeds and other badly needed
materials have caused a sharp decline in grain production.

TIRANA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian parliament has
decided to temporarily use a limited number of troops to curb
nationwide violent protests over collapsing pyramid investment

returns for small outlays.

</P>
<P>
The center will be jointly headed by Professor Ma Songde,
President of the Institute of Automation, and Olivier Monga, a
French scientist at the France's National Institute for Computer
Science and Control. The budget will be shared equally between the
two countries, according to the CAS.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Automation, established in 1956, focuses
mainly on computer science and high-tech research and
development. It is the first in China to develop the controlling
technology in the satellite and space industry.
</P>
<P>
Its French partner, renowned for achievements in computer
science and automation, covers similar research fields.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences and the French institute had a
cooperation agreement in as early as 1981, and two have since
frequently exchanged visits between scholars.
</P>
<P>
Zhou and Bernard Larrouturou, President of the French institute
signed the cooperation deal today in Beijing, in the presence of
Francois Fillon, France's minister of post, telecommunication and
space and Pierre Morel, the French Ambassador in China.

<HEADLINE> 4 Rebels Killed in Western Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Four members of Iran's anti-
government organization were killed by armed policemen in a
western border region, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the four, who were from Iraq-based armed
opposition group People's Mojahedin of Iran (PMOI), were killed
in clashes with Iranian border guards and tribesmen.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the outlawed members were spotted
while trying to penetrate Iran for sabotage activities via
western border crossing of Mehran.
</P>
<P>
A local official was quoted as saying that four Kalashnikov
assault rifles, four anti-vehicle mines, some explosives belonging
to the Iraqi army, eight cyanide pills, some propaganda
pamphlets and photos of PMOI ring leaders were also seized.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the four-member team had been
dispatched to Iran for sabotage activities and intimidation of
people on the eve of the 10-day dawn celebrations marking
the triumph of the Islamic revolution beginning from February 1.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report, two PMOI members were
killed and two others arrested in clashes with Iranian Law
Enforcement Forces in western province of Kermanshahan earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
Those who were arrested had confessed to cooperation and
coordination with the Iraqi intelligence agency for crossing the
border and their objective behind infiltrating into Iranian
territory.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, PMOI staged a series of bombings in the country during
the fourth parliamentary elections. Tehran reacted by staging an
air raid on PMOI base inside the Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
Mass'oud Rajavi, PMOI's leader, lived in Iraq at the
moment. There are about 20,000 anti-Iranian government troops in
Iraq.

BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Federation of

Cotton should only be purchased by the authorized organs, and
no other institutions should be involved in the buying. This will
help to achieve a stable market and ensure the success of the
farmers, the federation emphasized.

NICOSIA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Telecommunications
Authority (CYTA) has signed an agreement on the construction and
maintenance of an international submarine fibre optic cable
system, called Sea-Me-Wee-3, Cyprus News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by other 92 telecommunications
organizations from around the world, can transfer telephone
communications as well as wide-band services, including
video-conferencing and multi-media.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice-President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam arrived here today to continue his Gulf tour
aimed at reviewing bilateral relations and regional issues of
common concern, after ending a visit to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam, accompanied by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
Al-Shara, was met upon arrival by Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah and other
government officials.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay here, the Syrian vice-president is
expected to hold talks with the Kuwaiti prime minister.
</P>
<P>
This is the second leg of Khaddam's Gulf trip which will take
him to the other four countries of the six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC), namely, the United Arab Emirates, Oman,
Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Official Syrian sources disclosed that the Syrian delegation
was seeking to discuss latest development of the Middle East
peace process in light of the Hebron agreement already signed
by the Palestinian National Authority and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The sources were quoted by the Saudi Press Agency (SPA)
as saying that the current tour was aimed at reviewing bilateral
relations, regional and international issues of mutual concern
between Syria and the GCC states.
</P>
<P>
Syrian sources here said Syria still insists on a
comprehensive peace based on the principle of land-for-peace
formula and in accordance with the international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said the Syrian vice-president and foreign
minister, who arrived in Saudi Arabia Sunday, held talks with
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Saudi Crown Prince and First Deputy Prime
Minister and Commander of the National Guards, during which they
reviewed bilateral relations and key developments on the Arab,
regional and international arenas.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam also conveyed a letter from Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad to Saudi King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aziz Sunday, which dealt
with Arab situation in general and the latest development of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the Syrian leader' tour came amid a
flurry of meetings among Arab leaders in the Saudi capital of
Riyadh after the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on
Hebron earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> China Enjoys Stable Situation in Int'l Income, Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China is now enjoying the
comfort of a stable international income and payment situation, a
senior Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China's foreign exchange situation maintained a sound
development trend, along with the remarkable achievements in the
country's macro-economic control and the evident improvement of
the economic and financial situation, according to Zhou Xiaochuan,
Director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).
</P>
<P>
Speaking today at a national conference attended by heads of
SAFE's provincial branches, he said that China's imports and
exports totaled 289.9 billion US dollars last year, with a surplus
of 12.24 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The overseas funds which actually arrived were more than 50
billion US dollars, including a direct overseas investment of
42.35 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, China witnessed a slow-down in the growth of
its outstanding overseas debts as the sum increased only nine
percent to reach 116.28 billion US dollars, 9.69 billion US
dollars more than that of the previous year, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that there would be balanced international incomes
and payments under current accounts, with a little surplus, while
there would be a relatively big surplus for capital accounts.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, supply was larger than demand in the local foreign
exchange market, while the state foreign exchange reserve
increased by a large margin to top 105 billion US dollars, up
31.4 billion US dollars over the figure at the beginning of the
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the RMB yuan against the US dollar climbed
from 8.3174 to 8.2984, increasing at a slower rate compared with
the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that the rise in China's foreign exchange reserve has
largely contributed to the country's comprehensive overseas
payment capacity. It has also laid a relatively solid foundation
for continuing the reforms, and has helped to inspire foreign
investors' confidence in the country's economic development.

BRUSSELS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
recorded a trade deficit of 2.9 billion ECUs (3.8 billion
U.S. dollars) with the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The deficit followed two years of favorable balances in 1994
and 1993.
</P>
<P>
Despite the reversal, the ratio of the EU's exports over
imports with NAFTA, which includes the United States, Canada and
Mexico, has improved significantly since 1990. Then, the EU was
7.3 billion ECUs (about 9.5 billion dollars) in the red with
NAFTA, Eurostat (the EU's statistics body) said today.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat said trade between the EU and NAFTA was "extremely"
important, with about 20 percent of the EU's trade dealing with
the U.S., Canada and Mexico in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The EU had trade imbalances of 7.4 billion ECUs (about 9.6
billion dollars) and 5.5 billion ECUs (about 7.2 billion dollars)

<HEADLINE> China to Carry on Anti-corruption in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China will step up the fight
against corruption in the new year, based on the nationwide
achievements made in 1996, a ranking Communist Party official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, secretary of the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
called for more supervision to be enforced among Party members,
and more supervision over Party members by the masses of people.
</P>
<P>
Hard work and thriftiness should be carried forward, and the
corrupt practice of spending public money lavishly must be
stopped, said Wei, also a member of the Political Bureau of the
CPC Central Committee, at the commission's eighth plenary session
which opened today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is essential to build up an army of high-quality
and competent officials to oversee disciplinary inspection, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Wei's report at the meeting, China has carried out
countrywide inspections of illegal activities concerning cars,
housing and abuse of public funds for personal use among some
Communist Party members and government officials. And officials
have been required to report their income and to turn in the gifts
they receive.
</P>
<P>
From January to November last year, a total of 116,000 people
were disciplined in accordance with reports from the masses, an
increase of 14.3 percent over the same period in 1995. And some
key cases have been solved.
</P>
<P>
However, Wei Jianxing pointed out that corruption remains a
serious problem, and some officials are not yet fully aware of the
importance of the anti-corruption campaign.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Promises to Improve Beijing's Investment Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Acting Mayor Jia
Qinglin promised today to improve the capital city's investment
environment for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with senior employees from some 20 international
companies, Jia said that the municipal government will work to
better serve the needs of overseas investors, and that some
preferential policies will be created to attract more foreign
funds and technology.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing has decided to select the hi-tech sector as its new
growth measure of the economy, so preference will be given to
those involved in such industries as electronic information,
biological engineering and new medicines," he said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is now the regional headquarters of over 70
multinational companies. More than 6,000 overseas companies have
offices in the city.
</P>
<P>
According to the mayor, this plus the available talent and the
favorable policies will give the city full room to develop
cooperation with foreign businesses.
</P>
<P>
Last year, as many as 279 international companies opened
offices in Beijing, adding the total direct foreign investment of
the year to more than 19.7 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Personally I believe Beijing is one of the best places in the
world to develop business, as its economy has been growing so fast
during the past years," said Aldo Saluador, the general manager of
France's Phone-Poulenc China Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The representative from AT&AMP;T China Inc. also showed his
satisfaction with the cooperation shown by Beijing. "We have
always been interested in investing in Beijing," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Crime Rate Down in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Crime dropped in Ukraine in 1996
for the first time since the nation won its independence from the
former Soviet Union in 1991, Deputy Internal Affairs Minister
Leonid Borodych said today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the internal ministry showed the overall number
of crimes dropped by four percent in 1996, and crimes classified
as "serious" by seven percent.
</P>
<P>
But Borodych spoke with reserve about the ministry's
performance. "It's still too early to call the performance of the
police satisfactory," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that fewer than 30 percent of the 500 murders had been
solved. Police were still searching for answers in two of the past
year's high profile crimes: the attempted assassination of Prime
Minister Pavel Lazarenko in July, and the murder of politician and
businessman Evhen Scherban in Donetsk, in November.
</P>
<P>
"Scherban's murder would be solved," Borodych added. He refused
to comment on recent reports in the media linking Scherban's
murder with that of American businessman Paul Tatum in Moscow in
November.
</P>
<P>
Internal Affairs Minister Yuri Kravchenko raised concern last
December about increased crime in certain areas. The number of
kidnappings tripled last year, and organized crime groups doubled
in size.
</P>
<P>
"The number of economic crimes grew to 60,000 in 1996, for
which more than 68,000 people were tried, including more than
2,000 government officials," said Kravchenko.
</P>
<P>
He said the effectiveness of the police was limited by outdated
equipment and a general lack of funds, especially when dealing
with well-financed criminals with access to advanced weapons and
high-tech communication devices.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Legislator: Reality Favors Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Tolbah al-Sanea, Arab member of
the Israeli Knesset (parliament), said that the political reality
of the Middle East peace process is going forward towards the
establishment of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
In an interview this morning with Voice of Arab radio, he said
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu' threats to occupy the
West Bank if the establishment of the Palestinian state is
announced were a mere attempt to win bargains with the Palestinian
Authority in their future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"He is jockeying for concessions from the Palestinian side in
other directions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu seeks to keep this issue as a trump card in
negotiations with the aim of attaining political gain in return
for a recognition of the Palestinian state, Sanea told the
Cairo-based radio.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want to establish their own independent state
with East Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has reportedly vowed to reoccupy the West Bank, which
Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East War and is handing
over to the Palestinians through phased pullbacks, if a
Palestinian state is established.
</P>
<P>
According to the Israeli legislator, Netanyahu is keen to
activate the Syrian-Israeli track, underlining the need to create
a political reality in this connection, a matter that is related
to political future of the Israeli premier.

Netanyahu said he enjoys now enough support inside Israel to
conclude a peace agreement with the Palestinians by the year 2000
without resorting to holding a referendum in this respect.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, final status talks, which will

The PA now controls the Gaza Strip and seven West Bank cities
handed over by Israel under several agreements signed since

In an interview with British daily Times which was also carried

Israeli troop pullback from Hebron showed a possibility of
"achieving balance between the Palestinians' need to manage their
own affairs and Israel's need to protect its security and
interests."

<P>
The Israeli premier also expressed his hope for reaching peace
agreements with Syria and Lebanon, according to the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu refused to swap the Syrian Golan Heights for a peace
treaty and normalization of ties with Syria which insists on
restarting talks where they ended and on the basis of

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Plays Important Role in Disaster-Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Red Cross Society
has efficiently helped people all over the country survive the
earthquakes, fires, floods and other disasters in the past year,
an official with the society said today.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 million people in 27 provinces, autonomous
regions and cities in China were directly affected by natural
disasters in 1996, with over 100 billion yuan (about 12 billion Us
dollars) of economic loss, said Sun Baiqiu, vice-chairman of the
society.
</P>
<P>
The society has sent 17 groups of relief workers to
disaster-struck areas, including quake-hit Yunnan Province in the
southwest, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region where
devastating fires broke out. Workers distributed the relief goods,
prevented the spread of epidemics and raised funds, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Red Cross is always set to cooperate with the
International Red Cross and Red Cross societies overseas, she said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, it collected 5.4 million Swiss francs of international
donations for 12 disaster-hit provinces and autonomous regions in
China.
</P>
<P>
It also helped the Hong Kong Red Cross to carry out an aid
project, involving 18.7 million yuan (about 2.3 million US
dollars), in the country, and received disaster-relief goods worth
24 million yuan (about 2.9 million US dollars) from the Taiwan Red
Cross Society, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent post-disaster epidemics, the society has sent 62,540
medical workers to the most heavily-affected areas. There they
have treated more than 3.8 million patients, disinfected drinking
water and sanitized the local environments, she said.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Goals on Foreign Exchange Issue in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China's 1997 goals for the
country's administration of foreign exchange include the
implementation of a new law on import payments that goes
into effect on March 1.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Xiaochuan, Director of the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange (SAFE), said today at a national conference attended by
chiefs of provincial branches of SAFE, that on March 1, with the
adoption of the law known as the Provisional Regulations on
Supervision and Administration on Payments of Imports, SAFE will
be responsible for verification of payments for imports.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, verifications have been handled by designated
foreign exchange banks.
</P>
<P>
The new rule is aimed at establishing a supervisional mechanism
for the payments for imports under current accounts, Zhou said,
adding that this will ensure the authenticity of the payments and
the orderly implementation of the policy to make RMB yuan
convertible under current accounts.
</P>
<P>
The new law will standardize the payments for imports by
importers and the designated banks, and it will also prevent the
transfer of foreign exchange from the current accounts to capital
accounts, which may disturb the financial market, he said.
</P>
<P>
The regulations will be of great significance to the foreign
exchange administration after the adoption of the convertible RMB
yuan under current accounts, Zhou stressed, adding that it will
also have positive effects on China's foreign trade sector.
</P>
<P>
SAFE has made 1997 its year of administration and research on
the country's foreign exchange sector, Zhou noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, he said, China will start a comprehensive statistical
study of international incomes and payments, and strengthen the
analysis and forecasts of them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will try to improve the utilization of foreign
funds, strengthen the regulation on the general supply and demand
of foreign exchange under capital accounts, gradually carry out
the long- and medium-term administration on outstanding foreign
loans, and support the reforms of large and medium-sized
state-owned enterprises, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country will further improve its management and
administration on foreign exchange reserve, standardize and
develop the interbank foreign exchange market, and maintain the
stable operation of the foreign exchange market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that China will continue its moderately-tight
financial and currency policies and that the domestic demands will
be under effective control.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that this year China will see an overall evening
out between imports and exports and a sound tendency in direct
foreign investment, as well as balanced international incomes and
payments with some surplus, and a basically stable exchange rate
of RMB yuan.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Calls for More Public Housing Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The best path to follow for
China's urban housing reform lies in the establishment of a public
housing fund system and a consummate housing market, Vice-Premier
Zhu Rongji said.
</P>
<P>
At a recent national conference on housing reform, Zhu said
that the masses of people face the immediate need to improve their
living conditions, and housing funds have to be raised from the
state, businesses or institutions and individuals.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, housing is provided free of charge to individual
residents by government departments, state-owned enterprises or
social institutions. But the introduction of a market economy has
inevitably driven housing to the market.
</P>
<P>
The public housing fund system demands that individuals turn in
a certain portion of their income, their work units set aside
supportive funds, and at the same time the state gives financial
assistance.
</P>
<P>
In this way, steady and low-cost housing funds can be made
available, Zhu said. The practice in some places proves that the
method is effective in promoting the construction of more urban
housing.
</P>
<P>
He urged officials at various government levels to step up the
collection of housing funds and strengthen their management.
</P>
<P>
Through in-depth reforms and stricter macro-control over the
past three years, China's national economy has maintained a rapid
growth rate, and inflation has been curbed. It is high time to
speed up housing reform to provide low-priced houses to the
people, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, marketable houses can help boost the growth of some
related industries, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He urged governments at all levels, urban construction units in
particular, to offer preferential policies concerning land use and
the collection of housing taxes and other fees. In addition, he
noted, profitable construction companies must also shoulder the
responsibility of building a certain proportion of low-priced
houses.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, China has launched a "comfortable
living program" in some cities by way of favorable banking loans
and related government policies, but the shortage of funds has
remained a problem.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the two methods will be combined, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Rural Economy Enjoys All-Round Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China's rural economy made
laudable progress in 1996, with both the grain output and the net
income of farmers hitting an all-time high, a national conference
on rural economy was told.
</P>
<P>
The total grain output exceeded 480 billion kilograms in 1996,
an increase of 13.5 billion kilograms from 1995.
</P>
<P>
The per capita net income of farmers rose to 1,900 yuan (229 US
dollars) last year, up eight percent from 1995, thanks to the
bigger harvest.
</P>
<P>
The output of sugar crops, tobacco and most of the other cash
crops has increased, while the output of cotton and oil-bearing
crops decreased due to the bad weather and less market demand.
</P>
<P>
The country's agriculture also saw steady growth in the animal
husbandry and aquatic products industries in 1996, with a total
meat output of 58 million tons, and 28 million tons of aquatic
products.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4.6 million hectares of newly-forested land
illustrates the development of China's forestry last year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese township enterprises are expected to turn out a total
of 7,600 billion yuan (507 billion US dollars) in 1996, up 19.6
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
About 134 million people are involved in the flourishing
business run by township enterprises last year, an increase of 5.4
million as against the figure of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The project to aid the needy in rural areas has produced
good results. The average per capita income of farmers in 592 poor
areas around the country was estimated at nearly 1,000 yuan last
year, up 180 yuan over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Another seven million needy have been provided with enough food
and clothing.

between the two central banking institutions has been signed.
</P>
<P>
The agreement with the BOK is the HKMA's ninth such agreement.
The HKMA has earlier signed bilateral repo agreements with central
banks from Australia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
A bilateral repo agreement is a simultaneous agreement to buy
securities for an agreed amount of cash and to sell back the same
securities at a specific later date for a specified amount.
Highly liquid U.S. dollar government securities are the
instruments used in all the repo agreements signed between the
HKMA and regional central banks.
</P>
<P>
Entering these well secured agreements with central banks,
whose credit standings is generally higher than those of private
sector banks, would improve the liquidity of the central banks
under minimal risk.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Offer Conditional Ceasefire to Opponents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
today offered a conditional ceasefire to its opponents, according
to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's acting Information Minister Amir Muttaqi was
quoted as saying they have only two conditions to a ceasefire:
First it wants exchange of prisoners of war and second it wants
the opposition alliance to bow to the will of the Taliban rule.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi said the opposition must not use any truce to
strengthen its military position.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire offer came after the conclusion of intra Afghan
dialogues between the anti-Taliban alliance in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic student militia, who now control more than two
thirds of the Afghan territory, boycotted the Tehran meeting on
the grounds that Iran was not a neutral body.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran parley asked an immediate ceasefire only if the
Taliban agreed to share power with the anti-Taliban alliance
including former Afghan military chief Ahmad Masood and northern
warlord Roshid Dostum.
</P>
<P>
"There will be peace in Afghanistan only if they accept the
Taliban," said Muttaqi.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi made it clear that the Taliban, which imposes a strict
version of Islam, were not ready to share power with any hostile
factions.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have inflicted major defeats on the joint forces of
Masood and Dostum during last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The student militia said it had pushed towards the Panjsher
valley, stronghold of Masood, asked the civilians to leave
Gulbahar, about 100 kilometers north of Kabul and gate way to the
Panjsher valley.

<HEADLINE> China Defends Rapidly-Growing Foreign Exchange Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- It's a correct policy choice
for China's central bank to purchase surplus hard currencies to
stabilize the exchange rate of the Renminbi yuan, a senior
financial official said today.
</P>
<P>
"It may not be the only correct policy combination to actively
attract foreign capital, stabilize the exchange rate and increase
hard currency reserves," conceded Zhou Xiaochuan, director of the
State Administration of Foreign Exchange.
</P>
<P>
"But right now it's a correct policy for China, in view of a
sustained and robust capital influx," Zhou told a national meeting
attended by heads of grassroots foreign exchange administrations.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, has been buying
surplus foreign exchange from the market since China overhauled
its foreign exchange system in 1994, to stop the yuan from
appreciating too much.
</P>
<P>
The policy maneuver has resulted in a rapidly-growing foreign
exchange reserve, which reached 105 billion US dollars by the end
of last year, up from 21.2 billion US dollars at the end of 1993
and 73.56 billion US dollars at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zhou acknowledged that an opportunity cost exists for China to
hold such a large foreign exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
"But such a large amount of hard currency reserve has greatly
lifted China's overall national strength and its viability for
international payments," Zhou noted.
</P>
<P>
It has also created a solid base for China to deepen reforms
and open wider to the rest of the world, and bolstered public
confidence in the Chinese economy, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
"These invisible benefits far outweigh the measurable and
visible costs," he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged foreign exchange administration agents to improve
foreign exchange operations and be more aware of exchange risks.
</P>
<P>
"You should study the international market more earnestly and
closely follow the changes in foreign exchange supply and demand,
in order to be able to readjust the currency, asset and maturity
structure of our country's foreign exchange reserves at a proper
time," Zhou told the meeting participants.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, the central bank governor, claimed that China
successfully handled the relationship between an increase in hard
currency reserves and the effort to curb money supply and
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Despite an increase of more than 30 billion US dollars in
China's foreign exchange last year, the central bank's discount
loans to the four state-owned commercial banks dropped by 60
billion yuan, he said, adding that the 6.1 percent growth rate of
the retail price index was well below last year's target of 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the term structure of China's foreign exchange
reserves was reasonable and the return on the hard currencies was
fairly good, Dai noted.
</P>
<P>
The country's four state-owned commercial banks are the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of
China, the Bank of China, and the China Construction Bank.

<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China's first assembly line for
CDMA (code diversion multiple accesses) products, the
new-generation mobile telecommunications mode, has gone into
operation in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based Science and Technology Daily said that the
production line was built at Hangzhou Motorola Mobile Telephone
System Ltd., a Sino-Motorola joint venture, and will be able to

<P>
CDMA is the most advanced mobile telecommunications mode in the
world in term of its transmission capacity and frequency use rate.
It is believed to be a potential substitute to the present GSM
(global service for mobile communication) standard.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has launched two pilot CDMA networks in Fujian
and Guangdong Provinces, based on equipment from Motorola and
Lucent Technologies, the former network and system business of

<HEADLINE> Achievements In China's Desert Control Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU January 27 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved successes in
its drive to control the spread of the country's extensive deserts.
</P>
<P>
It has staged 12 training courses for foreign countries and
trained more than 150 foreign experts in desert control.
</P>
<P>
One-sixth of China's landmass is covered by deserts, widely
located in the country's northern, northwestern, and part of the
northeastern regions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches much importance to desert
control efforts, bringing the ecological project in line with the
state economic and social development plan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted three comprehensive
surveys on deserts areas in 1950s, which laid a solid foundation
for working out an anti-desertification plan.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of survey results, Chinese researchers set up 16
research and demonstration zones in different biological and
climatic regions, finding out various ways to control desert
spread and a researching anti-desertification technologies.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have worked out an anti-desertification system
for a section of railway line, which links China's north region
with its northwest region and runs across a large moving desert
area of the Tengger Desert. The system has fixed the moving desert
effectively and promoted the transformation of sand into land.
</P>
<P>
A 400-km highway has also been constructed in the Taklimakan
Desert, the world's second largest desert.
</P>
<P>
The anti-desertification system has ensured the smooth traffic
of the highway.
</P>
<P>
Progress has also been made in improving the environment of
desert areas. A green belt covering an area of more than 40 square
kilometers has been established in Linzhe County in the southern
end of the Badain Jaran Desert, which has enhanced the local grain
production to 15 tons per hectare, and the research results have
been widely applied in the Hexi Corridor areas.
</P>
<P>
China's advanced technologies have made the development of
desert resources feasible. Using underground water in irrigation,
the researchers have produced thousands of kilograms of vegetables
in the hinterland of the Taklimakan Desert, and with plastic film
for covering young plants, they planted watermelons and
muskmelons in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, formerly facing a scarcity of fresh aquatic
products, now has surplus to send to inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1996, the region sent out 2,000 tons of
aquatic products to other areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region, with average annual raindrop of less
than 147 mm, is one of the most drought hit areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the past, local residents could seldom find fresh aquatic
products on the market, as such products usually came from coastal
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid 1980s when the local government first eased the
control on aquatic products, the aquaculture industry has
witnessed rapid development.
</P>
<P>
Cities and prefectures in the region began to list fish
breeding as a priority in the strategy for the development of a
"vegetable basket", and to improve the living standards of local
residents. Inland farmers also rushed into the region to join the
efforts pushed by potential profits.
</P>
<P>
The aquatic products breeding area in the region has reached
73,000 hectares, generating some 50,000 tons of the products last
year.

NEW DELHI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The consternation over
foreign direct investment (FDI) has kept India as a marginal
player among the developing world, Industry Secretary N. Mohanty
said.

foreign investment, the industry secretary said, "we need to make
up our minds whether we need FDI or not. If some people have
doubts, government should take a majority view."

"India is not focused on FDI like China," he added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Denies Expelling Burundi Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
denied Tanzania has expelled refugees to Burundi, thus resulting
in their being killed after their return home.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa made the denial after a local paper last Saturday
claimed that Mkapa had pledged to officials of Amnesty
International that Tanzania would not repeat forced repatriation
of Burundians since 122 out of 126 returned refugees had been
killed by the Burundi army.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Daily News today, State House
spokesman Patrick Chokala said here on Sunday that Mkapa told the
Amnesty International delegation last week that none of the
refugees had been expelled from this country.
</P>
<P>
They decided to return home on a voluntary basis, said the
Tanzanian president.
</P>
<P>
In the conversation, the spokesman said, Mkapa informed the
delegation that Burundi refugees in Tanzania had the option of
asking the United Nations High Commission for refugees to find
them another country of asylum other than Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"But they decided to return to Burundi, on their own free
will," he said, adding, "forceful repatriation of refugees is not
part of Tanzania's policy."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted Tanzania started accommodating refugees in
1959 and has an excellent record in its treatment of refugees,
acclaimed world-wide. Even in the case of Rwandan refugees, he
stressed, those returning home were doing so also voluntarily.

<P>
 of Occupants
</P>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The world's tallest
building -- Malaysia's Petronas Twin Towers -- today received its
first batch of occupants -- 166 Petronas employees.
</P>
<P>
The employees from the central administrative unit and
Property Management Services Company Ltd. of the National
Petroleum Corporation moved in to occupy the 15th and 16th floors
of the 88-storeyed building with a height of 451.9 meters from the
street level.
</P>
<P>
One of the employees, who has served Petronas for 13 years,
said she was proud of being among the first to occupy the building
which has a futuristic design.
</P>
<P>
She said she was confident that the building was safe although
there had been negative claims about the safety.
</P>
<P>
Another employee said all her fears disappeared the moment she
set foot in the building.
</P>
<P>
Petronas Human Resources Vice-President Nordin Hassan
described at a reception the move-in as "historic" both for
Petronas and its staff as they would be occupying the world's
tallest building.
</P>
<P>
A Petronas spokesman said although the building had 88
storeys, only 86 floors could be occupied.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the 5,000-odd employees of Petronas and its
subsidiaries are expected to move into the building in stages by
August.
</P>
<P>
The 88-storey building, whose construction was started in
September, 1992, was completed at the end of last year. Its two
towers, each with an area of 218,000 square meters, are linked at
the 41st and 42nd floors by a skybridge and the building has
Islamic geometric features designed by world-renowned architect
Cesar Pelli.
</P>
<P>
Each tower has 29 double deck high speed passenger lifts.
</P>
<P>
The building is part of the 1 billion ringgit (about 400
million US dollars) Kuala Lumpur City Center (KLCC) integrated
project which is being developed.
</P>
<P>
The building is higher by 8.9 meters than the Sears Towers in
Chicago, United States, which were previously the world's tallest
buildings.
</P>
<P>
The twin towers are expected to be officially opened at the
end of this year.

<HEADLINE> HK-Mainland Cross-Border Cooperation Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong official said
today that effective cooperation on cross-border issues with
Guangdong Province has helped cut Hong Kong's general crime rate.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Nicholas Ng said that the
crime rate for Hong Kong in 1996, the lowest for the past 15
years, was partly attributable to the effective co-operation
established over the years between law enforcement officers on
both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
Ng is currently in Guangzhou heading a high-level delegation to
attend the 17th Annual Border Liaison Review Meeting, which was
concluded early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting as "very useful and productive," Ng said
both sides endorsed the functions of the Border Liaison System and
recognized the need to maintain an effective system for liaison
and co-operation on such issues as smuggling, illegal immigration
and cross border traffic.
</P>
<P>
"The System, established in 1981, has provided a good basis and
foundation for further co-operation between Hong Kong and
Guangdong and its continued development is vital to the economic
prosperity and social stability of both sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was encouraged by the 22 percent decline in
cross-border smuggling activities last year compared with figures
in 1995. Theft of cars and container tractors also dropped by 43
percent and 56 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had reaffirmed their commitment in the fight
against illegal immigration activities and had agreed to step up
border patrols to curb smuggling of illegal immigrants, he said.

<HEADLINE> Flood Prevention Projects Beefed Up in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The ability to prevent and fight
floods has been greatly strengthened in southeast China's Fujian
Province, which frequently falls victim to natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government worked out a plan to fight natural
adversities in the late 1990s, according to Chen Guoliang, director
of the Provincial Department of Water Resources and Electric Power.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the governments of China and Japan have jointly
spent 220 million yuan building a flood alarm system on the
Minjiang River, the largest river in the province.
</P>
<P>
The system, the largest of its kind in China, became
operational before the flood season last year. The system's 98
monitoring stations cover an area of over 30,000 square kilometers
and quickly reflect rainfall and water levels in the area.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, 4,800-kilometers of standard dykes will be
built along the river and coastal areas in the province. The
enhancing of 1,008-km of coastal dykes was completed late last
year, costing 730 million yuan from both government and unofficial
sources.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2.4 billion yuan will be spent on enhancing or
building dams along the rivers across the province. The provincial
financial department has arranged 40 million yuan for the project
this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 78 reservoirs are under construction, involving an
investment of 3.8 billion yuan. There are now 2,896 reservoirs in
the province.

<HEADLINE> High, New Technology Sector Becomes Industrial Pillar in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- in southern Shenzhen's high
and new technology sector has turned out more than 30 billion yuan
in output value, becoming a pillar of the economy in the south
China city adjacent to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It accounted for 24 percent of Shenzhen's industrial production
last year, growing by 33 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen in Guangdong province aims to boost the output value
of its high and new technology sector to 60 billion yuan by the
year 2000, or 35 percent of its industrial production.
</P>
<P>
The city at present boasts four high and new technology
developments, with 11 major businesses in the sector achieving an
output value over 18.4 billion yuan last year, making up over 60
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment has played a vital role in development of
the local high and new technology, as evidenced by the fact that
all the 69 "enterprises with advanced technologies" recognized by
the local authorities recently were Sino-overseas joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The electronic industry is one of the most successful in using
overseas funds in the sector.
</P>
<P>
With 18 consortia and multinationals such as Hitachi, IBM,
COMPAQ, Samsung, and Siemens investing in the industry, a
well-developed electronics industry has been established in
Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Boss Complains About Financial Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Environmental Program
(UNEP) boss today complained about financial snags which she said
have hintered the implementation of its programs.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 19th session of the UNEP Governing Council
which opened here this morning, UNEP Executive Director Elizabeth
Dowdeswell said some programs approved at the 18th session cannot
be implemented as financial commitments have not been realized.
</P>
<P>
She told the two-week meeting that last year 18 states reduced
their contributions to the UNEP and three of them were major
contributors.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP boss stressed that whenever a decision is taken
jointly to pursue programs, full financing must be guaranteed and
secured.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Key western donors such as Japan, the
United States, Britain, France and Italy were reluctant to pay,
arguing that the UNEP set up in 1972 has become less effective
since the 1992 Earth Summit.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP budget dropped from 160 million U.S. Dollars in
1991-92 program to 105 million Dollars for 1996-97, but only 62.5
million was contributed by donors.
</P>
<P>
After listing a series of achievements in the past year,
Dowdeswell complained that "many view the UNEP as an organization
that has been marginalized over the years, losing much of its
credibility."
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that many of the difficulties experienced by
the UNEP are "stemming from factors that lie outside the scope of
the organization's immediate management control".
</P>
<P>
It is believed that financial difficulties facing the U.N.
environmental agency and structural reforms of the organization
will dominate the current session which takes place every two
years.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Use Vote Counting Machines in Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Commission on
Elections (Comelec) will use vote counting machines in the 1998
general elections, Comelec officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Comelec Regional Director Felimon Asperin said the Comelec made
this decision under a law approved last year by Congress, which
stipulates the use of automated counting machines starting in
1998.
</P>
<P>
He said the government needs to spend some 900 million pesos
(34.4 million U.S. dollars) for buying such counting machines made
by an American firm for the more than 1,400 towns in the country.
</P>
<P>
Asperin said under the new counting system, voters will no
longer write the names of the candidates. They will only need to
blacken the oval space opposite the names of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
The new counting system will avoid spelling errors and assure
faster voting, he said, adding that it will help guarantee clean
and honest election as the machine will reject any fake ballot.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Comelec Regional Director Dominador Micu said vote
counting machines might be pilot-tested in some cities and towns
in local elections this May.

MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific Parliamentary
Forum (APPF) has accepted the Philippines' proposal to include the
anti-corruption issue in the agenda of its sixth annual meeting in
Seoul next year.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Senate majority leader Francisco Tatad said today
the 22-nation APPF will discuss the ways of combating official
corruption as proposed by Philippine delegates to the
just-concluded fifth APPF annual meeting in Canada.
</P>
<P>
"Rising corruption is not the only problem. More serious than
that is the growing public apathy and indifference to corruption,"
said Tatad, who headed the Philippine team to the APPF meeting in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Tatad said the APPF meeting in Seoul "is probably the first
that official corruption and its effects on democracy and
development will be discussed in an international parliamentary
forum."
</P>
<P>
Official corruption has received very little attention in
international conferences despite its increasing adverse effects
on trade and investment, democracy and development as well as
national security, Tatad said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Turkey Wants Israeli Help in Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- When Europe and the United
States hesitate to sell weapons to Turkey, Ankara turns to Israel
for help in its defense modernization, the Jerusalem Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The English daily quoted General Sitki Orun, technical adviser
to the Turkish Armed Forces Foundation, as announcing the request in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
Turkey needs Israeli contractors to fulfill its plan of 150
billion U.S. dollars over the next 25 years to modernize the
military. This includes new battle tanks, helicopters, jets and
ships, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This year most of the countries are decreasing military
budgets, but not Turkey," he said. The military budget has been
increased from 9 percent to 11 percent of the Turkish government
budget, according to Orun.
</P>
<P>
Orun complained that European countries and the United States
have hesitated selling weapons to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Belgium canceled a weapons sale, following
a Norwegian arms embargo on Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department has been hesitating to grant an
export license for the AHIW Super Cobra attack helicopters
because of congressional concerns of Turkey's campaign against
rebel Kurds.
</P>
<P>
"If Belgium does not give us the weapons, we'll buy it from
some place else," Orun said. "These types of developments are to
the benefit of Israel."
</P>
<P>
Orun will be conducting meetings Monday and Tuesday in
efforts to recruit Israeli companies to participate in Turkey's
Defense Industry and Civil Aviation Fair in September. The fair is
sponsored by the government defense holding company Turkish Armed
Forces Foundation, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish general said that his government will examine the
Israel-made Merkava tank as part of its program to produce 800
battle tanks in a deal estimated at 3.2 billion dollars. Ankara
plans to begin co-production of a new type of tanks after the year
2000, preferring this to outright acquisition.
</P>
<P>
Orun said that another area Israel can participate in is that
of patrol and assault boats. Turkey is planning on acquiring 45
frigates, patrol ships and missile boats in its modernization
program.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been severely criticized by Arab countries and
Iran for signing a military cooperation pact with Israel last
year. The new Turkish Islamic government has watered down its
ties with the Jewish state since taking office.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey has also come under harsh criticisms from the
European Union and the U.S. over its threats against Cyprus
following the island state's announcement to purchase Russian
missiles.
</P>
<P>
In view of the developments, Turkey is apparently attempting to
diversify its sources of arms acquisition, observers noted.

<HEADLINE> Experts Concern About Unemployment in Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli business leaders has
cautioned the government to deal properly with unemployment in
implementing its ambitious privatization plan.
</P>
<P>
Iscar Ltd. Chairman Stef Wertheimer told the English daily
The Jerusalem Post that the caution was needed to perform the
privatization process so as not to worry the work force.
</P>
<P>
Wertheimer's remarks came after the Prime Minister's Office
announced recently the sketchy details of the first group of
companies it hoped to sell during its term in office.
</P>
<P>
The privatization program should have been implemented two
years ago, but due to the concern about mass unemployment
the process might cause, the previous Labor government,
which maintained good relations with workers, failed to carry out
the plan.
</P>
<P>
Dan Propper, Chairman of Manufacturers Association, said that
if the Labor government had finished the privatization process
when the economy was at a stage of rapid growth, all those
losing their jobs would have been easily absorbed.
</P>
<P>
But now the economy was slowing down, and possibly heading
toward recession, so there could be problems for the work
force, namely a large increase in unemployment, Propper added.
</P>
<P>
He proposed a solution for the government: change the
monetary policy by the Bank of Israel so to spur economic
growth, which in turn would lead to heightened job creation.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector has been urging the central bank to
lower interest rates, but was refused at a time when the
government is implementing a belt-tightening economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Leah Achdut, Director of Histadrut (Israel's General Trade
Union) Institute of Social and Economic Research, urged the
government to sit with employers and workers to decide
on the privatization method that will be of benefit to most
people.
</P>
<P>
The privatization plan has already caused widespread protests
from the labor camp, leading to several Histadrut-sponsored
nationwide strikes that have caused the economy dearly.

CANBERRA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Carl Lewis, nine time Olympic
gold medallist failed Monday at his first-ever grand prix
athletics meeting in Sydney, Australia.

Lewis, 35, finished equal seventh in the 100 meters race behind
Australia's Steve Brimacombe at the Homebush stadium, his similar

Brimacombe won the race with a time of 10.37 seconds, with
Lewis hitting the finish line with Australian Olympian Dean
Capobianco in 10.56 secs.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu province, east China,
has made an actual use of 21.4 billion U.S. dollars worth of
foreign funds, ranking second after Guangdong province in south
China.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed the success to the province's
efforts in improving the investment environment by investing
heavily in infrastructure. Jiangsu also adapted the province's
economic operations to international common practice by
implementing a modern enterprise system and economic globalization
strategy.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 alone, foreign investors paid in 5.56 billion
U.S. dollars in various projects they started in the east China
province, up 4.8 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Governments at local levels have made efforts to adjust the
foreign investment structure, and directed foreign funds to basic
industries, while having seen a decrease in moderate and small
processing industrial projects and a rise in large projects with
comparatively high technological contents.
</P>
<P>
Contracts involving an agreed use of 140 million U.S. dollars
of foreign funds have been signed for development of agricultural
projects, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
The province has won nine foreign-governmental loans, most of
which are given in support of construction of infrastructure and
social public projects.
</P>
<P>
Large state-owned enterprises in the province succeeded in
raising funds, by floating shares on domestic and overseas
bourses, according to the officials.

<P>
MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors have decided
to use the Japanese bullet train technology to build a railway in
the southern Philippines, government officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Hatimil Hassan, deputy chairman of the Southern Philippines'
Council for Peace and Development, said that with the Japanese
technology, the railway on Mindanao Island will be "comparable

<P>
He said a feasibility study for the railway system will be
completed by the middle of February.
</P>
<P>
According to Hassan, a transnational consortium comprising
Malaysian, Spanish, Australia and Indonesian investors has
initially put up 200 billion pesos (7.6 billion U.S. dollars) for
the project.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said a group of Japanese investors have also expressed
keen interest in joining the consortium.
</P>
<P>
The Mindanao railway project, which has already been approved
by the government, will link most provinces on the island and
provide cheap transport for both commuters and goods.

LUSKA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) will not allow its members to indefinitely
continue to be members of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA), "the post" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian newspaper quoted SADC Information Officer
Kgoesinki Moesi as saying that member states holding the dual
membership will not be allowed as this will hinder SADC's smooth
operations.
</P>
<P>
He also denied a possible merger of the two regional bodies,
saying, "we want to develop a common market and merging is not an
answer."
</P>
<P>
As to the recent decision to withdraw from the COMESA by
Lesotho and Mozambique, Moesi said the two countries are just
implementing an undertaking they made two years ago to choose
between the two institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Time will come when a deadline will be set to force members
to decide which organization they want to belong to," he added.
</P>
<P>
Of 12 SADC members, only Botswana and South Africa are not
members of the 20-member COMESA.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed Up Technical Development to Protect Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China is to invest 500 million
yuan annually to develop environmental technology in the last few
years of this century, equaling the total of the Eighth Five-Year
Plan period (1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Ye Ruqiu, deputy director of the State
Bureau of Environment Protection, today at a press conference to
give details of the "'97 China Environment Forum".
</P>
<P>
Ye said that enterprises in China should become another source
of investment in the development of environmental technology,
instead of depending on funds from the government.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis should be put on technical research to harness
industrial pollution by the year 2000, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Major polluted areas, such as the rivers of Huaihe, Haihe, and
Liaohe, and the lakes of Taihu, Chaohu, and Dianchi, are badly in
need of advanced technology to eliminate pollution, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
According to a blueprint by the State Bureau of Environment
Protection, China expects to bring the aggravating tendency in
environmental protection and ecological destruction basically
under control by the end of this century. Improvement will be
achieved in the environmental quality of cities and regions.
</P>
<P>
The "97 Environment Forum" is the first international
environment symposium sponsored by non-government organizations in
China, focusing on research into the coordinated development of
the country's economy, social progress, and environmental
protection.

valley, 70 kilometers northwest of Kabul, Radio Shariat in Kabul
reported.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was aired on Sunday and could not be
independently confirmed, said about 2,000 opposing soldiers had
defected.
</P>
<P>
The capture of the Ghorband valley gives the Taliban an easier
route to advance into the northern provinces controlled by warlord
Rashid Dostum and former military chief Ahmad Massood.
</P>
<P>
The direct route to northern Afghanistan through the Salang
Tunnel is controlled by Dostum's troops and is a difficult area to
penetrate.
</P>
<P>
The Salang Tunnel is the final gateway through the Hindu Kushi
mountains to his northern stronghold.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban now control roughly two-thirds of the country,
while the opposition forces control the northern one-third.

ANKARA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy are to
visit Turkey next month to discuss the Middle East peace process
and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to be in Ankara a few days after the
Ramadan holiday in mid-February at the invitation of Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel, local newspaper Daily News reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Levy will be the first Israeli foreign minister to visit
Ankara, at the invitation of his Turkish counterpart Tansu
Ciller, since the Islamist Welfare Party (RP) led by Necmettin
Erbakan came to power last year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has said that his
government would make efforts to strengthen its relations with
Turkey.
</P>

With the signing of several economic and military training
agreements between the two countries, Turkish-Israeli ties saw
notable progress last year, but the developments also created
uneasiness among Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu's Foreign Trade Surges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
recorded 19.9 billion U.S. dollars worth of imports and exports
in 1996, up more than a fifth over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Exports made up 13.1 billion U.S. dollars, a rise of 13.8
percent over 1995 and 12.34 percentage points higher than the
national average, making Jiangsu China's third largest exporter.
Imports were worth 6.77 billion U.S. dollars, up 35.13 percent.
</P>
<P>
The fast growth in foreign trade was made possible because the
province intensified its efforts to break the monopoly of foreign
trade by state and provincial foreign trade professional
companies, and encouraged enthusiasm in foreign trade services.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, all 13 cities directly administered by
the provincial government and 64 counties and county-level cities
have been given the authority to manage foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers with fine conditions have also been given the
autonomy to handle imports and exports, and directly participate
in international trade, which has in turn helped improve operation
vitality and competitiveness of the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 502 large and medium-sized enterprises
had been given the authority to directly manage imports and exports.
The enterprises exported 1.33 billion U.S. dollars of commodities
last year, a rise of 38.5 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu now has more than 30,000 foreign-backed enterprises
which are also playing a leading role in boosting the province's
exports.
</P>
<P>
They exported 5.5 billion U.S. dollars worth of commodities in
1996, up 34 percent over 1995, and accounting for one quarter of
the province's total export volume for 1996.
</P>
<P>
While encouraging more economic entities to participate in
foreign trade, the province has also paid close attention to the
quality of export commodities and the economic benefits of foreign
trade companies.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the ratio of certification of
export commodities for inspection last year was 99 percent, and
from January to November last year foreign trade firms earned
32.13 million yuan (one U.S. dollars equals to 8.3 Chinese yuan)
in profits.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A series of studies have been
done in Uganda on asparagus and will be completed by the end of
this year, "The New Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
D. S. Osiru, head of Department of Crop Science and Production
at Makerere University, said the researches have been done in
Uganda concerning appraisal of varieties of the crop, optimum
spacing, fertilizer application, disease control, yield and
post-harvest handling.
</P>
<P>
Asparagus was introduced into Uganda in 1960's, but failed due
to lack of knowledge. It was reintroduced with the help of the
U.S. Agency for International Development and now is considered
as one of the potential supplement crops for export.
</P>
<P>
The studies were launched early last year by Makerere
University and Fort Valley State College in Georgia of the United

<HEADLINE> "Wrong Decision Responsibility System" to Be Tried Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation is to try out a system in which
leading officials of state-owned enterprises will take
responsibility for making wrong decisions.
</P>
<P>
Details of the trial were announced in an article in the
Beijing-based magazine "Outlook" which published here today.
</P>
<P>
The system will first be tried on an experimental basis at some
designated enterprises in Shanghai and Guangzhou cities and
central China's Hunan province this year.
</P>
<P>
The move will play a positive role in enhancing leading
officials' sense of responsibility and cutting down the number of
blind decisions, the article said, adding that other trades and
departments should use it as a reference.
</P>
<P>
The article criticized some leading officials who had given no
thought to the interests of the state, collectives and the people,
and who failed to conduct careful investigations in making
decisions.
</P>
<P>
They often depended on "inspiration" and made unrealistic
decisions which wasted money and manpower.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, improper or wrong decisions by leading
officials in some areas have caused inestimable losses to the
state and the people, it said.
</P>
<P>
It advised leading officials to be more pragmatic rather than
subjective in making decisions.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Continue Electoral Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
continue to implement its massive electoral reform program,
Philippine President Fidel Ramos said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ramos told the delegates from more than 20 countries attending
a symposium organized by the International Foundation for Election
System and the Commission on Elections of the Philippines that
beginning this year, all voters will register anew and this will
be on a continuing basis.
</P>
<P>
The government has embarked on a massive electoral reform
program, he said, including the installation of modern computers
to speed up the tabulation of votes and eliminate fraud in
preparation for the 1998 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Voters will be issued voter's ID cards that will help reduce
the incidence of electoral fraud.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Commission on Election put in place the
beginning of a computerized electoral process that "will allow us
to take advantage of new technologies to greatly speed up the
counting process," the President said.
</P>
<P>
He said he is looking forward to the day when all electoral
processes are computerized for an instantaneous tabulation of
electoral results.
</P>
<P>
The President said this will be a major progression from the
elections that brought him to office in 1992, "where the
tabulation of results required nearly six weeks of suspenseful
counting, canvassing, proclamation -- and waiting."
</P>
<P>
The symposium held at the Diamond Hotel is aimed at laying the
foundations for an Asian regional organization of officials
responsible for the election process.

LANZHOU, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese city plans to cure
its serious pollution problem by moving a mountain.
</P>
<P>
It will take two years to remove the 30 million cubic meters of
a mountain to the east of industrial Lanzhou, capital of Gansu
Province.
</P>
<P>
The removal of the three-hilltop mountain will cost around 100
million-yuan (12 million US dollars). The project has been
launched by the city government of Lanzhou to clear atmospheric
pollution and again bring the sight of clear blue skies to its
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Located in the basin of river valley, the city is surrounded by
mountains, which slows down atmospheric circulation and the
dispersal of pollutants.
</P>
<P>
To relieve the situation, the city government decided to change
the geographical conditions by leveling the Daqingshan mountain in
eastern part of the city. The project is expected to be finished
in two years, and more than 30 million cubic meters of earth will
be removed.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Establishes More Hospices For Old People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
city, has built 30 hospices to strengthen its care service for its
growing population of elderly people.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has a population of 13 million, including 2.2 million
people at over 60 years of age -- 17 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Though most of the old people in Shanghai are in good health,
150,000 people aged at over 70 are unable to take care of
themselves because of serious illness or the after-effect of
strokes, senile dementia, and terminal cancer.
</P>
<P>
In most cases the spouses of sick old people are also too old
to take care of their partners, and their children are busily
engaged in their work.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, the city began to build hospices that receive old
people with serious diseases. Now Shanghai's hospices have over
1,500 hospital beds.
</P>
<P>
The hospices provide medical, nursing and psychological
services.
</P>
<P>
Wang Suqin, an 85-year-old dementia sufferer, is living in
Jing'an Hospital for the aged people. Her niece said the hospital
has a good environment and nurses are very kind to patients there,
adding that her aunt is in better condition after receiving
treatment in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
More old people are changing their idea of "living at home
until their last days" and prefer to live in the hospices when
they can not take care of themselves, even though they have
children who are willing to take care of them.

<HEADLINE> China Shifting Textile Industry to Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China has taken its first step
to transfer part of the country's textile industry from its
eastern regions to the west.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has started
five projects which will expand the region's cotton spinning
production.
</P>
<P>
The projects, which will increase spinning capacity by 261,000
spindles, are the result of cooperation between the region's
backbone textile enterprises and the country's traditional textile
industrial bases, such as Shanghai, Beijing, east China's Shandong
province, and southwest China's Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
The move is regarded as China's first step to transfer the
major part of the textile industry to the west, where the
country's major cotton production bases are located.
</P>
<P>
China will shift 500,000 spindles of cotton spinning into the
hinterland region during the ninth five-year plan period
(1996-2000), in a bid to build Xinjiang into the largest
manufacturer of cotton yarn and cloth in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
China's State Development Bank (SDB) will allocate 750 million
yuan in loans for the drive, which has been jointly launched by
the China National Textile Council and the State Planning
Commission.
</P>
<P>
So far, 200 million yuan of SDB's loans have been poured into
the region, which is the leading cotton producer in China, and
turned out over one million tons of cotton in 1996, accounting for
25 percent of the country's total.

JOHANNESBURG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
Kwazulu/Natal Premier and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) National
Chairman Frank Mdlalose will step down from both posts in late
February, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
Mdlalose's resignation, which came out as a surprise not only
to the public but also to most IFP members, was accepted by the
IFP's National Council in Ulundi at the weekend, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Mdlalose, 65, a founder member of the IFP, cited ill-health
for his resignation, but there is a strong speculation that the
real reason is connected to tensions between him and Party
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
</P>
<P>
The pressure on Mdlalose has been unbearable following
Buthelezi's recent attack on unnamed leaders whom he said are
more interested in drawing publicity to themselves than in
building the party.
</P>
<P>
Following Mdlalose's announcement of resignation, Buthelezi
said in a statement that the premier has indicated that because
of personal reasons, he will not be prepared to lead the party in
the 1999 electoral campaign acting both as IFP chairman and
Kwazulu/Natal premier.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ngubane, 55, currently provincial finance minister, will
step into Mdlalose's shoes as acting chairman of the party and
Kwazulu/Natal premier.
</P>
<P>
Kwazulul/Natal, heart-base to the country's largest tribal
group Zulu, is the only province controlled by the IFP in South
Africa's nine provinces.

<HEADLINE> China to Pour Huge Investment into Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China is to invest 1.5 percent
of its gross national product (GNP) in environmental protection
in the remaining years of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
It will mean the country spending an average 65 billion yuan
annually on "green' projects.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Ye Ruqiu, deputy director of the State
Bureau of Environment Protection (SBEP), at a press conference
today in advance of the '97 China Environment Forum.
</P>
<P>
The event is the first international environmental protection
symposium to be sponsored by China's non-governmental
organizations, and is scheduled for February 24-27 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that the funds will be used to build new environmental
protection projects, control old pollution sources with advanced
technology, and construct basic environmental protection
facilities in cities, and strengthen natural protection.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis will be given to control water pollution in the
Huaihe, Haihe, and Liaohe rivers, and the lakes of Taihu, Chaohu,
and Dianchi, he said.
</P>
<P>
The funding will come mainly from central and local
governments, domestic and overseas banks, and local enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SBEP plans to absorb some foreign funds, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China invested nearly 40 billion yuan
annually on average in environmental protection during the Eighth
Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), accounting for about 0.8
percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
According to a blueprint by SBEP, China will bring the
aggravating tendency in environment pollution and ecological
destruction basically under control by the end of this century,
with a marked improvement of environment quality seen in cities
and regions.
</P>
<P>
However, Ye pointed out, China still faces a grim environmental
situation, with a negative influence on social and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, environment pollution is taking a turn for
the worse in urban areas, and is stretching into the
countryside. The range of ecological destruction is widening, he
warned.

<HEADLINE> Trains to Run Faster in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Major inter-city rail journeys
in China will be quicker from April when train speeds are
increased to more than 110 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
The faster trains will run on rail journeys starting from the
cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Zhengzhou, Wuhan,
and Xi'an, most of them long distance journeys of between 1,000
kilometers and 1,500 km.
</P>
<P>
And by the start of the new century, China will have taken
delivery of 64 "arrive-in-a-night" long-distance passenger trains,
Zhou Yimin, deputy chief engineer of the Ministry of Railways,
told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Included are 11 pairs of such trains to be started this year,
including the Beijing-Dalian and Beijing-Qingdao trains, he said.
</P>
<P>
Low-standard marketing and service, and the low speeds of
trains in China are factors that have caused a drop in passenger
transport of railway, Zhou pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that trains carried a total of 942 million
travelers last year, a 12.3 percent drop over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways will launch more "return-in-a-day"
trains within a distance of 200 to 400 kilometers, as part of
efforts to enhance the attraction of rail transport to
travelers, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Such trains already run on some rail sections, including
Beijing-Beidaihe and Shanghai-Nanjing. The railway line from
Zhengzhou to Wuhan will soon witness such a pair of trains,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ministry of Railways will put into operation a
batch of tourist trains, holiday trains, as well as special trains
for rural people working in cities, and football specials will be
started for fans.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that the speed of cargo trains will also be raised to
about 80 km per hour from 60 km per hour, to match the raised
speeds of passenger trains and to ensure the safety on rail
tracks.

<HEADLINE> China's Economic Climate to Further Improve This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China's overall economic
climate is expected to move between the green light and yellow
light zones this year, coupled with an expected stable and
improving national economic performance in 1997, according to a
forecast by the State Statistics Bureau today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, individual industrial enterprises are likely to
enjoy a more favorable performance this year.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, spokesman for the bureau, said that China's
overall economic climate went through an upward spiral in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said that the business climate, feelings of individual
companies about their performance, was basically stable last year,
with its four quarterly indicators moving within a range of minus
0.07 and a positive 0.06. He added that the fluctuation was
smaller than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Qiu said that the business climate for state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) continued to be poorer than that for the non-state sector,
but the gap has narrowed.
</P>
<P>
"The fourth quarterly business climate indicator stood at 0.06
for SOEs and that for non-SOEs was 0.08," he said, "but the
indicators were minus 0.03 and a positive 0.06 respectively for
the same quarter in 1995."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that serious problems remain in the
economic climate.
</P>
<P>
"The allocation of resources is not radical," he
said. "Redundant and blind construction has not been effectively
curbed, which hampers economic efficiency."
</P>
<P>
"For instance, 23 of the 30 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions have their own automobile plants. But the
national total of 1.45 million units is even less than one-quarter
of a major car company abroad," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, poor industrial economic efficiency continues to be
a sore spot in the Chinese economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
A quarter of the country's industrial enterprises are
money-losing and 43.7 percent of the state-owned enterprises are
not profitable. The rate is five percentage points higher than the
previous year, he said.

CHANGCHUN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- When 39-year-old cancer
patient John Chen was told that he had just one month to live, he

reached alarming proportions and warned this poses a serious
threat to human health.
</P>
<P>
UZ deputy Dean of Agriculture Austin Chivinge said on Sunday
that many people were either applying wrong chemicals for the
wrong crop or over-applying certain chemicals on crops.
</P>
<P>
''Some people are spraying insecticides to control diseases,
instead of using a fungicide,'' he said, adding that this was
most prevalent in horticultural production among small-holder
farmers.
</P>
<P>
He said many people did not observe the safety regulations on
the use of chemicals, neither did they use protective clothing
like gloves, gorgles and gum-boots, thereby exposing themselves to
the highly dangerous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
''This normally results in acute poisoning which ends up in
death and the worst one is chronic poisoning, where one is being
poisoned gradually and only realizing this much later when health
problems begin to affect the individual,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Chivinge said casinogenic or cancerous diseases could also
result from pesticides abuse, adding that sterility could also
result.
</P>
<P>
Chemicals should be stored separately in locked-up places
where there were no foodstuffs, he said.
</P>
<P>
''There is also a need for a lot of education for pesticides
users on both the benefits of using and the problems associated
with using, such as pollution of water and other environments, as
well as education on the need to intensify the safety aspect,''
he said.

WEIHAI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The streets of coastal Weihai in
east China's Shandong province offer a welcoming sign to the
city's fastest growing tourism group. Advertisements are not only
written in Chinese, but also Korean.
</P>
<P>
The small city, with a population of less than 300,000,
was the destination place for 67,000 tourists from ROK last year,
more than any other city in Shandong.
</P>
<P>
"Tourists from ROK have become one of the main dynamic forces
to push the economic development forward in Weihai," said a
city government official.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Weihai, known widely as "a garden
city" in China, last year attracted 94 new ROK-funded enterprises,
accounting for 79 percent of the total number of newly-introduced
foreign-funded enterprises in the city.
</P>
<P>
"ROK has become the most important trading partner of
Weihai", the official said, "Last year the city's trade volume
with ROK reached 852 million US dollars, a 35 percent increase
over the previous year".
</P>
<P>
The nearest distance between Weihai to ROK, which face each
other across the sea, is less than 100 nautical miles.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Intra-regional trade in
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has increased
by 12.4 percent in the past two years, said a SADC report.
</P>
<P>
Local daily "The Citizen" today quoted SADC sources as saying
that the report was released in Gaborone, capital of Botswana on
Sunday and planned to be submitted to a SADC consultative
conference in Namibia's capital Windhoek early next month.
</P>
<P>
It cited peace and stability and the introduction of trade
liberalization measures as main contributions to the trade
increase.
</P>
<P>
SADC member states have been trading in agricultural products,
mining, food products, textiles, clothing, beverages, wood
products and industrial chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The report said, however, inadequate production base,
insufficient trade policies and market access, underdeveloped
financial infrastructure and inadequate trade statistics and
information are still obstacles to trade in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another report on trade and industry, also to be
submitted to the forthcoming SADC conference, identified low
savings, exchange control regulations, high investment risks and
low returns as obstacles to the increase of the investment in the
region.
</P>
<P>
SADC comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia
and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> China Zoo Wants Adoptive 'Parents' For Its Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 27 (Xinhua) -- People in China are to be given
the chance to adopt a cuddly giant panda.
</P>
<P>
The move has been taken by a zoo in northwest China's Gansu
Province which has invited individuals and organisations to adopt
its vast collection of rare animals.
</P>
<P>
Most of the animals seeking adoptive parents at the zoo in the
provincial capital of Lanzhou are under state or world-level
protection.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, sponsoring organizations or individuals can
choose one or several animals at the zoo and help towards the cost
of raising them, according to the Lanzhou City Zoo.
</P>
<P>
The zoo will post a board containing the sponsor's name on the
cage of the animal, and each sponsor will also be allowed to name
the animal, said an official.
</P>
<P>
The zoo will also release regular reports to sponsors on the
condition and progress of the animals they are supporting.
</P>
<P>
Gansu is home to 80 kinds of rare animals under national
protection, including the giant panda and the takin, with Lanzhou
City Zoo now raising 22 types of animals on the verge of
extinction.
</P>
<P>
Since China ratified the "Convention on Bio-Diversity" in 1992,
an important international environmental regulation formulated by
many countries in the world, a large number of cities in the
country including Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou have called on
the public to contribute to the protection of rare animals.

XI'AN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A high-grade asphalt mixing plant
imported from Britain has been transformed to meet local
road-building requirements.
</P>
<P>
The M3000 mobile asphalt mixing plant was jointly introduced
into China by the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, in a move to promote a
massive road construction drive in China.
</P>

DHAKA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government and
the tribal rebels in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) seem poised for
striking an agreement when their peace talks entered the third
consecutive day today, according to meeting sources.
</P>
<P>
"The difference between the two sides to resolve the issues is
gradually narrowing to reach an agreement," the sources said,
adding that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday night was
briefed on the talks.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying for an agreement. We've come for an agreement,"
said Chittagong Mayor Abm Mohiuddin Chowdhury, who is also a
member of the National Committee on CHI which is negotiating with
the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS), political
wing of the armed Buddhist rebels in CHT.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have been fighting a bush war since 1973 for
autonomy of the resource-rich hill forests in Southeast
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Today's talks are to center around three crucial points of the
rebels' demand -- land distribution, Bangalee settlers and local
government structure in the three hill districts, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, nine rounds of talks were held since a cease-fire was
reached in August 1992 between the government and the tribal

<P>
ULAN BATOR, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China has become the second
largest trade partner of Mongolia, with their two-way trade volume
reaching 140 million U.S. dollars in 1996, a Mongolian official
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Nazhengova, deputy director of the International Trade and
Cooperation Bureau under the Ministry of External Relations, said
the figure accounted for 16 percent of Mongolia's total foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
Since the normalization of the relations between the two
countries, both governments have made efforts to develop
cooperation in economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, there are more than 170 Sino-Mongolian joint
ventures in Mongolia, accounting for 30 percent of the total,
which made China a country that operates the largest number of
joint ventures in the land-locked country, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has provided Mongolia with 130 million
yuan in soft loans since 1990 to help the country overcome crisis
during its transition to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are working on 16 cooperative projects funded by the
loans, including those in coal mine, trade service centers and
leather processing plants. The other eight projects will be
completed within 1997, she added.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China gave Mongolia 3 million yuan of commodities in
aid, plus a 20-million-yuan free loan to help Mongolia fight a big
forestry fire, she said.

The date for the trip to Moscow has not yet been finalized, but
if all goes well, he would leave for the Russian Federation on
February 13.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, the prime minister will hold talks with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and other Russian leaders on bilateral
relations and regional and international issues of mutual concern.
The current status of Russia-China ties and Sino-Indian relations
are items high on the agenda besides Afghanistan, the same sources

The fact that Gowda has chosen to be in Moscow after his recent
visit to Bangladesh is reflective of the importance attached by
New Delhi to its ties with Russia.

Indian External Affairs Minister I. K. Gujral is going to be in
Moscow ahead of the prime minister for a meeting of the

base with the active participation of the domestic private

BANGKOK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreign capital inflows into
Thailand slowed down last year, with long-term loans outpacing
short-term ones.
</P>
<P>
According to data from the Thai Central Bank available today,
Thailand's outstanding external debt was posted at 88.96 billion
U.S. dollars in November last year, rising by only 7.7 percent
over 1995.

Of the debt, foreign loans longer than one year accounted for
55.4 percent, higher than the 50.2 percent seen at the end of
1995.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Central Bank's measures introduced last April to curb
inflows of short-term loans might contribute to the healthier
borrowing situation in the country last year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank now requires commercial banks to place a
7-percent cash reserve when they get foreign debts with a maturity
less than one year.

<HEADLINE> Budget Cut to Trim Inflation: Thai Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The central bank of Thailand
believes that if the government's austerity policy succeeds, the
country's inflation this year could drop to 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
To curb the current account deficit, the government plans to
defer government spending for 1997 of more than 50 billion baht (2
billion U.S. dollars) in non-productive projects and intends to
slash the 1998 budget by another 50 billion baht.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's fiscal 1998 begins in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
For the past two years inflation has been relatively high,
standing at 5.8 percent in 1995 and 5.9 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
For 1997, the Bank of Thailand predicts that a higher
agricultural output should dampen food prices, a major
contribution to inflation.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the central bank predicted that
inflation for 1997 would drop considerably to 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The National Economic and Social Development Board is working
out basic criteria for slashing unnecessary projects from the
budget.
</P>
<P>
Board Secretary-General Wirat Watanasiritham said projects to
be axed would be those deemed unproductive, overly luxurious or
those with high import content. Projects which do not complement
current projects would also be cut.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thawatchai Yongkitikul, secretary-general of the
Thai Bankers' Association, said the government should especially
concentrate on reducing spending on imports rather than cutting
investment projects affecting domestic employment.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria National Coach Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January, 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria suspended the country's
national soccer team coach Amodu Shaibu indefinitely, state
television said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the reason for Shaibu's leave was not given but
his criticism on the soccer authorities could irritate officials.
</P>
<P>
Last week Shaibu told the television that: "The Nigerian
Football Association (NFA) and sports ministry officials are not
telling the truth about soccer matters in Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
Three months ago Shaibu's former, Dutchman Jo Bonfrere, had to
leave the place by complaining of annoying interference from the
sports authority.

<HEADLINE> More People Killed in Philippines' Military Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) continued their clashes,
killing eight more people on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were still battling despite a temporary local
cease-fire declared by higher military and MILF leaders, bringing
the death toll to 41 since the start of the fighting last
Thursday, the newspaper Manila Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
They began crossfire after the rebels attacked Buldon Mayor
Macarampat Manalao and his escorts near one of the MILF's main
camps in Maguindanao Province in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The MILF claimed that all the dead in the latest fighting were
soldiers and that only one rebel was wounded. The military had no
comment on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Social Welfare and Development said some
2,000 families have already fled the area and evacuation still
continued due to the unabated fighting.
</P>
<P>
However, another local newspaper, Today, reported that
negotiators from the two warring sides agreed on a six-point pact
on Sunday for the cessation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Ghazali Jaafar, MILF political affairs chief, was quoted as
saying the two sides' representatives are slated to sign the
agreement today in Sultan Kudarat town, where they held their
first round of low-level peace talks last month.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides that the MILF and the military will
maintain the respective positions of their troops and no
additional deployment will be allowed, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Both the MILF and the military agreed not to take any
provocative action such as ambushes, bombardments and similar acts
relative to military combat operations, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The MILF also agreed not to set up blocking forces or
checkpoints along a highway near the town of Buldon to prevent the
military from being provoked, it said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a 12,000-member breakaway faction of the mainstream
Moro National Liberation Front which concluded a peace agreement
with the government last year, is scheduled to have its second
round of peace talks with the government peace panel on February
25-26.

<HEADLINE> Metrobank Becomes Philippines' Largest Conglomerate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- After decades of being the
country's largest commercial bank, the Philippine National Bank
has given way to Metrobank, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Metrobank's assets grew by 26 percent to 200
billion pesos (7.6 billion U.S. dollars) last year, dislodging the
Philippine National Bank which posted total assets of 189 billion
pesos (7.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
While several of the country's big banks were products of some
mergers and consolidations, Metrobank had been piling up assets on
its own.
</P>
<P>
Metrobank, which overtook Bank of the Philippine Islands to be
the biggest private commercial bank several years ago, also led in
terms of loans and capital last year, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The bank had total deposits of 140 billion pesos (5.3 billion
dollars) as of the end of last December, followed by the
Philippine National Bank, Bank of the Philippine Islands and
PCIbank.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes World's Major Corn Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China has become the world's
major producer of corn, with production amounting to 100 million
tons in 1996, researchers have reported.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounted for one-fifth of the world's total output.
</P>
<P>
Experts credit China's success with effective measures against
natural disasters and progress in processing industry.
</P>
<P>
The planting area of corn covers 20 million hectares in China,
about 15 percent of the country's arable land.
</P>
<P>
Three major corn production regions stretch almost across the
country, from southern most Hainan Island to the northern most
Heilongjiang Province, from Taiwan to northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that about 27 percent of the planting area is
in the northeast China's Jilin, Heilongjiang and Liaoning
provinces and north China's Hebei Province, where corn is seeded
in spring.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent is on the plains between Yellow River and
Huaihe River in east China's Shandong and Jiangsu provinces and
central China's Henan Province, where corn is seeded either
in spring or in summer time.
</P>
<P>
One-fourth of the corn is planted on hilly land in southwest
China's Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan provinces.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have seen their efforts in improving corn
planting techniques pay off, as the per hectare output of the corn
has risen to 7,500 kilograms as against 1,350 kg in 1949, when new
China was founded.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, China has cultivated and introduced many
strains of good-quality corn, some of which can be made into tasty
and nutritious food, and some can be used as raw material for
industry.
</P>
<P>
"Corn can be processed into 500 different kinds of products,
and can be used as basic material for some hi-tech products," said
an expert in the study of corn.
</P>
<P>
As the corn output rises and the techniques of corn processing
improve, corn is no longer only used as food in China, but also
can be used as feed and as a resource in industry.

<HEADLINE> New Navy Commander Appointed in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chief of Staff of the Navy
Rear Admiral Cecil Tissera has been appointed the commander of the
Sri Lanka Navy with effect from today, according to an official
release from the Presidential Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The release said Tissera becomes the 13th commander of the Sri
Lanka Navy and the first Navy commander to have been trained as an
officer cadet at Sri Lanka's Naval and Maritime Academy in
Trincomalee.
</P>
<P>
He was enlisted to the then Royal Ceylon Navy in September 1966
 and was selected as one of the academy's first officer cadets in
July 1969.
</P>
<P>
Tissera, 49, is also the youngest to assume command in the rank
of vice admiral.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Finland Opposes Power Concentration of EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Finnish Minister of European
Affairs Ole Norrback today rejected a proposal calling for
enlarging the power of France, Germany and Britain within the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Norrback said the removal of veto power of some EU members will
not raise the efficiency of the EU's decision-making. On the
contrary, this will increase difficulty in cooperation within the
EU and could even possibly halt its ongoing integration process.
</P>
<P>
Hans Borek, a member in charge of external relations of the
Commission of the EU, proposed Saturday that small member
countries of the EU hand over their decision-making powers to
France, Germany and Britain, so as to quicken the pace of the EU's
decision-making process.

<HEADLINE> Floods Force Thousands to Leave Homes in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Floods, caused by heavy rains,
forced the evacuation of thousands of people from their homes on
Saturday and Sunday in the Central Java town of Kendal, Indonesia,
the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of hectares of farmland and rice paddies, buildings,
schools and roads were swamped in the town by flood waters up to
two meters deep, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The main coastal road, which runs through Kendal to the
provincial capital Semarang, was hampered by the floods causing a
traffic backlog.
</P>
<P>
Kendal, which is 60 kilometers west of Semarang, saw thousands
of its residents pack their belongings and sought dry ground on
roofs and tall buildings.
</P>
<P>
Waters up to 1.7 meters deep inundated the town's central
market, the attorney general's department and other government
buildings.
</P>
<P>
Police said the flood waters began to drop Sunday morning,
although some of the farming areas are still under half a meter of
water.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been hard-hit by heavy rains this month, which is
the middle of the wet season here.
</P>
<P>
Last week two people were reported missing and thousands of
people had to be evacuated from their homes in areas close to
Kendal as flash floods hit Semarang and surrounding districts.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: U.S. to Continue Policies on Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said today he would carry out the administration's
policies and promote a "three-plus-three" formula on an
anti-missile system.
</P>
<P>
Under the formula worked out by Cohen's predecessor, William
Perry, the Pentagon would research the concept of a national
defense system until 2000, and then decide whether the threat
warrants deployment by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Republicans have demanded immediate efforts to erect a national
anti-missile defense system, a new version of the Strategic
Defense Initiative sought during the Reagan presidency.
</P>
<P>
The administration has countered that it would be inordinately
expensive, unnecessary and a violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
On ABC's "This Week" program, Cohen said he was not sure if it
was technically possible to install a system by 2003 and that it
would not be designed for all-out nuclear war but "to give us
protection against limited, isolated or perhaps accidental
missiles."
</P>
<P>
Cohen also urged the Senate to ratify a treaty banning chemical
weapons. He said that failure to join other countries in the
international convention could isolate the United States and
result in serious economic losses.

<HEADLINE> China to Expand Medicine Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Every town in China will have a
medicine retail shop or medical pharmacy by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The State Pharmaceutical Administration has vowed to build
38,000 medicine retail networks in the next four years, double the
current number, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are 19,000 medical retail shops in the
countryside, or one for 2.5 towns on average.
</P>
<P>
Once the targets are fulfilled, a state-managed pharmaceutical
wholesale and retail network will cover all counties, towns and
villages and provide safe and high-quality medicines for rural
people, especially those living in poor and remote villages.
</P>
<P>
In China, counties and towns near cities often get medicines
from state pharmaceutical wholesale stores and their subordinated
commercial centers. Some township hospitals, village supply and
marketing cooperatives also sell medicines.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the administration suggested that over 900
million people living in rural areas consume only one quarter of
the medicines in the country each year. The ratio of average
consumption of medicines and use of medical equipment per person
between farmers and urbanities is one to nine.
</P>
<P>
The average expenditure on medicine per person will go up to
some 30 yuan (about 3.6 U.S. dollars) among rural people by the
year 2000, said experts, due to the improvement of health care
services and a changing concept on health. The current figure is
17 yuan (about two U.S. dollars).

<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Premier Li Peng recently expressed his concern about
the workers at a large state-owned enterprise in the old
industrial city of Anshan, in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection tour from January 23 to 25, Li warmly
greeted employees and visited the homes of some model workers. He
said that the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government
work in the interests of the people, and officials at various
levels should help to solve the problems of the people, especially
those in state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In Anshan, Li inspected a number of state firms, including the
Anshan Iron and Steel Company, a steel production giant employing
500,000 people, 120,000 of whom are retirees.
</P>
<P>
-- The All-China Journalists Association (ACJA) made an
announcement to encourage public supervision over journalists. The
Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China, the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television and the
ACJA jointly banned paid news service on January 23.
</P>
<P>
"Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- The per capita net income of Chinese farmers in 1996 reached
1,900 yuan, hitting an all-time high since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented a 20 percent rise over that in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Economists said a good harvest was a major factor contributing
to the rise in farmers' incomes. Last year each farmer earned
50 yuan more from increased grain production alone.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of farmers' income comes from agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
-- Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun has called on local officials in
Hunan and Anhui provinces to show more concern for the farmers who
suffered from last year's heavy floods.
</P>
<P>
During his inspection tour of the area from January 22 to 25,
Jiang visited five villages and praised farmers for their efforts
to rebuild their homes.
</P>
<P>
He urged local officials to ensure that every disaster-affected
rural family has enough food, clothing and housing so that they
can enjoy the Spring Festival, which falls on February 7.
</P>

</P>
<P>
-- Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai became the president of the Provisional
legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
-- The number and quality of Chinese lawyers and law firms
gained rapid progress last year thanks to effective reforms,
Justice Minister Xiao Yang told China Daily over the weekend.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Reports Rapid Progress in Law Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of Justice
Xiao Yang said that the number and quality of Chinese lawyers and
law firms gained rapid progress in 1996, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Beijing-based English newspaper, Xiao
revealed that lawyers across the country totalled nearly 100,000
by the end of last year, while the figure was merely 40,000 in
1993.
</P>
<P>
The number of law firms increased to 7,500 in 1996 from 3,000
in 1993, and to date, 80 percent of the lawyers have higher-level
academic degrees, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chinese lawyers handled 700,000 lawsuits and
non-lawsuits, more than double that of 1993. They also provided
better services for more government agencies and enterprises as
legal consultants than in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Xiao pointed out that six reform measures were carried out last
year on the basis of the previous years' efforts to bring the
lawyer's system closer to international standards.
</P>
<P>
The measures include redefinition of the organization of law
firms, improvement of the lawyer management system, promulgation
of new laws and regulations concerning lawyers, promotion of the
legal assistance system, and establishment of the lawyer
qualification examination system and a reasonable income
distribution system.

<P>
NEW YORK, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan, one of world
basketball all-time greats, on Sunday became the first player to
receive more than 2 million votes for the NBA All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
In final fan voting for the February 9 game at Cleveland, the
Chicago Bulls guard led all players in votes for a record eighth
time with 2,451,136. He will be playing in his 11th All-Star game.

<HEADLINE> New Shopping Mall to Promote Commercial Projects Along Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Work has been completed on the
Ningbo Commercial Mansion, built at a cost of 400 million yuan and
the largest shopping mall in the history of this port city in east
China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
As one of the largest projects launched by the Yangtze Economic
Joint Development (Group) Corp., the newly-finished mall shows
that another important step has been made in the program to build
a commercial and trade corridor along the Yangtze River valley.
</P>
<P>
The project was initiated by the group, which is the leading
government-sponsored business in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The group has total assets of 2.5 billion yuan, with funds from
31 city governments, more than 50 large enterprises, and 28
branches of the Shanghai-based Bank of Communications in the
valley, said Gu Chuanxun, chairman of the group and a former vice
mayor of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Gu noted the group plans to establish a commercial and trade
corridor, with Shanghai as the leader, which is expected to help
promote economic growth in the Yangtze River valley, one of the
most economically developed areas in China.
</P>
<P>
With Ningbo as a strong link in its investment chain, the group
has also channeled funds to other main cities in the valley,
including Wuhan, Nanjing and Suzhou.
</P>
<P>
Local officials from both Shanghai and Ningbo praised the
project as an example of cooperation between the two cities.

<HEADLINE> Sweden's Karlsson Equals World Swimming Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Louise Karlsson of Sweden
equaled her world short course record in the women's 100-meter
medley, clocking one minute 1.03 seconds in a World Cup meet in
Malmo on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
She had set the record at the Esbo World Cup in Finland on
November 22, 1992.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 800 meters freestyle, Germany's Jorg Hoffmann
broke one of the oldest European records with a time of 7:36.24.
Michael Gross of Germany had set the old mark of 7:38.75 at Bonn
12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Karlsson, 22, competed here this weekend for the first time
since taking a seven-month break after the Atlanta Olympics
because of bronchitis problems.
</P>
<P>
Since the 100 medley isn't a medal event in the World Short
Course Championships at Gothenburg, Sweden, in April, Karlsson is
expected to enter the 200 meters medley and relays and she may
also enter the 50 meters breaststroke, the event she won in 31.63
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Australian swimmers dominated Sunday's session winning four
races.
</P>
<P>
Michael Klim won the men's 200 meters freestyle in 1:45.99;
Matthew Dunn got the 200 meters medley in 2:00.31; Adrian Radley
won the 200 meters backstroke in 1:59.47 and Natasha Bowron took

<HEADLINE> Hi-Tech Industry Plays Major Role in Weihai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WEIHAI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics show that 297
high-tech industrial projects with total investment of 3.7 billion
yuan have been launched in the Weihai Hi-tech Industrial Zone in
east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates the high-tech industry is now playing a major
role in the 40 square kilometer zone," said Li Guodong, director
of the zone's Administrative Commission.
</P>
<P>
At present, 77 percent of industrial projects carried out in
the zone involve high-tech operations, said Li.
</P>
<P>
The national-level zone, set up five years ago, has carried out
98 science research projects included in the outline of the State
Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the output of the hi-tech industries reached 2.1
billion yuan, accounting for 80 percent of the zone's total. And
the development of the high-tech industries helped raise its
import and export volume.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, 42 firms engaged in imports and exports had
been set up in Weihai, completing 580 million yuan of export
during the year.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, the number of research institutes and educated
personnel in the zone also increased by a large margin, and were
responsible for developing more than 40 high-tech products and
applied for patents for 63 projects.
</P>
<P>
To date, the zone has approved 866 projects, involving 11
billion yuan in total investment including 6.4 billion US dollars
in overseas investment.

<HEADLINE> China to Severely Punish Misuse of Three Gorges Resettlement Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China will severely punish the
improper use of funds issued for the resettlement of the gigantic
Three Gorges Project, the world's largest water-control endeavor.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project Construction Commission under the
State Council will set up a supervision bureau to improve
management of the resettlement fund.
</P>
<P>
"China has imposed strict management on the Three Gorges
resettlement fund," said Qi Lin, director of the commission's
Resettlement and Development Bureau.
</P>
<P>
By 2009, China will have to relocate around 1.2 million people
and thousands of factories to make way for the project.
Compensation for the resettlement amounts to 40 billion yuan (4.8
billion US dollars on May 1993 prices).
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, China has invested more than 4.5 billion yuan in
the Three Gorges resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
To better manage the fund, Qi said his bureau has will set up
five major systems in the fields of planning, account checking,
investment, statistics and auditing.
</P>
<P>
The bureau earlier imposed three rules to be observed by
government officials in the reservoir area extending from Yichang
in central China's Hubei Province to Chongqing in southwestern
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
-- It is forbidden to use the resettlement fund for the
construction of projects not linked to the resettlement plans, the
development of real estate, or the buying of stock.
</P>
<P>
-- It is forbidden to use the resettlement fund to cover
administrative expenses, construct luxury hotels or buy cars.
</P>
<P>
-- It is forbidden to randomly adjust major resettlement
projects.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the chaotic management of the fund by various banks,
the country has also put the China Construction Bank in charge.

"Nikola Koljevic will be remembered as a generous man who had
focused all his endeavors on ensuring lasting peace, freedom and
independence for his people," the telegram says.
</P>
<P>
Koljevic died at Belgrade's Military Academy Hospital late
Saturday as a result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the
head, according to a statement from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Koljevic attempted suicide on January 16 in Pale, the
administrative center in Bosnia's Serb entity -- the Republika
Srpska, and was rushed to Belgrade for treatment the next day.
</P>
<P>
A brain surgery and intensive care failed to stop a
deterioration of the vital functions and he eventually died, the
hospital statement said.
</P>
<P>
Koljevic was born in Banja Luka on June 9, 1936, graduated in
world literature from Belgrade University and did post-graduate
studies in literary theory in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
He wrote a number of books on European and Yugoslav literature,
edited literary magazines in Sarajevo and Banja Luka and taught at
Sarajevo University.
</P>
<P>
His political activity intensified at the outbreak of former
Yugoslav crisis in early 1990s and became member of the presidency
of Bosnia-Herzegovina in late 1990, a post he held until he
resigned in April 1992 when Bosnian civil war formally broke out.
</P>
<P>
He was vice president of the Republika Srpska from May 1992 to
1996.

<HEADLINE> Albright: U.S. Expects Saudi Cooperation over Truck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Sunday said that the United States expects
Saudi Arabia to be cooperative with the investigation into last
June's truck bombing in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on NBC "Meet the Press" program, Albright said: "The
Saudis have assured us at the highest levels that they will be
cooperative, and we expect them to be cooperative."
</P>
<P>
Albright expressed her implicit criticism when she indicated
that there was no disagreement within the Clinton administration
regarding critical statements about Saudi cooperation from FBI
chief Louis Freeh and Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
Freeh and Reno on Thursday attacked the government in Riyadh
for withholding important information about the truck bombing at a
U.S. military housing complex in Dhahran, killing 19 American
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Albright told NBC that there is a unified position within the
Clinton administration over Saudi cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We are a team, and we have a unified team," she said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the U.S. criticism, Saudi ambassador Prince
Bandar Bin Sultan said on Friday in a statement that the
conclusion of the investigation into the bombing will be made
public by Saudi authorities exclusively, indicating his government
would not provide any clues about who was behind the bombing to
anyone before any conclusion is reached.
</P>
<P>
"it would be premature to accuse or absolve anyone until the
investigation is completed," the prince said.
</P>
<P>
But Prince Bandar assured the United States that close
cooperation will continue.

<HEADLINE> Albright: U.S. Bases Ties with Russia on Russian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said today that it was important for her
country to keep good relations with Russia, but the ties are based
on the Russian government, not just on person.
</P>
<P>
"While we really wish (Russian President) Boris Yeltsin well
and we have a very good relationship with him, it's important that
people understand that our relationships with Russia are based on
where they're going, other people in the government, and the
possibility that we will be able to work better and better
together," Albright said said on NBC's "Meet the Press" this
morning.
</P>
<P>
"The Yeltsin-Chernomyrdin government is one that is on the
right track, and we are working with them," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that U.S.-Russian relations are very important to both
countries. The scheduled summit meeting between U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Yeltsin in March in the United States was still
expected to take place but no exact time or place has been
arranged.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the Clinton administration was closely monitoring
Yeltsin's progress. Yeltsin is recovering from double pneumonia,
which struck him earlier this month just two weeks after he
returned to the Kremlin after undergoing heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
She said the immediate focus is on a February meeting between
Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.

<HEADLINE> Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Arrives in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia's first Deputy Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov arrived at Belgrade on Sunday on a working
visit.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at Belgrade airport, Ivanov said current
political developments in Serbia were the country's internal
affairs and deterioration of the crisis in the Yugoslav Republic
of Serbia could complicate the situation in the country and in all
of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian opposition coalition Zajedno has staged
demonstrations over the past two months to protest the annulment
of the local elections results and demanded the recognition of
their victory in the elections on November 17, thus causing a
political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov told reporters that the report drawn up by the
commission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) after its visit to Belgrade in late 1996 was
constructive, and the Yugoslav side shared this view.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE delegation report has confirmed that the Serbian
opposition coalition won local elections in 14 out of 18 major
cities across Serbia and asked the Serbian government to reinstate
the election results.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the current visit to Belgrade by a delegation
of the Russian State Duma (lower house), the deputy foreign
minister said the parliamentarians' visit, which began on
Saturday, showed that all political forces in Russia hoped that
the political situation in Yugoslavia would be normalized as soon
as possible, through political dialogue.
