<P>
ATHENS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Military experts from seven Balkan

concerning the establishment of a multinational peacekeeping force
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which will last five days, is being attended by
delegations from Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Romania, Turkey
and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), and
representatives from the U.S. and Slovenia are also taking part in
as observers.
</P>
<P>
The Athens meeting will center on issues regarding the
organization and structure of the multinational force's

To prevent conflict and maintain peace and stability in the
region, defense undersecretaries of the eight Balkan countries and
the United States agreed last month at a meeting in Tirana,
Albania, to set up the multinational force.

<HEADLINE> Sensitive Index on BSE Falls 64 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive index on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market Monday closed at 3,078.51 as
against last Friday's close of 3,143.1, showing a net fall of
64.59 points.
</P>
<P>
The national index dipped by 30.17 points to 1,341.13 from
previous close of 1,371.3.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 and the U.S. dollar indexes were quoted remarkably
down at 306.11 and 119.38 compared with last weekend's closes of
312.56 and 123.31 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Equities recovered most of the losses at the fag end but the
sensitive index still showed a fall. Prices, which suffered a
sharp setback in curb deals last Friday following a Moody's
investor service decision to push India's foreign currency country
ceiling for long-term debts and notes down to speculative grade
category, declined due to heavy selling pressure but with no
buyers in the market. Moody's downgrading triggered heavy selling
pressure from foreign institutional investors.

<HEADLINE> British Nanny Woodward Admits "Sentence Was Brief" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Louise Woodward, the British au
pair convicted of killing an eight-month-old baby, has admitted
she was lucky not to serve more time in jail for the death of baby
Matthew Eappen.
</P>
<P>
In her first interview to BBC TV since returning to Britain,
the former au pair admits her sentence was brief for anyone
convicted of manslaughter. The interview will be screened on BBC
1's Panorama Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
She was convicted in Massachusetts of manslaughter but was
allowed to return home after serving 279 days in a U.S. prison.
</P>
<P>
She insisted she was innocent and made a scapegoat for the
death of the baby under her care.
</P>
<P>
"There's the whole feeling that somebody had to pay -- and that
somebody had to be me," said Woodward who returned to Britain from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the 279-day sentence was long for an "innocent
person to serve," the 20-year-old woman said.
</P>
<P>
The BBC is to broadcast the full interview Monday evening. It
emphasized it had paid nothing to Woodward or her family and said
it would distribute the interview internationally free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Both Louise and her parents have repeatedly denied that they
sold or had any intention of selling the story of Louise's ordeal
in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Pak Government Announces Annual Trade Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government is
determined to bring down the trade deficit in the new fiscal year
to about zero from the 1.53 billion U.S. dollars expected at the
end of current fiscal year on June 30.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Commerce Minister Ishaq Dar while
presenting the government's annual trade policy in his televised
speech Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The expected goal of bringing down trade deficit to about zero
is to be achieved by increasing exports by 15.6 percent and
keeping imports at the same level as in the outgoing fiscal year
(July 1-June 30).
</P>
<P>
The government has set the export target for the 1998-99 fiscal
year at 10 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan achieved a wheat production of 18.6 million tons in
the 1997-98 fiscal year from 16.7 million tons in the previous
year, registering an increase of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sugarcane production in the outgoing fiscal year
jumped by 26.4 percent to 53.1 million tons from 42 million tons
in the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In that context, Dar said, wheat imports in the new fiscal year
will be lower and sugar imports will be nil, resulting in savings
of around 400 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The actual import value in the new fiscal year will be about 4
percent higher than 1997-98, Dar said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that in case the exports do not show the
desired level of growth, steps may be taken to discourage imports
of non-essential items. "The need of the day is that our exports
should pay for the imports," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The essence of the trade policy must be a sharp focus on
facilitation of exports by creating a conducive environment. It is
also imperative that the exports are not unnecessarily loaded with
costs making them not competitive," said Dar.

<HEADLINE> Greece's Alistratis Cave Opens to Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Alistratis cave, one of
the largest and most beautiful caves in Europe, was opened Monday
to visitors and researchers.
</P>
<P>
The cave in the northern Greek prefecture of Serres, which is
believed to date back 2 million years, covers an area of 25,000
square meters with an estimated three kilometers of underground
passages, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The calcified bones of small and larger prehistoric animals
have been discovered on the surface, and Greek authorities believe
that simultaneous exploration will not obstruct the tourist
exploitation of the cave, which has been described by the Greek
geology society as a "rare geological phenomenon of exceptional
beauty."
</P>
<P>
Paleontologists believe that the solubility of the limestone in
the area facilitated the development of the cave, with its network
of smooth, high-ceilinged passages and chambers.
</P>
<P>
The exploration and exploitation of the Alistratis cave is a
project partially funded by the European Union under the 1994-99
regional operational program for Greece's central Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> Russia Bewildered by Diplomat's Expulsion From Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on
Monday expressed "bewilderment and regret" over the expulsion of
an employee of Russia's mission in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"The action by the Swiss authorities was carried out without
explanation for the motives behind this decision," Spokesman
Valery Nesterushkin told a regular press briefing.
</P>
<P>
As reported by the Swiss press, the unidentified diplomat of
the Russian mission to Geneva-based United Nations agencies and
other international bodies was believed to be receiving
information about NATO enlargement from a Slovak diplomat.
</P>
<P>
He had been declared a perona non grata and barred from
re-entering Switzerland for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss move, Nesterushkin said, "evidently fails to conform
to the consistent development of Russian-Swiss relations and does
not contribute to the strengthening of Switzerland's role as an
important center of multilateral diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
Moscow was bewildered by the Swiss decision to make public an
incident which occurred a month ago, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Our initial contacts with Switzerland gave reason to believe
that this incident would not be made public," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nesterushkin said he regrets that "Switzerland has decided to
step aside from certain previous commitments."
</P>
<P>
Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Swiss media reports as
saying that the Russian diplomat was exposed by the spy agency of
a third country, possibly Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Interfax earlier reported that Moscow is hesitant on whether
to take any retaliatory actions.
</P>
<P>
"All this is very problematic, because (the diplomat was) an
official at a mission to international organizations and not at an
embassy," a source was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Circular Urges Care for Laid-Off Workers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee and the State Council have jointly issued a
circular today calling for ensuring the basic living standard for
laid-off workers and carrying out reemployment programs.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of factory layoffs in state-owned enterprises has
become increasingly prominent and attracted wide-spread public
concern in recent years," according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
The circular instructs Party committees and governments at all
levels to introduce effective measures to ensure the basic
livelihood of laid-off workers and to expand efforts to implement
reemployment programs.
</P>
<P>
Various achievements have been made concerning the issue due to
the joint efforts of local Party committees and governments at all
levels and people from all walks of life, according to the
document.
</P>
<P>
However, it warns that "we are facing a crucial situation" and
it will be difficult to carry out the task of ensuring the basic
livelihood of unemployed people and carrying out reemployment
programs.
</P>
<P>
Stronger measures must be adopted to deal with the issue in
order to ensure realization of the goals for the current
restructuring of state enterprises, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
It urges concerned parties to unify their understanding of the
issue by fully realizing the urgency and responsibilities
involved.

<HEADLINE> Circular Urges Care for Laid-Off Workers (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The large number of factory layoffs is not only a reflection of
the employment system and policies under the planned economic
system and the current shift of the nation's economic
structure, but is also a result of long-term overlapping, blind
construction, and the accumulation of contradictions in the
management of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Experiencing such historical events will be inevitable if China
wants to create a socialist market economy and introduce a modern
enterprise system, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that the current situation will bring temporary
difficulties to a segment of factory workers, but fundamentally
speaking is good for economic development and social progress, and
is in conformity with the long-term interests of the working class.
</P>
<P>
The circular says that dealing with the problem is both a major
economic issue and major political issue. At the same time, it is
not only a realistic and urgent issue, but also a long-standing
strategic issue.
</P>
<P>
"Successfully handling the issue is required by the nature
of the socialist system and is a compulsory duty of the
government and Party," according to the document.
</P>
<P>
It adds that the issue is related to the success or failure of
the effort to restructure state enterprises, as well as social
stability and consolidation of the socialist system.

<TEXT>
<P>
According to the circular, the government will continue current
efforts to ensure that the number of reemployed factory layoffs
will surpass the number of workers laid off by state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It pledges that over 50 percent of factory layoffs in 1998,
including previously and newly unemployed workers, will find new
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The circular notes that it will take five years for the
government to establish a social security system and employment
mechanisms that will meet the requirements of a socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
It terms the establishment of reemployment service centers as
an effective measure which represents a social security system
with Chinese characteristics. It asks all localities open related
agencies to serve laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
It proposes that the service sector, especially the commerce,
catering services, tourism and community service sectors, provide
major reemployment channels.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies should be provided to unemployed workers
who want to open business in the service sector, according to
circular. It notes that policies include simplification of
procedures for approving related businesses, tax exemptions for
the first three years of operation, and small loans from
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers in some areas could be hired for public works
projects such as road construction, environmental protection and
afforestation and landscaping projects.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers will also be encouraged to reclaim wasteland
and engage in grain cultivation, afforestation, animal husbandry
and fisheries projects.

improve the nation's social security system.
</P>
<P>
Reforms concerning the pension system, medical care and housing
must be implemented by all local enterprises, with benefits
excluding foreign nationals working in Sino-foreign joint
ventures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the establishment of a minimum living standard
security system in cities should be accelerated, it says.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, enterprises will be required to remit some
three percent of total salary payments to unemployment funds, up
from the previous one percent. Individuals will pay one percent
and units will pay the remaining two percent, according to the
document.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for greater efforts to build and improve labor
markets and accelerate training for laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
The circular encourages job agencies to provide free
services to laid-off workers and urges employers to hire more
female workers.
</P>
<P>
It calls for the closure of illegal job agencies and a crack
down on cheating in the labor market in order to maintain market
order.
</P>
<P>
The circular urges leading officials in local governments to
abandon bureaucratic approaches when dealing with the issue, and
urges them to gain an understanding of the situation facing
workers by learning of their difficulties, listening to
complaints, and actively helping them handle problems.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers should learn new concepts concerning the issue
of employment. The circular notes the glory in working at any type
of legal job.
</P>
<P>
The circular urges local Party committees and governments to
list the issue on the top of their agenda, and nongovernmental
groups are encouraged to play their due role in dealing with the
issue.

<HEADLINE> Pak Hopes to Improve Economic Ties With Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the National Assembly
of Pakistan Illahi Bakhash Soomro said here Monday that his
country hopes to broaden economic and trade relations with the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Soomro was talking to Speaker of the House of Representatives
of the Philippines Jose De Venecia Jr.,. who called on him at the
Parliament House, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated all the help provided by the Philippines to
Pakistan. "Pakistan needs the Philippines' help for its efforts to
be included in various regional organizations like the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Recapitulating the situation in the wake of nuclearization of
South Asia, Soomro told his guest that Pakistan was left with
little choice but to exercise its option to detonate nuclear
devices.
</P>
<P>
It had become necessary to protect the national security of
Pakistan and correct the regional power balance after India
conducted nuclear tests on May 11 and 13, he added.
</P>
<P>
Soomro also said the nuclear tests in South Asia have brought
the Kashmir dispute, which continues to remain a major source of
tension, into focus.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he briefed his guest on the four meetings held
between leaders of India and Pakistan in the past on the
initiative of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Another meeting is on the cards during the forthcoming summit
of the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation in Sri
Lanka to be held by the end of next month, Soomro said.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, de Venecia said there should be conscious
endeavors to promote economic cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He called for setting up forums of bilateral trade to explore
new opportunities to counter the economic crisis being faced by
both Pakistan and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines
arrived in Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi Sunday on a
four-day visit to the South Asian country and came here this
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> German FM to Urge Restraint in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said Monday he would call for restraint in Kosovo when meeting
ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova later this week.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians must refrain from all acts of violence as
international pressure on Belgrade to stop crackdown in Kosovo
continues, Kinkel told the German Radio Westdeutschen Rundfunk.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been running high in Kosovo since February, when
Serbian police clashed with ethnic Albanians seeking independence
from Belgrade and integration into neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has stripped the autonomy of ethnic Albanians, who
make up 90 percent of the province's population, since early 1990s
and strongly opposed any external intervention into the crisis.
</P>
<P>
For Belgrade, Kinkel warned that western countries had almost
run out of options to end the crisis except military intervention.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group of the United States, France, Russia,
Britain, Germany and Italy has urged the Yugoslav government to
curb violent acts and demanded progress in talks with ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) staged an air
strike exercise over the southern Balkans last week in a display
of strength against Yugoslavia over the crisis.
</P>
<P>
But Kinkel reiterated that NATO military intervention should
meet legal conditions approved by the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
On Russia's opposition to military intervention in Kosovo,
Kinkel said he believed Moscow would eventually revise its
position if all political pressure on Belgrade failed.
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview with the German Radio Deutschlandfunk
on Sunday, Kinkel said NATO was considering dispatch of ground
troops to neighboring Albania and the Republic of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Such a move was legally possible at the moment as the two
nations had joined the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program and
wanted stronger NATO military presence on their soils, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Monday categorically
rejected the accusation made Sunday by India that Pakistan was
involved in the recent killing of 25 Hindus in India-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman described as "self-serving" and
"totally baseless" the charges made by Indian Home Affairs
Minister L.K. Advani.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan condemned all acts of terrorism wherever they may
occur, including state terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said, "Pakistan continues to be the target of terrorist
activities aided and abetted by India."
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the Pakistani government had proof of the
involvement of Indian intelligence agencies in specific terrorist
acts committed in various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Advani hoped that through such unwarranted allegations the
Indian government could deflect attention from its sponsorship of
terrorism in Pakistan and also its brutal campaign of repression
against the innocent people of Jammu and Kashmir," the spokesman
further said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Foreign Minister's Visit to Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday denied the report
that Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi will visit Egypt to discuss
normalization of ties, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted an informed source at the Foreign
Ministry as saying that there is no plan for Kharrazi to pay a
visit to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The source added that Iran and Egypt have good cooperation in
regional and international forums, but there is no plan for such a
visit.
</P>
<P>
The Sharja-based daily al-Khalij Sunday quoted political
sources in Egypt as saying that Kharrazi is to travel to Cairo
next month to prepare the ground for resuming bilateral ties and
reopening embassies in Tehran and Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Iran severed diplomatic relations with Egypt after the late
Iranian shah ousted in the 1979 Islamic Revolution was allowed to
stay in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The two countries began to improve ties in recent months amid
efforts made by the moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to
break the political and economic isolation initiated by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a delegation of Iranian businessmen paid a
ground-breaking visit to Cairo and signed a cooperation protocol
with the Egyptian side.
</P>
<P>
In March, an Egyptian delegation visited Iran in a similar bid
to improve economic links.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two sides stood at 75 million
U.S. dollars in 1997.

BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
upcoming China visit is expected to further promote
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin made the remark during a recent

Zhongnanhai, headquarters of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"During my visit to the United States last year, President

He said China-U.S. relations have since witnessed constant
improvement with new progress in wide-ranging bilateral
cooperation and exchanges. "The consensus President Clinton and I
reached has gradually come true," according to the president.

The two countries have consulted and cooperated on a series of
major international issues, such as promoting peace and stability
on the Korean Peninsula, mitigating the Asian financial crisis and
easing tensions in South Asia, said Jiang.
</P>

"I enjoyed a successful state visit to your country and
President Clinton will soon pay a visit to China. I fully believe
the mutual visits will further promote the development of

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Refutes British Paper Report on Libyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Monday launched
a harsh attack against a British newspaper, Sunday Telegraph,
over its report that South Africa had struck an arms-for-oil deal
with Libya, saying the report is part of a disinformation
campaign against it.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government has noted with contempt the
article in London's Sunday Telegraph," Mandela's office said in a
strong-worded statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement described the article as "a pure fabrication"
invented by the newspaper and its unnamed sources.
</P>
<P>
The British paper said South African President Nelson Mandela
had approved a secret 300-million-Pound (500-million-U.S. Dollar)
deal to supply Libya with weapons and spare parts in return for
cut-price oil.
</P>
<P>
The South African statement said neither Mandela nor the South
African government and its agencies had entered into any
discussions -- let alone concluded any deals -- with Libya on
arms-for-oil transactions.
</P>
<P>
"If at all such a decision is ever taken, the South African
government will publicly declare its intentions and fully state
its reasons for doing so, " said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the paper report's speculation that the deal
raised fears that Libyan leader Muammar Gadaffi might acquire
details of South African chemical and bacteriological weapons
built up during the apartheid era, the statement said: "Besides
the other untruths contained in the article, the references to
chemical and biological weapons defy the imagination."
</P>
<P>
"We are therefore compelled to conclude that those who elected
to peddle these untruths are either part of a massive
disinformation campaign against our new democracy, or they have
allowed themselves to be used in such a campaign."
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph said the arms-for-oil deal was negotiated
by South African secret service officials. It gave no date for
the deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the paper said, South Africa would supply
spare parts for Libya's aging Mirage jet fighters and attack
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had also held out the possibility of supplying
Libya with its advanced Rooivalk attack helicopters, said the
paper.
</P>
<P>
Any such deal would violate United Nations sanctions, imposed
to put pressure on Libya to surrender two Libyan suspects in the
1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
which 270 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The statement said: "South Africa abides by decisions of the
United Nations on the issue of Libya. At the same time, we are
part of the resolutions of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) on how this matter should be resolved. We are working
closely with other OAU members and interested parties to seek an
amicable solution to this problem."
</P>
<P>
The statement said South Africa's National Arms Control
Committee, made up of cabinet ministers, is responsible for the
regulation and control of all exports of conventional arms from
South Africa, and it ensures that arms transfers are regulated
and controlled in a consistent, responsible and accountable
manner.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has long been defensive about ties with countries that
the West regards as sponsoring or encouraging terrorism. During a
visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton to South Africa in March, he
said critics of his ties with Cuba and Libya should "throw
themselves in a pool."
</P>
<P>
Mandela visited Libya twice last October. He has urged an end
to UN sanctions against Libya.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
reiterated that the Taiwan problem can be solved on the principles
of "Peaceful Reunification" and "One Country, Two Systems."
</P>
<P>
Jiang restated the stance of the Chinese government in a recent
interview with Elizabeth G. Weymouth from U.S.-based Newsweek at
Zhongnanhai, headquarters of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan problem is an issue on agenda of every
China-U.S. summit," Jiang told the U.S. reporter.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, the non-official contacts, beneficial to
deepen the mutual understanding between the Mainland and Taiwan,
have become ever frequent in recent years. "Taiwan has a
population of 22 million, of which 12 million have visited the
Mainland," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said in a recent conference on Taiwan, "we proposed to
develop an all-round relationship and increase cross-strait
exchanges." To peacefully reunify China, the two sides across the
Taiwan Straits should carry out political negotiations. As the
first step, "the two sides can first hold negotiations and reach
agreement on formally ending the state of hostility on the
principle of 'One China'," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"I think the proposal can dispel the apprehension of the Taiwan
authorities and meet the expectation of the Taiwan people to seek
peace and stability. It is also beneficial to the development of
cross-strait ties, as well as the peace and stability of
Asia-Pacific region," the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Whether the political negotiations will go ahead or not now
"depends on the Taiwan authorities," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Taiwan authorities, with the long-term interest of
compatriots across the straits and overall situation in mind, to
make active response to our proposal with their actions," Jiang
said.

<HEADLINE> WTO Entry Should be Balance of Rights and Obligations: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) should be realized with a balance of
rights and obligations, said Chinese President Jiang Zemin in a
recent interview with U.S.-based Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Elizabeth G. Weymouth, a special editor of the
magazine, that "I have expounded our views on the issue at the
first meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1993."
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, WTO, a global organization, is incomplete
without the membership of China, the world's largest developing
country. Moreover, "China will enter WTO as a developing
country. When China is admitted into the WTO there should be a
balance between our rights and obligations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"No matter what the outcome of the negotiations, our reform and
opening-up will go on and our determination and sincerity in
developing economic relations and trade with all other countries
in the world will not change," Jiang said, adding that China is
making more efforts in market access.
</P>
<P>
"On the issue, I would like to quote Xin Qiji, a famous poet of
the Song Dynasty, that 'Despite efforts of the mountains, the
river keeps flowing eastward'," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Jiang on China's Contribution to Easing Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China has contributed actively to
easing the Asian financial crisis while taking risks and paying a
price, Chinese President Jiang Zemin told U.S.-based Newsweek in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
"This is manifested in China's adherence to the policy of not
devaluing the renminbi and its provision of assistance for
Indonesia, the Republic of Korea and Thailand through bilateral
and multi-lateral channels," Jiang told Elizabeth G. Weymouth, a
special editor of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
"The economies of the world are increasingly inter-dependent
with each other so there ought to be a common standard to judge an
issue," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, one should not commend a country which
maintains the value of its currency, while giving tacit approval
to another country which devalues its currency. "Such practice is
incomprehensible," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Leaders of major countries in the world should be
far-sighted," Jiang said, adding that they should see the future
from a strategic point of view rather than only consider the
immediate interests.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, China and the United States share common interests
in stabilizing the Asian economies, so we would like to keep
dialogue and consulation with the U.S. for promoting the stability
and development of the economies in Asia," Jiang noted.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges India, Pakistan to Abandon N-Weapons Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Both India and Pakistan should
give up their nuclear weapons programs and unconditionally sign
the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, said Chinese President Jiang Zemin in a recent interview
with U.S.-based Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Elizabeth G. Weymouth, a special editor of the
magazine, that the recent nuclear tests have triggered a nuclear
arms race in South Asia, resulting in sudden tension in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"This will inevitably endanger the peace and stability of South
Asia and the world at large and have a big impact on the
international non-proliferation regime," Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to point out that the nuclear testing is against the
international trends, no matter whether the test is conducted by
India or Pakistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "We must not fail to note that it was India
who started the South Asia crisis."
</P>
<P>
As a close neighbor to South Asia, the Chinese president said,
China hopes to see continued peace and stability in the
region. And China will always play a constructive role on the
South Asian question.
</P>
<P>
To ease the tension in the region, "It is most imperative that
India and Pakistan keep cool-headed, exercise restraint, resume
dialogue immediately and refrain from any remarks or actions that
might further intensify tensions," Jiang stressed.

BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China's unemployment rate is
around 3.5 percent, according to Chinese President Jiang Zemin

for various kinds of training programs and will continue to
receive their salaries," Jiang said, adding that they will be
reemployed after learning new skills.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Urges U.N. Role in Solving Kashmir Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said
Monday that after the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, a very
effective role is needed from the United Nations for the
resolution of the Kashmir issue, the main cause of tension in the
region.
</P>
<P>
A pragmatic and serious approach is required to revive dialogue
for the resolution of the Kashmir issue, Sharif said while talking
to the media at the Parliament House.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said threats of use of force can serve the domestic
public but will not lead any country toward resolving the issue.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has expressed his intention
to send a special envoy to Pakistan and India to look into the
possibility of fresh efforts for finding a suitable solution to
the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said he had told Annan that the Kashmir dispute is the
"root cause" of tension in South Asia and urged him to play his
role for the settlement of the problem.
</P>
<P>
Sharif also said Pakistan should not be equated with India as
far as sanctions are concerned because nuclear detonation had
become inevitable for Pakistan's national security following
nuclear weaponization by India and this fact should not be ignored
by the world.
</P>
<P>
A thorough study of the situation would prove that Pakistan
cannot he held responsible for nuclear detonation. Because of the
prevalent situation in the region Pakistan had been in a fix to
take such steps for its national security, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I do not know what was the Indian objective for detonating
nuclear devices but Pakistan was compelled by the Indian action,"
the prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question about aggressive statements by the
Indian leadership, Sharif said the threatening postures cannot
work. The situation needs serious consideration and resumption of
meaningful dialogue between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sharif noted that he always pursues a pragmatic approach and
never resorts to threats, which bear a zero impact.
</P>
<P>
"Threats will not resolve anything but aggravate the situation,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Indian Rupee Plunges to New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee went into a
tailspin against the U.S. dollar and plunged to a historical low
of 42.81/85 to one dollar Monday at the Interbank Foreign Exchange
(FOREX) Market in Mumbai, India's financial city.
</P>
<P>
The Indian currency opened at 42.33/38 per dollar Monday,
sharply lower than the weekend finish of 42.18/20, and closed at
42.72/76, a new record low logged for a closing quote.
</P>
<P>
The downfall was driven largely by the announcement of Moody's,
an international credit rating agency, to downgrade India's
sovereign rating to below investment grade last week.
</P>
<P>
The agency lowered India's foreign currency country ceiling for
long-term debt and notes from BAA3 to BA2, the long-term foreign
currency deposit ceiling to BA3 from BA1 and the ceiling for
short-term debt to not-prime from prime-3.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
discussed Monday with U.S. presidential envoy Richard Holbrooke on
ways to ease his country's tension with Turkey in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
No statement was made after the 40-minute talks.
</P>
<P>
But diplomatic sources said Simitis, together with Holbrooke,
reviewed developments on the Cyprus issue, the relations with
Turkey and cooperation with the United States in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who arrived here earlier in the day with Thomas
Miller, the U.S. Department of State coordinator on the Cyprus
issue, initially requested the meeting with Simitis.
</P>
<P>
Simitis agreed to the talks in light of the fact that Holbrooke
had won nomination as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is also scheduled to meet Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos later Monday, and leave Athens on Tuesday for a
tour of Belgrade, Kosovo and Skopje.
</P>
<P>
Greece has been at odds with Turkey for decades over disputed
bordering waters, air space, and delimitation of the continental
shelf in the Aegean Sea, and the protracted Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Their relations have been worsening over Cyprus' planned
deployment of Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's claim of the four uninhabited islands in the eastern
Aegean Sea, Turkish war games in the Aegean Sea and Greece's firm
stance of not preparing to give up its right of veto against the
release of EU's financial aid package to Turkey have made the
tension between the two rivals even worse.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains Blamed for 21 Deaths in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Torrential rains were blamed for
the death of 21 Romanians over the past two weeks, the Ministry of
Water, Forestry and Environmental Protection said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A report of the official Rompres quoted the ministry as saying
that as many as 1,848 houses were swept away and 10,677 flats
inundated with the waters in 23 counties.
</P>
<P>
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu suspended his visit in
Austria and flew back on Sunday after receiving a complete report
of the damage registered.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, Prime Minister Radu Vasile visited some
flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Swollen rivers swamped 113,000 hectares of farmland, and more
than 2,000 kilometers stretch of roads and railway lines were
ruined or damaged by the rains, a report of the national
television station TVR-1 said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of livestock drowned. Many cities or villages were
blacked out and short of gas supply, and fresh water reservoirs
and fountains were left oozing of mud, the TV report added.
</P>
<P>
Romania has abundant rainfall in recent years, often causing
floods and landslides.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the National Institute of Meteorology attributed
that to the country's unrational massive wood clearings in the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of improper agricultural technologies, as well
as the lack of funds necessary for diking, were also blamed for
the increasing floods.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Foreign investment in Israel during the first five
months of 1998 was more than 50 percent lower than that of the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of Israel Bank Sunday attributed the drop to
the economic slowdown and the uncertainty about the peace process
in the country.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- An Israeli business delegation, led by Industry and
Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, is scheduled to pay a visit to
Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted by the Israel Export Institute
before the visit, Uzbekistan has potential for joint ventures with
foreign firms in oil and gas exploration, precious stones,
industry and tourism.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Foreign workers from Thailand comprise 75 percent
of all agriculture labor in Israel, according to a report on local
daily The Jerusalem Post on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that there are some 18,000 Thai agriculture
workers in the country, out of a total of 24,000 laborers in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Well-informed sources have confirmed that the current
talks in Washington by an Egyptian ministerial delegation are
aimed at reaching agreement on a new timetable on the abolition of
U.S. aid to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian daily "Alam Al Yom" quoted the sources as saying that
the Egyptian plan envisages the abolition of U.S. aid over a
period of 10 to 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's share of the U.S. foreign assistance now amounts to 2.1
billion U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
RAMALLAH, WEST BANK -- The Palestinian Minister of Planning and
International Cooperation Nabil Shaath has disclosed that donor
countries will meet in Washington in November to examine
international pledges to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
over the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting last Thursday in Gaza with representatives
of the donor countries, he briefed the participants about the
latest development plans and ways and means to accelerate the
payment of arrears. He indicated that donor countries' payments
this year did not exceed 250 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Shaath pointed out that the PNA is in much great need of
financial support to overcome its current financial crisis in view
of the Israeli government's efforts to undermine Palestinian
economy and sabotage the PNA development programs.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Strives to Eliminate Leprosy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- As an endemic country in the
world, the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal is doing its best to achieve
the goal of eliminating leprosy as a public health problem by the
year 2000, a health official said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua on Sunday, Dr. Jaya Prasad Baral,
director of the Leprosy Control Division under the Health
Ministry, said that at present Nepal has a prevalence rate of five
cases per 10,000 people. But it is making efforts to bring it down
to below one case per 10,000 people by 2000 as called upon by the
World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, the elimination of leprosy as a public health
problem means reducing the prevalence rate to below one case per
10,000 people, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1982-83 fiscal year, Nepal introduced a multidrug
therapy (MDT) as recommended by WHO and the therapy is
well-tolerated and accepted by patients and highly effective
compared with the dapsone monotherapy before 1982, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that for multibacillary (MB) leprosy which is
infectious and paucibacillary leprosy (PB) which is not
infectious, it took two years and six months respectively for
regular treatment. But after WHO introduced a revised MDT in
January this year, only one year is needed for curing an MB
patient.
</P>
<P>
And for single-skin lesion PB cases (SLPB), a single dose is
enough, he added.
</P>
<P>
The director said that in 1982-83, people believed that leprosy
was the curse of God while it was actually caused by food, the
environment and water.
</P>
<P>
But at present people are aware of the disease and treatment.
After the introduction of MDT, people believe that it is curable.
"Now they come voluntarily to the clinics," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At present, we have 12,000 cases under treatment," he said.
"We're providing MDT (free of charge) to all patients."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Baral said that under the integrated programs, there are
regional health directorate offices in all the five development
regions and under them there are health offices in all the 75
districts of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Under the district health office, we have the primary health
center, health post and sub-health post," he said. "At district
level, we have one supervisor of leprosy and tuberculosis."
</P>
<P>
"Up till now, 50,000 cases (of leprosy) have been cured through
MDT service," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said early detection and early treatment can save a leprosy
patient from disabling and disfiguring, but it is felt that many
hidden cases exist in society especially in the hilly areas and
the southern Terai plain, where people are illiterate and poor.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has approved the launching of a national
campaign in the near future to go from house to house to detect
leprosy patients with the help of WHO and non-governmental
organizations, which have been active in helping Nepal eliminate
leprosy.
</P>
<P>
Besides, there are special action projects for the elimination
of leprosy for difficult-to-access areas, Dr. Baral said.
</P>
<P>
The projects comprise public awareness campaigns, orientation
training to social workers, community leaders, teachers and health
workers and skin camps, where people suffering from skin diseases
gather together for the detection of suspect cases, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said the projects have already been implemented in one
district in eastern Nepal and one in the mid-western part of the
country. "We detected many cases from these activities," he added.
</P>
<P>
A Leprosy Elimination Campaign is also under way in the
country. "In this campaign, we especially focus on mass health
education and give education about the disease, about the cause of
the disease, about treatment facility and about the consequences
of not treating properly," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that at present the major problems facing his country
are difficult access to hilly areas, lack of trained manpower and
lack of health education.
</P>
<P>
In September, Dr. Baral and experts from other endemic
countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America will gather together
in Beijing, China, for the 15th International Leprosy Congress, to
explore practical plans for working toward a world without leprosy
which by 1997 had affected an estimated 1.15 million people around
the globe.

ISLAMABAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister of Bangladesh
Sheikh Hasina will pay a day-long visit to Pakistan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During her stay here, Hasina will call on Pakistani President
Rafiq Tarar and meet Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to discuss
bilateral and regional matters, according to the Associated Press
of Pakistan (APP) Monday.
</P>

its nuclear devices last month, APP quoted official sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Hasina's visit has special significance in
view of the recent developments in South Asia following the
nuclear explosions by India and Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Objects Referendum on Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- As the Israeli government began
discussing the possibility of holding a referendum on the next
redeployment in the West Bank, the opposition parties voiced their
objection to the idea on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition Labor Party leader Ehud Barak told
Israel Radio that only a "sleep walking" government will agree to
throw away over 100 million shekels (about 27 million U.S.
dollars) for a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Barak noted the opinion poll has already shown that 70 percent
of the public support the further redeployment. He called on Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to put his policy to test by holding
an early general election.
</P>
<P>
Another opposition Meretz Party leader Yossi Sarid also called
the referendum idea nothing but a gimmick.
</P>
<P>
He said that the peace process is in "a total stalemate,"
adding that Netanyahu used the referendum proposal to postpone
the implementation of the next redeployment.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Netanyahu, a special committee, headed by
Justice Minister Tzachi Hanegbi, convened its first meeting on
Monday to explore the possibility of holding a referendum on the
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Hanegbi told the meeting that he favored holding a non-binding
referendum instead of a binding one in a bid to avoid changes in
the basic law. But the committee did not reach a final resolution
on the issue and will meet again to continue the discussion.
</P>
<P>
The United States has presented a proposal for a 13.1 percent
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, in a bid to revive the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which has been deadlocked for
more than 15 months.
</P>
<P>
The American plan, which has been formally accepted by the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), also call on Palestinians to
reciprocate with tougher actions against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But the right-wing in the Israeli government rejected it,
citing that any withdrawal of more than 9 percent would endanger
the security of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure from the U.S., Netanyahu said that he is
considering taking the pullback issue to the public as a way to
solve the dispute in his government.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Reiterates Iran's Policy for Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
reiterated here Monday that Iran's policy is based on detente,
security and cooperation with friendly countries, especially the
states in the region.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with outgoing Qatari ambassador to Tehran Ali
Abdulaziz al-Kuwari, Khatami said that the common viewpoints
shared by Iran and Qatar on restoration of security and stability
in the region can serve to expand and deepen mutual cooperation in
various fields.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Qatar should have closer cooperation in view of
Iran's chairmanship of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC) and convention of the forthcoming 9th OIC summit in Qatar,
the official Iranian news agency IRNA quoted Khatami as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran tries to safeguard religious, moral and
cultural values and believes that real peace can be realized on
the basis of such values, adding that "we should not be
influenced by forces beyond the realm of our belief or national
interests."
</P>
<P>
"We want to have a world where all nations enjoy equal rights,
not the one where owners of wealth and power can dictate their
wishes to other nations," he said, adding that a prerequisite for
the realization of such a world is regional states' strength and
their ability to find their real status in the world community,
using their existing facilities and advantages.
</P>
<P>
Al-Kuwari said that his country is interested in further
expansion of Tehran-Doha relations in all spheres.
</P>
<P>
He expressed welcome to Khatami's stance on dialog among
civilizations.

<HEADLINE> Major Decisions Announced to Boost Pak Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
taken a number of major decisions to boost the country's export
and improve its balance of payments position.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the annual trade policy here Monday, Commerce
Minister Ishaq Dar said the government has decided to lift a ban
on the export of 15 items.
</P>
<P>
These include live animals, beef and mutton, grains, pulses,
blood meals and meat meals, bran and fodder, hides and skins, wet
blue leather, empty wooden crates, ferrous and non-ferrous metals,
arms and ammunition, maps and charts, unfinished and semi-finished
hockey blades, paper waste and oil seeds.
</P>
<P>
However, their exports will be regulated by the imposition of
export duties, if required, and will also be subjected to the
registration of export contracts/orders with the Export Promotion
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In order to curb smuggling, it has been decided that export of
kitchen items will be allowed via land route to Afghanistan and
through Afghanistan to Central Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Dar said the State Bank of Pakistan will make efforts for free
availability of export refinance as was done in 1997-98 and
arrange provision of at least 25 billion rupees (568 million U.S.
dollars) through banks as export finance during the 1998-99 fiscal
year (July 1-June 30).
</P>
<P>
Export Processing Units, which export at least 70 percent of
their production, will be allowed to import goods (inputs for
exports) without payment of customs duty and sales tax.
</P>
<P>
To promote small and medium enterprises, both direct and
indirect exporters, the Sate Bank of Pakistan will arrange
allocation of funds to the tune of 5 billion rupees (114 million
dollars), Dar said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that to make Pakistan's exports competitive, the
State Bank will make efforts to provide export refinance facility
to all direct and indirect exporters at a maximum markup of 80
percent from the existing rate of about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The services sector is assuming increasing importance in
international trade, Dar noted, adding that Pakistan also
possesses great potential in this sector.
</P>
<P>
It has been decided to provide export refinance on the export
of services in respect of contracts signed with foreign
governments, as applicable to the export of goods to increase its
contribution in export earnings, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said a number of other decisions have also been
taken to facilitate trade and simplify procedures, such as private
parties commodity exchange arrangements with foreign parties and
removal of restrictions on export of fruits and vegetables to
bordering countries.
</P>
<P>
In order to monitor and ensure implementation of the measures
of the trade policy, an Export Modernization Steering Committee
has been set up under the commerce secretary with representation
from other departments and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Dar said the trade policy decisions presented Monday have been
made in all sincerity to give a fillip to manufacturing activities
leading to enhanced exports.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends MINURCA Mandate Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Monday recommended to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA) for two
months until September 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The MINURCA, established in April 15, 1998, was aimed to
maintain security and stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council of the United Nations,
Annan said the political situation in the country remains
premeated by division and distrust among political parties, and
national reconciliation and the security situation are still fragile.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that if last peace is to be achieved, urgent action
is needed in the following priority areas: the credible
restructuring of the defense and security forces, the organization
of free and fair legislative elections, and economic and social
recovery.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general stressed the main responsibility for the
implementation of those essential tasks lies with the Central
African Government and the political parties, and at the same
time, it is clear that the government and people of the Central
African Republic need external assistance.
</P>
<P>
Annan also strongly urged all Central African parties to
reconcile their differences to allow for the urgent installation
of the Electoral Commission and the development of a detailed
operation plan for the elections.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief called upon the government and all other members
of the Central African civil society to implement in a timely
manner the plans developed by the Commission on the Restructuring
of the Defense and Security Forces, which were based on the
recommendations developed by the General Meeting on National
Defense held in September 1996 in Bangui.

<HEADLINE> Saudi King Sounds Caution on Possible Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz
warned on Monday that any Arab summit would be fruitless if it was
held without enough preparation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the weekly cabinet session, the king stressed the
need for "coordination and masterful preparations for any Arab
summit," saying "Any summit held without the necessary bases of
its success will be inconclusive."
</P>
<P>
According to the Saudi Press Agency, the king reaffirmed his
country's keenness on Arab solidarity on the basis of the Arab
League Charter and Arab agreements.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the strength of the Arab nations is mostly
linked to their unity and the respect of Arab summits' decisions.
</P>
<P>
The king stressed the need to double efforts to recover the
occupied lands of Palestine, the Golan Heights and south Lebanon,
and guarantee Palestinian people's rights to self-determination
and to an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd also reiterated that the aim of the visit by Saudi
Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz to
Jordan and Syria earlier this month was not limited to the Arab
summit issue.
</P>
<P>
A statement circulated on June 9 by the Saudi Royal Diwan said
the Saudi drive in Syria and Jordan was previously arranged and
included in a series of issues covering bilateral, Arab, regional
and international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
A possible Arab summit has been discussed since last month by
Arab leaders during their extensive talks about Arab and
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat paid a
surprise visit to Saudi Arabia late last month in pursuit of his
crusade to arrange a mini Arab summit to discuss the deadlocked
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was trying to persuade the Arab leaders to adopt a
united stance to confront Israeli intransigence by holding such a
summit.

<HEADLINE> Israel, France Widen Space Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to expand their
already strong cooperation in the space field, Israeli and French
scientists have selected three new space projects for joint
research, Israel Radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
During their two-day workshop in Tel Aviv, which ended Monday,
scientists from both countries reviewed their cooperation in the
use of space reconnaissance satellites for environmental studies,
and decided to engage in three additional programs in this area,
the radio quoted a leading Israeli researcher as saying.
</P>
<P>
Israel and France are currently working on four joint space
projects for environmental research, said Yuval Neeman, chairman
of the Israel Space Agency, one of the co-sponsors of the
workshop. The other sponsor was the French National Center for
Space Studies.
</P>
<P>
Neeman said Israel hopes to use its cooperation with France to
facilitate its integration into the European Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
Alain Ben-Soussan, director of the French space agency, said
France also has a need to widen its cooperation with
Israel. "Israel certainly has a strong industry and is very active
in computers and is already supplying French and European
industries with equipment. Israel is an active actor in this
field," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel and France began their cooperation in space in December
1990 when they signed an agreement for the Israeli reception of
data from a French satellite.
</P>
<P>
Besides France, Israel also has joint space projects with the
United States. It plans to send an astronaut into the space for 10
days aboard a U.S. shuttle in 1999, but Neeman said the date has
not been fixed.

<HEADLINE> Sharp Job Growth in the City Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Another 100,000 people will be
working in the City of London and the financial services industry
by 2015, whether or not the UK joins European economic and
monetary union, it has been forecast.
</P>
<P>
The forecast came from Tim Congdon, of Lombard Street Research,
in a report commissioned by the the Corporation of London Monday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Congdon, a famous economic commentator, believes that
City output will continue to grow at the 7 percent rate enjoyed
since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
He said his forecasts were based "on the identification and
consideration of long-term changes in the world economy, such as
the rapid growth of markets in countries such as China and India,
rather than short-term expectations of business growth."
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the City employed 275,000 people, of whom 195,000 were
located in the Square Mile. He said he expected such jobs would
grow by 1.75 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Creation of 100,000 extra jobs in less than 20 years, even if
some are located at Canary Wharf and other developments outside
the City, has implications for the property market, infrastructure
and planning, Congdon said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Congdon expected the growth in jobs to come on the
foreign exchanges, in derivatives and in high-value services such
as corporate finance and fund management.
</P>
<P>
Employment in domestic banking and insurance is forecast to be
static as staff shed to further productivity gains are replaced by
those employed in expanding areas, he added.

<HEADLINE> Cote d'Ivoire Gets Debt Relief from WB, IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) have announced an agreement to
support debt reduction package for Cote d'Ivoire under the
initiative for heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC).
</P>
<P>
The World Bank said in its latest edition of "World Bank News"
reaching here Monday that the assistance to be provided by all
the country's external creditors would reduce its debt burden by
345 million U.S. Dollars in net present value (NPV) terms.
</P>
<P>
"This is estimated to translate into debt-service relief over
time of close to 800 million Dollars," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"The assistance of 91 million dollars and 25 million dollars
in net present value will come from the World Bank and the IMF
respectively," it added.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, the completion point for the delivery
of the debt reduction will be March 2001.
</P>
<P>
The publication quoted Cote d'Ivoire's Minister of Economy and
Finance Emmanuel Niamian as saying that the decision of the bank
to approve debt reduction for the country is a welcome
development.
</P>
<P>
"The reduced debt burden will contribute to help the country
in realizing its economic and social objectives, achieve a
significant reduction in its debt burden, and accelerate its
progress in the fight against poverty," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Cote d'Ivoire is the fifth country to benefit under the HIPC
initiative, raising the total debt relife committed under the
initiative in NPV terms to about 2.8 billion Dollars in debt
service over time.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC initiative, established in September 1996, is
coordinated by the international finance community to reduce to
substantial levels of the external debt burden of heavily
indebted poor countries which pursue IMF and World Bank supported
adjustment and reform programs and for whom traditional debt
relief mechanisms are insufficient.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Israeli Plan to Expand Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi here on Monday condemned the plan approved by
Israeli cabinet to expand the boundaries of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The goal behind the plan is Judaization of Jerusalem by the
Zionist (Israeli) entity," Mohammadi was quoted by the official
news agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has said that by implementing the plan to
enlarge the city westward, Israel would annex about 18 percent of
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The move is a clear example of Israel's expansionist policies
and its disregard for international regulations, Mohammadi said,
calling on the world community, especially Muslim countries, to
encounter this issue seriously and unanimously.
</P>
<P>
Despite criticism from Palestinians and the United States, the
Israeli cabinet on Sunday endorsed, with no objection, the plan
for Jerusalem to encompass West Bank settlements and increase the
Jewish population by some 30,000.
</P>
<P>
The "greater Jerusalem" plan is widely seen as a violation of
the Oslo accords, which call on both sides refrain from unilateral
actions to change the status of Jerusalem pending final-status
talks, and is likely to trigger a new round of conflict between
Israelis and the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Foreign Minister Meets U.N. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf Monday met with Benon Sevan, executive director of
the Iraq Program of the United Nations, the Iraqi News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, al-Sahhaf talked about the U.N. Security
Council resolution 1175.
</P>
<P>
The resolution passed on Friday allows Iraq to spend 300
million U.S. dollars of the oil-for-food program revenues to buy
spare parts badly needed in its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf reiterated Iraq's rejection of turning the temporary
and exceptional program into a permanent arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program reached between Iraq and the U.N. in
1996 is an exception of the U.N. economic sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. It allows the country to
sell a limited amount of oil over six months to buy food and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf reviewed the hurdles in the implementation of the
program's distribution plan, such as delays in approving
procurement contracts, complicated banking procedure and lack of
coordination between the U.N. and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf called for removal of the hurdles in an effort to
speed up the implementation of the current distribution plan.
</P>
<P>
Sevan, who arrived here Sunday evening, voiced his
understanding of Iraq's position, stressing that the outstanding
problems would be thoroughly considered in the light of the Iraqi
proposals.
</P>
<P>
He promised to address the problems as soon as possible to help
expedite the implementation of the new distribution plan.

<P>
MONTPELLIER, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A second-half goal from striker
Leider Preciado gave Colombia a 1-0 win over Tunisia in Group G here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Santa Fe Bogota striker scored the goal 38 minutes into the
second half during a goalmouth melee.
</P>
<P>
He blasted another into the net one minute later but the goal was
disallowed by German referee Bernd Heynemann.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia almost equalized in the 87th minute when a Sami Trabelsi
header was saved by Colombian keeper Fardi Mondragon.
</P>
<P>
Luck was apparently not on the Tunisian side as a 29th minute
header from Mehdi Ben Slimane hit the post while a ball bounced off
Riadh Bouazizi in the 43th minutes went against the crossbar.

<HEADLINE> Bonn to Launch Legal Challenge to EU Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The German government will launch a
lawsuit to the European Court of Justice to challenge a planned
European Union ban on tobacco advertising, a spokeswoman of the
German Economics Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the decision formally adopted by the EU in Luxembourg
Monday, the 15 EU nations were required to phase out tobacco
advertising and sports sponsorship by the year 2006.
</P>
<P>
The German government, however, believed that the ban
contravened the principles of freedom of expression and violated
the professional freedom of the advertising industry as well as
the property rights of tobacco companies, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
She also said that if the ban was to be justified by health
protection for consumers, this was also an issue that should be
tackled by individual governments, not the EU.
</P>
<P>
After nearly ten years of negotiations, EU health ministers
agreed on the tobacco advertising ban at a meeting last December.
Germany and Austria were the only EU states which voted against
the decision. The European Parliament already approved the ban in
May.
</P>
<P>
German tobacco and publishing industries meanwhile lobbied
strongly against the EU plan which they said would lead to massive
job and revenue losses.
</P>
<P>
A German cinema advertising company also claimed earlier that
about a fourth of German cinemas would go bankrupt due to the
advertising ban.
</P>
<P>
German health organizations, however, support the EU decision
and call for tougher measures to protect non-smokers.

<HEADLINE> UK Housing Market Slowing Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The housing market in Britain is
slowing down, according to the Building Societies' Association and
estate agents Black Horse.
</P>
<P>
In May building societies' gross mortgage advances totaled
1.78 billion pounds (2.848 billion U.S. dollars) compared with 1.7
billion pounds (2.72 billion dollars) in April.
</P>
<P>
Net advances last month were 777 million pounds (1,243 million
dollars), up from 747 million pounds (1,195 million dollars) in
April.
</P>
<P>
Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies'
Association, said, "The housing market picked up slightly in May
with net advances at their highest level this year."
</P>
<P>
"However, on a seasonally-adjusted basis the housing market
appears to be flat. In the first four months of 1998 the number of
transactions was 4.6 percent down on the same period of 1997," he
added.
</P>
<P>
A separate report from Black House, released here Monday, said
that it now takes 13 weeks to sell the average house, two weeks
more than it did in February.
</P>
<P>
David Woodcock, managing director of Black Horse Agencies,
said, "There is no longer the froth apparent last year, when house
prices were escalating rapidly in the South East."
</P>
<P>
Observers in the housing market believe that consumers appear
to be heading back to mutual societies because they trust them to
offer competitive rates and value the safety of building
societies.

<HEADLINE> Russian Spokesman on Clinton's Upcoming China Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A Russian government spokesman said
Monday that U.S. President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to
Beijing will pave the way to a constructive strategic partnership
between the U.S. and China.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery
Nesterushkin noted that the visit, scheduled for June 25 through
July 3, "will return the October-November 1997 visit by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin."
</P>
<P>
"Such an exchange of visits at the top level is taking place
between the two countries after a long pause," the Itar-Tass news
agency quoted the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Jiang's U.S. visit last year "set a trend
towards leveling off and improving U.S.-Chinese relations."
</P>
<P>
He said that stability, security and international cooperation
in the Asia-Pacific, and the world at large, will hinge on the
ability of the two countries to establish durable relations.
</P>
<P>
On Russia-China ties, the spokesman recalled that in April 1996
the two countries announced the establishment of a strategic
partnership of cooperation oriented towards the 21st century and
characterized by equality and mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
"It is in this context that we consider prospects for further
development of contacts between Russia and China at the top and
high level," Nesterushkin said.

<HEADLINE> World Oil Stocks High: CGES </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Industry stocks of crude oil and
refined products are rising sharply in the second quarter this
year, Center for Global Energy Studies (CGES) announced here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Euroilstock statistics as saying "an average increase
of 1.6 mbpd over the past two months in the U.S. and Europe."
</P>
<P>
Crude runs remain high, as refiners take advantage of cheap
crude to maximize throughputs, and middle distillate stocks are
starting to look exorbitantly high as demand for heating oil drops
seasonally, CGES said.
</P>
<P>
Distillate stocks in the U.S. and Europe were 53 billion bbls
up on a year ago at the end of May, the center added.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the contango in the heating oil futures markets
has continued to widen and has reached record proportions in
Europe, where a flood of Russian gas/oil exports is putting
additional downward pressure on prices.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline also remains in an unseasonal contango, high runs
having removed any threat of a shortage this summer, CGES said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. stocks were 16 million bbls up on a year ago at the end of
May and European stocks rose last month, leaving inventories 7
million bbls up on last May, it added.

<HEADLINE> Lukashenko: Diplomatic Residence Incident Exaggerated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko said Monday that the incident surrounding the departure
of several foreign ambassadors from Minsk is being blown out of
proportion.
</P>
<P>
"An ordinary housing problem is being brought into a state
level," the Interfax news agency quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
His statement followed the departure earlier Monday of
ambassadors from Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Italy and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors accused Minsk of violating the Vienna
Convention on diplomatic rights in asking them to move out of the
posh Drozdy complex to allow for plumbing work.
</P>
<P>
The Belarussian Foreign Ministry, however, said it was the
ambassadors who violated the Vienna Convention.
</P>
<P>
In a statement circulated in Minsk Monday, the ministry said
the convention obliges diplomatic representatives to respect the
law of their host countries, abide by the decisions of their
governments and respect the traditions and culture of the people.
</P>
<P>
The statement, as quoted by the Interfax news agency, said
Minsk regrets that the necessary repairs at the Drozdy complex
caused inconveniences to diplomats.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's decision must be implemented, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
President Lukashenko seemed to have softened his stance, saying
that he is ready to meet with the ambassadors at any time to
discuss any respect of their moving.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Bans Another Two Tabloids for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has banned another
two kiswahili language tabloids for featuring of pornographic
cartoons.
</P>
<P>
The ban on Tingisha and Watu, effective on Monday, came after
the editors of the papers refused to heed to the government
warnings of not publishing pornographic cartoons which have
adverse effects on the general public especially children.
</P>
<P>
A government statement released here Monday said that the
suspension of production, printing and distribution of the papers
has been in accordance with the Newspapers Law of 1976 and
Newspapers Procedures of 1977.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in a month that the government has
banned tabloids for persistently carrying pornographic cartoons
and articles. The first three tabloids -- Chombeza, Arusha Leo
and Kasheshe -- were banned by the government on June 6.
</P>
<P>
The Tingisha tabloid was first advertised on June 11 through
radio and television and appeared in the streets the following
day. The paper had all similarities to Kasheshe. The difference
was the name only, while Watu replaced Chombeza, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers are said to have challenged the government and
tried to measure its ability to control the publication of
pornographic cartoons.
</P>
<P>
The Tingisha also did not give the correct name of the
publisher, address and the issuing place either in the front or
in the last page as stipulated in Newspapers' Law of 1976.

<P>
Nujoma singled out the Saharan-Sahelien Community which

<P>
In his message to Gaddafi, Nujoma said he hoped the new group

people.
</P>
<P>
The creation of regional groupings would eventually lead to a
wider African community capable to advance African unity.
</P>
<P>
Libya was one of the countries which gave strong backing to
the Namibian people during their struggle for national
liberation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Tracking Teenagers' Cigarette Choices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
ordered Monday that the government survey which brands of
cigarettes teenagers smoke, as a way to hold tobacco companies
accountable for "targeting children" with advertising.
</P>
<P>
The executive order directs the Department of Health and Human
Services to chart the brands preferred by teenagers as part of an
annual survey of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
The move came five days after Senate Republican leaders shelved
a tough anti-smoking bill. Clinton said he has not given up on
getting legislation passed but believes the survey of teen
smokers' brands will serve a purpose "while we wait for Congress
to heed the call of America's families."
</P>
<P>
"Once this information becomes public, companies will then no
longer be able to evade accountability, and neither will
Congress," Clinton said before leaving for a family conference in
Nashville, Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to issue an executive order in Nashville,
instructing federal agencies to begin enrolling uninsured children
in Medicaid -- the federal health insurance programs covering tens
of millions of poor, elderly and disabled Americans, including
those on welfare, low-income children -- according to a White
House official who spoke Sunday on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The seventh annual Family Re-Union conference, sponsored by
Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, there is focused on
health issues.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reportedly also planned to renew his call for Congress
to pass his proposed "patient's bill of rights," to protect the
rights of people enrolled in managed-care programs.
</P>
<P>
At the Nashville conference, Gore planned to announce a new
public-private Medicare Council, through which about 80
organizations would work to ensure that the elderly get
information on preventive care and wellness.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the year, Clinton ordered several agencies to make a
greater effort to enroll children who are eligible for benefits
under Medicaid. Government estimates show that about 4.7 million
children out of roughly 10 million uninsured children are
eligible.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Condemns Russia's Nuclear Deal With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States Monday
condemned Russia's decision to extend a nuclear deal with India
despite India's latest nuclear test and asked Moscow to reconsider
its decision.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Russia and India signed an agreement to cooperate in
building two 1,000 megawatt reactors at Kudankulam in south India,
claiming it was a supplement to a 1988 deal not put into effect
because of the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
"This is not good news," State Department spokesman James Rubin
said. "It's the wrong message at the wrong time and we are going
to urge the Russians to reconsider," he told a briefing.
</P>
<P>
"Even before India's latest test we urged Russia not to proceed
with the reactor sale to India as it is not consistent with
Russia's obligations as a member of the nuclear suppliers group"
not to sell reactors to countries which do not have "full-scope"
safeguards, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The deal undercuts "the good work we have done together" in the
frame of the permanent five members of the U.N. Security Council
and the Group of Eight to get India to understand that nuclear
testing does not bring rewards, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
India conducted five nuclear tests and then Pakistan followed
the suit last month. The P-5 countries condemned the move.
Washington announced a wide range of sanctions against India.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Push Demilitarization Idea: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said on Monday that Cyprus is willing to
begin a dialog on security issues with the aim of achieving
demilitarization on the island.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark while commenting on Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides' letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan last
week. In the letter, Clerides urged the U.N. chief to intervene
personally to reduce military tension on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides told a press briefing that his government believes
the president's letter "formulates our willingness and our
dedication to demilitarization that is directly linked to the
issue of security."
</P>
<P>
He said Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides will begin efforts
to promote the demilitarization proposal which will be in the
center of discussions and initiatives for a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
Tensions are running high on the Mediterranean island. In
January last year Cyprus ordered Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles, which are expected to be delivered later this year.
</P>
<P>
The move angered Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots who saw it as
a threat to their security. Cyprus, however, has maintained that
the deal can only be reconsidered when progress can be made in the
island's demilitarization process.
</P>
<P>
Last week Cyprus accused Turkey of creating "artificial
tension" by sending warplanes and warships to the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled northern part of the island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's action was in retaliation for a visit to the Greek
Cypriot part of the island earlier last week by six Greek Air
Force warplanes.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the island in 1974
after a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Continues Consultations on Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat Monday continued consultations with
different political factions and members of the Palestinian
Legislative Council over cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Arafat chaired a meeting in Ramallah, West Bank, which was
attended by senior officials of the Fatah Movement, the
Jerusalem-based Palestinian media service JMCC reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting focused on the issue of cabinet reshuffle and the
latest developments of the peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Fatah is the strongest and most popular Palestinian group
founded and led by Arafat himself.
</P>
<P>
During Arafat's consulations with members of the Palestinian
legislature, Sulaiman Romi, member of the Islamic bloc, called on
him to reduce the number of ministers, assigning them more duties,
JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
Romi said that Arafat has promised that the upcoming cabinet
reshuffle would reflect the demands made by the legislature and
its members, according to the media service.
</P>
<P>
Independent members of the legislative council Ziyad Abu Amir
and Kamal Shrafi suggested that the appointment of new cabinet
ministers be based on educational qualifications.
</P>
<P>
They voiced support for and spoke highly of the consultations,
which they said could lay a solid foundation for confronting the
Israeli intransigence in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
After he started consultations last Tuesday, Arafat has met
with leaders of the legislative council, Hamas, the Islamic Jihad
and other political factions.
</P>
<P>
The leaders have expressed welcome to Arafat's consultation
efforts, which they said are conducive to national reconciliations.
</P>
<P>
The consultations are expected to continue for a few more days
before Arafat announces the formation of a new cabinet.

MONTPELLIER, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Colombian won their game against
Tunisia on continual attacks, coach Hernan Dario Gomez said here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Our continual attacks finally paid off. To sum up, the
players kept up the pressure and ended up winning. We're a very
unified team."
</P>
<P>
He added, "The match was very hard. Both teams made serious
defensive errors. In the first half, our passing was mediocre, but the
players gained in confidence in the second half."
</P>
<P>
Substitute Leider Preciado said he was pleased with his 83rd-minute
winner that gave Colombia a 1-0 win.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy to repay the confidence that coach Henan Gomez
showed in me when he brought me on. It was very important."
</P>
<P>
Tunisian coach Henryk Kasperczak said, "We played the ball well,
what was lacking was our finishing."
</P>
<P>
He added, "We are disappointed. We are bitter. But after this
second loss, we need to maintain our confidence and morale when facing
Romania. If Romania lost to England we still have chance to qualify."

<HEADLINE> Canadian Family Income Remains Flat in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Canadian family after-tax income
remained almost unchanged in 1996 for a second consecutive year,
Statistics Canada reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from a modest increase in 1994, average income declined
throughout the early 1990s," the federal statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Annual after-tax income averaged 45,032 dollars (30,620 U.S.
dollars) in 1996, about the same as in 1995 after adjustments for
inflation, but down 5 percent from the peak in 1989.
</P>
<P>
However, Canada's family income taxes reached an all-time
average high of 11,597 dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
About 20.5 percent of total family income went to income taxes,
up from the 1990 peak of 19.8 percent, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Though the gap between Canada's highest income families and the
lowest has been growing since 1980, the after-tax ratio has
remained almost the same, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Families in the top 20 percent of incomes earned 22 dollars for
every dollar earned by families in the bottom 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
But after taxes and government transfers, the gap was reduced
to five dollars for every one dollar, the agency said.

KAMPALA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the Ugandan Lord
Resistance Army (LRA) abducted 40 girl students from a secondary
school in the northern Acholi district in the early hours of
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here Monday said the abduction took
place at the St. Charles Lwanga Kalongo Secondary School at 1:00
a.m..
</P>
<P>
Owiny Dollo, the Minister of State for Northern Uganda
Reconstruction Program, condemned in the strongest terms the
abduction of children and continued victimization of the entire
Acholi people.
</P>
<P>
He urged the LRA rebels to lay down arms and stop inflicting
so much pain on the civilian people, adding that if the rebels
have any cause against the government, they should not pursue it
through abduction of children or traumatization of the unarmed
civilian population.
</P>
<P>
The rebels' activities targeting unarmed civilians have
triggered harsh criticism and relentless condemnation from all
walks of life.
</P>
<P>
The administration and students of St. Mary's College in Aboke
District in the north have expressed their great pain about the
calculated act of terror and pleaded the rebels to release the
girls.
</P>
<P>
The Concerned Parents Association also directed its accusing
finger to the merciless rebels, saying that attacking innocent
students is a very worrisome situation that is unacceptable.

<HEADLINE> Senior Arab Official Raps Israel's Nuclear Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior Arab official Monday rapped
Israel's nuclear program, saying it harms the stability of the
Mideast region, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's possession of nuclear arms clashes with the drive to
establish just and durable peace, which is called for by the Arabs
and the whole world," said Mahmud Barakat, chairman of the Arab
Atomic Energy Authority (AAEA).
</P>
<P>
This state of affairs will drag the whole region into an
unbalanced situation, he added. Barakat made the remarks on the
sidelines of the AAEA technical committee's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held here Monday at the Arab League
headquarters to outline a draft agreement on rendering the Middle
East a zone free from weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"Peace with Israel requires that it should not possess nuclear
weapons otherwise peace would be fragile," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Barakat ruled out the possibility that Israel would
use its nuclear arms. He underlined the Arab stance on using
nuclear power for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
The committee chief, Mahmud Karem, said that Egypt is closely
following up all nuclear activities by the region's countries,
particularly Israel, the only Mideast country that is believed to
possess nuclear weapons.

ANKARA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister

</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation
President Eyup Ganic, Ecevit said that Turkey would help the
war-torn country solve its economic and security problems.
</P>
<P>
"The Bosnian-Herzegovina federation is one of the most
complicated state structures in world political history. We want
the Dayton peace accord to work and the Bosnians, Croats and
Serbs to live in peace and unity," Ecevit was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that contributing to the proper functioning of the
federation was a humanitarian and national duty for Turkey.
</P>

Ganic, for his part, said that Bosnia needs Turkey's help in

region is impossible without Turkey's cooperation.

He said that serious problems still exist in his country,
especially in the province of Sanacak, where the mainly populated

<HEADLINE> UK Plans to Amend Law to Safeguard Press Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw
said Monday the government would change the law to make it easier
for newspapers and broadcasters to fight attempts to gag them in
the courts.
</P>
<P>
Straw said he would table an amendment to the Human Rights Bill
which would require courts to have "particular regard" to the
importance of the right to freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
The Human Rights Bill is designed to enshrine in British law
provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, which
includes elements which have up to now been largely absent in
British law, such as the right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
In cases involving journalistic, literary or artistic material,
courts will have to consider a range of other factors including
the public interest and codes of conduct regulating the right to
privacy, he said.
</P>
<P>
In line with the amendment, it will also be harder for a
plaintiff to obtain an interim injunction or gagging order to halt
the publication or broadcast of material.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Legislature Condemns Israeli Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) Monday condemned Israel's Jerusalem expansion plan
as being "illegal."
</P>
<P>
"The announcement of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
about the Jerusalem expansion (plan) is illegal and must be fought
by every means if the Israeli government does not retract this
decision," PLC Speaker Abu Ala said in a statement issued in
Ramallah, West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet Sunday approved a plan which will set up an
"umbrella authority" for the Jerusalem municipality over eight
West Bank settlements to the north, east and south of the city.
</P>
<P>
"All activities and unilateral measures that Israel put on the
ground of Jerusalem and other areas are illegitimate and invalid,"
the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
Under agreements signed between the Palestinians and Israel,
neither side should take unilateral actions related to Jerusalem
and Jewish settlements, items on the agenda of the final status
talks for a permanent peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The speaker stressed that the traditionally Arab East Jerusalem
was occupied by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War and it must
withdraw from every inch of the city.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their
future independent state.
</P>
<P>
"It becomes clearer every day that the language Israel is
speaking is not the language of peace," the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the world parliaments which believe in justice and
peace to denounce the Israeli decision and pressure the Jewish
state to reverse the decision which is in opposition to peace.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Israel announced the plan Sunday, Palestinian
officials accused Israel of trying to change the status of the
Jerusalem and demanded Israel to reconsider it.

<HEADLINE> Prominent Party Figures Swarm to Maryland to Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Big-name Republicans are making
trips to Maryland, that is considered a most Democratic state, in
hopes of making a political breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
With the primary election just three months away, three
governors, two potential presidential contenders and a U.S.
senator have come to raise money for Republican gubernatorial
candidate Ellen Sauerbrey.
</P>
<P>
More are on the way. House Speaker Newt Gingrich will be coming
Thursday, to be followed by three more governors and one of the
Republican's most prominent black officials, Representative J.C.
Watts of Oklahoma, according to an Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans' zeal shows that they believe they have a rare
opportunity to claim the governorship in a state where election of
Democrats is almost automatic.
</P>
<P>
Democrats have occupied the governor's mansion in Maryland for
almost four decades, the only exception being two years in the
1960s when Republican Spiro T. Agnew was Maryland governor.
</P>
<P>
"The reason that you are seeing so many VIPs coming into
Maryland is there is a clear recognition by the Republican
leadership across the country that this seat is going to be
competitive and we have a good shot at it," the AP report quoted
South Carolina Governor David Beasley, chairman of the National
Republican Governors Association, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Sauerbrey narrowly lost to Democrat Parris Glendening four
years ago, by fewer than 6,000 votes in a state where registered
Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
This year, Sauerbrey is seen as the front-runner in the race
for the Republican nomination, while the incumbent governor is
fending off three challengers.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the Republican's high-profile support of
Sauerbrey, many prominent Democrats have been slow to back the
governor's re-election.
</P>
<P>
Except for an appearance last year by Vice President Al Gore,
Glendening has not had any fund-raising help from national
Democrats. Peter Hamm, a campaign spokesman, said the governor
expects help will materialize after the primary election.
</P>
<P>
Hamm said many moderate Republicans are supporting Ms.
Sauerbrey out of party loyalty, not support for her conservative
positions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retaliates in Dispute With Belarus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced
Monday that Belarus' ambassador to Washington will not be welcome
back when he ends a vacation at home because of a dispute over the
residences in Minsk.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told a regular briefing
that "it would be inappropriate for the Belarussian ambassador to
return to Washington until further notice."
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin declined to say the United States was expelling
Valery Tsepkalo, the Belarussian ambassador, or declaring him
persona non grata.
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a bridge we're not going to have to cross...if
we were barring him, I would have said so. We're telling them it's
a very bad idea for him to return," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
Tsepkalo left Washington in late May before the dispute
became serious, and had planned to be back by the beginning of
July.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors from the United States and five European countries
left Belarus today to protest the government's attempt to evict
them from a diplomatic compound.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the government cut water and power supplies to the
diplomatic compound and had ditches dug inside the compound's
gates, which prevented cars from entering.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that Belarus' behavior was an unprecedented
violation of the Vienna Convention on the treatment of diplomats
and that the United States was looking at other steps, including
direct and proportionate retaliatory actions.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Belarus' conduct had damaged relations with the
United States and other countries and would isolate Belarus from
the international community.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government said Monday
that it will always be committed to the upgrading of radiation
protecion infrastructure by providing necessay resources to
achieve basic safety standards.
</P>
<P>
Opening a regional training workshop on radiation protection
in mining and milling, Assistant Secretary of the Health
Ministry, Edgar Sivile noted that the mutual sharing of knowledge
and experience on sound radiation protection may truly benefit
all communities and contribute to a healthy and sustainable
environment.
</P>
<P>
He told the five-day workshop that in devising strategies and
developing national regulations and standards to improve
radiation safety in Africa, regional cooperation should be
emphasized and sharing of limited resources, pooling of
experience and exchange of information are important factors.
</P>
<P>
"We are all exposed to radiation at the time. Most perople
receive their greatest radiation dose of exposure from natural
radiation, mainly from radon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Radon is a natural radioactive gas with no smell, taste or
colour from the minute amounts of uranium present in all earth
materials such as rocks, bricks and concrete.
</P>
<P>
Radon seeps into enclosed spaces such as mines and into
houses, schools and places of work.
</P>
<P>
When inhaled, Sivile said, these particles will increase the
risk of developing lung concer.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to facilitate the transfer of technology
involving ionizing radiation, the application of internationally
accepted basic safety standards for radiation protection is
indispensable for the local use of nuclear technology for
socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
Attending the workshop are 11 African countries including
Algeria, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia and Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Diana Fund to be "Living Memorial" in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Diana, Princess of Wales
Memorial Fund will continue its work indefinitely and become a
"living memorial through helping those in need and distress," a
statement by the trustees said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, approved by Buckingham Palace and the Spencer
family, the memorial fund trustees set out the type of charities
they intended to support and the way the money would be
distributed.
</P>
<P>
The fund, which has raised 50 million pounds (80 million U.S.
dollars), will give a minimum of 4 million pounds (6.4 million
U.S. dollars) to good causes every year.
</P>
<P>
Donations have poured into the Diana, Princess of Wales
Memorial Fund since she died with her companion, Dodi Fayed, in a
car crash on August 31 of last year in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The trustees identified four areas into which funds would be
channelled: displaced people, people at the margins of society,
survivors of conflict and the dying and bereaved.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Attaches Importance to Corporate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government attaches
importance to corporate governance, Vice President Christon Tembo
told a workshop on corporate governance here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"As a government managing the affairs of the nation with
transparency and accountability under the rule of law, we see
corporate governance as an important lever in making executives
accountable to their shareholders, suppliers, customers,
employees of companies they run and society at large, " Tembo
said.
</P>
<P>
As globalization and liberalization intensify, corporate
governance is no longer an esoteric branch of commercial law, it
is becoming a matter of central concern in many countries, he
told the opening meeting of the three-day workshop.
</P>
<P>
While liberalization is a welcome instrument for promoting
efficiency among corporate entities, it also carries with it
inherent dangers of corporate fraud and deception as well as
corporate collapse, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia, there are also unscrupulous business promoters
defrauding investors handicapped by imperfect information but
drawn to transfer their finances to those promoters on the
promises of high returns on investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tembo said that there is also bank failures that have locked
in what in numerous cases have turned out to be the only savings
of unsuspecting customers.
</P>
<P>
"In this connection, we not only see corporate governance as a
bulwark against irresponsibility in the corporate world but also
a tool to be used by managers to run companies with prudence and
integrity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the participants will rise to the
challenge by evolving a model of corporate governance in his
country that should facilitate corporate success and contribute
to generation of enhanced investor-confidence in the country's
corporate sector, employment, poverty reduction and development.
</P>
<P>
On Zambia's economy, he said his country is at a stage where
most of the economic assets have been transferred to the private
sector through privatization.
</P>
<P>
Stabilization and privatization have brought in their wake, an
incentive structure that is explicitly pro-business, Tembo said.
</P>
<P>
Structural reform of the enabling environment for private
sector development has also seen the removal of legal impediments
to free enterprise and free competition and the development of a
stock market, Tembo said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Official Discusses Pension Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- An expert from the World Bank
has suggested that China introduce reform of the existing pension
insurance system in order to overcome the extensive social and
economic pressure resulting from the aging problem expected early
next century.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the International Symposium on China's Social
Security which opened here today, Estelle James said the nation's
existing pension system is underfunded and lacks clearly defined
benefit plans and will fail to fulfill requirements or provide
sufficient social security for the elderly in the next century
unless it is replaced or traditional insurance is supplemented
with personal accounts funded with clearly defined contribution
plans.
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, the government determines the
amount of pension insurance for retirees and enterprises must
remit a certain percentage of salaries to labor departments which
allocate the bulk the funds to old-age pensions.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, the system requires younger people to pay
pensions for the elderly," according to James. She added that the
system has been unsustainable in recent years and will become
increasingly weak as the country faces a serious aging problem
resulting from the rising average life expectancy and
declining birth rate.
</P>
<P>
Old-age pension payments have emerged as a major burden for
both young workers and enterprises due to the increasing number of
people eligible to receive pensions, said the expert, adding that
replacement rates are also expected to rise along with the
increasing proportion of retirees who worked under the pension
system qualify for full benefits.
</P>
<P>
Demographers predict that the aging problem will reach a peak
around 2030 when more than a fourth of the world's elderly
population will live in China.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Official Discusses Pension Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Elderly Chinese at that time, or the younger generation at
present, will lack the protection of efficient social security
system even though they formerly supported their elders,"
according to James.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the time for replacing the traditional pension
system with the personal savings insurance system has arrived. The
latter system will enable the government to open personal accounts
for employees who will receive total savings and accumulated
interest in the form of retirement pensions, said James.
</P>
<P>
The effort to introduce the market to the Chinese economy
during a period of sustained rapid economic growth and constantly
improving living standards for 1.2 billion people is of special
significance, according to James.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the new system will offer greater promise and
protect workers from financial uncertainties," she added.
</P>
<P>
The new system will ensure equality in pension assignments
between generations by eliminating losses for the young generation
and providing gains for the older generation.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Xiaochuan, president of the Construction Bank of China,
agreed that the new system will base benefits on amounts credited
to account for each worker on an annual basis, plus investment
returns and bank interest.
</P>
<P>
The system will help workers learn to prepare for their
pensions with early savings and at the same time will increase the
efficiency of insurance competition, said Zhou, adding that reform
of the system will convince young employees to open personal
pension accounts.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that establishing the new system involves
many difficulties. For example, the government has to maintain the
existing pension system for existing and future retirees who have
only limited personal savings accounts due to relatively low wages
and rising cost of living.
</P>
<P>
This will overburden members of the in-between generation who
will not only have to fund pensions for their elders, but also
contribute to their own personal pension savings, according to
Zhou.
</P>
<P>
He called for further pension reform at the earliest possible
date. "Otherwise the country's pension system will face serious
problems in the decade between 2010 and 2020", said Zhou.

<HEADLINE> Official Warns Against Spreading of Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Singapore official
Tuesday warned that the spreading of the present raging Asian
financial crisis will plunge the world into recession.
</P>
<P>
George Yeo, Singapore's minister for information and the arts
and second minister for trade and industry gave the warning in a
speech at a dinner for the Business Week 8th Asian Leadership
Forum, the theme of which is "Crisis and Confidence: Building a
New Asia."
</P>
<P>
"We are entering a dangerous period in world history," Yeo
said. "The present Asian crisis is a very much institutional
crisis."
</P>
<P>
If the crisis got a chance to reach America and spread, he
said, the whole world could plunge into recession.
</P>
<P>
He also warned, "The economic crisis now raging through Asia
can also lead to an anti-U.S. backlash of one kind or another."
</P>
<P>
Probing the cause of the current Asian crisis, Yeo said the
shift in U.S.-Japan relations has been playing a major part.
</P>
<P>
Calling the United States the "world's largest debtor nation"
and Japan "the world's greatest creditor nation," he said, "We
thus have a situation where the greatest power on earth is also
the world's largest debtor nation, while the world's greatest
creditor nation, for historical reason, is unable to lead."
</P>
<P>
"This creates a dangerous fault line in world politics and
economics," the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The evolving U.S.-Japan relationship, the emergence of China
and the disintermediation of economic and political structure by
IT ( information technology) are tectonic shifts which will cause
earthquakes throughout the region for many years to come," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out, "Without the U.S., Japan and China
acting decisively, the Asian crisis can get much worse."
</P>
<P>
"The success of (U.S.) President (Bill) Clinton's visit to
China in the next two weeks is very important for this reason," he
added.
</P>
<P>
On China, the minister said, "China's decision not to devaluate
the Renminbi despite the loss of export competitiveness has helped
 stabilize the economic situation in Asia."
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of China's economy in the world, he
said, "An early entry of China into the WTO is good for the whole
world."
</P>
<P>
On his own country, Yeo said, "The expected growth rate for
this year will have to be revised downward although it is still
not likely to be negative."
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that next Monday, on June 29, Singapore's
finance minister will announce in the parliament a package of
off-budget measures to check the economic slowdown in his country.
</P>
<P>
The focus will be to reduce business costs and help business to
cope with this difficult period, he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 business and political leaders including former
British Prime Minister John Major are attending the three-day
forum.

<HEADLINE> Economists Stress Positive Aspects of Economic Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China's economy has not entered a
recessionary period, despite the fact that the country faces
various economic problems such as a declining growth rate and
unemployment, according to a senior economist.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's session of an international symposium on
China's social security system, Liu Guoguang, former
vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said
that various positive conditions may help China achieve its
economic goals for this year.
</P>
<P>
"China's current transportation, energy, raw materials supply,
agriculture and foreign exchange reserve conditions are at the
highest levels in history and can fully support an economic growth
rate of over 8 percent," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
He noted that measures designed to push the economy forward are
beginning to play their role despite the fact that the GDP growth
rate for first half of this year was less than eight percent and
ended the period at between 7-7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The government is extending great efforts to encourage more
employment and increased investment," said Liu, adding that
investments in fixed assets grew by 12.7 percent for the first
five monthes of this year.
</P>
<P>
Liu, the former editor-in-chief of the magazine Economic
Research, said that further experimentation in the housing and
rural markets will provide good news for China's economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
"Rural residents account for 70 percent of China's total
population, but only 40 percent of total consumption," according
to Liu.

<HEADLINE> Most Indians See Government Conduct as Immature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide opinion poll showed
that some 75 percent of Indians think that the government's
handling of the situation after India's nuclear tests at the
international level was very "immature, inept and at times rather
arrogant."
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Tuesday that the poll
was conducted by the Center for Media and Culture Research among
10,800 people in all metropolitan cities and major state capitals.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of 72.86 percent of the people
interviewed do not want Indian defense forces to use nuclear
weapons against any country, according to the result of the poll
published in Jaipur, about 300 kilometers southwest of here.
</P>
<P>
To a question on economic sanctions imposed by certain
countries, 39 percent said the sanctions would hurt the Indian
economy badly while 52 percent said India would overcome them.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Feels Impacts of Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 23 (Xinhua) - Southeast Asian financial crisis
and price fluctuation in international commodity market are having an
ever increasing impact on Mongolian economy, said Mongolian Prime
Minister Elbegdorj Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's trade ties with Southeast Asian countries have been
expanding rapidly in recent years, with imports in the first five
months this year from these countries increased two times over the
same period last year, Elbegdorj told a Xinhua reporter.
</P>
<P>
But as a result of the negative impact of Southeast Asian
financial crisis, the prices of fine copper powder and cashmere,
Mongolia's main export products dropped sharply as against those
in last year. The prices are continuing to slide, resulting a sharp
reduction of Mongolia's trade income. The copper powder alone
would bring about a 30 billion Tughrik (839 Tughrik equivalent to
one U.S. dollar) trade income loss this year, said Elbegdorj.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit of Mongolia reached 70 million U.S. dollar in
the first five months this year. The enlarged trade deficit and
reduced foreign currency reserve will certainly hurt the
stability of Mongolian currency, said Elbegdorj.
</P>
<P>
The Gross National Product is expected to grow by around 3
percent this year, roughly the same level last year, and the
inflation rate should be kept within 25 percent, said Elbegdorj.

<HEADLINE> China Gives Priority to Natural Gas Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China is giving priority to gas
development as one of its energy development strategies, and plans
to double its annual gas production capacity to 30 billion cu m by
the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the China National
Petroleum Corp (CNPC), China is expected to verify additional
onshore gas reserves of one trillion cu m by the end of the
century, with the accumulative total hitting two trillion cu m.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the country's gas production capacity will rise by
another 10 billion cu m, with the total topping 25 billion cu m.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC official said that through further exploration, major
breakthroughs are expected to be made in the expansion of proven
gas reserves and production capacity in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia
region and Tarim Basin in northwest China, and Sichuan province in
southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC official noted that enormous potential exists for the
country's gas production. Following years of vigorous development,
three large-scale gas production areas have taken shape in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In the central part of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, gas
reserves totaling 230 billion cu m have been verified. Total gas
reserves of 200 billion cu m have been proven in the eastern part
of Sichuan. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, total gas
reserves of 160 billion cu m have been verified, in addition to
the discovery of a group of new gas-bearing structures.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the Sebei area of northwest China's Qinghai
province, a gas field with proven reserves of 50 billion cu m has
been found.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, gas pipeline networks running across the country will
have been set up, which will better serve industrial and civilian
use in many large and medium-sized cities.

<HEADLINE> France Affected by Suspension When Facing Denmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LYON, France, June 23 (Xinhua) -- France will face a grave test of
confidence and midfield strength when they meet Denmark in their last
group C match against Denmark here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Coach Aime Jacquet has vowed to grab a victory, which would place
the hosts atop Group C.
</P>
<P>
"It's very important for us to finish the first round on a high
note, and so we must win," he said. "We must not fall into the
complacent self-satisfaction, and we will prepare the match right down
to the last detail."
</P>
<P>
Playmaker Zinedine Zidane has been suspended with a red card while
injured Christophe Dugarry is doubtful.
</P>
<P>
"I have to watch out over the yellow cards issue," Jacquet said.
"But I want to put my best team out really and we'll be playing for a
win in Lyon."
</P>
<P>
He is not expected to play libero Laurent Blanc, Bixente Lizarazu
and Emmanuel Petit.
</P>
<P>
Jacquet said the reserve players who have not yet had a chance to
play could be fielded, including Patrick Vieira, Vincent Candela,
Christian Karembeu and Frank Leboeuf,
</P>
<P>
Jacquet was also on record by saying he wanted to give midfielders
Robert Pires and Bernard Diomede more significant roles.
</P>
<P>
In the front, the firepower would come from a possible striking
parternship of Youri Djorkaeff and Stephane Guivarc'h.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome is, Danmark's goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel will
make set the national record for the most caps with his 103rd
appearance.
</P>
<P>
Denmark has Morten Wieghorst and Miklos Molnar suspended after
being sent off against South Africa last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Coach Bo Johansson lookslikely to bring in central defender Jacob
Laursen in place of Soren Colding.
</P>
<P>
Michael Schjonberg will be placed in the center for midfield and
Michael Laudrup remains the mainstay in the midfield.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States signed
some 300 million US dollars worth of contracts and cooperative
agreements on telecommunications here today.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony of the seven contracts and agreements was
sponsored by the Ministry of the Information Industry (MII) at the
Great Hall of the People in Beijing this evening.
</P>
<P>
Motorola of the U.S. signed four contracts and agreements with
four Chinese telecommunication enterprises for selling GSM mobile
communications systems to and buying relevant equipment from
China.
</P>
<P>
The other three contracts and agreements were signed between
Lucent Technologies of the U.S. and three Chinese
telecommunications enterprises. Under the contracts and
agreements, Lucent will sell 60 million US dollars worth of
optical cable transmission equipment and local network
transmission network to the Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
An official from MII said that in the past few years, China and
the United States have maintained fairly close links in the field
of telecommunications. The two countries have increased the
exchange of visits of high-ranking officials of relevant
government departments and signed a number of agreements and
memoranda of understanding.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Urges Russians to Support Anti-Crisis Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Tuesday urged the country to back the government's anti-crisis
plan and pull the country out of economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
At an extended meeting attended by Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko, government ministers and parliamentary leaders, Yeltsin
said the program was intended to ease the tension in the financial
market in the short term and establish a stronger economy that can
weather global financial crises in the long run.
</P>
<P>
The program on financial and economic stabilization was
submitted to the Duma, the lower house of parliament, Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
To implement the program, Yeltsin said, the Russian economic
policies must be revised. He did not elaborate on how to revise
the policies.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Duma and the Federation Council, or upper house of
parliament, to prepare all the necessary laws needed to approve
the program before the summer recess early next month.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Russia will try to increase revenues, cut
spending, reform the tax system, support industrial production,
and protect investment.
</P>
<P>
The measures prescribed in the 200-page document include a
unified taxpayer registration system, crackdown on tax evasion
and delayed tax payments, strengthened supervision on foreign
trade and production and sales of alcoholic products.
</P>
<P>
To cut government spending, Kiriyenko planned to save 12.3
billion rubles (about 1.1 billion U.S. dollars) by laying off
workers employed by government-funded organizations, deregulating
the cultural, educational and sports facilities originally under
federal control and cutting subsidies to the farming and transport
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Kiriyenko said that the country's
debts had reached 44 percent of its gross domestic product
(GDP). Foreign debts now equal to 26 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the financial crisis that hit Russia late last
month to financial turbulences in Asia and the dramatic drop in
world oil prices. Oil export is one of Russia's major foreign
exchange earning sectors.
</P>
<P>
The measures intended to prop up Russia's national industry
include a new tax code that lowers the tax burdens on the
enterprises, a slash in prices for transport and power and gas
consumption for industrial use.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Incoming Philippine President Faces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The incoming Philippine
administration of President-Elect Joseph Estrada is expected to
face a tough test on the multi-billion-peso pork barrel funds for
lawmakers which he has vowed to scrap after he takes his oath of
office on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, an ex-movie star who won a runaway victory in the May
11 presidential polls on a populist pro-poor platform, has
promised his constituents to abolish pork barrel which has been
widely blamed as a source of corruption among government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Diokno, Estrada's choice as budget and management
secretary, claimed earlier that the pork barrel items in the 1999
budget will be scrapped before it is submitted to the new congress
for approval.
</P>
<P>
But political observers here said Estrada, who is currently the
country's vice president, is taking a great risk in picking fights
with the bicameral congress over the pork barrel issue.
</P>
<P>
They doubted that the incoming president will win the war on
pork barrel although its proposed abolition is supported by the
public, the media and the country's powerful Roman Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
Pork barrel, which has been allocated as perks to lawmakers for
their pet projects since the era of former President Ferdinand
Marcos, includes the Countrywide Development Funds, the Public
Works Fund and the School Building Fund.
</P>
<P>
The pork barrel funds, which should be used to finance
infrastructure projects their constituents need, are vital for the
re-election of legislators.
</P>
<P>
But it has been seen as a system breeding graft and corruption
among legislators and government officials since the funds were
mostly used at the discretion of legislators.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997 budget, nearly 2.9 billion pesos (72.5 million U.S.
dollars) were allocated for the pork barrel funds, with 12 million
pesos (300,000 dollars) for each representative and 18 million
pesos (450,000 dollars) for each senator.
</P>
<P>
According to Budget Secretary Salvador Enriquez, however, 45
percent of the pork barrel funds are lost in corruption, kickbacks
and inappropriate projects.
</P>
<P>
"In the Philippines, pork barrel has become a very dirty term.
It connotes corruption," political observer Jake Macasaet said,
adding that this is clearly the reason why Estrada wants to
abolish it.
</P>
<P>
Macasaet said pork barrel has to go since it is anomalous for
the legislature to take the responsibility of the construction of
roads and other infrastructure, which is the function of the
executive branch.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said earlier that he will use the gargantuan pork
barrel funds to revitalize the country's backward agriculture,
whose development has been listed as one of the priorities of his
administration.
</P>
<P>
But analysts doubted that Estrada will win to his side
supporters in the congress of pork barrel, regarded as lifeblood
for legislators, particularly members of the House of
Representatives elected by constituents.
</P>
<P>
Rodolfo Albano, majority floor leader of the lower house, said
that some of his colleagues from the ruling Lakas-NUCD (National
Union of Christian Democrats) party are set to block Estrada's
initiative.
</P>
<P>
The Lakas, which won 120 out of the 206 seats in the lower
house in the May 11 polls, is likely to remain the dominant party
in the next House of Representatives. But a number of Lakas
congressmen are expected to defect to Estrada's LAMMP (Fight of
Patriotic Filipino Masses) party due to bandwagon effect.
</P>
<P>
Besides strong opposition from the ruling party, even some
representatives from the LAMMP, which gained 50 seats in the lower
house, have indicated their opposition to the abolition of the
pork barrel funds.
</P>
<P>
Representative Daisy Fuentes of the LAMMP, who admitted that
she is personally for the abolition, said she has to block the
move since it would deny her constituents access to national
funds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts said it will be harmful to the Estrada
administration to open a war with the legislature at the beginning
of his term since a rival congress could hinder the implementation
of his political and economic agenda.
</P>
<P>
"During his (Estrada's) first 100 days, he needs to get
Congress behind his legislative agenda," said political analyst
Amando Doronila.
</P>
<P>
"If he antagonizes it at the start, he is erecting obstacles
against the success of his agenda that has to take immediately
during the first year of his administration," he added.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing President Fidel Ramos, who has been much credited with
the sustained economic growth during his six-year term, has
advised Estrada to take more caution on the pork barrel question.
According to him, Estrada's ambitious action agenda, such as
streamlining the bureaucracy, needs the cooperation of the
congress.
</P>
<P>
By passing more than 200 bills during the past six years, the
ruling party-controlled outgoing lower house contributed a lot in
helping the Ramos government push through its economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predicted that anticipating strong resistance
from the congress, Estrada could reach a compromise with the
legislature. The pork barrel funds may be retained but slashed and
conditioned with stringent safeguards against wanton use.
</P>
<P>
Citing a statement of Ronaldo Zamora, a close aide of Estrada,
analysts said the Estrada camp has already showed a softening
stance on the thorny issue.
</P>
<P>
Zamora, incoming executive secretary of the Estrada cabinet,
said Estrada is not for the complete abolition of pork barrel but
only wants transparency in the disposal of the funds.

The zones will be given up to one million pounds (1.6 million

<HEADLINE> UAE, Saudi Arabia Attack Israeli Jerusalem Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and
Saudi Arabia Tuesday assailed Israel's plan to extend the
authority of Jerusalem to West Bank Jewish settlements, the Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
UAE ambassador to Egypt Mohammad al Mahmoud said that Israel's
plan reflects its defiance of the United States, which is trying
to push forward the Mideast peace process, according to the news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud reiterated the need to hold an Arab summit to confront
the Israeli stance, saying that UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin
Sultan Al-Nahyan is among the first to call for a summit to
strengthen Arab solidarity to face Israel's "repeated attacks."
</P>
<P>
He underlined that Israel should abide by international
resolutions and return the occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Cabinet Sunday approved a plan to set up an
"umbrella authority" for Jerusalem over eight West Bank
settlements to the east, north and south of the city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi permanent delegate to the Cairo-based Arab
League Fuad Sadek Al Mufti said in a press statement that Israel's
plan is part of a conspiracy to impose a fait accompli in the holy
city.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi diplomat expressed confidence that Israel's plot
will not pass without being confronted by a firm stance of the
Arab countries in cooperation and consultation with the world
community.
</P>
<P>
"A genuine peace could not be achieved without solving the
Jerusalem issue within the framework of the final status
negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under peace agreements signed between the Palestinians and
Israel, the issue of Jerusalem will be solved in the final status
talks for a permanent agreement. Neither side should take
unilateral actions to change the status of the holy city.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want the traditionally Arab East Jerusalem as
the capital of their future independent state.

<HEADLINE> EU Observer Pleased With Cambodia's Voters Registration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Voters registration went
smoothly in Cambodia with positive sign being seen through the
process, Seven G. Linder, chief observer of the European
Observation Unit assigned to supervise the registration, said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official told a press conference that representatives of
political parties and the National Election Committee of Cambodia
had made efforts and done a lot of jobs in preparation for the
upcoming July 26 elections to ensure the move free, fair and
credible.
</P>
<P>
A total of 98.26 percent of eligible voters so far had been
registered, and the whole process is very encouraging with many
technical problems resolved, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he still listed some problems in the process including
communications failure due to long distance, the closing of
registration booths before time, refusal to register individuals.
</P>
<P>
Though there were rumors that non-Cambodian citizens had been
registered, Seven G. Linder said the election on the whole would
not be affected because the number of non-Cambodian civilians was
low.
</P>
<P>
Seven G.Linder, a Swedish with about 30 years experience in
foreign affairs, said the European Union kept the operation on
high gear.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member bloc has supported the election with a budget of
11.5 million U.S. dollars and will send 200 short and long
observers to supervise the forthcoming elections.

<HEADLINE> HK Business Leader Urges Support for Gov't Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong business leader
Tuesday urged the business sector and the broader Hong Kong
community to support the government's latest initiatives to boost
the local economy in the wake of the impact of the Asian economic
downturn.
</P>
<P>
Peter Sutch, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce, said that given appropriate community support, the
government's substantial fiscal initiatives announced on Monday
should help stabilize the local economy and hopefully bring some
modest improvement to the economic outlook as the year progresses.
</P>
<P>
Sutch noted that despite the substantial changes announced by
the government, the administration had also re-committed itself to
the fundamental fiscal and monetary policies that have served Hong
Kong well in the past, including the linked exchange rate between
the HK dollar and the U.S. dollar and fiscal prudence.
</P>
<P>
Sutch said the rebate on rates would directly help the more
than 1 million home-owners and also assist other property owners
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's freezing of its land sales programs
until April next year would help home-owners and take some
pressure off the banking system and property developers, help
their cash flow and go some way toward stabilizing property
prices.
</P>
<P>
The exemption of corporate interest income from profits tax
will help local liquidity and the measures to aid small and medium
businesses to acquire bank loans will also give a boost to this
most important sector of the local business community.
</P>
<P>
"The other measures announced by the government aimed at
opening the housing market to first home buyers, easing the costs
of diesel fuel to local users and reducing the import and export
declaration charges to traders are also welcome," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned that Hong Kong is in the midst of an
Asia-wide crisis and full recovery is not possible until the
entire region's economic situation stabilizes. "Expectations
should be realistic," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine NPA Rebels Threaten to Pull Out of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The New People Army (NPA) rebels
Tuesday threatened not to pursue peace talks with the incoming
Joseph Estrada administration if Estrada insists on burying former
President Ferdinand Marcos at the Manila heroes' cemetery.
</P>
<P>
NPA made the threat when the controversy over the burial of
Marcos is intensifying in the Philippines. President Fidel Ramos
has ordered the suspension of construction of Marcos' burial site.
</P>
<P>
NPA has been in peace talks with the government for the past
few years, but the two sides have made little progress in reaching
a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
NPA announced earlier that it would arrest Imelda Marcos, the
widow of Ferdinand Marcos, and their children for the crimes the
Marcoses committed against the people.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who would assume the presidency on June 30, said
earlier that he would have the remains of Marcos buried on July 11
at the heroes' cemetery which is usually for war heroes and
presidents.
</P>
<P>
Various groups and personalities including former President
Corazon Aquino have objected to Estrada's decision. They accused
Marcos of killing thousands of Filipinos and looting billions of
dollars from the state treasury.
</P>
<P>
Marcos was ousted in a bloodless revolt in 1986. He went into
exile in Hawaii, the United States, the same year and died there
three years later. His remains were returned to the Philippines in
1993.

and drivers and passengers found not wearing seat belts will be
issued with fixed penalty tickets, summoned or warned by police,
Monica Lo Suk-ching, superintendent (administration) of Traffic
Headquarters, announced at a press conference here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Although it is generally accepted that the wearing of seat
belts reduces the chance of being killed or seriously injured in
traffic accidents by as much as 50 percent, the number of
casualties, without wearing seat belts, in road accidents is still
on the rise," she said.
</P>
<P>
Although the seat belt legislation, first enacted in Hong Kong
in October 1983, was extended to cover rear-seat passengers of
private cars in June 1996 and the wearing of seat belts was
generally thought to reduce fatal rates in traffic accidents,
recent studies by Hong Kong's Transport Department showed that
only half of the rear-seat passengers comply with the regulation.
</P>
<P>
Among the 499 drivers and front-seat passengers of private cars
 killed or seriously injured in traffic accidents in 1993, 21 of
them or 4.2 percent were not wearing seat belts, Lo said.
</P>
<P>
And in 1996 and 1997 respectively, 24 out of 421, or 5.7
percent, and 38 out of 484, or 4.2 percent such drivers and
front-seat passengers were killed or seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of goods vehicle drivers, not wearing seat
belts, killed or seriously injured in traffic accidents remains
"unacceptably high." In 1996, 15 out of the 140 (10.7 percent)
such light goods vehicle drivers were killed or seriously injured
in traffic accidents. The 1997 figure was 23 out of 154, or 14.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The same figures for medium goods vehicle and heavy goods
vehicle drivers were 11 out of 55, or 20 percent, in 1996 and 15
out of 53, or 28 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Between July 1996 and February this year, 101
middle-front-seat and rear-seat passengers were prosecuted for
seat belt offenses, according to police.

<HEADLINE> HK TDC Backs Move to Lower Trade Declaration Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Trade Development
Council (TDC) Tuesday voiced support for the government's move to
reduce the official declaration charges on imports and domestic
exports.
</P>
<P>
Council Chairman Victor Fung said this measure, which was
announced on Monday, would help reduce the cost of doing business
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The measures will bring relief to manufacturers, importers and
exporters, and particularly to Hong Kong's small and medium-sized
enterprises, who carry out most of our trade," said Fung. "Lower
charges will also help enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as a
trading hub," he added.
</P>
<P>
Fung said that reduction in the two declaration charges will
reduce the subvention from the government by more than 200 million
HK dollars (25.64 million U.S. dollars) in a year in funding for
the council.
</P>
<P>
However, this is a positive move to support the Hong Kong
economy in the current difficult economic climate, he added.
</P>
<P>
The TDC currently receives about 30 percent of its funding
through government subvention which is drawn from imports and
domestic exports charges.
</P>
<P>
The proposed shortfall is expected to be covered without a
reduction in the level of service by increased business activities
of the council, Fung said. The council also remains committed to
its recent pledge not to increase fees for its business services
and its trade fairs, he added.

<P>
BAGHDAD, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed
Mehdi Saleh Tuesday called for speeding up the approval of the
contracts of the oil-for-food deal to ensure the arrival of
foodstuffs, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with visiting Executive Director of the Iraq
Program of the United Nations Benon Sevan, who arrived here on
Sunday evening, the minister emphasized the importance of
accelerating issuing letters of credit in order to prevent any
negative impact that might affect the distribution of foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the U.N. envoy on problems and obstacles that
had blocked up the mechanism of implementing the previous three
phases of oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iraq-U.N. deal signed in 1996, Iraq is allowed to
export 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over six months to buy
food, medicine and other daily necessities. From the fourth phase
which came into effect in June this year, Iraq is allowed to
export 5.2 billion dollars of oil in six months.
</P>
<P>
Saleh also reiterated Iraq's demand to get the U.N. sanctions
on Iraq lifted because the oil-for-food deal had proved to be a
failure in alleviating the suffering of the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf had a meeting with Sevan and briefed him on hurdles
impeding the distribution plan under the oil-for-food program.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Specialists on Sino-US Relations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Beijing-based experts commented
today that U.S. President Bill Clinton's coming visit to China
will further advance cross-century Sino-US relations just as
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's successful visit to the US last
year.
</P>
<P>
Mutual visits between the leaders of the two countries within
one year reveal that Sino-US relations has embarked on a track of
stable and normal development after years of up-and-downs,
according to Wang Jisi, director of the Institute of American
Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will be the first incumbent U.S. president to visit
China in nine years, and the major event will join Jiang's
U.S. visit as a milestone in the history of relations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to establish constructive strategic partnership
reached during Jiang's visit laid a solid foundation for the
development of Sino-US relations in the 21st century, said
Wang. He pointed out that events over the past six months have
made the establishment of the relationship even more necessary and
pressing.
</P>
<P>
"The nuclear arms race in South Asia, the Asian financial
crisis and the resultant political crisis have made the two
countries realize the importance of engaging in thorough strategic
consultations related to stabilizing world financial order and
promoting peace in South Asia," said Wang, an expert who has
studied Sino-US relations for over ten years. He pointed out that
the two countries should grasp all opportunities to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chengxu, president of the China Institute of International
Studies, pointed out that China's strict adherence to the "one
country, two systems" policy in the year following the resumption
of sovereignty over Hong Kong, as well as the nation's promise not
to devalue the renminbi, and its stance on nuclear testing in
South Asia have further enhanced mutual trust between the two
countries and laid a solid foundation for bilateral cooperation.

Song Baoxian, deputy director of the China Institute of
Contemporary International Relations, expressed the hope that
further discussions will be held to facilitate mutual
understanding in order to "reduce strategic misunderstandings and
promote a greater strategic consensus", as well as an acceptable
strategic framework.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the two countries will reach as
many agreements as possible in order to consolidate the basis for
future Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chengxu pointed to the development trend in Sino-US
relations and expressed regret that some Americans still view
China with cold-war mentality, despite the fact that Cold War
ended long ago.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries exhibit great divergence over certain
sensitive issues," said Yang. "Whether or not the United States
will act prudently on the Taiwan issue poses a major test to the
establishment of a strategic partnership between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
However, Wang Siji expressed his belief that dialogue will
control any discord and prevent hostilities from erupting between
the two nations. "We should help Americans understand China," said
Wang.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges between the two countries have expanded greatly in
all fields and have served as both the impetus for promoting
bilateral relations and a means for avoiding political conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Constantly increasing exchanges have attested to the point
that the two countries share more common interest than ever
before," said Wang.

<HEADLINE> EC Hands over Vehicles, Equipment to Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
Tuesday handed over 33 vehicles, 11 generators and other
equipment worth of 1.43 million U.S. Dollars, to the Ethiopian
government for the implementation of the pan-African rinderpest
campaign.
</P>
<P>
At a handover ceremony through the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) at its general secretariat here, Mohamed Haggag, OAU
assistant chief, made a statement on behalf of Secretary General
Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
As agriculture is the mainstay of most of African countries'
economies, he said, "it should be accorded a high priority in
their development plans."
</P>
<P>
The human population of the African continent is growing at an
alarming rate of three percent per year while the increase in
food production remains at two percent, said Haggag, adding that
it has been projected that human population of sub-Saharan Africa
will be more than one billion by the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
"In order to achieve food self-sufficiency and food security
at household level in the continent, we should achieve an annual
agriculture growth of four percent," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
After receiving keys of vehicles from Giuseppe Uitille, acting
head of the EC delegation to Ethiopia, Haggag handed over these
keys to Ethiopian Minister of Agriculture Seifu Ketema at the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Seifu, on his turn, said one of the fundamental problems
restraining the growth of livestock industry in Africa is the
occurr of highly contagious trans-boundary diseases.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, through constant and effective rinderpest
eradication campaign undertaken so far, Ethiopia is able to
control this dangerous disease to a very large extent.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, 28 African countries have
launched livestock disease control programs.

<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Based on a prediction that the
world population will reach six billion in 1999, the United
Nations has chosen "approaching the six billion" as the theme of
this year's World Population Day, which falls on July 11.
</P>
<P>
China's State Family Planning Commission announced today that
the commission, along with the Representative Office of the United
Nations Population Fund in China and relevant Chinese departments
will hold a ten-day event from July 10 to July 19 in Beijing to
mark the World Population Day.
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the event will give introductions to the
achievements China has made during the past years to control its
population and improve the quality of its population, and provide
information and services for the reproductive health care.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Began to mark the World Population Day on
July 11, 1987, when the world population reached five
billion. Activities are usually held worldwide on the day to
enhance people's awareness of the population problem.
</P>
<P>
The world population, which is posing increasingly bigger
pressure on the global environment and resources, will reach 9.4
billion in the middle of the next century, a UN prediction said.
</P>
<P>
As the most populous country in the world, China will try to
control its population below 1.3 billion by the end of this
century, under 1.4 billion by 2010, and no more than 1.6 billion
at its peak in the middle of the 21st Century.

<HEADLINE> Food Aid Ensured for 4 Million Ethiopians: WFP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- In response to the ongoing border
conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the World Food Program
(WFP) said here Tuesday it will expand operations to "ensure four
million hungry people in Ethiopia to receive food aid."
</P>
<P>
As many as 240,000 tons of "much-needed food aid" would safely
arrive in Ethiopia in the coming months as WFP has negotiated
with Ethiopian officials and Djibouti seaport leaders over the
transport and logistics arrangements, said WFP in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Due to the current tension between Eritrea and Ethiopia,
Djibouti's port is expected to become increasingly congested as
shipments are diverted from the Eritrean ports of Massawa and
Assab.
</P>
<P>
A WFP assessment mission recently concluded that if Djibouti
becomes the main point of entry for shipping to Ethiopia then the
local port infrastructure may need to be upgraded. This in turn
will require international financial support.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. food relief agency is also in the process of hiring
some 200 commercial trucks to ensure that once food aid is
released from the port, it can be quickly delivered to the needy.
</P>
<P>
"By expanding our operations with a dedicated trucking fleet,
we'll create a new lifeline for millions of Ethiopians and
refugees in that country who depend on food aid to help them and
their families make it through to the next harvest," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton will
receive a red carpet welcome at the Great Hall of the People
on June 27.
</P>
<P>
Some 26 years ago, a U.S table tennis team received a warm
welcome in the Great Hall as unofficial ambassadors from the other
side of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The spin on the little white balls was seen across the
globe. "Ping Pang Diplomacy", a unique creation in the history of
diplomacy, served to thaw relations between the two great nations
and thereafter helped to change the global pattern.
</P>
<P>
Late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai said that China's diplomacy
consists of official, semi-official and unofficial exchanges with
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping noted that governmental cooperation lacking
unofficial exchanges will fail to lay a solid foundation for the
growth of state-to-state relations.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the U.S. last October, Chinese President
Jiang Zemin stressed that an extremely important aspect in
Sino-U.S. relations centers on enhancing "mutual understanding"
between the people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaolin, vice-president of the Chinese People's Association
for Friendship with Foreign Countries, pointed out that increasing
unofficial exchanges between China and the United States have
helped to solidify the foundation for official diplomacy, while
increasing official diplomacy has provided a broad venue for
nongovernmental contacts.
</P>
<P>
China and the U.S. have established 28 friendly
provincial-state relationships and 93 sister city relationships
since central China's Hubei Province and the State of Ohio
established ties in 1979.

Local observers note that these particular type of relationship
serves to promote mutual understanding between people in the two
nations.

The Little Swallow Art Troupe from northwest China's Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region visited the United States to attend the 39th
annual meeting of Sister Cities International shortly after Lee
Teng-Hui's visit to the U.S in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaolin, director of the art troupe, said that traditional
performances the troupe staged in Washington D.C. attracted large
audiences and filled Americans with good feelings for Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
In addition, well-known unofficial organizations in the two
countries hosted events celebrating the 25th anniversary of the
signing of the Shanghai Communique and the 25th anniversary of the
Ping Pong Diplomacy in order to acquaint younger generations with
the bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of Chinese middle school students will visit the
U.S. this summer to join their American counterparts in
discussions on entering the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The friendship between youngsters in the two countries is
without a doubt of great strategic significance to establishment
of Sino-U.S. partnership geared to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
However, a small number of people with a Cold War mentality do
not want to see the steady development of Sino-U.S. relations and
are attempting to obstruct the bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
Many insightful Americans stress that the establishment of a
solid and long-standing relationship with China has been a basic
objective of the U.S. foreign policy since former U.S. President
Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972.
</P>
<P>
They believe that China will certainly be an economic and
political power in the new century, and that its full
participation in international affairs is in the national
interests of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. President George Bush said that increasing
unofficial exchanges is critical to the promotion of mutual
understanding between China and the U.S. due to their quite
different social systems and cultures.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that his grandchildren and Chinese children
will live in a peaceful world.
</P>
<P>
Li Furong, vice-president of the Chinese Olympic Committee,
said that the Ping Pong diplomacy was simply a prelude to
Sino-U.S. friendship, with President Jiang Zemin's successful
visit to the U.S. last year and President Clinton's coming visit
to China representing the main chapter in the
Sino-U.S. partnership for the new century.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Criticizes Council of Europe for Report on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Tuesday criticized the
Council of Europe (CE) parliamentary assembly for its discussion
of a report on the country's policy toward the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
"The report certainly exceeds the mandate given to the CE and
arouses our suspicion that political motives are involved in it,"
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The claims in the report prepared by a socialist deputy of the
assembly are "unfounded and biased," Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
The 14-page report, entitled "People Displaced in the
Southeastern Turkey," condemns Ankara's alleged "unjust policy"
toward Kurds living in southeastern Turkey, the most backward
part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Such a policy adopted by Turkey has forced a large number of
Kurds to leave their homeland, it said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party has
sent the European body a letter encouraging the adoption of the
report.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish party has been fighting against the Turkish
government since 1984 in an attempt to establish an independent
Kurdish state in the southeast of the country.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is closely following the issue and see what proper
measures should be taken, Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reacted harshly to the document, describing it as "a
piece of paper aimed at distorting facts."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish parliament has urged the Council of Europe assembly
to postpone the release of the report. The request was turned down
by the CE, which is based in Strasbourg, France.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder for President Clinton's China trip: Xi'an Stele Forest - China's Biggest Stone Library </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The ancient capital of Xi'an boasts
numerous relics from China's glorious past, and the Forest of
Steles, although not as famous as the terracotta warriors,
represents China's history from a unique angle.
</P>
<P>
A collection of more than 2,500 steles created by Chinese
artists over the centuries, it is named China's biggest stone
library and a sacred place of the art of calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
The Forest of Steles was first built in 1087, and was
designated as a piece of key cultural relics for national
protection by the central government in 1961.
</P>
<P>
Gathering together the representative calligraphical works from
almost all the dynasties, especially those from the Han (206
BC-220 AD) and Tang (618-907) dynasties when the art of
calligraphy were at the height of splendor, it virtually presents
the history of Chinese calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
There are steles that recorded the historic events of cultural
exchanges between ancient China and foreign countries, including
one telling the spread of Christianity in China during the Tang
Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Two hundred representative carvings from different dynasties
are also collected in the Forest of Steles.
</P>
<P>
The solid and silent steles embody the comprehensiveness and
profundity of Chinese culture, and tens of thousands people came
to visit the Forest of Steles each year, which is one of the 15
special visiting spots designated by the state tourism and
cultural relics authorities across the country.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Leave Romania's Securities Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Chances for Romania's securities
market to be the world's best performing one are crumbling, said a
report in the Romanian daily Adevarul (The Truth) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Significant decreases have been registered on the market since
May, with the indices reflecting the Bucharest Stock Exchange's
overall performance plunging to the lowest levels this year.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts attributed the heavy loss to the disappointment
of Romanian companies' shareholders, the withdrawal of foreign
capital and the lack of trust of potential investors.
</P>
<P>
They are "the main determinant elements," said the Adevarul
report. However, it added, "basic causes are given by the deep
degradation of the domestic economic situation."
</P>
<P>
"Every week sees the leave of yet another important foreign
investor," said the report, quoting analysts as saying that there
is a shift in foreign investors' attitude from "wait and see" to
"sell and leave."
</P>
<P>
But data put up by the Romanian National Securities Commission
show that only two investors have left the Romanian market in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Chief analyst at CA/IB Securities explained: "When a foreign
investor withdraws from the market, he is not statistically
recorded unless he annuls the brokerage contract. In general,
those who leave prefer keeping their accounts open so that they
may save time and money in case they decide to come back."
</P>
<P>
The Adevarul report commented that it is an encouraging
attitude since, even if they repatriate their money, they have not
entirely given up the Romanian market.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The heaviest flooding witnessed
this century is roaring through the east China city of Fuzhou,
with flood waters isolating over 61,300 local residents.
</P>
<P>
Minqing and Minhou counties, as well as low-lying areas in
Fuzhou proper on the lower reaches of the Minjiang River have
sustained the most severe flooding. Flood waters have totally
inundated Minqing County, with water levels reaching six meters
and covering two-story buildings in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Flooding has also toppled houses and totally disrupted
transport, according to a press release issued by the
Fuzhou City Government.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains which have hit northern Fujian Province since
mid-June have also caused the heaviest flooding since 1900. The
flood peak is expected to rise to between 2.6 meters and 2.7
meters above the danger level by midnight.
</P>
<P>
The press release noted that Fujian Province is engaged in an
all-out battle against flooding, with tens of thousands of local
residents joining in the flood relief effort.
</P>
<P>
All government officials, including Governor He Guoqiang and
Chen Mingyi, secretary of the Provincial Committee of the
Communist Party of China, are manning posts at the most dangerous
areas along dikes, river banks, bridges and reservoirs The

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends in Quiet Trading Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar experienced
one of its quietest trading sessions in weeks Tuesday when it
received few opportunities to break out of a tight range.
</P>
<P>
An attempt to hold it above 61 U.S. cents was short-lived and
the unit spent most of the session changing hands just under the
figure before closing at 60.85.
</P>
<P>
That was barely changed from Monday's close of 60.86.
</P>
<P>
"The yen is still ruling the roost," Rothschild Australia
treasury manager Paul Macarounas said.
</P>
<P>
While the Japanese yen/U.S. dollar exchange rate showed more
volatility than the Australian dollar, Macarounas noted that it
too had been kept to a tight range.
</P>
<P>
There was also some selling of the Australian dollar against
the yen, with the local unit closing at 83.92 yen, from 84.07
previously.
</P>
<P>
Having a secondary impact on the Australian dollar was some
softness in the New Zealand dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Kiwi was losing some ground as analysts predicted weak
numbers in the run of data there beginning with current account
figures Wednesday and winding up with inflation numbers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Macarounas said the Australian dollar's "yen watch" could be
expected to continue for the next couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally expect a U.S. dollar/yen exchange rate under
140 until at least the end of a planned visit to China by U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In the foreign exchange market, the Australian dollar was
buying 1.0908 German marks from 1.0946.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is scheduled to mark the
anti-narcotic day on June 26 together with the International Day
Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trade, a minister told reporters
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in connection with the anti-narcotic day,
Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare and Poverty Alleviation
Haryono Suyono said the commemoration of the day is expected to
become a momentum for the nation, particularly the younger
generation, to activate an anti-narcotic movement.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the anti-narcotic movement would face a big
challenge from illegal drug traders, who have so far been able to
lure the country's younger generation to fall into their hands.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the anti-narcotic movement has to emerge and make
some breakthroughs to prevent the younger generation from
consuming the drugs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The on-going anti-narcotic movement must win support from the
people and parents who pay attention to human resources
development in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Putera Astaman, chairman of Bersama, a non-governmental
organization in charge of anti-drug activities, told reporters
that President B.J. Habibie will attend this year's commemoration
of the anti-narcotics day.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Angola Sign Diamond Industry Cooperation Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Angola on Tuesday signed
an agreement on bilateral cooperation in the diamond industry.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed after talks in the Kremlin between
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and visiting Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
No details of the deal were available.
</P>
<P>
However, Interfax reported last week that Angola may convert
its 6 billion U.S. dollar debt to Russia into assets, including
diamond mines.
</P>
<P>
Angola is a major producer of diamonds, putting out more than 1
million carats annually.
</P>
<P>
"Russia believes Angola to be a promising partner and would
like to find mutually acceptable ways of solving the debt problem
as quickly as possible to prevent the issue from hindering
mutually beneficial cooperation," an unidentified government
official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most of the debt was for arms shipped for political motives,
the official said. "But that does not mean that the debt can be
written off."
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos arrived here Sunday for a three-day official visit
to Russia. He last visited Moscow 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Under a joint declaration signed by Yeltsin and dos Santos, the
two sides vowed to expand political, trade and economic dialogues,
improve the legal foundation of bilateral relations and strengthen
information exchange and cooperation in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also signed an accord on trade and economic
cooperation, which granted each other most favored nation trading
status.
</P>

Russian-Angolan trade totalled 48.7 million dollars last year,
Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Suspends Construction of Marcos' Grave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
ordered here Tuesday the suspension of all construction work for
the burial of former President Ferdinand Marcos at the Manila
heroes' cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Ramos issued the order after Defense Secretary Fortunato Abat
admitted that he was the one who ordered the construction of the
Marcos' burial site.
</P>
<P>
Although having only a week left in his presidency, Ramos said
he has not changed his position opposing the burial of Marcos'
remains at the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it very clear that my position, my policy with
regard to that particular issue has remained very consistent and
it has not changed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Various groups and personalities, notably former President
Corazon Aquino, have objected to President-Elect Joseph Estrada's
decision to have Marcos' remains buried on July 11 at the cemetery
which was reserved for presidents, members of the Armed Forces and
veterans.
</P>
<P>
Marcos was ousted in a bloodless revolt in 1986. He went into
exile in Hawaii, the United States, the same year and died there
three years later. His remains were returned to the Philippines in
1993.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Rejects Criticism Over Greater Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Tuesday described as "out of line" the international
criticism over the government's plan to expand Jerusalem far
beyond its current borders.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted the prime minister as saying that the
criticism could have been motivated by an attempt to prevent
strengthening Jerusalem or to even divide it in the future. He
reiterated that Jerusalem will always remain the "undivided
capital of Israel."
</P>
<P>
The Greater Jerusalem Plan was approved by the cabinet Sunday,
incurring strong response from the international community,
particularly Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The plan, termed by Netanyahu as the move "for strengthening of
Jerusalem's status," set out broad and complex guidelines under
which several communities west of Jerusalem will be annexed and an
"umbrella municipality" will be created over other Jewish
communities and settlements to the east and north, some in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
There was widespread speculation that the goal was to tighten
Israel's hold on Jerusalem, to solidify its links to eastern
settlements and to expand its Jewish population and tax base by
annexing wealthier and more secular towns along the "Jerusalem
corridor" to the west.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority has described it as a
declaration of war against Palestinian residents of Jerusalem and
warned of a harsh response. The European Union, Egypt and Jordan
said the plan would complicate and derail the already deadlocked
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which had strongly condemned the plan as
"extremely provocative," softened its attitude Monday, saying that
Washington had understood it better following Netanyahu's
explanation.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin, however, insisted that
it would have been better to work on getting the peace talks back
on track instead of taking unilateral action on Jerusalem, whose
status should be negotiated in the permanent talks under peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
The next step Israel will take is for the interior minister to
prepare a detailed plan for both the annexation and the creation
of the umbrella authority. The proposal will be submitted in
August to the cabinet, who will then present it to the Knesset
(Parliament) when it reconvenes in September.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Russia Hold on to Peaceful End to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Germany and Russia have called for
the world community to explore all possibilities of a peaceful end
to the Kosovo crisis, the German Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry's latest statement on Kosovo came after
the Monday meeting in Nyborg, Denmark, between German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel and his Russian counterpart Yevgeni Primakov.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed to arrange another meeting of the Contact
Group of the United States, France, Russia, Britain, Germany and
Italy early next week in Bonn to review the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been running high in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province,
since February, when Serbian police clashed with ethnic Albanians
seeking independence and integration into neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
In talks with Kinkel, Primakov reiterated Moscow's opposition
to outside military intervention in Kosovo and stressed that any
such move must acquire approval by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the mediation by Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed earlier this month to
meet some Western demands, including resuming the political
dialogue with Kosovo-Albanian leaders.
</P>
<P>
According to the German Foreign Ministry, Kinkel and Primakov
agreed that there were still two problems that need to be solved
in particular at the moment, namely the withdrawal of Serbian
security forces from Kosovo and international monitoring over the
dialogue between Belgrade and Kosovo-Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, however, expressed the worry that a complete pullout
of Serbian police forces could lead to a new exodus of Kosovo
refugees.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder for President Clinton's China Trip: Fruitful Cooperation Between Chinese Manufacturer, Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Xi'an Aircraft Co., one of the
leading aircraft manufacturers in China, has become a major
supplier of vertical fins for Boeing 737, the world's most popular
passenger jet.
</P>
<P>
The company, known as Xifei, has produced 574 vertical fins
and 230 horizontal tails for Boeing 737s, and 364 parts in 20
categories for Boeing 747s, since it signed the first production
contract with Boeing Co. back in 1984.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 1,000 Boeing airplanes with parts produced by
Xifei are flying around the world.
</P>
<P>
Xifei President Yang Zhong called the cooperation between the
two companies as "having built a cross-Pacific friendship bridge
in the vast blue sky."
</P>
<P>
In March 1988, Xifei handed over the first vertical fin for
Boeing 737-300. In 1989, the cooperation expanded to the
production by Xifei of other parts including horizontal tails for
Boeing 737.
</P>
<P>
On the delivery of the 500th Boeing 737 vertical fin on March
28, 1997, Richard James, vice president of Boeing Commercial
Airplane Group, called the vertical fin the biggest proof of a
friendship lasting for almost two decades.
</P>
<P>
Calling Xifei's products with the best quality in the world,
James expressed the hope of the two sides creating a better future
on the basis of past cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In August 1995, Boeing contracted the production of 1,500
vertical fins for the newly developed Boeing 737-700 airplane to
Xifei, whose supply will account for half of the total for the
project. The development of the tail will be completed in the
recent future.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation between Xifei and Boeing, the world's leading
aircraft manufacturer, not only has helped create a good image of
China's aircraft manufacturing industry, but also contributed to
the improvement of our manufacturing technology and management,"
said Xifei president Yang Zhong.
</P>
<P>
He added that the cooperation also has helped Boeing lower
its production costs and strengthen its presence in China.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Xifei reported 2.17 billion yuan (about 261 million US
dollars) in sales income, 90 million yuan (about 10.8 million US
dollars) in profits, and 22.78 million US dollars in foreign
exchanges, 8.8, 2.16 and 3.58 times those in 1987, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Fall Sharply in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell sharply in Tokyo
Tuesday amid continued unwinding of cross-held shares among
Japanese companies and a rise in net selling by foreign brokerages.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 254.49 points, or 1.66
percent, from Monday's close to finish at 15,054.60.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 11.89 points, or 1.00 percent, to
close at 1,175.42.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 410
million shares from Monday's 370.24 million shares.
</P>
<P>
The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB) was the day's most
heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Market watchers said new government plans to tackle the
mountain of bad loans held by major Japanese banks failed to ease
the downward pressure weighing on the Tokyo market.
</P>
<P>
The market reflected strong expectations for the government to
fix the country's financial woes, but there are also deep-rooted
fears about the economy, an analyst at a private financial
institution said.
</P>
<P>
Net selling by foreign brokerages doing business in Tokyo
remains high, having a serious impact on the Nikkei index, the
analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,334 issues listed on the First Section, losers
outpaced gainers 692 to 406, with 166 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> S. African Footwear Industry Caught in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- South African footwear
industry is being caught in a cross-border stampede, the daily
Star newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Many local companies shut shops to relocate to neighboring
states while imports are streaming back into South Africa thanks
to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) protocol,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Business Report of the newspaper quoted industry leaders
as saying that the South African footwear industry is dying,
despite measures aimed at pulling it up by its own bootstraps.
</P>
<P>
The measures include a footwear accord to boost
competitiveness and a government quota on imports from the east.
</P>
<P>
Local companies were reportedly eager to move to countries
like Lesotho, where wages are a fraction of those in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho is bordering with South Africa's KwaZulu Natal
Province where the port city of Durban is situated.
</P>
<P>
Harry Naicker, Chairman of the Association of Medium and Small
Footwear Manufacturers, said that cutters in Lesotho are paid 120
Rand (22.6 U.S. Dollars) a week as opposed to 750 Rand (about 141
U.S. Dollars) in South Africa. Stitchers receive 80 Rand (about
15 U.S. Dollars) against 450 Rand (about 84 U.S. Dollars)
locally.
</P>
<P>
South African footwear industry heads have confirmed that at
least three more Durban companies are considering moving across
the border.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Pietermaritzburg-based Amber Footwear
relocated to Lesotho last year. Pinetown-based Crown has already
moved sections of its production and might ultimately move the
lot.
</P>
<P>
At least 3,000 jobs have been lost so far this year and
footwear industry casualties are growing, Naicker said.

<HEADLINE> EximBank Expands Efforts to Boost Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Export and Import Bank of
China (EximBank) plans to significantly increase its credit line to
help boost the country's exports, according to todays announcement
by a senior bank official.
</P>
<P>
EximBank, a policy-oriented bank founded in 1994 to finance
China's exports of electronic products, machinery and other
capital goods, will provide a total of 24.3 billion yuan in export
seller's credits during 1998, up 60 percent on the previous
year. Bank President Zhou Keren made the remarks during today's
address to representatives from more than a dozen agent banks.
</P>
<P>
The credits will include 10 billion yuan in new loans and 14.3
billion yuan in recovered loans.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that meeting this year's official economic target
of an eight percent increase in gross domestic product this year
will require preventing a downturn in exports due to the Asian
financial crisis, said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
"EximBank must fulfill its lending program and provide
powerful support to increase exports, especially exports of
machinery and electronic products," said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
China's 1997 foreign trade volume reached 325 billion US
dollars, with exports of machinery and electronic products valued
at 59.3 billion US dollars, or 32.5 percent of total exports.
exports. Related products constituted the largest proportion of
all export items for the third consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that EximBank provided financial
support for nine percent of China's total 1997 exports of
machinery and electronic products. The bank issued export seller's
credits exceeding 40 billion yuan and 130 million US
dollars by the end of last year, with export buyer's credits
standing at 93.7 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loans supported Chinese exports valued at over 13 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Beijing-based EximBank, which does not have subsidiaries of its
own, has entrusted a dozen Chinese commercial banks, including the
Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the
Minsheng Banking Corp., to act as agents and handle the bulk of
its business in other parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Lowers Economic Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government Tuesday
revised downward its earlier projection for gross national product
(GNP) growth from 3-4 percent to 2.5 percent for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The inter-agency Development Budget Coordinating Council said
the revision was made following the deterioration in the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter this year, the Philippines' GNP and the
gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 2.5 and 1.7 percent
respectively, 2.9 and 3.4 percentage points lower than the same
period last year due to the Asian financial crisis and the El Nino
weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
It is unknown whether the government also revised its GDP
target of between 2.4 and 3.5 percent for the year. Analysts said
however that the country could not attain the GDP target if its
GNP could grow only by 2.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the council, which formulates the Philippines'
macroeconomic targets and policies, projected that the government
this year would post a fiscal deficit of 36.8 billion pesos (920
million U.S. dollars) instead of the earlier planned surplus of 5
billion pesos (125 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The council includes representatives from the Department of
Budget and Management, the Department of Finance, the National
Economic and Development Authority, the Central Bank of the
Philippines and the Bureau of Treasury.
</P>
<P>
It said the country's revenue for this year is expected to
reach only 488 billion pesos (12.2 billion dollars) while the
expenditures would amount to 524.8 billion pesos (13.1 billion
dollars).

<P>
GENEVA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The 12th World AIDS Conference is
scheduled for June 28 through July 3 in Geneva, announced the
organizers here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Top officials from the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS) are scheduled to make speeches during the meeting with
the theme of "Bridging the Gap."
</P>
<P>
AIDS deaths decline in richer countries but rise in poorer
ones, as treatment gap widens, said a report of UNAIDS and the
World Health Organization (WHO) on the eve of the conference.
</P>
<P>
The major reason for the gap is uneven access to combination
therapy with anti-retrovirals, drugs that combat the human
immunodeficiency virus in the body and forestall the development
of AIDS-related infections and cancers, said the report.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS and WHO estimate that by the end of 1997 there were 30.6
million people worldwide infected by HIV -- 29.4 million adults
aged between 15 and 49 and over one million children.
</P>
<P>
Established in January 1996, UNAIDS is the leading advocate for
global action on HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
It brings together six U.N. agencies in a common effort against
the epidemic: the United Nations Children's Fund, the United
Nations Development Program, the United Nations Population Fund,
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, World Health Organization, and the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Price Inflation Continues to Ease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Consumer price inflation
continued its moderating trend in May, with the year-on-year
increase in the Composite Consumer Price Index (CPI) edging down
to 4.5 percent from 4.7 percent in April, the Census and
Statistics Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Taking the first five months of 1998 together, the increase in
the Composite CPI, covering the combined expenditure pattern of
all Hong Kong households, averaged 4.9 percent over the same
period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by sub-index, the CPI(A), covering 50 percent
households whose monthly expenditures are between 3,900 and 16,000
HK dollars (503 and 2,065 U.S. dollars), registered a year-on-year
increase of 4.3 percent in May compared with 4.4 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
CPI (B), which covers 30 percent households with expenditures
between 16,000 and 28,500 HK dollars (2,064 and 3,677 U.S.
dollars), eased to 4.4 percent against 4.9 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The lower rates of increase were "mainly due to slower increase
in charges for meals bought away from home, rent for private
housing and prices of outer clothing," said the department.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Kids Get Hefty Pocket Money: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Generous pocket money owned by
Hong Kong kids generates a child economy of over six billion HK
dollars (770 million U.S. dollars) a year, according to a survey
revealed here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, entitled New GenerAsians, finds that Hong Kong kids
between 7 and 18 receive 119 HK dollars (15 U.S. dollars) on
average a week, the biggest amount among the 12 Asian-Pacific
countries and regions covered by the survey.
</P>
<P>
With more than one million children falling into this age
group in Hong Kong, their pocket money alone will create an
annual child economy of six billion HK dollars (770 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Conducted by AC Nielson, a market research company from March
through May 1998, the survey covers more than 5,700 children
across the Asia- Pacific region, including 430 from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The study touches a broad variety of issues including kids'
activities, aspirations, clothes, entertainment, fashion, food,
drink, games, money, school and toys.
</P>
<P>
The findings show that more than one third of Hong Kong
children choose watching TV as their top form of entertainment,
and almost 80 percent own some sort of electronic game system.
</P>
<P>
The number one career choice for Hong Kong boys is policemen,
while girls want to be teachers, says the survey.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Seizes Lots of Smuggled Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican customs authority
has seized 570 boxes of wine, 560 boxes of gin and whisky and
over 80 crates of cigarettes in an informal market in a wake of
strengthened crackdown on smuggling.
</P>
<P>
These smuggled goods were transported in four containers, the
daily Noticias Tuesday quoted a customs official as saying in
Maputo.
</P>
<P>
Arthur Sanderson, the Public Relations Official of the
Mozambican National Bureau of Customs, said Monday that the
police will make further effort to crack down on the smuggling in
order to curb the practice of tax evasion and to protect the
domestic goods.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that so far, the owners of the goods had not
presented certificates justifying these goods.
</P>
<P>
Besides taking actions in the urban areas, Sanderson said, the
Mozambican police will also send reinforcements to Ressano Garcia
and Namaacha for stricter inspection on the goods passing through
the customs.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the personnel to be sent there are receiving
training in a police school in the suburb of Maputo City.
</P>
<P>
Ressano Garcia and Namaacha are bordering with South Africa
and Swaziland respectively. Most of the goods destined for
southern Mozambique, especially Maputo, are coming through the
two transit ports.

<P>
CANBERRA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A lackluster New York session
overnight and local profit-taking, particularly in media giant
News Corp., conspired Tuesday to push the Australian bourse lower.

</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped just 1.74 points

"New York offered no inspiration. I think News Corp. continued
to come off in profit-taking, similar to what happened in the U.S.
last night," one Brisbane-based broker said.
</P>
<P>
"I also think we're seeing some tax-loss selling where
investors are looking to offset some big gains made on the market
over the financial year."

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Tuesday stressed that Egypt supports neither war nor the
proliferation of nuclear, chemical or other weapons.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the remarks after inspecting the Egyptian
peacekeeping contingent to be stationed in the Central African
Republic (CAR), the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt supports peace and does not encourage war as it had
experienced the woes and ravages of war," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt seeks to take part in peacekeeping operations, out of
its conviction that without peace, there would be no welfare and
secure life for peoples," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Our tasks as peacekeeping forces, either in Bosnia at present,
in Somalia in the past or in CAR and other African countries are
mainly to work for keeping peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is one of the 11 European and African countries that send
peace keepers in CAR.
</P>
<P>
Addressing problems in the Middle East, Mubarak said what is
going on can not bring about peace in the region, apparently
referring to Israel's intransigent policy toward peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with Israel,
which is believed to be the only nuclear power in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> No Let-Down of Super Eagles Facing Paraguay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOULOUSE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, who has qualified for the
the last sixteen in the World Cup finals here, would have no let-down
when they face Paraguay in last group game on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Oliseh, who scored the winning goal in their 3-2 win over
Spain, said it was vital the team did not relax against Paraguay to
maintain morale and momentum.
</P>
<P>
Coach Bora Milutinovic agreed, saying his confident squad wanted to
keep up its winning streak, and what is more important, beyond the
second round.
</P>
<P>
The Super Eagles' campaign in the United States four years
concluded with their loss to Italy in the second round.
</P>
<P>
However, Milutinovic has to compromise somewhat on his motto of
"best defence is attack".
</P>
<P>
Striker Victor Ikpeba, playmaker Jay-Jay Okocha and midfielder
Mutiu Adepoju all have had one yellow card each while captain Uche
Okechukwu was out of the game serving suspension.
</P>
<P>
It is probable that Milutinovic would take a cautious approach to
rest the yellow-carded trio.
</P>
<P>
But the Nigerians, brimmed with creative talents, would still have
1996 Olympic champion striker Nwanko Kanu, who is on his way to top
form after a surgery.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Hugo Brizuela of Argentinos Juniors is expected
to spearhead the Paraguyan attack.
</P>
<P>
Coach Paolo Carpeggiani is still looking for the best striking
combination when he tested Jose Cardozo of Mexican club Toluca and
Cesar Ramirez of Sporting Lisbon in training.
</P>
<P>
He would also have to decide between veteran Roberto Acuna and
newcomer Carlos Paredes for the midfield.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay, with two points on the group standings, will reach the
last 16 if they win. A draw would also suffice if Bulgaria ties with
Spain in their last group match.

that with the stabilization of the situation, the friendly
cooperation between the two countries can continue to grow.

<HEADLINE> APEC Stresses Flexibility in Sectoral Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUCHING (Malaysia), June 23 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) concluded their trade
ministers meeting here Tuesday with stress on flexibility in
implementing sectoral liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The trade ministers meeting mainly discussed Early Voluntary
Sectoral Liberalization (EVSL), Individual Action Plans (IAPs),
Collective Action Plans (CAPs), electronic commerce, impact of
trade liberalization and the issue of supporting the multilateral
trading system.
</P>
<P>
On EVSL, the most important issue at the meeting, the ministers
agreed that in order to finalize the sectoral arrangements that
would maximize participation, flexibility would be required to
deal with product-specific concerns raised by individual economies
in each sector, Malaysian International Trade and Industry
Minister Rafidah Aziz, who chaired the meeting, said at a press
conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Such flexibility would generally be in the form of longer
implementation periods and in principle developing members should
be allowed greater flexibility, she said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed that consideration of other forms of
flexibility should take into account the broader goal of
maximizing mutual benefits and the need to maintain the balance of
interests, Rafidah told reporters.
</P>
<P>
There is emerging consensus on product coverage, target end
rates and target end dates, and the ministers endorsed some
recommendations as a means to make further progress in the
fast-track sectors -- chemicals, environmental goods and services,
energy, fish and fish products, forest products, gems and jewelry,
medical equipment and instruments, toys and telecommunications
mutual recognition arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said that except telecommunications on which agreement
was reached, environment and energy sectors need more work to be
done by senior officials while other forms of flexibility in the
remaining six sectors would be considered.
</P>
<P>
The ministers were of the view that participation in the nine
sectors and all three measures (trade liberalization,
facilitation, and ecotech) in each sector will be essential to
maintaining the mutual benefits and balance of interests which
APEC leaders had established when selecting the sectors in
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said the ministers agreed that all sectors containing
tariff liberalization proposals be communicated to the World Trade
Organization for transparency purposes once all details of the
sectoral proposals are finalized.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will consider the final agreements/arrangements
of each sector in its entirety at a ministerial meeting in
November, with a view to commencing implementation in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Chinese
Taipei, Chile, China's Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Korea,
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and the United States, which were all
represented at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Three members-designate -- Peru, Russia and Vietnam -- as well
as observers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
South Pacific Forum and the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council
also attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislature Deliberates Law on Sea, Marine Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislators today
discussed the law on exclusive economic zones and continental
shelves.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Keyu, vice-chairman of the Law Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), elaborated on some revisions of the draft
law to the third meeting of the Standing Committee of the Ninth
NPC, which started Monday.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for China to promulgate the law, which will
guarantee the sovereignty and jurisdiction over the country's
exclusive economic zones and continental shelves, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
When drafting the law, the NPC Law Committee managed to comply
with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which
was approved by the NPC Standing Committee in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The country should adopt the law as early as possible for the
nation's interests," said Xu Dunxin, a member of the Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The proposed law must strictly protect the marine environment
and prevent new pollution sources from occurring, said Gu Jinchi,
also a member of the Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the U.N. convention, China greatly expanded
its area of marine jurisdiction of less than 400,000 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The 14th and 23rd meetings of the Standing Committee of the
Eighth NPC separately deliberated the draft law.

Coach Javier Clemente must shake off the criticisms from home which
accused of lack of tactical creativity and consistence following his
making five changes against Paraguayans to no avail.
</P>
<P>
"I have got news for those people who are moaning that we are out
of the World Cup. We are not," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we keep on working as hard as we have been then lady luck will
eventually shine on us. We are not giving up the ghost yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the changes that Clemente is expected to make, veteran
Fernando Hierro of Real Madrid may move back and replace Barcelona's
Abelardo in the back.
</P>
<P>
Athletic Bilbao's Julen Guerrero will team up with Luis Enrique and
Amor in the midfield, leaving Raul free for attacks in the front.
</P>
<P>
Another Bilbao player Joseba Etxeberria and Barcelona's Juan
Antonio Pizzi may be benched if Alfonso and Morientes lead the Spanish
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria would pin their hope on experienced strikers Hristo
Stoitchkov, Emil Kostadinov and Luboslav Penev.
</P>
<P>
And the recent fine imposed on Stoitchkov and Penev after the duo
left team hotel without permission may not contribute to building a
better teamwork.
</P>
<P>
However, their experience with the Spanish style would benefit the
team when they spot the weakpoints of the opponents.
</P>
<P>
Penev plays for the Spanish club Compostela while Stoitchkov had
led Barcelona to club honors before.

<P>
MARSEILLE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Brazil have already qualified for
the last 16 as the top team from Group A and captain Dunga said his
team was yet to hit peak form.
</P>
<P>
"Brazil can still develop its game. After the match against
Norway, we'll have a better idea of who the final team should be."
Dunga said.
</P>

"With regard to other opponents, Nigeria have confirmed their
potential and the Netherlands have some great players," said Dunga,
"the more Argentina are in difficulty, the better things will be for
us."
</P>
<P>
Roberto Carlos, who has failed to display his magical free-kick
technique, said:"We don't know the starters who will be coming up

<HEADLINE> Interview: EU-HK Relations Stronger After Handover: Envoy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Etienne Reuter, head of the
office in Hong Kong of the European Commission, the executive body
of the European Union (EU), said that the relations between the EU
and Hong Kong are stronger than before.
</P>
<P>
Before Hong Kong returned to China on July 1, 1997, Reuter
explained that after all the colonial administration in Hong Kong
was an administration run by one of the member states of the EU
and some European countries might think it was less important.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is a city in Asia where the greatest number of EU
citizens live (more than 50,000) and where you can find some 600
EU-based companies," Reuter told Xinhua at his office.
</P>
<P>
Working as an envoy of the EU in Hong Kong, Reuter is
responsible for developing contacts with the government of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) to boost cooperation
between the EU and the SAR.
</P>
<P>
More Europeans have arrived in Hong Kong since July 1, 1997, to
work here although Hong Kong's economy is now in difficulty due to
the Asian financial crisis, Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied that the Hong Kong government continues to
have a policy which encourages European business to stay here and
work here," Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
"That is very important. As you can imagine, businesses,
particularly some of the smaller businesses felt a little bit
concerned before July 1, 1997 over Hong Kong's future because they
were not sure whether things will stay the same as before," Reuter
said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one year after Hong Kong returned to China, all the
conditions for foreigners to do business here remain attractive,
Reuter said. The rule of law is still effectively followed and
Hong Kong continued to be an open society. These are all the
ingredients of favorable business environment.
</P>
<P>
Reuter told Xinhua that a number of Hong Kong chambers of
commerce and business associations with links to the EU banded
together in January to form the European Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The new European Chamber will be important in consolidating
Europe as a business partner of Hong Kong and the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the economy in Asia is confronted with dramatic
and difficult developments, closer cooperation between Europe's
dynamic chambers and business associations in Hong Kong makes good
sense, Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
"We are also satisfied that the first Legislative Council
elections were held in the first year after the establishment of
the SAR as promised," Reuter continued.
</P>
<P>
The elections on May 24 were very successful because there was
an unexpected high rate of turnout which meant that the Hong Kong
people are really more interested in having a say in the operation
of the government, he added.
</P>
<P>
"From our experience since we contacted both the SAR government
and the Chinese authorities, I think that China has made great
efforts to make sure that there will be no interference in Hong
Kong affairs," Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government decided on their own how to weather the
financial storm in Asia, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
Reuter is from Luxembourg and his work in Hong Kong is to
coordinate the work of the consulates-general of the EU member
states in Hong Kong and to explain to Hong Kong what the EU
policies are.
</P>
<P>
He also helps increase the business contacts and promote the
cooperation between the European and Hong Kong businesses.
</P>
<P>
As for the EU's policy for Hong Kong, Reuter said that his
office supports the "one country, two systems" principle and
strengthens the EU's direct links with Hong Kong in the areas
where Hong Kong exercises autonomy.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was satisfied that Hong Kong really enjoyed a
high degree of autonomy after its reunification with China.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Hong Kong's future, Reuter said that he was
optimistic about Hong Kong because Hong Kong has its strength.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is always able to deal with difficult situations,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Although Hong Kong's economy is in difficulty and its people
experience pain, Hong Kong remains a vibrant business center,
Reuter stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the last 15 years Europe's imports from Hong Kong almost
doubled, exports increased seven-fold and total trade multiplied
by more than three times.
</P>
<P>
Europeans like living here and appreciate a business
environment which is fashioned by the rule of law and an open
society owing to the effective and successful implementation of
Deng Xiaoping's "one country, two systems" policy, Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
Reuter said that one item of his work is to report to his
headquarters back in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of misunderstanding about Hong Kong and China,"
Reuter said. "Just after the People's Liberation Army marched into
Hong Kong, some parliamentarians of the European Commission asked
me whether the tanks of the PLA had rolled into streets of Hong
Kong."
</P>
<P>
"I need to explain to them how smooth the transition was," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Reuter is now taking a lesson of Mandarin and his youngest
daughter has just spent a year in Beijing studying Chinese. Reuter
said when he visited Beijing, his daughter worked as his
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
Reuter said that Hong Kong has a very very essential
relationship with China's mainland, and Hong Kong, through its
economic dynamism, through its capital, through its know-how and
expertise, has a role to play in the modernization and
transformation of the economic structure of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
"That role will generate wealth and prosperity for both Hong
Kong and the Chinese mainland and that is a key factor in
weathering the financial crisis," Reuter said.

LENS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria will play Spain on Wednesday
and its coach Hristo Bonev said he hoped group leaders Nigeria would
go all out in the match against Paraguay on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria could qualify only on the conditions that they beat
Spain while at the same time, Nigeria don't lose to Paraguay.

"As for the Nigeria-Paraguay match, I hope that FIFA will be

conditions." Bonev said.

As to their own match against Spain, Bonev said:"We need to play
well during the entire match against Spain. We can't lose

<HEADLINE> South Asia's Longest Bridge Completed in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TANGAIL, Bangladesh, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Jamuna
Multipurpose Bridge, the longest bridge in Bangladesh and in South
Asia, was completed and inaugurated Tuesday, the day the ruling
Awami League celebrated its second anniversary in power.
</P>
<P>
The 4.8-kilometer-long bridge in Tangail district links
northwest Bangladesh with the country's center-east region.
</P>
<P>
Besides road transportation, the world's 11th longest bridge,
also named "Bangabandhu Bridge" after Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman, the first prime minister of independent Bangladesh, will
also be used for train service, power and gas transmission and for
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
At a cost of 950 million U.S. dollars, the construction of the
bridge started in October 1994. The World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank and Japan each provided 200 million dollars for
the construction of the bridge, with the rest of the fund from the
Bangladeshi government.
</P>
<P>
Deltaic Bangladesh in South Asia is crisscrossed by many
rivers, with the Jamuna river, which flows through the country,
dividing it into two distinct and separate regions.
</P>
<P>
The 18.5 meter-wide bridge was inaugurated by Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
Communications ministers of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri
Lanka were present at the inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the bridge will greatly facilitate the
movement of passengers and freight traffic between the northwest
and center-east regions of the country, and contribute to the
economic development of the relatively underdeveloped northwest
region.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Cabinet Okays Draft Central Depository </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh's cabinet has
approved the draft Central Depository System (CDS) Act to make the
country's capital market transparent.
</P>
<P>
The approval was made at a cabinet meeting held Monday, the
Financial Express daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed act sought to float a company for the safekeeping
of share certificates which now remained in a scattered system.
</P>
<P>
The draft act placed earlier by the Securities and Exchange
Commission stated that the depository would be a private company
incorporated under the Companies Act 1994.
</P>
<P>
All securities credited to the depository portion of the
company register would be dematerialized and would remain in a
fungible form, according to the draft.
</P>
<P>
The hazards like physical transfer and delivery of shares would
be removed with the installation of CDS, market experts said,
pointing out that at present fake share syndrome hit the market
hard in the absence of this modern infrastructure of the capital
market.
</P>
<P>
The act would be placed before the Law Ministry and then be
submitted to the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Save Money from Direct Fuel Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will save about 50 million
U.S. Dollars on each cargo of imported fuel from the government's
new arrangement for direct importation of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement, approved over the weekend, involves four
multinational oil companies operating in Nigeria in direct
importation of fuel, especially petrol, diesel and kerosene.
</P>
<P>
The savings represent extra cost paid by the Nigerian
government while utilizing middlemen in the fuel import program
which was kicked off last April to fight nationwide fuel crisis.
</P>
<P>
Fuel imports were handled by two Swiss-based companies
Glencore and Winterschell under the previous arrangement.
</P>
<P>
"These were putting extra 50 million U.S. Dollars on each fuel
cargo since there were no nominated vessels to carry the
consignment," said sources from the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation, quoted by the Daily Times Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, no fewer than 52 cargoes of 30,000
tons or 39.75 million liters each, have been imported by the
company within the past 12 months to satisfy a nation daily
demand of 18 million liters.
</P>
<P>
This is the first attempt of the military regime led by new
Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar to solve the country's
fuel crisis which the country has been suffering from for more
than one year.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar was made Head of State shortly after the sudden death
of former Head of State General Sani Abacha on June 8.
</P>
<P>
The government has ordered an upward review of the domestic
crude oil allocation from 250,000 barrels per day to 300,000 in a
bid to increase petroleum product supply nationwide and arrest
the hydra-headed oil crisis caused by the fall of all its
refineries due to lack of repair.
</P>
<P>
To reduce direct import of the products, Nigeria is to undertake
a long-term arrangement for offshore processing of about 50,000
barrels per day of its crude oil whereby deficit products would
be brought back to augment direct importation and local
production.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Still Appealing to Foreign Investors (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong remains an attractive
business center for foreign enterprises about one year after it
became a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China under the
"one country, two systems" formula.
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys on foreign businesses showed that there was no
commercial exodus from Hong Kong despite the financial turmoil
which was plaguing the region.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong continues to appeal to foreign companies as it
maintains sound economic fundamentals and retains its uniqueness
as a free trading port.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Consul General Richard Boucher said recently that the high
level of confidence American companies had in Hong Kong remained
in spite of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has weathered the storm better than many other
economies, proving once again the resilience of the foundation on
which it has been built," he said.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the SAR government showed that the U.S.
had the largest number of regional headquarters in Hong Kong, with
219 companies in 1996, far exceeding Japan and the Chinese
mainland; America was also the second largest external investor in
Hong Kong's manufacturing industries, after Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Consul General Kunihiko Makita said that Japanese
companies at large had a positive outlook for their future
development in Hong Kong, although some small Japanese banks
reduced their presence here.

<HEADLINE> Pak Prepared to Enter Into Dialogue With India: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan said here Tuesday that the country was prepared to enter
into a serious dialogue with India, which would meaningfully
address the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Gohar made the remarks while meeting with visiting Speaker of
the House of Representatives of the Philippines Jose de Venecia,
who arrived here Sunday on a four-day visit to Pakistan, according
to an official press release.
</P>
<P>
Gohar briefed his guest on the regional situation with
particular reference to the recent momentous events and Pakistan's
efforts to defuse the tension with India by addressing the Kashmir
issue, the root cause of the tension.
</P>
<P>
The recent nuclear explosions by India and its hostile
pronouncements posed a grave security threat to Pakistan, Gohar
said.
</P>
<P>
"It was only after being threatened by the nuclear blackmail
that we decided to restore the strategic balance," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that sanctions would hurt Pakistan but the
nation was prepared for sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting matters pertaining to economic cooperation
between Pakistan and the Philippines were also discussed. It was
agreed that bilateral commercial ties were not commensurate with
the existing friendly relations between the two countries and
steps should be taken to increase bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
At the same time Gohar thanked the Speaker for the support
extended by the Philippines for Pakistan's desire to become a Full
Dialogue Partner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) and a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum.
</P>
<P>
The Speaker assured Pakistan of the continued support of the
Philippines in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He was of the view that Pakistan and the Philippines could
cooperate in ways to lessen impact of the monetary crisis in
Southeast Asia which is likely to continue for another 2-3 years.

<HEADLINE> China to Spend Billions to Treat Chronic Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 billion yuan will be
spent yearly on the treatment of chronic diseases, such as
cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes -- the major causes
of death in China today, according to a report by the National
Health Economics Institute.
</P>
<P>
The annual expenditure on these diseases will surpass 121.6
billion yuan (14.7 billion U.S. dollars) by the year 2000,
accounting for more than 30 percent of the national health
expenditure, and three times the figure in 1994, the report
stated.
</P>
<P>
The report shows faster growth in the total health expenditure
than the national economic growth, caused partly by the high
incidence of chronic diseases and related deaths.
</P>
<P>
China's national health expenditure grows at an annual rate of
12 percent, compared with a GDP (gross domestic product) growth
rate of 8 percent, the goal for China this year.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic of chronic diseases in China is often associated
with a longer life expectancy, faster urbanization, environmental
pollution and a change of lifestyles, the report stated.
</P>
<P>
In addition to 90 million hypertension patients and 20 million
diabetes sufferers, 1.6 million people become cancer patients and
1.5 million suffer from strokes each year. About 13,000 of these
die every day.
</P>
<P>
Conducting preventive activities among community residents has
proved successful in campaigns against chronic diseases, said Kong
Lingzhi, an official in charge of chronic disease control in the
Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
"However, there are many difficulties and obstacles in this
field, such as lacking policy and financial support as a result of
underestimating the diseases," she said.
</P>
<P>
A group of research programs has been undertaken by medical
institutes, whose results may be published at a national
conference on prevention of chronic diseases later this year.

<P>
MARSEILLE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Norway will play Brazil in a
vital match on Tuesday and coach Egil Olsen admitted he was left
with no choises.
</P>
<P>
Norway defeated Brazil 4-2 in a friendly in Oslo last year but
Olsen said the friendly could not be compared with Tuesday's World
Cup match.
</P>
<P>
"The Brazilian team will be better prepared than for the
friendly match in Oslo. Obviously, you can't compare the two
matches." said Olsen.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a 50-50 chance of getting through to the last 16,
and a 20 percent chance to beat Brazil," said Olsen, "We'll be happy
if we get pass this stage, but we are prepared for the possibility
that we might lose."
</P>
<P>
Olsen said Norway was not very convincing in the previous two
matches which all ended in draw, "But we can feel a wave of optimism
because we like to be in the situation of being the underdogs, to
surprise the opponents and apply an effective pressure in midfield."
Olsen said.

Following are the Norwegian starting line-up for the match against
Brazil as announced by Olsen on Monday:

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government in Talk With Abiola: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has entered into
talk with Moshood Abiola, a detained politician and believed winner of
the annulled 1993 presidential elections, for his possible release, the
Post Express reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an authoritative source as saying that the secret
meeting was held in Nigerian capital Abuja between Abiola and military
chiefs representing the Nigerian government. But it did not say when it
was held.
</P>
<P>
Abiola was reportedly in a good spirit at the talk, but he insisted
on reclaiming his mandate as the winner of the June 12, 1993 election.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to release him so that he could consult
with Nigerians who gave him the mandate, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Nigerian government was impressed by
the outcome of the first round of discussions and has ordered the
relaxation of security measures on Abiola, who is now given access to
newspapers, radio and television.
</P>
<P>
The release of Abiola was already being considered at the highest
level of the government as a result of the meeting, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Following the release of nine political detainees, including former
head of state, General Olusegun Obasanjo, by Nigeria's new leadership
under General Abdulsalam Abubakar last week, there have been amounting
pressure both in and outside Nigeria for the release of Abiola.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, have said that Abiola is unlikely to compromise
his mandate, otherwise he would have been freed long time ago. In
this case, they said, he would not be released by the government.
</P>
<P>
The 1993 presidential elections were the climax of the transition to
civil rule program of the then military government of Ibrahim
Babangida, who came to power in 1985.
</P>
<P>
When announced results show that Abiola, a successful businessman
and millionaire from south Nigeria's Ogun State, was certain to win,
the election was annulled and transition stopped.
</P>
<P>
Abiola was put into jail by the Sani Abacha government on June 23,
1994, when he announced himself the winner of the 1993 election and
president of Nigeria. He has been since in prison.

<HEADLINE> S. African Economy on Brink of Recession: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's economy could
be on the brink of recession after a sudden surge of the Reserve
Bank's repo rate prompted fears of further commercial bank
interest rate hikes, the Business Day reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The repo rate, the market-set rate at which the Reserve Bank
lends to commercial banks, leaped to 23.985 percent Monday from
Friday's 20.377 percent, leading to a sharp weakening in the Bond
and equity markets, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted that commercial bank interest rates
will have to rise between two and three percentage points if the
situation does not improve within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The repo rate, introduced by the Reserve Bank in March,
remained at about 15 percent until mid-May.
</P>
<P>
In response to the repo rate hike, the beleaguered Rand
reached its new record low of 5.55 against the U.S. dollar before
settling at 5.51 in late afternoon trade.
</P>
<P>
Equities were hit by a wave of selling, sending the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange's financial index tumbling more than
4.2 percent, the industrial index 3.3 percent and the overall
index 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Standard Bank raised its prime rate to 21.25
percent from 20.25 percent after the repo rate jumped to 20.377
percent.
</P>
<P>
Most banking executives were at the meetings to assess the
situation late Monday, with Standard Bank saying it was
monitoring the situation "minute by minute."  First National
Bank said that it would review its position again Tuesday,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The events of the past few days painted a gloomy picture for
South Africa's growth prospects, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Many had revised their forecasts for the year downward to
between 0.7 percent and one percent from two percent earlier this
year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
One economist said that he expected the banks to hike their
prime rates to about 25 percent in the coming weeks, and the
Reserve Bank to maintain a high interest rate regime until at
least the fourth quarter to restore some stability to the Rand.
</P>
<P>
Others said the situation could be worse. If the situation
continued, they said, the economy could be plunged into a
recession.
</P>
<P>
"The Reserve Bank has two weeks to intervene to stabilize the
currency and save the economy," Breytenbach said. "If (it) does
not... South Africa will basically be in a recession."

<HEADLINE> U.S.,DPRK Generals Meet at Pamnunjon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from the U.S. Forces
in South Korea and the army of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK)Tuesday met at the truce village of Panmunjon, the
first since 1991.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the two sides reaffirmed the importance of
continuing dialogue to build confidence, prevent misunderstanding and
reduce tension on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. army said the meeting was a good first step in establishing
a crisis management mechanism to help prevent or deal with any
military incidents.
</P>
<P>
The one-hour and twenty-minute meeting was held in a constructive
atmosphere at the conference room of the Military Armistice
Commission, said a news release by the U.S. troops stationed in South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
However, a controversy is said to have flared up at the meeting
when the U.S. troops described a DPRK submarine's infiltration into
South Korean side of the East Sea Monday afternoon as "obvious
violation of the Armistice Agreement" signed in 1953.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK sub was found entangled in a fishing net about 11 miles
off the coast of South Korea's Sokcho at 4:30 p.m. Monday and has been
tugged to a South Korean naval base.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Major General Michael Hayden, Brigadier
General Keum Ki-youn, Brigadier General Colin Parr, Special Colonel
Smanthap Sinchai from the U.S. troops and Lietenant General Li
Chan-bok, Major General Cho Dong-hyon and Senior Colonel Pak Rim-su
from the DPRK army.

<HEADLINE> S. African Trade Unions Attack Govt's Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Congress of South
African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has warned that its two million
members will revert to military struggle to force the government
to abandon its macroeconomic growth, employment and
redistribution policy (Gear).
</P>
<P>
The daily Star Tuesday reported that the warning was jointly
made by Cosatu's first Vice-President Connie September and
General-Secretary Mbasima Shilowa at the federation's central
committee meeting in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
"The days of militant struggles led by our shop stewards are
now needed... Gear must go so that we can see the full
implementation of the RDP (Reconstruction and Development
Program)," September said.
</P>
<P>
The Gear strategy, announced by the South African government
led by President Nelson Mandela in June 1996, aims at creating a
competitive fast-growing economy which provides sufficient jobs
for all job seekers.
</P>
<P>
The policy was also designed to make a redistribution of
income and opportunities in favor of the poor, and to set up an
environment in which homes are secure and places of work are
productive.
</P>
<P>
However, September claimed that Gear had failed because it
focused on selfish, short-term business interests.
</P>
<P>
"Two years into Gear, workers are really beginning to feel its
pinch, Gear's rigid deficit and revenue targets have meant a very
limited implementation of the (former) RDP," she said.
</P>
<P>
The RDP, put into force in 1994 soon after apartheid was
abolished, is the predecessor of Gear strategy. It stressed the
need to uplift the living standard of poor people and to narrow
the gap between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
September said that last year alone the economy had shed more
than 120,000 jobs, while worker productivity had risen since
1992.
</P>
<P>
She said that corporate profits were breaking records while
the wage gap was increasing with no significant steps taken to
shift the tax burden from the poor to the rich.

<HEADLINE> China Supports APEC Sectoral Liberalization Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUCHING, Malaysia, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China said here Tuesday
it, in principle, is actively supportive of Early Voluntary
Sectoral Liberalization (EVSL) process.
</P>
<P>
"We have, in a serious and cooperative manner, participated in
the whole process of consultations concerning sectoral selection
and finalization of implementing details. On top of that, China,
with acceptable level of domestic industries in mind, has
submitted a detailed plan for participation in the nine sectors
(identified under the EVSL initiative)," Long Yongtu, Chief
Representative for Trade Negotiations of the Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Ministry of China, told the APEC trade
ministers meeting here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The nine sectors are chemicals, environmental goods and
services, energy, fish and fish products, forest products, gems
and jewellery, medical equipment and instruments, toys and
telecommunications, mutual recognition arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Long said despite the fact that the whole region was severely
hit by the financial crisis which also exerted substantial impact
on China's economy and trade, compounded by the enormous pressure
of rising unemployment following reforms in economic systems and
government re-institutions, China will not halt its process of
reform and opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Instead, China will intensify its reform programs both in scope
and magnitude and form closer economic links with the rest of the
world, Long said.
</P>
<P>
"Taking into account the macro economic and trade environment
in this region, we should give special attention to the following
principles if we wish to succeed in EVSL," long said.
</P>
<P>
First, EVSL should be based on the principle of voluntarism.
Given the fact that APEC members are at different stages of
economic development, affected in various degrees by the financial
crisis and, that their acceptable level to liberalization varies
from one to another, members should be allowed to decide on their
own how to participate in the EVSL process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Second, adequate flexibility should be included in the sectoral
liberalization plan, which means that the coverage and
implementation schedule should reflect the practical difficulties
and acceptable level of APEC members, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we insist too much on setting high standards in sectoral
agreement, it will in the end affect the active participation of
members and effective implementation of the plans," he added.
</P>
<P>
Third, EVSL should reflect the spirit of two timetables of
Bogor, which formulated the basic framework for the implementation
of APEC trade liberalization and developing members should receive
differentiated treatment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Long said China stresses that these principles could enable all
APEC members to effectively participate in the EVSL process.
</P>
<P>
He said at the time when the East Asian region is facing
financial crisis, APEC members should exhibit the spirit of unity
and cooperation and such a spirit is conducive to strengthen the
confidence in overcoming difficulties, and to mobilize market
forces so that the crisis-affected members could come out of the
crisis and Asian economies could recover and maintain sustainable
and stable development.
</P>
<P>
Long said according to the decision of the Leaders' Meeting
last year, EVSL is identified as a major subject for ministers'
review this year and thanks to the concerted efforts of APEC
members, certain progress in this area has been made.
</P>
<P>
EVSL is one of the main items on the agenda at the two-day APEC
trade ministers meeting which concluded later Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Chile Refuses to Under-Estimate Cameroon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NANTES, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Chilean captain Ivan Zamorano said
it was dangerous to under-estimate Cameroon when the two teams clash
in their last group match here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It's often said that you should never under-estimate any team in
this World Cup, and that is entirely true for Cameroon," said
Zamorano, "Their energy could pose problems for us, but we are
confident."
</P>
<P>
Zamorano said:"We have recovered pisically and mentally and we
are ready to play our own game without worrying about what may be
happening on other pitches."
</P>
<P>
Chile need a win to secure their berth in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Defender Francisco Rojas said:"Although everyone talks about
only Salas and Zamorano, Chile have a real good team. We haven't
been lucky until now, but I hope our luck will change tomorrow when
we play Cameroon."
</P>
<P>
Marcelo Salas, who had scored three goals for Chile at this
World Cup finals, said:"The match against Cameroon is of course very
important, but I have full confidence in our squad and I'm sure
we'll qualify."
</P>
<P>
Salas said earlier in the tournament that he began wondering
whether it was bad luck or lack of concentration that Chile had
squandered their lead in the two matches against Italy and Austria.
</P>
<P>
"We are not feeling pressure than we did when we faced Austria
and Italy. In spite of everything we must be careful not to be
overawed at the prospect of playing Brazil, but to just play the game
on the day." said Salas.
</P>
<P>
If Chile beat Cameroon and finished second in Group B, they will
have an early encounter with tournament favorites Brazil in the
round of 16.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: More Political, Economic Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- With the increasing pressure from
his conservative rivals and the declining oil market, Iran's
moderate President Mohammad Khatami is facing more political and
economic challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
In less than one year in office, Khatami suffered the first
serious political setback on Sunday when the
conservative-dominated Majlis (parliament) impeached one of his
strongest supporters, Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Despite of all his weight thrown behind Nouri in the showdown
with the conservatives, Khatami failed to convince the hard-liners
in the Majlis to give green light for his government to implement
its liberal political and social policies.
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats in Tehran said the offensive of the
conservatives was well-designed.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives were determined to pull Nouri out of the
sensitive position of interior minister, even if Khatami warned
that Nouri's absence from the cabinet would be detrimental to the
government and the country.
</P>
<P>
Nouri is not the first target of the conservative offensive.
The technocrat Tehran Mayor, Gholamhussein Karbaschi, Nouri's
close friend and another Khatami follower, has already been put on
trial since June 7 on charges of embezzlement, misuse of public
funds and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi's fate is not clear so far. Many prominent moderate
figures doubted that he would be able to remain in his office as
the judiciary is also dominated by the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
An open dispute between the conservatives and moderates has
already surfaced over performance of Minister of Culture and
Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani, who has made desperate
efforts to carry out Khatami's motto of freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani is under fire from his rivals for rejecting
censorship and giving a free hand to the press and intellectuals
to express their ideas freely.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believed that it will be difficult for
Khatami to deliver his campaign promises made during the
presidential elections in May last year because of the political
hurdles set up by the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Besides the political woes, Khatami is also facing another
strong challenge on the economic front. The country's ailing
economy has been hit badly by the continued decline of oil prices
in the world market. The prices have plunged into the lowest point
in the first 10 months of Khatami's office.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Construction Jihad Mohammad Saeedi-Kia has warned
that the government would suffer a loss of 4 billion U.S. dollars
in hard currency in the 1998-99 budget due to the oil price fall.
</P>
<P>
Iran relies on petrodollars for about 80 percent of its hard
currency earnings and up to 40 percent of state revenue. Lower oil
income means higher inflation rate and unemployment that could
hurt the social stability.
</P>
<P>
Khatami has stressed the importance of reducing dependence on
oil and shifting to a non-oil economy by boosting industrial
production, increasing privatization and attracting more foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
The whole nation is now waiting for his package of plans to
reinvigorate the ailing economy. However, the people could lose
patience toward him if he is unable to come forward with viable
alternatives soon to overcome the economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Bureaucracy in Lebanon Blocks Foreign Investments, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese central bank has
warned that bureaucratic inefficiency is impeding the inflow of
foreign investment which is badly needed for Lebanon's
reconstruction from the devastating 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
In the latest issue of its quarterly report on the overall
performance of the country's economy, Banque du Liban said lengthy
procedures on projects in certain public departments are
"crippling investments in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The report came at a time when local businessmen complained
that investors from Arab and other foreign countries were
irritated by the "bureaucratic behavior of Lebanese officials."
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star newspaper Tuesday quoted businessmen as
complaining that it usually takes six to nine months to obtain a
license to start a company in Lebanon and more time to get a
building construction permit.
</P>
<P>
"Expatriate Lebanese left Lebanon with a bitter taste in their
mouth after failing to obtain licenses for industrial plants in
Bekaa and the south," Ramzi Diab, a Lebanese food importer was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that many Lebanese businessmen have decided to invest
their money in Africa "where the authorities are more than
receptive to joint projects."
</P>
<P>
Labeling the public departments as "inefficient and politicized
offices," the newspaper report said that most staff in these
departments were selected for their political and sectarian
affiliation instead of their qualification.
</P>
<P>
Although the government is striving to improve the departments'
efficiency by modernizing their office appliances, the report
quoted economist Marawan Iskandar as saying that 55 percent of the
employees are aged over 50 and it is hard for them to grasp the
new technology.
</P>
<P>
There are no official statistics available for now on foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial statistics, Lebanon attracted 4 billion
U.S. dollars worth of foreign investments from 1990 to 1997, with
most of the money going to private sectors.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister's Visit to Africa Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese foreign minister Tang
Jiaxuan's visit to Africa has helped enhance the friendship and
mutual cooperation between China and African countries.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said this at the
regular press conference here this afternoon. The Chinese foreign
minister recently toured five western countries.
</P>
<P>
Though Africa now has difficulties and face challenges, and
even in some areas, there are wars and conflicts, Tang noted, the
African continent is advancing toward peace and development on the
whole and is playing an ever more important role in international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Sino-African friendship could be strongly felt during the
minister's visit to these countries. "Sino-African relationship
is established upon long-term and common strategic interests, and
will not change because of any changes in domestic and
international situations," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Tang described Sino-African relationship, particularly the
economic and trade ties, as highly potential, which could be
further tapped.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tang said, China will increase coordination and
consultations with Africa in international affairs, and safeguard
the just rights and interests of the developing countries, and
join the African countries to strive to establish new
international political and economic orders as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
China will increase its economic and trade ties on the
principle of equality, mutual benefit and common development, Tang
added.
</P>
<P>
At last, Tang said that the international community should
respect the countries politically and help them economically and
support them to overcome poverty.

(DPRK) every day this fall, Chung Ju-yung, founder of the South
Korean Hyundai Group, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chung, who came back Tuesday morning from an eight-day visit to
the DPRK, told a press conference that he had signed contracts
with the DPRK's departments concerned to lead South Koreans to a
tour of Mountain Kumkang.
</P>
<P>
The contracts would enable about 1,000 tourists from South
Korea to visit Mountain Kumkang every day this fall at the
earliest, said the 83-year-old business tycoon.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that his visit to the DPRK will help create a
rapprochement atmosphere for South-North exchanges and bring the
long-cherished reunification at an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
Chung, who was born in what is now the DPRK's Tongchon, crossed
the Military Demarcation Line on June 16 with his donation of 500
cattle and 40,000 tons of maize loaded on 50 Hyundai trucks.
</P>
<P>
Chung is the first South Korean businessman to have entered the
DPRK on foot via the truce village of Panmunjon.

<HEADLINE> 12 Employees of Zambian Central Bank Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian Central Bank has
suspended 12 employees in relation to one billion Kwacha (about
500,000 U.S. Dollars) allegedly stolen from the bank, the Post
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The periodical quoted bank spokesman Kabinga Pande as saying
here Monday that the 12 employees have been suspended to
facilitate the investigations into the alleged missing of the
money.
</P>
<P>
Pande said the bank's internal audit department discovered "some
financial irregularities" in the Currency Division during a
routine audit check.
</P>
<P>
"This discovery has resulted in the suspension of 12 employees
from junior ranks to senior management staff," the spokesman said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The periodical also quoted a senior official of the bank as
saying over the weekend that the missing funds had as of last
Friday reached about one billion Kwacha which has led to the
suspension of the Currency Division's Assistant Director Cosmas
Mwanza with 11 other staff under his supervision.
</P>
<P>
The fraud was unearthed last Monday after a cleaner at the bank
discovered 56 million Kwacha in one of the bank's storage rooms.

<HEADLINE> National Domestic Tourism Fair Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The '98 China Domestic Tourism
Fair will be held Dec. 6-11 in Quanzhou, a city in east China's
Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The event, jointly sponsored by the China National Tourism
Administration (CNTA) and the Fujian provincial government, is
expected to attract nearly 40,000 travel agents and employees in
the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
Each Chinese province, autonomous region, and municipality will
organize delegations to attend the fair. A total of 810 exhibit
stands will be set up at the site, according to CNTA.
</P>
<P>
China Domestic Tourism Fair is the country's largest tourist
gala. Five fairs of the kind have been held continuously since
1993, CNTA sources said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the fair's success, Quanzhou is accelerating
construction of basic tourism facilities and plans to provide a
beautiful sightseeing environment as well as a safe social
environment for the participants.

<HEADLINE> China Builds Low-temperature Air Transonic Wind-tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have invented a
low-temperature air transonic wind-tunnel in southwest China's
Sichuan Province, a step forward for the country's aerospace
program.
</P>
<P>
A recent test in this effort by China Air Dynamics Research
Center in northwestern part of Sichuan got an airflow temperature
at -141 degrees centigrade, using compressed air for refrigeration
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary wind-tunnels no longer meet the increasing demand of
China's supersonic air dynamic research tests for new space
aircrafts. The latest achievement will make it possible to build
large-scale wind-tunnels of Reynolds number, which are badly
needed to develop new aircrafts.
</P>
<P>
Reynolds number is a major simulated parameter for wind-tunnel
tests, and its variations can truly reflect the real flight
competence.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries have built three wind-tunnels, using liquid
nitrogen refrigeration techniques, but cost dearly.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientist Yu Hongru put forward the low-temperature air
refrigeration idea, and the center has turned his concept into
reality after years of hard work.
</P>
<P>
The new wind-tunnel can also be energy-efficient and
environment-friendly, scientists said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urges Moderation on Philippine Airlines' Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Tuesday called on the management and employees of the Philippine
Airlines (PAL) to use "moderation and creative patience" in
solving their present labor problem.
</P>
<P>
In talks with newsmen, Ramos said this was the same call he
made during PAL's big strike three years ago which also threatened
to collapse the airline's services within the country as well as
on its international routes.
</P>
<P>
The PAL problem is now a matter between the management and the
employees through their unions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The government has brought them together on the negotiation
table and they have talked but only cursorily. This is a
management situation right now in terms of the future of the
corporation," he said.
</P>
<P>
While the government is a minor equity partner of the majority
owner of PAL, Ramos said, "being what it is, a privatized
corporation, (the) government cannot impose its will on the
owners."
</P>
<P>
The company's 620-member pilots' union went on strike two weeks
ago, demanding revision of its collective bargaining agreement
with the management. The indefinite strike has cost the company
more than 50 million U.S. dollars in revenue loss, according to
PAL.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for OIC Session on Jerusalem Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Monday called for an extraordinary session of the Organization of
the Islamic Conference (OIC) to adopt proper stand toward Israel's
decision on expanding Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, currently holding the OIC chairmanship, made the call
in a statement to leaders of the OIC member states, the official
news agency IRNA said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that the recent decision of the Israeli government
on Jerusalem along with its already established policy of
occupation and flagrant violation of international law and
resolutions of the U.N. Security Council, manifested the regime's
total disregard for the least demands of the world community.
</P>
<P>
He warned of the danger of "this aggressive action of the
Zionists" which he called was another step towards further
trampling on the inalienable rights of "the courageous people of
Palestine."
</P>
<P>
Israel Sunday approved a plan that would extend Jerusalem
municipal authority over eight Jewish settlements in the West
Bank, which was seen as steps to expand Jerusalem's borders.
</P>
<P>
The plan touched off a storm of criticism inside and outside
Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords signed between Israel and the
Palestinians, the status of Jerusalem should be negotiated in the
final status talks. Before that, the two sides should refrain from
unilateral actions to change the city's status, demographic
composition and other characteristics.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Concerned Over Israel's Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has expressed
regret at Israel's move to expand the borders of Jerusalem in
order to increase the city's Jewish population.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is sensitive to both the Israelis and
the Palestinians and requires a negotiated diplomatic solution
involving all parties, South Africa's Foreign Affairs Department
said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet Sunday approved a plan to extend Jerusalem
municipal authority over eight settlements in the West Bank,
which has been seen as a step to expand the borders of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The move has drawn harsh criticism from the United States and
the Palestinians, who said that it violated the Oslo accords
which forbid any party to take unilateral action to change the
status of Jerusalem, the holy city to Muslims, Christians and
Jews.
</P>
<P>
"The Netanyahu government's decision to ignore appeals from
Israeli opposition leaders and pro-peace activists as well as
Israel's peace partners and the international community to avoid
unilateral actions which damage the peace process, demonstrates a
cavalier attitude to the requirements of peace making," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement called for a concerted international response to
Israeli Government's provocative actions to restore faith to the
stalled peace process in the Middle East.

"I'm happy that I scored against England. It was the most important
goal of my life."

I made a little joke on the bus coming here for the game -- I said I

HARBIN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Songhua River, in northeast

suspension because of low water levels.
</P>
<P>
At 8 a.m. today, the water level had risen to 113.29 meters
because of rainfall since mid-June. The water level of the
900-kilometer-long river is continuing to rise.

On May 25, the river's water level dropped to 111 meters, the
lowest since 1949. More than 100 ships were ordered to suspend
navigation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Rujie, head of the Harbin Hydrometric Station, attributed
the river's decline to lower water levels last winter, light
rainfall and higher temperatures this year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Becoming Consumer of Hard Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is slowly moving away
from being a traditional transit country for hard drugs into a
consumer as more of the drugs become easily available locally,
the daily Herald newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last year the Police Drugs and Narcotics Squad seized drugs
worth over 500,000 U.S. Dollars which had been illegally smuggled
into the country. Over half of this was destined for the local
market while some of it was on its way to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, which was traditionally a transit
center for the drugs destined for Johannesburg, South Africa, has
over the years been transformed into an established consumer of
the hard drugs mainly due to the predominance of foreigners who
came from countries where drug abuse is common.
</P>
<P>
Such hard drugs as cocaine, heroin and lysergic acid
diethylamide (LSD) are now commonly available on the streets of
Harare putting at risk the lives of thousands of young people who
are exposed to them.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Drugs and Narcotics Squad, 35
percent of the drugs which were finding their way on to the local
market were from Malawi, 30 percent from Mozambique and less than
five percent were from Zambia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's new Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has said that the priority of his
administration is the enthronement of genuine democracy, human
rights and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The vision of his administration for the country is one where
nobody will be intimidated because of his views, tribe or
religion, Abubakar said Monday in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with members of the National Human Rights
Commission, Abubakar said that his administration will do
everything possible to bring an end to human rights abuses in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, who became Nigeria's new Head of State shortly after
the sudden death of his predecessor General Sani Abacha on June
8, said that he would like "to see a Nigeria where democracy and
the rule of law reign supreme."
</P>
<P>
The new leader last week ordered the release of nine political
prisoners including former head of state General Olusegun
Obasanjo, who was serving a 15-year jail term in connection with
the March 1995 coup plot.
</P>
<P>
The release has won wide welcome both at home and abroad as a
gesture for national reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Community Helps Drug Addicts Return to New Life (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Hugging both his wife and son,
Zhou Wei, 38, was extremely delighted: two years of rehabilitation
had helped him give up his drug addiction and led to a reunion
today with his wife and son.
</P>
<P>
"For two years, I have been dreaming of this day," he
said. "It's the government and the community that saved me from
drugs and helped me to turn over a new leaf."
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the United Nations and the city government of
Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province, jointly
invested 50,000 yuan (6,000 US dollars) to establish Jinbi
Community to facilitate the rehabilitation of drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
As one of the beneficiaries of the Jinbi Community, Zhou Wei
said: "In an environment full of sympathy, I come to give up drugs
and started my new life."
</P>
<P>
The grey-haired Guo Jiayou, director of Jinbi, said that the
community periodically organized get-togethers for the so-called
"students," former drug-abusers, and encouraged them to swap
experiences during their rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the community regularly invites experts
to give lectures on the latest information about giving up drugs
and to help the students map out plans and boost confidence in
their rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Pino Arlacchi, deputy secretary-general of the United Nations
and executive director of the United Nations Drug Control Program,
said during his recent inspection to Yunnan Province he "has
witnessed a very efficient and very careful way to treat addiction
with rehabilitation."
</P>
<P>
The drug-use population in Yunnan has dropped to about 40,000,
down from 57,000 in 1990, because of the province's three-tier
rehabilitation system, Arlacchi said, namely medical treatment,
psychotherapy and rehabilitation with help from all circles.

JOHANNESBURG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading South African newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Business Day:
</P>
<P>
-- The weakening South African national currency Rand, coupled
with high interest rates, could soon result in the liquidation of
companies, job losses and increased repossessions, local
economists and consumer experts warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Star:
</P>
<P>
-- The Office of President Nelson Mandela Monday angrily
blamed a "disinformation campaign by elements opposed to South
African's democracy" for reports of an oil-for-arms deal with
Libya.
</P>
<P>
The Citizen:

<HEADLINE> Chinese Community Helps Drug Addicts Return to New Life (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The success of the community lies in its scientific and
home-like circumstances, Guo said, and in its sincerity to help
its students solve their physical and psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1997 China's 695 compulsory
rehabilitaion centers rehabilitated 180,000 drug-abusers, and its
86 labor rehabilitation centers accepted more than 90,000 drug
addicts. Among the rehabilitation centers, a number of model units
emerged for efficiently transforming drug abusers.
</P>
<P>
On June 11, Guo Yi, another beneficiary of the Jinbi Community,
was invited to the Shunkang Compulsory Rehabilitation Center in
Beijing, capital of China.
</P>
<P>
Addressing more than 500 former drug addicts who were
undergoing compulsory rehabilitation, Guo said, "I once was in
despair as I thought that I could never get rid of the bad habit,
but now I am quite confident in overcoming the habit with the help
of my family, my friends and the society around me."
</P>
<P>
Guo, once a promising businessman, began to sniff drugs in 1989
as a result of desiring stimulation. Two years later, he began to
take drugs by injection.
</P>
<P>
By the time he was sent to a compulsory rehabilitation center
in 1993, he had lost more than 100,000 yuan of his savings, and
also had to separate from his family. Guo said he was deserted by
his friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Guo resumed taking drugs and soon was sent to a labor
rehabilitation center. He was released from the center two years
later and accepted by the Jinbi Community.
</P>
<P>
Four years after his rehabilitation, Guo now works for a
construction company in Kunming with a monthly income of 1,200
yuan; and he is now living a decent life, happy and contented.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli government appeared divided Monday over holding
a referendum on implementing the second pullback from the West
Bank. Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky and Education
Minister Yitzhak Levy supported a binding referendum, rather than
the "advisory" one as recommended by Justice Minister Tzahi
Hanegbi. Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom and Agriculture Minister
Rafael Eitan expressed strong opposition to the referendum
idea. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai also voiced doubts over
the idea.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that he has
not yet decided whether to hold a referendum on the second
further redeployment but insisted that any such referendum would
be binding on the government, despite being called "a
consultative" referendum. He said if a referendum is to be held,
it can be carried out within two months and it will cost about
one-fifth of the widely reported sum of 100 million Shekels (about
27.4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- President Ezer Weizman said Monday that he will be very
unhappy if he found the referendum is only a time-saving
trick. It is too early for a referendum, he said, since a
redeployment is not a final deal. "The question is if one should
go to a referendum on such a very partial agreement. This is where
I have doubts," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Land Resettlement Starts This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's second phase of the
resettlement program began earlier this month with 12 farms
having been acquired and demarcated for the process, the Local
Government and National Housing Minister said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has decided to accelerate the pace
of the resettlement program "to redress the injusticies in land
ownership with utmost speed,'' Local Government and National
Housing Minister John Nkomo told a news conference here, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The minsiter said, " Any further delays in resolving the
inequities in land use and ownership will protract the poverty
and suffering of the peasant farmers, and we cannot tolerate it
for any further month.''
</P>
<P>
This latest move by the government on the land issue came as
hundreds of land hungry villagers in Marondera, about 90
kilometres east of Harare, forcibly occupied commercial farms and
vowed to stay put, saying the government was taking long to
resettle them.
</P>
<P>
Last month, more than 800 villagers in the Nyamandlovu Area
outside the second largest city of Bulawayo occupied five
commercial farms, also citing delays by the government to
allocate them land.
</P>
<P>
However, Nkomo said the speeding up of the resettlement
program had nothing to do with the occupations.
</P>
<P>
He said beneficiaries will be settled on the guiding
principles of orderliness, transparency and fairness.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Action to Complicate Middle East Situation, Spokesman Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang
Guoqiang said here today that Israel's recent adoption of plans,
which are intended to unilaterally change the status quo of
Jerusalem, will "inevitably further complicate the situation in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the remarks in response to a question concerning the
issue at today's routine news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Cabinet reportedly on Sunday approved plans to
expand the boundaries of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Such attempt runs counter to the positive efforts made by other
parties concerned to push the Middle East peace process, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that the Israeli side will strictly abide by the
relevant U.N. resolutions on the question of Jerusalem and the
Oslo Agreement and stop doing anything that might aggravate the
situation, so that the stalemated Middle East peace process will
move forward as soon as possible," he added.

<HEADLINE> 16 Kenyans Killed in Road Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen Kenyans were killed and
38 injured in two separate road accidents on Sunday and Monday
and which occurred only a few days after 17 people were killed
in one of Kenya's worst bus crashes on June 16, said traffic
officials.
</P>
<P>
Eleven passengers died and 18 were injured in an accident
involving two Nairobi-bound matatus (buses) and a mini bus on the
Nairobi-Nakuru road Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The two matatus, ferrying passengers from Nakuru to Nairobi,
were chasing each other when the accident occurred," said Traffic
Commandant Philemon Abong'o Monday.
</P>
<P>
"One of the matatus hit the other from the rear, forcing it
off the lane. It collided head on with an oncoming mini bus," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Six people died instantly while five others died in hospital
in Nakuru Town. The dead were all in the matatu that was hit
from behind, said Abong'o.
</P>
<P>
Another 18 passengers are in critical condition at hospitals,
he added.
</P>
<P>
In another accident in Thika, a Nairobi suburb, five people
including four children died and 20 were injured when a matatu
overturned on the road on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
At least 18 people were injured when the matatu overturned on
the Muranga-Thika road, several kilometers from central Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents have claimed more than 4,000 lives in the east
African country in the last two years, according to the latest

<HEADLINE> Zhenhai Port Becomes Largest Fluids Transfer Hub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Zhenhai Port in Ningbo, a city in
east China's Zhejiang Province, has become the country's largest
transfer center for chemicals and other fluid goods, according to
the port authorities.
</P>
<P>
China imports 2.5-to-3 million tons of fluid goods, mostly
chemicals, every year. The port of Zhenhai has an annual handling
capacity of three million tons.
</P>
<P>
The prices of imported fluids at the port are used by local
custom offices as a reference for tax refunds.
</P>
<P>
Pipelines connect berths and railways in the port area, which
enable the transfer of fluids from large vessels to smaller ones,
and from ships to trains.
</P>
<P>
Strict safety measures have been adopted by the port
authorities to reduce risks, and facilities such as two giant
fire-fighting pumping towers from the United States have been
installed.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the port has handled 158
tankers, including 120 from abroad.
</P>
<P>
At present, 10 foreign-funded companies at the port are engaged
in the transport and storage of fluid goods.

<HEADLINE> Universities Urged to Improve Students' Ability to Innovate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese universities should
strengthen the training of students' innovative knowledge and
ability to meet the demand of a knowledge-based economy, an
offcial of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Feng Zhengyu, from northeast China's Jilin University, said the
current rigid management in some Chinese universities, which
focuses on the unity of students, offers limited opportunities
for students to freely think about and innovate.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with the rapid development of high-tech industries
worldwide, the Chinese government has realized that the 21st
century will be an era of knowledge-based economy. A generation of
young Chinese with pioneering ability needs to be trained to
promote the knowledge-based economy in the country, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin has stressed time and again that
innovation is the soul of a nation's advancement and an
unremitting driving force for a nation's development.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Hu Jintao also encouraged young people to
emancipate their minds, be pioneering and ambitious.
</P>
<P>
However, Feng said many Chinese universities lack an effective
mechanism to stimulates students' creative ability and pioneering
spirit.
</P>
<P>
He said some universities reward students based on their exam
marks, daily deeds and social experiences instead of their
creative ability and innovation.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that scientific research departments
in Chinese universities should open doors to undergraduates,
instead of only to postgraduates and teachers, to shorten the time
for training of young scientific workers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government plans to set up a "state innovation
system" to establish a group of national research institutes and
universities which can complete important scientific research
programs and train a large group of inventors and personnel with
creative ability.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam determined to host Asean
Tiger Cup football tournament, Vietnam's English Daily "Vietnam
News" (VNS) reported monday.
</P>
<P>
Asean Football Federation (AFF) Secretary Dato Paul Mony Samuel
last Friday asked Vietnam to host the Tiger Cup.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Vietnam has been asked to host the
event.
</P>
<P>
VNS said that it will be a challenge for Vietanm to organize
international standard stadiums and satellite broadcasting.
However, football and relevant authorities here have confimed they
are determined to host the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The AFF invitation comes as a surprise. as Vietnam first lost
out on the chance to host the prestigious football tournament when
Malaysia was selected as host in place of Indonesia. The reason
for the switch is not clear.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from the AFF and AFC marketing Ltd (AMT) will
visit Vietnam in early July to discuss arrangements for the cup.
</P>
<P>
The tournament will cost over 400,000 U.S. dollars to host,
says a Vietnam Football federation official.
</P>
<P>
The eight-team regional tournament will be held for August 25
to September 5, with games scheduled for stadiums in both Hanoi
and Ho Chi Minh city.

<HEADLINE> Establishment of New Social Security System Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A senor Chinese official today
underlined the importance and emergency of setting up a new social
security system.
</P>
<P>
Li Tieying, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said at the opening
ceremony of an international symposium on China's social security
that "to establish a social security system suitable for China's
new situation has come to be an urgent key issue."
</P>
<P>
"Under the old planned economy, China did not consider
unemployment a problem, so it failed to establish an unemployment
insurance system in the society," said Li, who is also president
of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
However, he continued, with the establishment and development
of a socialist market economy and the emergence of growing
unemployment, the institution of a suitable social security system
is an urgent need.
</P>
<P>
Once in charge of the State Commission for Economic
Restructuring, Li said today that the phenomena of "all employees
and enterprises eating out from the same pot" has been basically
changed.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he noted, the old social security system based on
a planned economy should also be changed.
</P>
<P>
"The new social security system for China should include not
only a system of social insurance, social assistance, social
welfare and so on, but also a system of social security
administration, social insurance fund management and supervision,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the primary issue for instituting a new social
security system for China at present is the financial problem, and
how to establish a suitable social security system for the the
country's vast rural areas also poses another problem.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Minister Warns of Chronic Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa will face threat
of chronic food insecurity and the collapse of economies unless
effective measures are implemented to combat land degradation, a
senior Zimbabwean official has warned.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Minister of Lands and Agriculture, Kumbirai Kangai,
Monday stressed the need for the economies in the region, which
are highly dependent on agriculture, to develop effective
measures to curb soil erosion and boost agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
Addressing to a five-day workshop on conservation tillage for
sustainable agriculture in Harare, Kangai said that land
degradation is the most critical factor affecting agricultural
growth and rural development, the daily herald reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
''The loss of plant nutrients and organic matter through
degradation is an issue that requires serious consideration in
the southern African region,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Conservation tillage has been tried in other countries and was
found to be effective in combating soil erosion and mitigating
the effects of drought, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although conservation tillage systems have for long been
restricted to large-scale commercial farms, the Zimbabwean
Ministry of Lands and Agriculture is now promoting the
development of tillage systems suitable for the smallholder
farming sector where the land degradation problem has been a
headache to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which started Monday, attended by delegates from
southern African and European countries, seeks to enable
participants to share regional and worldwide experience in
conservation tillage.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- USS Missouri, the battleship on
which Japan signed the surrender documents at the end of the World
War II, arrived at Pearl Harbor on Monday as a floating museum.
</P>
<P>
The 270-meter, 58,000-ton battleship was pulled by tug Sea
Victory to its berth after an 18-day journey from the West Coast.
It was docked about 300 meters away from the shrine that straddles
the sunken USS Arizona in remembrance of the 1,177 crewmen who
died there in the war.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. President George Bush, the honorary chairman of the
USS Missouri Memorial Association, said in a telephone call to a
small gathering on the Missouri's Surrender Deck that the ship
will be an enduring symbol of peace.
</P>
<P>
On September 2, 1945, then Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru
Shigemitsu and U.S. General Douglas MacArthur signed the surrender
documents on board the ship in Tokyo Bay.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan met here this morning with a group of Beijing-based
U.S. journalists.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about Sino-US constructive strategic
partnership, Tang said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin in his
U.S. visit last fall signed a joint statement with U.S. President
Bill Clinton in which both sides agreed to make joint efforts for
a constructive strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
"Time changes. The world has ushered in a new phase of peace
and development," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"It is now the common aspiration for the people worldwide to
seek peace, stability and development," he said, adding that it
has become the main theme of the era.
</P>
<P>
Under current circumstances, the new Sino-U.S. partnership, a
normal state-to-state relationship, is "not an alliance, not
exclusive and not targeted at a third country," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that both sides should make common efforts
for peace and global economic growth under such a framework.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Tang reiterated that the problem is the
most sensitive and important problem in
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"Whether bilateral relations can continue in a healthy and
stable way will depend on whether the U.S. government adheres to
the principles laid down in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques
and abides by a series of commitments made by different
U.S. administrations on the issue," he underlined.

<P>
According to Tang, leaders of the United States have clearly
stated on different occasions their adherence to the "One China"
policy, and not the concepts of "One China, One Taiwan" or "Two
Chinas." They also did not support Taiwan's entry into the United
Nations and other international organizations made up of sovereign
nations.
</P>
<P>
"We hold that President Clinton should publicly reiterate the
stance of the U.S. side during his coming China visit at
appropriate occasions," Tang said, adding that the United States
should take still more concrete actions to implement its
commitments.
</P>
<P>
On arms sales from the United States to Taiwan, Tang urged the
U.S. side to abide by the principle of the Sino-U.S. August 17
Communique signed in 1982, and gradually reduce and eventually put
an end to arms sales to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On the remaining sanctions imposed on China by the United
States, Tang said that the leaders of both countries should view
bilateral ties from a strategic and long-term point of view. "In
fact, the remaining sanctions have no substantial contents," Tang
said, However, he added, "I think that the U.S. side, with the
view of improving Sino-U.S. ties in mind, should adopt appropriate
measures to thoroughly remove these sanctions."

Scores of Beijing-based U.S. journalists attended the news
conference held on the eve of President Clinton's visit, which is
scheduled to begin Thursday.

<HEADLINE> China, Britain to Cooperate on Hepatitis Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Health is
expected to initiate a nationwide education program next year for
hepatitis control with the help of the Glaxo Wellcome Company of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent memorandum of understanding, Glaxo
Wellcome China Ltd. will donate one million U.S. dollars to the
ministry from 1999 to 2002 for implementation of the program.
</P>
<P>
The four-year program is aimed at enhancing screening, control
and treatment of hepatitis through training of China's management
staff and related health workers, as well as through spreading and
improving public understanding.
</P>
<P>
The hepatitis virus is one of the most harmful contagious
diseases in the world, and China has a high incidence with about
120 million carriers.
</P>
<P>
Glaxo Wellcome, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical
companies, is the first British medical firm to establish a joint
venture in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ministry of Health also cooperated with the
company on a three-year education and training program for AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Economic Wall Crumbling Between China's Rural, Urban Areas (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Information from the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture shows that
about 60 million able-bodied people from the countryside, or 13
percent of China's rural work force, have been engaged in
processing, manufacturing, or in commerce and catering trade in
cities.
</P>
<P>
The flow of people from urban to rural areas, or vice versa,
has brought about an exchange of talent, technology and capital
between urban and rural areas, as well as active reorganizations,
said Zhang Caimin with the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
In their development stage, rural enterprises have utilized
idle equipment, technology and retired workers from urban areas.
</P>
<P>
So far, 1.5 million technical staffs from urban enterprises
have been employed by township enterprises. More than 70 percent
of inventions and new technologies have first been used in rural
enterprises, and the countryside has become the biggest market for
the application of new technologies from the cities.
</P>
<P>
"China Rural Enterprises News" reported that each year 60
million farmers go to the cities to find jobs. They send back by
mail about 80 billion yuan annually in earnings from their urban
workplaces to their homes.
</P>
<P>
When urban funds flow into rural areas, farmers are also
channeling back capital into the cities in the form of shares,
bonds and funds in addition to other financial channels.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of increased exchanges of key elements of
production between rural and urban areas, united economic
organizations of different types have mushroomed in different
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Many large- and medium-size enterprises in cities have shifted
part of their production or products into adjacent rural areas or
into rural enterprises to reduce production costs and increase
economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are 800,000 industrial and agricultural
enterprises jointly operated by investors from urban areas and the
countryside, generating 280 billion yuan of output value annually.
</P>
<P>
Xu Fengxian, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said the new trend in China's economic exchanges between
rural and urban areas has played a positive role in adjusting
irrational disposition of essential factors of production.
</P>
<P>
"The trend also symbolizes that China's economy has been
shifting from the period when rural areas were being strictly kept
away from urban cities as if by a stone wall to realizing a unity
of urban and rural areas and an economic union that shares
prosperity and is complementary to each other," said Xu. "It will
create favorable conditions to wipe out the long-existing gap
between urban and rural areas."

SHIJIAZHUANG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Yang Zhihui, who had worked
18 years with Shijiazhuang Machine-Building Plant of north China's
Hebei Province, recently quit his job to grow fruit trees and
medicinal herbs on 30 hectares of barren land.
</P>
<P>
In a reverse manner, a rural enterprise group from Xushui
County of the same province bought the bankrupt Pharmaceutical
Factory in urban Baoding, a major city in the province. The rural
enterprise group has also arranged jobs for 500 laid-off workers
from the state-owned factory.
</P>
<P>
These are just two examples of the fluid state between rural
and urban areas. Urban workers are starting new businesses in
rural areas and farmers are going to cities to go into business
there.
</P>
<P>
While commenting on the phenomenon, Xu Ping, associate
researcher with the Development Research Center of the State
Council, said that beginning in the 1950s China has practiced a
strict household registration system that classifies China's
population into two categories -- farming or non-farming -- and
permits no random mixing.
</P>
<P>
"Since China decided to practice reform and opening-up, the
functioning of market economic mechanisms and the change of
policies on grain have created conditions for Chinese people to
break away from previously set regional limitations and to engage
in more trans-regional economic activities," said the associate
researcher.
</P>
<P>
Machine-building worker Yang Zhihui considered plentiful
resources and cheap labor in rural areas as incentives that have
tempted him to quit his job and to contract for the planting
rights on barren hills.
</P>
<P>
Workers from urban areas, or non-farming people, have
participated in reclaiming part of the 15 million hectares of
barren hills and desolate mountain slopes now brought under
effective utilization, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
A group of graduates and postgraduates from Qinghua and Beijing
universities have invested 5 million yuan in purchasing 4,000
hectares of barren hills in the Dayao Mountains of southwest
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region for comprehensive
agricultural development. The tree farm they have built has become
the most advanced in the region.
</P>
<P>
The annual volume of business transactions at Xinhua Farm
Produce Market in Shijiazhuang exceeds 1,000 billion
yuan. Ninety-five percent of the traders are farmers from across
the country. But you can hardly tell their origins judging by the
products traded or the business scale.

<HEADLINE> Artists Draw Portraits of Clinton, Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Days before US President Bill
Clinton's visit to China, Chinese and US artists have drawn
portraits of their leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Jiang Zemin painting features the president and his family
members and officials who were planting trees in Beijing on April
5, 1996. The painting is by Yuan Xikun of China and Scott Martin,
Marion Macdonald Montgomery and Walter Kravitz from George Mason
University in the United States.
</P>
<P>
To complete the painting in time, the US painters even gave up
their holidays, Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first computer-aided painting of a Chinese leader,
according to Yuan, China's "portrait ambassador", who has drawn
portraits for quite a member of well-known figures, including Kofi
Annan, Boutros Boutros Ghali, Samaranch Toriello, Nelson Mandela
and Henry Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
Yuan also drew a portrait of Bill Clinton to welcome the
US president to China. In the picture, Clinton appears
resourceful, resolute and confident.
</P>
<P>
"I saw Clinton several times on different occasions when I
visited the United States and I have made sketches of him," Yuan
said. "But this portrait was drawn in my studio."
</P>
<P>
He explained that Clinton will have a tight schedule while in
China and there will be no time for him to pose for a portrait.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese artist said the reason for the paintings is to do
his bit for the expansion of Sino-U.S. exchanges and to express
his wish that the ties will be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people praise Clinton for he attaches importance
to promoting Sino-US friendship," Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Yuan, 54, is well-versed in both traditional Chinese painting
and oil painting. He is a member of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

NAIROBI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaria remains the most serious

Malaria kills between 1.5 and 2.7 million people worldwide

<HEADLINE> Southwest China Province Accelerates Railway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- With three major projects under
way, southwest China's Guizhou Province has begun a new round of
railway construction.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yixia, governor of Guizhou, said that on completion of the
three rail lines within the next five years, the investment
environment in the province should be improved along with mineral
resources exploration and transportation.
</P>
<P>
The three railways are: multiple tracks from Zhuzhou in Hunan
Province to Liupanshui in Guizhou, a Neijiang-Kunming rail line,
and a Shuicheng-Baiguo rail line.
</P>
<P>
With 867 km in Guizhou, the three railways are expected to cost
more than 30 billion yuan (3.6 billion US dollars), accounting for
40 percent of the total investment in railway construction by the
Chinese government in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Cai Qinghua, vice-minister of railways, said that China will
put 240-to-250 billion yuan (28.9-to-30 billion US dollars) into
railway construction in the coming five years, centering on
southwest China's provinces and regions. Eighteen large- and
medium-size projects will be built with an investment of 68
billion yuan (8.2 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
An official from the provincial government said that weak
transportation capacity has been a bottleneck restricting economic
growth in Guizhou. After construction of the three railways,
transportation capabilities in Guizhou will be doubled, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The multiple tracks of the Zhuzhou-Liupanshui railway, with
total length of 1,160 km, is an important passage from southwest
China regions to central and east China areas. Completion of the
railway will increase access to mineral resources and improve the
economy in regions along the rail line.
</P>
<P>
The Completion of the Neijiang-Kunming and Shuicheng-Baiguo
lines will connect the Chengdu-Chongqing, Guizhou-Kunming, and
Nanning-Kunming railways, and add a south-north rail passage
within southwest China.

<HEADLINE> China to Encourage Studying Abroad, Education Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China will continue its policy of
encouraging people to study abroad, Vice-Minister of Education Wei
Yu said here today.
</P>
<P>
China will also encourage students to return to the motherland
to participate in its modernization drive, she said, and if they
want to go abroad again the country will give the green light.
</P>
<P>
On June 23, 1978, late Deng Xiaoping, then Chinese
vice-premier, decided that more people should study abroad, and
the policy sparked a 20-year study-abroad fever.
</P>
<P>
In Chinese cities, it is difficult to find a young person who
has not heard of TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) or
GRE (Graduate Record Examination), the primary tests required to
attend graduate school in the United States.
</P>
<P>
China sent its first group of students to study in the United
States and Europe back in 1872. That ended during World War II.
</P>
<P>
During the 1950s, the major destination for students was the
former Soviet Union. Many current Chinese leaders were students in
Soviet colleges.
</P>
<P>
But the "Cultural Revolution" (1966-76) dealt a blow to the
enthusiasm. Even contacts with foreigners were strictly banned.
</P>
<P>
Wei went on to say that during the past two decades,
approximately 300,000 Chinese have gone to study in more than 100
countries. Most of them have chosen the United States as their
favorite destination, with Japan second.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, a total of 163,100 Chinese had studied in
the United States, accounting for 56 percent of the students who
went overseas to study.
</P>
<P>
"To some extent, the difficulty of a shortage of talented
people has been eased, she said, thanks to the study-abroad
policy, which has in turn promoted China's opening-up to the rest
of the world."
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that Deng's decision was correct, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Lin, an official with the Foreign Affairs Department of
the ministry, said that more and more students have returned to
China after completing their studies in foreign colleges.
</P>
<P>
"China's economic miracle is providing them with opportunities
to develop their talent," he said, adding that their social
status, working and living conditions have been improving.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Economic Zone Pins Future on Information Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, one of the earliest
economic zones in China to receive preferential state policies,
has mapped out strategic guidelines to build itself into an
information-oriented economy in the new century.
</P>
<P>
The local government has pointed to the information industry as
a key to link its local economy with the international market. It
plans to appropriate 10 percent of its annual urban planning
budget to the sector, or 12 billion yuan in total for the
1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The information industry accounts for 36 percent of the zone's
total gross domestic product (GDP), with 31 percent of its
workforce employed in that sector.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen's scaled computer and telecommunications industries
are paving the way toward a goal of lifting the added value of its
information industry to 35 billion yuan a year by the end of this
century, an annual growth rate of 26.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
So far, 50 of every 100 households in Shenzhen have a
computer. Governmental bodies such as the zone's social security
department and auditing office have hooked up to the Internet to
publicize announcements and 30 percent are filing their taxes via
computer.
</P>
<P>
The zone has intensified supervision and promulgated regional
rules on the industry to ensure that it continues rolling on a
healthy track.

<HEADLINE> Interests of Potential Investors Cool off in India: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The United State Ambassador to
India Richard Celeste said that there has been a noticeable
cooling off of interests on the part of potential investors in
India, the Economic Times reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the economic daily, Celeste said
that international financial decision makers are questioning the
wisdom of putting their money in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that sanctions imposed by the United States are going
to have a serious impact on the Indian economy and these are not
small and insignificant matters.
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, Celeste said, the multilateral sanctions
will operate principally through the international financial
institutions, World Bank and Asian Development Bank, and these
represent the deferral of well over one billion U.S. dollars worth
of loans over time.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the sanctions would have a substantial impact on
major U.S. projects in India. The overall impact of the sanctions
over the next year is estimated to be to the order of two to three
billion U.S. dollars of foregone business.
</P>
<P>
There would be consequences in terms of military relationships
between the two countries and U.S. export controls in technology
transfer, Celeste said.
</P>
<P>
And finally, the more profound impact of indirect sanctions are
the concerns on part of the financial decision makers in New York,
Paris, Tokyo, London and the major capital markets about the
wisdom of investing in India.
</P>
<P>
In an interview to India's magazine Outlook published last
Saturday, Celeste said that the real impact of sanctions was as
much indirect as it was direct. It would make those confronting
important investment decisions think twice about whether this was
where they wanted to put their money now.
</P>
<P>
The United States announced last week its detailed sanctions
imposed on India following its five successive underground nuclear
tests on May 11 and 13. The sanctions could hit direct flow of
over 2.5 billion U.S. dollars this year to India.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Price to Fall: ABARE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Weak world demand linked to the
Asian crisis has prompted the Australia's official chief commodity
adviser to further slash wool price forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics'
(ABARE) June quarterly commodity report, released here Tuesday,
expects the Australian wool prices' eastern market indicator to
drop about two percent to average 655 Australian cents per kg
clean in the fiscal year of 1998-99 beginning on July 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The western market indicator is put at 604 Australian cents per
kg.
</P>
<P>
The previous report had tipped respective indicator rates of
705 and 655 Australian cents.
</P>
<P>
"Reflecting the continuing uncertainty in the wool market,
there is an estimated 75 percent probability of the eastern market
indicator being between 575 and 690 (Australian) cents a kilogram
in the upcoming financial year of 1998-99, the latest analysis
said.
</P>
<P>
"The weaker market for raw wool is expected to continue for the
remainder of 1998, with reduced demand from several major wool
consuming countries expected to be felt throughout the wool
pipeline," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"As well, increased competition from other fibers will
contribute to downward pressure on raw wool prices."
</P>
<P>
But a price fall would be partly offset by reduced availability
of Australian wool, influenced by lower shorn wool production
forecasts and the continuing rundown of the wool stockpile.
</P>
<P>
Western European demand for raw wool was expected to drop
slightly due to higher stocks while lower economic growth
prospects in European countries including France and Italy should
cut into woolen clothing and textile sales, ABARE said.
</P>
<P>
Continuing slow retail demand in Japan had resulted in higher
stocks of worsted yarns and wool tops, the bureau explained.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, Japan's wool pipeline activity is expected to
slow further in 1998-99 and demand for raw wool is expected to
fall."
</P>
<P>
High import costs and low economic growth were anticipated to
keep South Korean demand low while factors including rising
competition should cause a slight fall in China's demand for raw
wool.

<HEADLINE> Cotton Output in Australia Set to Fall: ABARE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Australian cotton planting was
set to fall in the fiscal year of 1998-99 beginning on July 1 this
year, Australian federal government's chief commodities forecaster
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Government water reforms in New South Wales state were behind
the predicted fall, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and
Resource Economics (ABARE) said in its latest quarterly commodity
forecasts released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The area planted to cotton in (the fiscal year of) 1998-99 is
forecast to fall around 10 percent from the high 434,000 hectares
in 1997-98," ABARE said.
</P>
<P>
"This is mainly a consequence of cuts to irrigation licenses in
many regions across New South Wales to enable allocations to the
environment as part of government water reform processes."
</P>
<P>
Cotton lint production was forecast to fall to 578,000 tons in
the fiscal year of 1998-99 compared to the previous estimate of
653,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Stock sales in China and the United States were likely to drive
down the world cotton price to 71 U.S. cents per pound in the
upcoming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
But ABARE expected Australia to achieve 1.343 billion
Australian dollars (about 805 million U.S. dollars) worth of
exports, almost unchanged on the previous prediction of 1.345
billion Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
"World consumption of cotton is forecast to rise to 19.6
million tons" in the fiscal year of 1998-99, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the recent economic problems in parts of Asia, global
average incomes are forecast to rise" in the fiscal year of
1998-99 and, with falling prices, consumption can be expected to
expand," said the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- NATO is ready to take action in the
warring Yugoslav province of Kosovo, Secretary-General Javier
Solana said Monday at a NATO workshop.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Balkans has become the greatest challenge

</P>

Also on Monday, Elisabeth Rehn, head of the UN mission in

the international community to seek a peaceful settlement of the
Kosovo crisis, and NATO should send in troops to end the bloodshed
there.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Awami league, 2 years in Power in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Two years have elapsed since the
Awami League formed the Bangladeshi government on June 23, 1996,
after the general elections in the same year.
</P>
<P>
The Awami League-government with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
as its head has In the past two years made achievements in the
economic, political and foreign affairs fields, thus enhancing the
image of the South Asian country.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 127 million, the country has achieved 5.9
percent and over five percent growth rate of the GDP (gross
domestic product) in the 1996-97 and 1997-98 fiscal years
respectively, while its foreign exchange reserve till March 1998
reached 1.82 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government has also succeeded in realizing loans
of 30 billion taka (about 652 million dollars) from bank
defaulters out of a total of 110 billion taka (about 2.39 billion
dollars) owing to the strict measures taken by the government.
</P>
<P>
In the poverty alleviation sector, the government has given
special care to removing poverty both in the rural and urban
areas, through implementation of various projects on a priority
basis.
</P>
<P>
The government earmarked 49.6 billion taka (about 1.08 billion
dollars) and 64.3 billion taka (about 1.4 billion dollars) in the
1996-97 and 1997-98 fiscal years respectively, thus reducing the
country's poverty rate to some extent.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign investment, the government has enacted
various laws, simplified rules and given facilities to foreign
investors. It has already given registrations to 246 foreign
investor companies which invested 3.41 billion dollars in the past
two years, while the amount was 30.58 million dollars in the
1995-96 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In the communication sector, the government has built 525 km
concrete road, 339 km brick road and 10,000 km earth road. One of
the biggest achievements was the completion of the
950-million-dollar Multipurpose Jamuna Bridge scheduled to be
inaugurated by the prime minister on June 23.
</P>
<P>
In the food sector, the production of 20.25 million tons of
foodgrains in 1996-97 surpassed all previous records. The
government has undertaken a program to produce 25 million tons of
foodgrains by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
Another two great achievements made by the government are the
signing of the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) peace agreement and of
the Ganges water sharing treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Awami League-government concluded the CHT peace accord with
the tribal leaders on December 1, 1997, thus bringing an end to
the 22-year-old bloodshed and paving the way for a permanent peace
and development in the country's three hill districts.
</P>
<P>
The accord has been broadly acclaimed at home and abroad. Under
the initiatives made by the government, donor countries and
agencies have agreed in principle to support the
initially-assessed 34 long-term development projects worth 837
million dollars in the CHT.
</P>
<P>
In the water development sector, the government signed the
historic Ganges water sharing treaty with India on December 12,
1996, and the treaty, for the first time, established the rightful
share of the Ganges water for the country.
</P>
<P>
The government has been active in the fields of foreign
affairs, with "economic diplomacy" initiated by Hasina as its an
outstanding feature. Owing to her initiatives, the three prime
ministers of the three South Asian countries (Bangladesh, Indian
and Pakistan) held a business summit in Dhaka on January 15, which
would play a positive role in enhancing the regional cooperation
in economic and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there are a lot of work to do if the government
wants to complete its four-year term, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
Only by further deepening the reforms in economic and financial
sector, making continuous efforts to maintain comparatively stable
political situation and solving disputes with the major opposition
the Bangladesh Nationalist Party properly, can the Awami
League-government conclude its four-year term in accordance with
the Constitution, the analysts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Thus economic exchange between the two sides is reciprocal, the
commentary concluded.
</P>
<P>
It further pointed out that it has not been easy for the two
sides to achieve today's economic relations, which should be
treasured with care.
</P>
<P>
However, economic and trade cooperation of the two countries is
hindered by certain non-trade factors as well as influenced by
other unnecessary restrictions. That runs contrary to the efforts
of the two to establish the Sino-U.S. strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
It's natural for the two sides to have differences. But, some
obstruction and differences can be overcome if Sino-U.S. economic
and trade relations are handled under the spirit of establishing
the constructive strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
It will be short-sighted, harmful and undesirable to easily
resort to trade reprisals or sanctions against China.
</P>
<P>
The annual renewal in the U.S. Congress of the Most Favored
Nation preference to China is a product of the Cold War thinking,
which by no means has any reason to exist at a time when China and
the U.S. have proposed to set up the constructive strategic
partnership.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the wiser step to be taken is to solve their disputes
permanently and try to boost economic and trade cooperation to a
new level.
</P>
<P>
To view and handle economic and trade relations between China
and the United States in a strategic light, we should have the
sense of history and look upon the national conditions of the
other side in a reasonable way. We should treat problems or
disputes in bilateral trade and economic relations in line with
the principles of mutual respect, mutual-understanding, mutual
consultation and seek common ground while reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country, China is in a historical course of
constructing and improving its socialist market economy. China is
opening its market in a stable and orderly manner in keeping with
its national conditions. The country is seeking to join the World
Trade Organization (WTO) on the base of balanced rights and
obligations, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Such an approach taken by China will be beneficial not only to
the steady development of the Chinese economy and its smooth
adaptation to the world economy, but also to the improvement and
consolidation of the world multi-lateral trade system and the
development of Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations in
conformity with the common interests of both sides.
</P>
<P>
As an important signatory state to the WTO, the United States
should reasonably take a realistic and reasonable approach to push
forward the bilateral negotiations between China and the WTO and
play a positive role in China's bid to be a member of the
organization, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the imbalance of trade between the two
countries was a comprehensive reflection of many factors, such as
the differences in economic structures, development stages,
products structures, ways of trade, statistics methods and the
international division of labor.
</P>
<P>
We have to face up to the complicated reasons and the historic
inevitability of this situation, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
What is more important is that China has taken quite a number
of positive measures to increase its imports from the United
States, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
In such a circumstance, if only the United States could lift
its sanctions against China and greatly ease its restrictions on
the export of high and new technology to China, its trade deficit
to China would naturally drop down, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
To view and handle bilateral economic and trade relations in a
strategic light, we should also have the sense of marketing and
adopt appropriate and real steps to eliminate the various man-made
obstacles which are harmful to the development of bilateral
economic and trade relations, it added.

<HEADLINE> APEC Urged to lead Coherent Response to Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUCHING (Malaysia), June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council (PECC) Tuesday called for a strong and
comprehensive coherent regional response, to be led by the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), to the Asian economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
PECC strongly believes that "APEC remains well-suited to lead a
strong and comprehensive Asia Pacific community response to the
economic crisis," a policy statement delivered by PECC Chair
person Roberto R. Romulo to the ongoing APEC trade ministers
meeting here Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued to reporters here pointed out that the
crisis caused widespread turmoil and uncertainty in the banking
and financial sector as well as spreading to all sectors of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
It said "more than two decades of increasing regional economic
integration through trade and investment has meant that no Asia
Pacific economy will be immune from at least some of the adverse
effects of the crisis."
</P>
<P>
APEC is an ideal vehicle to drive a bold, new regional response
to the crisis, with its framework for deeper regional integration,
and its commitment to open regionalism and market-led integration,
as well as its implicit recognition of the importance of coherence
in its framework through its three pillars of trade and investment
liberalization and facilitation, which are comprehensive
liberalization, improved facilitation and economic and technical
cooperation, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the challenge for APEC now is to fully utilize these
potential institutional attributes to improve the welfare of the
Asia Pacific community.
</P>
<P>
The PECC said the APEC-led Asia Pacific community response must
include a strong re-commitment to the principles of open
regionalism; a package approach to liberalization, facilitation
and especially economic and technical cooperation; a coherent
approach which accounts for the inter-linkages of the various
issues; ongoing policy development to ensure the Asia Pacific
region can anticipate and respond to changes; a proactive role in
improving surveillance and confidence building so that each
individual crisis-affected economy remains committed to the
process of opening up, institutional building and good governance.
</P>
<P>
The PECC holds that more openness in trade and investment, not
less, will provide the path for recovery and has now become an
urgent priority, but it added that given the risks, liberalization
without rebuilding institutions and without concern for political
and business confidence is unlikely to be sustainable or credible.
</P>
<P>
It said a new level of coherence in policy development is
"paramount" if the recovery is to be effective and sustainable.
</P>
<P>
The PECC, an independent, policy-oriented organization of high
level business, academic and government representatives from 23
Asia Pacific economies, is the only non-governmental body among
the three official observers in APEC.
</P>
<P>
APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Chinese Taipei,
Chile, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico,
New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and the United States.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Price Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The average price of OPEC's basket of seven crudes dropped to
10.55 dollars a barrel from the 11.92 dollars a barrel the week
before.
</P>
<P>
The annual average price stands at 13.20 dollars per barrel as
of the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The average price last month was 13.16 dollars a barrel, a
little more than April's 12.76 dollars per barrel, but far less
than the benchmark price of 21 dollars per barrel set by OPEC.
</P>
<P>
The oil ministers of OPEC will meet in Vienna on Wednesday to
discuss reducing the ceiling of daily oil production set by the
organization as well as stablizing and boosting crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Some members of OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers have recently
decided to cut their daily oil production.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of OPEC's oil ministers at the end of March decided
to reduce the ceiling by 1.245 million barrels, but the decision
has not been well implemented by all members of the organization
and has not been effective in stabilizing oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The oil market is being over supplied. The members of OPEC and
non-OPEC producers must continue to cut their production in order
to maintain the stability of oil prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday deplored the decision of
the Government of Israel to expand the boundaries of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through his spokesman's office, Annan
regretted that Israel has taken the unilateral action which
infringes upon General Assembly and Security Council resolutions
on the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general wished to remind Israel that the
international community has not recognized the earlier imposition
by Israel of its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the city
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Annan urged Israel to rescind this unfortunate decision and to
make every effort to restart the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel adopted a plan on Sunday to extend the boundaries of
Jerusalem. Under the plan, the city will annex land to the west
and the expanded municipality will adopt administrative powers
over nearby Jewish towns, including some in the occupied West
Bank.

<HEADLINE> hke062314 -Thailand Ready to Register Cambodian Displaced Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is ready to help
registration of 55,000 Cambodian voters still remaining in Thai
border camps if the Cambodian government agrees to extend the
deadline, the Nation Tuesday quoted foreign ministry spokesman
Kobsak Chutikul as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian refugees in Thai camps would need to be registered
so they can vote for the July 26 elections.
</P>
<P>
Extension of the registration is needed, since the deadline
passed last week, Kobsak said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand is ready to assist the registration if the
Phnom Penh government agrees on the extension.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 55,000 displaced Cambodians are
taking shelter in four border provinces in Thailand, after having
fled fightings last year.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting between ASEAN troika, namely Thailand, the
Philippines and Indonesia, and the friends of Cambodia (FOC) in
the weekend, Thailand called for the repatriation of these
displaced Cambodians before the election.
</P>
<P>
Kobsak said that if registered Cambodians cannot be
repatriated in time for the elections, Thailand will consider
whether the elections could take place on Thai soil.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Calls for Strategic Approach to Sino-U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, Tuesday called for China and the United States to
view and handle their economic and trade ties in a strategic
light, which it believes will benefit both sides.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, the paper said economic and trade ties between
the two countries have been a very important, and the most vital
component, of bilateral bonds.
</P>
<P>
The development of Sino-U.S. cooperation has become an
increasingly important pillar and impetus to bilateral ties, the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
During Chinese President Jiang Zemin's state visit to the
United States last fall, leaders of both countries reached
consensus on efforts to build a constructive strategic partnership
between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the importance of expanding bilateral
economic and trade cooperation, saying the endeavor not only
conformed to the fundamental interests of both countries but also
would benefit the growth of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the summit brought the Sino-U.S. economic and
trade cooperation to a new stage of development.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the commentary said, U.S. President Bill Clinton's
forthcoming reciprocal visit to Beijing would breathe new life
into economic and trade cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of Sino-U.S. diplomatic relations,
economic and trade ties between the two countries have experienced
rapid growth. The 1990s, in particular, have witnessed a momentum
of accelerating development.
</P>
<P>
To support the argument, the commentary quoted Chinese customs
statistics which say that the Sino-U.S. trade volume rose from a
total of 11.77 billion U.S. dollars in 1990 to 48.99 billion
U.S. dollars in 1997, with an average annual growth rate as high
as 22.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
As China's second largest trading parter, the United States has
more than 24,000 investment projects in China, with the total
contractual investment reaching 42 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China, now the fourth largest trading partner of the United
States, has seen its investment efforts in the United States
steadily rising and expanding.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to mutual efforts, the two countries have reached an
unprecedented broadness and depth in their exchanges and
cooperation in such fields as trade, investment and finance, said
the commentary.
</P>
<P>
The grand economic scales of the two nations have enabled them
to cooperate closely in a broad range of fields while giving full
display to their individual economic advantages.
</P>
<P>
The differences in resources, industrial and consumption
structures determine the two countries' complementarity in economy
and trade, said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
More and more people in U.S. industrial and commercial circles,
said the commentary, have come to realize that China is not only a
potential market, but a vast market in reality. They believe
Sino-U.S. economic and trade cooperation will have broad prospects.
</P>
<P>
The two economies are mutually complementary and beneficial to
each other, the commentary pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chinese commodities, being of good quality and low prices, have
brought benefits to American consumers. Moreover, imports from
China into the U.S. has resulted in the creation of more than
300,000 direct, high-salary jobs, while making some one million
indirect job opportunities possible.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the American investment in China not only
extended markets for American businessmen, but also brought
capital, technology and managing experience to their Chinese
partners. More

<HEADLINE> EDS-Details added Progress Made toward President Clinton's Visit, Chinese FM Says (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said today that "active progress" has been made centering
on the preparations for U.S. President Bill Clinton's China visit
after a number of mutual talks and consultations.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the remark in his opening statement for an interview
here this morning with Beijing-based journalists from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton is scheduled to pay a state visit to China as
guest of his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin later this week.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has attached great importance to
President Clinton's imminent visit, which is another major event
in Sino-U.S. relations following President Jiang's successful
visit to the United States last fall, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Jiang and Clinton will meet and have an
exchange of views in an all-round, extensive and in-depth manner
on Sino-U.S. relations and major international political, economic
and security issues of common concern, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton is scheduled to visit Xi'an, Shanghai, Guilin
and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) in addition
to Beijing. Tang said China is expecting that President Clinton's
visit will be crowned with success through joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
Tang went on to say he believes that a successful exchange of
visits by heads of both countries will further deepen the mutual
understanding and friendship between the people of the two
countries, and push bilateral relations into a new development
stage.
</P>
<P>
Since President Jiang's historic visit to the United States
last year, he added, bilateral exchanges and cooperation in the
economic and trade, energy, environment, science and education,
culture, military and legal fields have scored new achievements.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have conducted fruitful cooperation in a
series of major international issues such as the Asian financial
crisis, the weapons inspection crisis in Iraq and the nuclear
tests in India and Pakistan, Tang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
As the overall Sino-U.S. relations have picked up an active
momentum for positive improvement, the Chinese side has also taken
note of "noises" emerging from the United States, which could
hamper President Clinton's China trip as well as the further
improvement and enhancement of Sino-U.S. relations, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed his belief that such noises do not
represent the willingness and aspirations of the American people.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the mankind is marching toward the 21st century,
he said, the development of the international situation has
further proved that the common interest between the two countries
has been increased rather then decreased, their cooperative sphere
has been expanded rather than reduced, and the two peoples'
aspirations for tightening their friendship has been enhanced
rather than weakened.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a long-term, stable and healthy
relationship between China and the United States is not only in
the fundamental interest of both countries, but also beneficial
to world peace, stability and prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
As long as the two countries strictly adhere to the principles
laid down in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, take a tight
hold of their common interests proceeding from a strategic height
and a long-term perspective, and handle their differences
properly, a sustained and healthy development of Sino-U.S. ties
can be ensured, and the purpose of establishing the constructive
strategic partnership can also be achieved, Tang said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Ministry to Axe Entrance Exams for High Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Education Ministry is
planning to abolish junior-high and senior-high school entrance
exams to provide equal opportunities for all students in line with
the new constitution, The Nation said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The constitution, which was promulgated last year, requires
equal study opportunities for everyone.
</P>
<P>
A senior ministry official was quoted as saying that the
ministry plans to close the academic excellence gap among schools
by transferring good teachers to schools which need certain
experts.
</P>
<P>
If this is agreed by all parties concerned, the country will
not have entrance exams for high schools starting from the 1999
academic year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 80 percent of the students gaining admittance to
schools at the grade seven and grade 10 entrance levels are
determined by a school district catchment area admission system.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 20 percent are admitted after sitting entrance
exams.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Promises Iran to Enforce Law on Mujahideen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States will strictly
enforce a law against contacts with Iran's Mujahideen Khalq
opposition movement, State Department Spokesman James Rubin said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has repeatedly demanded that the United
States crack down on the group, which the U.S. now lists as a
terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
"The international fight against terrorism is one of our
highest foreign policy priorities. We are determined that U.S. law
concerning the MEK's (Mujahideen's) designation be strictly and
fully enforced. We categorically condemn terrorism whether
directed at Iran or anyone else," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said this was another good-will gesture from the
United States to Iran, with which Washington is anxious to have
direct dialogue.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin draw a distinction between the Mujahideen and
the Iranian National Council of Resistance (NCR), an umbrella
group, which the Mujahideen dominates and sometimes uses as a
front in the United States and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"A careful review of the evidence concerning the National
Council of Resistance, which is associated with the MEK, has shown
that it does not meet the legal criteria to designate it as as a
foreign terrorist organization," he said.
</P>
<P>
The question of designation of any terrorist organization
remained under constant review, Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman congratulated Iran on its 2-1 victory over the
U.S. team in a World Up soccer match in France on Sunday, and
wished the Iranians the best of luck in the rest of the
tournament.

SHANGHAI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Genway Shipping
Broker Co. Ltd., the first of its kind in China, opened here last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The shipping broker was invested by the Shanghai Shipping
Exchange. Some local analysts call it an important move for the
city to accelerate its pace to become an international shipping
center.
</P>
<P>
Local shipping brokers have begun to join the market
competition independently, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
A lack of standards, inadequate supervision and a shortage of
independent brokers have hindered the development of the shipping

<HEADLINE> Western Countries Criticized For Backing Terrorism in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister
Zoran Lilic Monday criticized Western countries Monday for their
support of terrorism in Kosovo, which is hindering settlement of
the regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
Western countries have "double standards," Lilic told the
country's newspaper Vecernje Novosti. "And what they do is quite
different from what they say, and that has instigated the
terrorists in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
He said the international community must pressure the ethnic
Albanian party in Kosovo and condemn terrorism so the political
dialogues to settle the issue could continue.
</P>
<P>
Only after ethnic Albanians stop their terrorist actions, will
the Serb interior forces withdraw from Kosovo, the deputy prime
minister in charge of national security affairs said.
</P>
<P>
"If the threat from Albania still exists to Yugoslav
Federation's security and sovereignty, the Yugoslav army will, in
accordance with the country's constitution, effectively use every
means to guard the border with Albania," Lilic said.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China Working to Link Four Southern Water Outlets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan, a border province in
southwest China, is accelerating efforts to link its
transportation system with four river outlets in southeast Asia --
the Mekong, Red (Song Hong), Irrawaddy and Salween rivers.
</P>
<P>
For the next three years the province will strive to improve
the water lane on the 333 km-long Lancang River, which runs out of
the Chinese territory from Yunnan and flows through Vietnam,
Myanmar, Laos and Thailand, where it is called the Mekong River.
</P>
<P>
By the time the cross-border water passage opens, Chinese cargo
exported to western Asia, Africa and Europe can go downstream to
Chiang Mai in Thailand and, via the Thai expressway network, reach
its ports in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
A joint water-land transport route to link the province with
the Red River in Vietnam is under negotiation between the Chinese
and Vietnamese governments, and an agreement is expected soon for
two routes to the Irrawaddy and Salween rivers in Myanmar allowing
construction to begin.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is expediting construction of the road transportation
section of the routes, which starts in Kunming, the provincial
capital, and ends at Shweli in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The four outlets should facilitate foreign trade between
China's inland provinces and other Asian, European and African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan Province has so far three railways linking the inland
area and three highways are under construction to improve its road
transportation.

<HEADLINE> Survey Reveals Void in Children's Wear Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey has showed that 10
top brand-name children's wear producers have only 30 percent of
the overall market share.
</P>
<P>
The survey urges domestic garment firms to improve their
operation to capture more of the remaining 70 percent of the
market, where no brand has a dominant role.
</P>
<P>
Following the garment market for adults, overseas firms are
entering the children's wear market on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
Facing the challenges, the domestic firms have been pondering
strategies to maintain their market share.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese children's wear industry is facing challenges as
well as an opportunity," said Chen Huajiao, chairwoman of the
board of the Yixiu Group, the largest children's wear producer in
the country.
</P>
<P>
She added that her firm has adopted new methods to promote
marketing, such as setting up sales networks in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The Zhejiang-based Yixiu has taken the lead in China's
children's wear industry for five years. It now has 20 percent of
China's children's wear market, or 15 percentage points more than
No.2, Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
Yixiu has also set up the largest marketing network in the
country, through establishing cooperations with 1,800 shops across
the country, according to Chen.

<HEADLINE> Advertising Business Booming in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Advertising has been playing an
increasingly vital role for businesses in China's economic
powerhouse as a major method to exchange information, set up
images and promote products.
</P>
<P>
Advertising expenditures in Shanghai reached nearly 8.49
billion yuan (1.02 billion US dollars) in 1997, four times the
1993 figure.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, Shanghai had 2,400 groups involved in the
advertising business, a 60 percent rise from the 1993 figure, with
the number of employees involved rising nearly 57 percent to
32,600.
</P>
<P>
Food led all economic sectors in Shanghai in advertising
expenditures last year with nearly 1.5 billion yuan (181 million
US dollars), up 61 percent over the previous year. Advertising
expenditures for household appliances and cosmetics exceeded 1
billion yuan (120 million US dollars) each in Shanghai last year.
</P>
<P>
Advertising information can be displayed a large number of ways
such as electronic billboards, buses and beepers, along with the
more traditional TV, radio, newspaper, and magazines.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, experts predict that the expenditures for advertising
will rise in real estate, computers and interior decoration as the
economy shifts to consumer spending.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- British sniffer dogs will be
brought in Sri Lanka to help clear landmines in the island's north
to further strengthen the on-going landmine clearing campaign in
the Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Eight well-trained sniffer dogs will join the United Nation's
Development Program's (UNDP) team to detect landmines and
unexploded devices in the peninsula, according to UNDP sources
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jaffna Peninsula was once the stronghold of the Tamil
rebels, who have been fighting a 15-year war against the Sri
Lankan government for a separate state in the north and east of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Government troops recaptured the peninsula in May, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP program commenced a few weeks ago. About 20 foreign
and local experts are to be mobilized for the project to identify
and clear the risky land, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP has allocated 300,000 U.S. dollars for the project,
said the sources, adding that the first phase of the project will
conclude by the end of August this year.

WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The worst outbreak of wildfires
in more than 50 years in Florida has burned thousands of hectares
of pine forest, forcing thousands of residents to leave their
homes.
</P>
<P>
Over nearly a month, fires have also destroyed more than 100

<HEADLINE> Information Technology World Congress Opens In Virginia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The three-day 11th World
Congress on Information Technology opened at George Mason
University, Fairfax County, Virginia, U.S.A., with 1,800 of the
world's business leaders from more than 90 countries and regions
including delegates from China.
</P>
<P>
The main item on the agenda for this congress is to review the
development and future technological challenges to the information
Industry.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Jim Gilmore, governor of the state of
Virginia, said: "Never before in history has a force brought about
so much change, over so short a period of time, and across so
broad a spectrum of society than the information technology
industry."
</P>
<P>
It has been just over fifty years since the world's first
programmable computer became operational. It cost millions of
U.S. dollars to build and processed an unprecedented 5,000
instructions per second.
</P>
<P>
Today's computers process 400,000 instructions per second and
if current trends continue, desktop-computing power will be at
100,000 million instructions per second by the year 2012.
</P>
<P>
Gilmore said with the profusion of computers into society and
advances in telecommunication technologies, the most powerful
communication medium in history, the Internet, has come into being.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of the Internet is promoting electronic
commerce and is a sign of the dramatic impact the information
technology industry is having on the global economy, said the
governor.

<HEADLINE> Americans Want Government Health Care Aid for Poor Retirees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- While most Americans think
saving for retirement is an individual responsibility, nine out of
10 people want the government to help pensioners who can't afford
health care, a telephone survey revealed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey was commissioned by Americans Discuss Social
Security, a group studying public attitudes about the country's
retirement system.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 2,001 adults showed that 59 percent considered it
a personal responsibility to save enough money to meet at least
basic expenses in retirement.
</P>
<P>
However, when asked if the government should provide medical
care for retirees who can't afford it themselves, 90 percent said
yes.
</P>
<P>
Those surveyed were divided evenly over whether the government
should help all retirees with medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
Both the Social Security pension system and Medicare, the
government-sponsored health insurance offered to everyone over age
65, are expected to run short of cash when baby boomers retire
early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton and Republican leaders in Congress say
action may be taken as soon as next year to change the programs to
avoid crisis.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that Americans believe the government should
play a bigger role in making sure people are taken care of in old
age than in some other aspects of life, such as childbearing.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to taking care of their sick or disabled parents,
45 percent said they expect the government to pitch in.
</P>
<P>
The margin of error for the poll, which was conducted between
October 14 and November 16, was plus or minus two percent.

<HEADLINE> 50 Million Indonesians Face Poverty: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has warned that up
to 50 million Indonesians are facing a return to poverty because
of the country's prolonged economic woes and drought, The
Indonesian Observer reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted World Bank Indonesia Director Dennis de Tray
as saying that no less than 20 million people will lose their jobs
because of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Before the economic crisis began in mid-1997, only 22 million
of Indonesia's 202 million people were living below the poverty
line. The figure rose to 28 million currently. The rupiah has
depreciated by over 70 percent against the U.S. dollar since July
last year.
</P>
<P>
Around 70 percent of Indonesian companies are technically
bankrupt because of the currency turmoil. They find it very
difficult to boost exports due to lack of imported raw materials
for re-export goods because Indonesia's letters of credits have
been virtually unacceptable overseas.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to help Indonesia deal with the crisis, De Tray
said the World Bank has launched a social safety net program to
support the hungry and sick with tens of millions of U.S. dollars

<HEADLINE> Fiat Presidency Stays Out of Agnelli Family Hands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TURIN, Italy, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Presidency of Fiat, the
renowned Italian private conglomerate run by the Agnelli family
for over a century, passed on Monday from Cesare Romiti to Paolo
Fresco.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time for the Agnelli family to concede the
most important position of Fiat to a candidate who is not a member
of the family.
</P>
<P>
The first concession took place in February 1996 when Cesare
Romiti, 73 at that time, replaced Giovanni Agnelli as the
president.
</P>
<P>
Since Romiti reached the Italian maximum retirement age of 75
this year, rumors have been rife, even among Agnelli family
members, about the successor of Romiti.
</P>
<P>
The most common prediction was that an Agnelli would take the
presidency because the family could not give up the position twice.
</P>
<P>
However, Giovanni Agnelli, 79, said at the stockholders'
assembly Monday that since a president could play a key role in
the ups and downs of a company, he would rather select an
non-Agnelli qualifier than choose an incompetent Agnelli family
member.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the promotion of Romiti, Giovanni Agnelli said, "For
me, Romiti was the right man to deal with the terrible situation
in those years when the lots were filled with unsold cars, the oil
crisis was in full swing and there was a total lack of order and
discipline in the company."
</P>
<P>
Paying farewell to Romiti and welcoming Fresco, Agnelli said,
"Fresco is the best one available and best one I could hope for
now."

<P>
STOCKHOLM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish Customs and police
have confiscated 65 kilograms of heroin so far this year, 51
kilograms more than the total seized in the entire year of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Sweden Daily reported Monday that most of the drugs were
smuggled in from East European countries. The sharp increase in
the seizure of drugs was attributed to close cooperation between
police from Sweden and East European countries, especially the
Czech and Slovak police.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish police said 80-90 percent of confiscated heroin is
from Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.

Monday after the Belukar River overflowed, according to reports

<P>
The flood also inundated paddy fields and a tobacco plantation,
causing hundreds of millions of rupiah in material loss.

Although the flood water had reached a height of 1.5 meters, no

<HEADLINE> Italian FM Urges Support for NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini told the Lower House Monday that Italy must approve the
expansion of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Dini criticized the opposition argument against including
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in NATO as "outdated
thinking."
</P>
<P>
"Whoever obstinately insists in interpreting all this in terms
of a possible threat, does not know how to deal with the radical
changes of these years," said Dini.
</P>
<P>
It smacked of "an outdated logic, an obvious blindness in the
face of so many changes, a mental laziness and a deeply-rooted
ideological prejudice," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dini said the cost of the expansion for Italy could be
recovered through savings and redefinition of current spending
programs.
</P>
<P>
According to NATO figures, the proposed expansion would cost
NATO member states 1.4 billion U.S. dollars, of which Italy would
contribute 106.3 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Summarizing Italy's historical stance on the expansion, Dini
said the country had always maintained an "open door policy" that
did not limit membership on the basis of geographical location.
</P>
<P>
For the same reason, Italy had also been in favor of extending the
G7 and the World Trade Organization to include Russia, Dini said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the 16-member NATO decided last July to admit
Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland in 1999, but the decision
requires ratification by the legislature of each NATO member.
</P>
<P>
Canada, the United States, Germany, Greece, Norway, Denmark,
Luxembourg and Ireland have so far approved the expansion.

<HEADLINE> New Census Director to Be Nominated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
plans to nominate Kenneth Prewitt as director of the Census Bureau
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prewitt, head of the Social Science Research Council in New
York, confirmed Monday that he had been chosen, according to media
reports. The Commerce Department, parent agency for the bureau,
scheduled a news conference to make the announcement Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Prewitt will replace Martha Farnsworth Riche, who left the job
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The nomination, subject to Senate confirmation, could become
controversial because of the dispute over whether the census
scheduled for April 1, 2000, should include a statistical method
known as sampling, which is strongly opposed by Republicans in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Confirmation will be done by the Senate, but it generally
listens closely to the opinions of House members, who are most
directly affected by the national head count.
</P>
<P>
Census results are used to reapportion seats in the House, and
Republicans there have expressed concern that sampling could
result in increased counts of minorities, who tend to vote
Democratic.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investments in Philippines Need to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines, in a move to help the government generate more
foreign currency, has directed the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) to require all foreign investors to convert their
investments into pesos, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the commission, the central bank said the SEC
should require the mandatory conversion of all foreign exchange
remittances into pesos through local banks, including both
investments in new companies and capital increase in existing
companies.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors had been allowed to use foreign currency as
payment for the issuance of stocks since 1995 when the government
started liberalizing its foreign exchange and investment policy,
according to the Philippine Star.
</P>
<P>
With the currency crisis still raging in the region, the SEC
said it is complying with the central bank's directive and will
require the conversion of all foreign investments into pesos.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investments flowing into the country account for
more than 10 percent of total foreign investments, with hot money
now accounting for over 90 percent.

the United States on 3.7 percent, or France's 3.4 percent.

percent higher than those of the last quarter of 1997 and 2.07
percent greater than those of the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Bans Morocco from Hosting Future Events </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur Athletic
Federation (IAAF) has banned Morocco from hosting future events
for refusing visas to the Israeli team for the world
cross-country championships in Marrakech in March, according to
reports from Seville.
</P>
<P>
IAAF press chief Giorgio Reineri said in Seville that the IAAF
council meeting on Monday decided on a series of sanctions
against the Moroccan athletics federation.
</P>
<P>
"A strong letter of protest will be sent to the Moroccan
federation which asks them to withdraw their candidature for the
1999 Golden League Grand Prix final," Reineri said.
</P>
<P>
"They will also be asked not to present any further bids for
IAAF events until they are able to assure the federation that
the government will allow athletes from all other member
countries to compete at an event in Morocco."
</P>
<P>
The IAAF council stopped short of a ban on Moroccan athletes
competing in its events such as next year's world cross-country
championships in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF is also proposing a Millennium Marathon which will
take place in Rome on January 1 2000.

<HEADLINE> Hearings on PAL's Rehabilitation Plan Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) will start hearings Tuesday on the
petition filed by Philippine Airlines (PAL) for the suspension of
debt payments and appointment of a receiver to oversee its
financial rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
PAL, the country's national carrier, has said that it may not
be able to pay its maturing debts and liabilities amounting to 85
billion pesos (2.1 billion U.S. dollars), even though its assets
and properties stand at 90 billion pesos (2.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In its petition submitted to the SEC last Friday, PAL said the
region-wide financial turmoil and the ongoing pilots' strike made
it difficult to pay its obligations on schedule.
</P>
<P>
The hearing, which starts Tuesday afternoon, will be presided
over by SEC chairman Perfecto Yasay.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's hearing will focus on the appointment of an interim
rehabilitation receiver to help in finalizing and drawing out a
viable rehabilitation plan for PAL.
</P>
<P>
The SEC chief hopes to finalize the rehabilitation plan for PAL
within the next 60 days, notwithstanding the complex issues that
may be involved.
</P>
<P>
An independent body of receivers, will shortly be appointed to
ensure that the rehabilitation plan is faithfully implemented.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous receivership committees created by the SEC for
ailing firms, Yasay said the management, creditors, and unions
would not be represented in the receivership committee for PAL so
as to avoid conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
The SEC will seek the help of experts in the airline industry
to complete the rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
But Yasay warned that PAL may face liquidation if it fails to
implement a workable and viable rehabilitation plan within a
period of five years.
</P>
<P>
Under the SEC's new rules governing the suspension of debt
payments, an ailing company is given a maximum of five years to
rehabilitate itself. If it is still insolvent after the five-year
period, the SEC will order the dissolution of the company.
</P>
<P>
The main elements of PAL's proposed rehabilitation plan, which
has yet to be approved by the SEC, include a reduction in fleet
size, retrenchment of personnel, disposal of excess assets and
inventories, and suspension of more than two-thirds of its routes.

<HEADLINE> South African Coach Pleased Players Sent Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- South African national coach
Philippe Troussier said Monday he was pleased that swift action
was taken against two of his players, who were sent home from the
World Cup on Monday, for misconduct at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Midfielders Brendan Augustine and Aaron Mokoena were
immediately suspended from the squad when they broke a curfew on
Saturday to attend a nightclub in Vichy, France, where they were
camping, until the early hours of Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Troussier said the team came to France to represent the country
and such behaviour was unacceptable, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"We need to protect the country, we need to protect the team as
the world will be judging South Africa here...I am happy they are
going back quickly," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa tackle another troubled team, Saudi Arabia, in
Bordeaux on Wednesday in a make-or-break match where they need a
big win to stand a chance of advancing to the next round.
</P>
<P>
The Saudis sacked their coach Carlos Albertos Perreira after
they were thumped 4-0 by France last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the axing of the two South African players has left
the squad rather thin. With striker Phil Masinga a doubtful
starter and midfielder Alfred Phiri serving a three-match ban, the
team are now down to only 15 outfield players.
</P>
<P>
But Troussier was still upbeat about his chances against the
Saudis, saying he need only three substitutions and five more
players were quite enough for him.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the dismissed Augustine expressed his regret at the
turn of events in a prepared statement released on Monday through
his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
"I want to apologize to my teammates for letting them down at
such a crucial stage in the World Cup...I also want to apologize
to Troussier, the management staff, the South African Football
Association, my family and the South African soccer fans," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Although there were a number of factors that led to me
breaking the curfew, my behaviour was unprofessional and
unnecessary and I sincerely regret having done this," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Playing for the national team means everything to me as a
South African player and as a professional footballer," Augustine
said. He said he hoped this incident would not end his
international career.

<HEADLINE> Phil Jackson Says Last Goodbyes to Chicago Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Phil Jackson cleared out his
office and said his last goodbyes to the Chicago Bulls before
driving off on his motorcycle on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to speak about 'could have, would have, should
have,'" the coach said at the team's practice facility. "It was
time to go. I've been pushing at this horn a little bit the last
couple of years about leaving and being ready to leave. It's my
time to go. It's the right time."
</P>
<P>
After coaching the Bulls for nine years, even after the Bulls
won their sixth championships in eight years, Jackson turned down
an offer from Chicago chairman Jerry Reinsdorf to coach for
another season.
</P>
<P>
He said he doesn't have another job, and he has no other plans
right now except to leave later this week for a vacation in Turkey
with his wife.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if there is a basketball challenge," Jackson
said of his future. "I'll have to wait and see if one presents
itself."
</P>
<P>
The Bulls' spokesman Tim Hallam said a statement would be
release later today.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Tennis Championships Open With Stars Shining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The 1998 Wimbledon Tennis
Championships opened here Monday with most star players including
Pete Sampras and Steffi Graf sailing comfortably into the second
round.
</P>
<P>
Defending Champion and top seed Sampras of the United States,
who had a miserble first six months, showed his strong
determination to defend his honor at the Center Court of the All
England Law Tennis Club by overpowering Slovakia's Dominik Hrbaty
6-3, 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The 1992 Wimbledon Champion Andre Agassi, who has been making
steady comeback to top level tennis, defeated his Spanish opponent
Alex Calatrava in straight sets and voiced surging confidence.
</P>
<P>
"Physically I am 100 percent and game-wise I feel really good.
I am very confident out there, hitting my shots," he said.
</P>
<P>
Third-seed Petr Korda of the Czech Republic and British player
Tim Henman, the 12th seed, both squeezed into the second round by
beating their opponents.
</P>
<P>
The only major casualty of the men's seeds was 7th-seeded
verteran Russian player Yevgeny Kafelnikov who was beaten by
Australian big-server Mark Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
In the womens' events, the rising Russian tennis star Anna
Kournikova, the 12th seed, was forced to withdraw from the
two-week tournament due to an injury picked up at a pre-Wimbledon
competition.
</P>
<P>
Former world number one German Steffi Graf, who has collected
seven Wimbledon titles so far, made a successful comeback to the
Wimbledon Center Court by out-classing her little-known opponent
by 6-4, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
The other women's seeds including Monia Seles of the United
States, second seed Lindsay Davenport and the 1994 champion
Conchitz Martinez all came into the next round after defeating
their rivals. China's Li Fang was defeated in straight sets 6-1,
6-4 by an Italian player.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Curbs Sales of High-powered Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Commerce Department
said on Monday it would block exports of high-powered computers to
Indian and Pakistani governments and private agencies involved in
nuclear and missile programs because of the threat to U.S.
national security.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department's Bureau of Export Administration
said the guidelines that prohibit the sales of computers apply
to machines ranging from high-end desktop workstations to
complex super-computers.
</P>
<P>
Last month, India conducted five nuclear tests, sparking
global outrage and raising tension with Pakistan, which
retaliated by carrying out itw own tests.
</P>
<P>
The United States immediately imposed economic sanctions
against both countries, as required by its law. Last week
Washington revealed details of sanctions. The high-powered
computers were the latest items to be prevented from exporting to
the two rival countries.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Export Administration said it would require
licenses for all exports of computers with performance levels
greater than 2,000 million theoretical operations per second
(MTOPS), "reguardless of end-use or end-users."
</P>
<P>
These types of computers can have military applications, easy
for nations to develop nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the bureau would deny license
applications for Indian and Pakistan governments and
non-governmental agencies involved in nuclear, missile or
military activities.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said it would publish a list of Indian and
Pakistani governments and private agencies involved in military
projects, and would prevent them from buying other sensitive
technologies, including some computer software.
</P>
<P>
But the bureau added in a statement: "License applications to
other end-users will be favorably considered ona case-by-case
basis."

<HEADLINE> WMO, UNEP Releases Summary of Scientific Assessment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report has been prepared by more than 200 scientists from
around the world and was reviewed from June 1 to 6 by 77
scientists from 27 countries.
</P>
<P>
The summary confirms the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol
on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer, which had proved to be
an outstanding success for far. A full recovery of the Earth's
protective ozone shield could occur by the middle of the next
century, but it would require that the Protocol is fully
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Among the recent major scientific findings and observations
mentioned in the summary are:
</P>
<P>
-- The combined total abundance of ozone-depleting compounds
in the troposphere peaked in 1994 and is now slowly declining,
However, total concentrations of bromine are still increasing;
</P>
<P>
-- In the Artarctic, the appearance of the "ozone hole"
during the austral springs has continued unabated, with ozone
column losses usually exceeding 50 percent during the months of
September and October;
</P>
<P>
-- Only over the middle latitudes in both the northern and
southern hemispheres had the ozone decline slowed in comparison
with the previous scientific assessment in 1994;
</P>
<P>
-- If measures have not been taken in accordance with the
Montreal Protocol and its Amendments and Adjustments, the ozone
decline would have been much stronger and would have continued
for many more decades;
</P>
<P>
-- Ozone losses in the stratosphere may have caused part of
the observed cooling of the lower stratosphere in the polar and
upper middle latitudes;
</P>
<P>
-- The increase of ozone in the troposphere since
pre-industrial times is estimated to have contributed 10 to 20
percent of the warming due to the increase on long-lived
greenhouse gases during the same period;
</P>
<P>
-- The abundance of ozone-depleting substances in the
stratosphere is expected to peak by the year 2000. However, when
changing atmospheric conditions are combined with natural ozone
variability, detecting the start of the ozone layer recovery may
not be possible for perhaps another 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Argues Its Case in Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Monday reiterated
that it has fulfilled its disarmament obligations, saying that a
recent U.N. report on the matter "fails to give a balanced and
objective picture of what occurred".
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the President of the U.N. Security Council,
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Iraq had worked "in a
positive manner" and "in a spirit of cooperation" on the points
put forward by UNSCOM, the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
disarming Iraq set up after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his talks with UNSCOM Executive Chairman Richard
Butler during the latter's June 11-15 trip to Baghdad, Aziz said
Iraq provided "tangible proof" that it had carried out most of the
points raised by UNSCOM and agreed on a schedule of work for the
next tow months to resolve the remaining issues.
</P>
<P>
In its report to the Security Council, which was made public
last Thursday, UNSCOM said Iraq refused to include in the new work
plan issues such as VX nerve gas, missile propellants and
"concealment practices".
</P>
<P>
Rebutting the accusations, Aziz said the report's reference to
Iraq's refusal to clarify the extent of production of chemical
warfare agent VX is "incorrect".
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq submitted the relevant clarifications,
explanations and documents, but UNSCOM "requested additional
documents to prove that the production of the aforementioned
chemical agent during 1990, which amounted to one and a half tons,
had also failed, even though Iraq has submitted documents proving
without any doubt that the chemical agent VX had not been produced
in 1990 or 1991 in a sufficiently stable manner to be utilized
within the framework of the armament program".
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the issue of missile propellants "was not essential
for the disarmament process", and that it could be addressed under
ongoing UNSCOM monitoring instead of being included in any current
schedule of work.
</P>
<P>
"Since the accounting for missile engines, missile launchers and
the warheads was completed, the question of missile propellants
loses importance," Aziz argued.
</P>
<P>
Regarding biological weapons, Aziz said Iraq has already
accepted a new approach proposed by Butler to focus on the
material balances of the weapons, chemical agents, materials and
equipment at a meeting of experts to be held in Baghdad starting
on July 11.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said UNSCOM's doubts on Iraqi concealment "were totally
unfounded" as proved by intensive investigations over the past
three years.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Cessation of Hostilities by Eritrea, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has urged Eritrea and Ethiopia to avoid any action
which could escalate their border conflict, according to a
statement issued by his spokesman on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief appealed to the two Horn of Africa countries to
continue working with the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
towards a full cessation of hostilities, so that the dispute can
be settled by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The two nations have claimed a piece of land covering 400
square km since 1993. The dispute turned violent on May 6 with air
strikes on border towns in early June before both sides agreed to
a moratorium.
</P>
<P>
News reports said a peace effort led by the OAU broke down on
last Friday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tones down Criticism of Israel's Jerusalem Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
appeared to tone down its criticism of Israel's plan to expand
Jerusalem's municipal borders and its administration reach into
the West Bank after it received what it called a "clarification"
from Israel.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters that
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had assured the State
Department that the new blueprint for Jerusalem did not expand the
city's authority into the West Bank. The plan was approved on
Sunday by the Israeli Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Rubin criticized Israel last Friday for its expansion of the
city's borders, describing the plan as provocative and
insensitive. And Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Sunday
called Netanyahu to complain about the plan.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister (Netanyahu) told us that this decision is
not an effort to expand the municipal authority of the city into
the areas that extend beyond the green line," Rubin said,
referring to the boundaries between Israel and Arab nations
before the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate that clarification," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"Our point is, and it is a very simple and clear point, at a
time when we are trying to break a prolonged impasse in the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, an impasse that has harmed the
interests of all concerned, the last thing we need from either
party are statements or actions that raise suspicions and make
it even more difficult to get the process back on track," he
said, trying to temper his criticism of the Israeli plan of
expansion of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to some press reports, the plan expands Jerusalem's
municipal borders and its administrative reach. The Washington
Post said at the heart of the plan is a significant expansion to
the west and south to include a number of overwhelmingly Jewish
towns and villages.

<HEADLINE> Annan Reports Progress in Identification Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Secretary-General, however, expressed concern over the
identification process in the three contested tribes where Morocco
and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia El-Hamra and
Rio de Oro (POLISARIO Front) have different positions on the
applicants.
</P>
<P>
Annan called on the two parties to work with his Special
Representative and the United Nations Mission for the Referendum
in Western Sahara (MINURSO) and seek practical and concrete ways
to solve this problem so as to complete the whole identification
as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Western Sahara had been a Spanish colony until 1976 when Spain
withdrew and released itself from international responsibility
over the territory. The territory was subsequently occupied by
Morocco, a move which was opposed by POLISARIO front which took up
arms against Morocco forces.
</P>
<P>
Following diplomatic initiatives by the Organization of African
Unity and the United Nations, the Security Council approved a
settlement plan for Western Sahara in 1990. Under the plan, there
would be a ceasefire, and a transitional period during which the
Special Representative of the U.N. Chief would be in charge of all
matters relating to the referendum, assisted by MINURSO.
</P>
<P>
The plan was eventually bogged down by the two parties'
differences on certain groups of people to be included in the
referendum.

<HEADLINE> Romania Beat England to Qualify for Second Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
TOULOUSE, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Dan Petrescu scored the winner at
the 90th minute to give Romania a 2-1 edge over England in an
exciting Group G match here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The first half failed to produce a single goal yet the match was
still exciting as both teams played an open game and concentrated on
attack.
</P>
<P>
Adrian Ille's volley shot hit the crossbar at the 28th minute
while England also had several chances in the first half but Graeme
Le Saux and Alan Shearer squandered them all.
</P>
<P>
The Romanians dealt England a sudden blow as Viorel Moldovan
scored just one minute into the play. England manager Glenn Hoddle
sent in teenager Michael Owen to replace the off-form Teddy Sheringham.
</P>
<P>
It paid off immediately. The strengthened England attack forced
the Romanians back into their own area and Owen capitalized a
Romanian defence mistake to level the score 1-1 at the 83rd minute.
</P>
<P>
England kept a pressure on the Romanians. But the more
experienced Romanian team took one of the few chances to surge ahead
again when Dan Petrescu slamed home the winner at the 90th minute.
</P>
<P>
England still had the chance to equalize in the injury time, but
Owen's shot hit the post and let the Romanians go away with three
points.
</P>
<P>
The victory put Romania into the round of 16 while England will
try to get the second qualifying place from the group when they take
on Colombia on June 25.
