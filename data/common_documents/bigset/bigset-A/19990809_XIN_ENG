<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Parliament to Discuss Transit Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The issue of transshipment of
Indian goods through Bangladesh will be discussed in the next
session of the Bangladeshi parliament scheduled for August 29, the
BSS news agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the National Advisory Committee on
Trade and Industry on Sunday, Minister for Commerce and Industries
Tofail Ahmed welcomed the opposition to the debate both in and
outside the parliament on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is taking all initiatives to make the
issue more transparent and actions more accountable to the people.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has approved in principle a proposal
for examining and discussing the transit issue.
</P>
<P>
Right after the approval was made, the major opposition party
in the parliament, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
denounced the government decision, saying it "would ultimately
jeopardize security" of the country.
</P>
<P>
The BNP-led alliance has decided to conduct a series of
activities to force the government to abandon the decision.
</P>
<P>
However, some business leaders said that the transit would give
enormous direct and indirect dividend to the national economy, and
they urge the government to finalize the transit issue as early as
possible.

<HEADLINE> Contracts for Employment Outside HK Must be Attested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The public here in Hong Kong
have been reminded that every contract for employment outside Hong
Kong must be signed by the employer or his representative and the
employee before the employee leaves Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The contract must contain all the particulars required by the
Contracts for Employment Outside Hong Kong Ordinance to define the
rights and obligations of both parties and be presented to the
Commissioner for Labor for attestation before the employee's
departure.
</P>
<P>
Labor officer of the external employment service of the Labor
Department Lam Chow-Laiwah said Sunday that the Ordinance applied
to all contracts entered into in Hong Kong by manual employees and
those non-manual employees with monthly wages not exceeding 20,000
HK dollars who were employed to work outside Hong Kong by
employers who were not in Hong Kong and were not running a
business locally.
</P>
<P>
"An employer or his agent will commit an offense if he fails to
enter into a written contract or present the written contract for
attestation by the Commissioner for Labor before the employee
leaves Hong Kong," said the officer.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, a person will commit an offense if he induces an
employee to enter into a contract which does not comply with the
Ordinance or leave Hong Kong to take up employment before the
contract is attested," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalty for each offense is a fine of 50,000 HK
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch: Doping Cases Show Pan Am Games Successful in Fighting Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, Croatia, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The latest revelation of
positive doping cases including Cuban star high jumper Javier
Sotomayor showed the Pan Am Games organizers were successful in
fighting drugs, said International Olympic Committee President
Juan Antonio Samaranch on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic chief added that the overall image of the Pan Am
Games has not been affected and the event in Winnipeg, Canada, was
"one of the best games in history."
</P>
<P>
"Of course it is a pity (to have the doping cases). But that
shows that the Pan America organizers are really fighting against
the drugs," said Samaranch, who arrived here to attend the opening
ceremony of the Military World Games.
</P>
<P>
"I congratulate the Pan America Games organizers for their
really, really effective fight against doping," he added.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Sotomayor tested positive for cocaine at
the Winnipeg tournament and was stripped of the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
He will be suspended by two years by the IAAF, the world
governing body for track and field. But the high jumper adamantly
denied of any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Liu Joins Waldner in Table Tennis All-time Greats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Liu Guoliang became
the only second man in the world to complete a "Grand Slam" of
Olympic, world championship and World Cup singles titles as he
outlasted fellow Chinese Ma Lin in the dramatic men's world
championship final.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Liu, the Olympic singles-doubles gold medalist and
the 1996 World Cup winner, came from 1-2 down to beat the 19-year-old
teammate, 21-16, 19-21, 19-21, 21-16, 24-22.
</P>
<P>
Only Sweden's Jan-Ove Waldner has won "Grand Slam", but he fell a
victim in the semifinals to Ma Lin's giant-killing spree.
</P>
<P>
With 1-2 down, Liu Guoliang took the fourth set with strong,
consistent forehand smashes and then held his nerves to clinch the
match point after wasting three.
</P>
<P>
Liu's road to the final was easier than Ma's. The world
second-ranked fast attacker had beaten the bygone players including
1993 world champion Jean-Philippe Gatien of France, 1991 world
champion Jorgen Persson of Sweden and dark horse Werner Schlager of
Austria.
</P>
<P>
Ma upset world No. 1 Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus in the fourth
round and subdued current World Cup runner-up Kim Taek Soo of South
Korea in the quarter-finals and outlasted defending champion Waldner
to advance into the final.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel sad," said Ma Lin. "I played to my best today and
Liu deserves the title."
</P>
<P>
Ma added that he "felt good" for his role in clearing the road for
his teammate.
</P>
<P>
"I beat the top two European stars as well as Kim Taek Soo, the
world best topspin player in penhold grip," Ma said. "I should feel
happy, shouldn't I?"

<HEADLINE> People's Daily On Increasing Fight Against Falun Gong Cult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily will carry a
commentary tomorrow, urging people to use Marxism, Mao Zedong
Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory to erase the pernicious effects
of the Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that facts have proved that only Marxism,
Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory can help people
clearly see the importance of the fight against Falun Gong and see
the true nature of its malicious fallacies and save the people who
have been deceived and fooled by Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
People need to use these theories to have an overall
understanding of the internal and international political
background of the campaign against Falun Gong and of the
seriousness, arduousness and complex nature of the fight, it says.
</P>
<P>
It emphasizes that the cult is a mixture of superstition and
pseudo-science that has posed a serious threat to the Communist
Party of China and the state and that the importance of the fight
can never be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
The major reason Falun Gong could deceive so many people was
that it had a complete set of fallacious ideas. Li Hongzhi, its
founder, in his work against science and government clearly made
Marxism and Materialism his targets of attack.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the fight against Falun Gong is a fierce one
for the defence of science and truth, it says, so the importance
of theories can not be neglected for even one moment.
</P>
<P>
Li's fallacies and Falun Gong were by no means an isolated
phenomenon, it says, and the fight against Falun Gong is not
confined to dealing with it organizationally or merely helping
practitioners avoid superstitious and pseudo-scientific thought.
What is more important is increasing socialist spiritual
civilization, ideological and political work, building democracy
and a legal system, and building the Party, it concludes.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Economy Up 6.7 Percent in 2Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
said Sunday that Singapore has passed the most serious economic
crisis since 1965 as its economy registered a strong growth of 6.7
percent in the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Goh also said the economy managed a 3.7 percent growth for the
first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ministry of Trade and Industry has revised its GDP
growth forecast for this year upwards to between four and five. In
April the ministry revised its GDP growth forecast for this year
from between minus one to plus one to between zero to two after
the first quarter had seen a 1.2-percent increase in the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Goh made the announcement in his National Day message to mark
the 34th anniversary of his country's independence.
</P>
<P>
Goh said Singaporeans' rational and cohesive response to the
crisis has made a critical contribution to the economic recovery,
referring to the wage cut accepted by all, worker retaining
supported by the whole nation, and efforts made to build long-term
capability, to invest in education and infrastructure and to
liberalize the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also partly attributed the recovery to the
strong U.S. economy, the recovery in the global electronics
industry, the improvement in the regional economies and the return
of confidence to South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the recovery is far from complete, citing the
unemployment rate which is higher than it was before the crisis,
serious concerns about cost competitiveness, ongoing restructuring
in companies' operations, the contracting construction industry
and some financial services which have yet to pick up.
</P>
<P>
He also said that external uncertainties remain and worries and
skepticism over the global and regional economic environment still
exist.
</P>
<P>
Goh called upon the whole nation to press on, look ahead and
prepare for fresh challenges in the new millennium.

<HEADLINE> International Symposium for Chinese Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOVER, Germany, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Aiming at promoting the
Chinese language as a globally accepted speech in the coming
century, and improving skills of teaching the language, the Sixth
International Symposium for Chinese as Foreign Language began here
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 linguistic scholars and Chinese language teachers from
33 countries took part in the symposium, which was first ever held
outside China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese language, the speech of about one fourth people in
the world, will certainly make more contribution to the
civilization of humankind, a senior Chinese official said at the
opening ceremony of the symposium.
</P>
<P>
Under the title of "Chinese Language Teaching for the 21st
Century", the symposium will help the language winning world-wide
acknowledge, said Zhang Baoqing, China's deputy Minister of
Education.
</P>
<P>
But with this aim, he stressed, sweeping reforms, both of the
contents and the teaching skills in Chinese language course, is
urgently needed.
</P>
<P>
"Modern technologies such as the multimedia should be applied
in the teaching of Chinese language," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The German host to the symposium, Professor Peter Kupfer at the
University of Mainz, echoed the call for reform by saying a
"practice-directed Chinese language teaching" should be conducted
in future.
</P>
<P>
The internationally growing interests in Chinese language
reflect the growing importance of China, homeland of the speech,
said Kupfer, who is chairman of Germany's Chinese Language
Professional Association.
</P>
<P>
In the fields of economy, trade, culture and science research,
more westerns are trying to learn and use the Chinese language as
an international working language, he said.
</P>
<P>
But to the westerns, there are many obstacles in the way to
master the language. One of them, quoted Kupfer, is the complex
structure of the Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
"It needs one's lifetime to study the Chinese language," he
said, adding that more simplification is needed, especially in the
international teaching of Chinese language.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Hails Barak's Pledge to Start Wye Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat Sunday welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's promise to start implementing the Wye River Accord as from
September.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks at a press conference after meeting
with visiting Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani at
Arafat's presidential office in Gaza. The meeting lasted for one
and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
Hamad, who arrived here in the midday, is the first Arab Gulf
state leader to visit the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is the implementation of the provisions on
the building of Gaza seaport, the release of prisoners and the
opening of the safe passage as well as the economic aspects and
the third stage of the Israeli pullout from the West Bank," Arafat
said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak's predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu signed the
Wye Accord last October in Washington, but hardliner Netanyahu
suspended the agreement in early December.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed regret over the current situation of
the peace process, saying, "up till now, there is a lot of talks
about peace, but the implementation of the Wye Accord is
repeatedly deferred."
</P>
<P>
"What we ask for is the sincere and precise implementation of
the signed agreements in order to be able to establish fair and
comprehensive peace in the region," Arafat added.
</P>
<P>
"We call on Barak who adopts the line of (late Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzrak) Rabin to expedite the implementation of the
signed agreements and meet the promises he made to us and to
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak," Arafat underlined.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Hamad said Barak "should immediately put into
force the Wye Accord as he committed."
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli trade office in his country, Hamad said "this
will not infringe on our ties with the Palestinians." "The Qatari
people stood by the Palestinian people since its crisis," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari emir promised that his country would continue its
assistance to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Arafat and Hamad dealt with a score of issues of
common interest, including the peace process, bilateral economic
cooperation and Qatari financial aid to the PNA, according to
Palestinian sources.
</P>
<P>
Hamad left Gaza later in the day and flew to Beirut to continue
regional tour.
</P>
<P>
Qatar opened a trade represtation office in Gaza in November,
1995, and provided 5 million U.S. dollars to the PNA in aid since
the PNA return to the Palestinian territories in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, an air route between Gaza and Doha opened with
one regular flight every week.

<HEADLINE> Barak Reiterates Commitment to Implementing Wye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Sunday reiterated commitment to implementing the Wye
Agreement, but also called on the Palestinians to consider
"seriously" the proposed modification of the accord.
</P>
<P>
During the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem, Barak said
that Israel will resume the implementation of the Wye agreement
on September 1.
</P>
<P>
Barak also added that Israel is currently waiting for the
Palestinian response regarding his proposal on Israeli troops'
withdrawals from the West Bank. He expected that the proposal
"will be taken seriously."
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) signed the
Wye agreement in the United States last October, which requires
Israel to hand over another 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Netanyahu, hard-line predecessor of Barak, suspended
the accord after carrying out the first phase of the three-stage
withdrawal, accusing the Palestinians of failing to fulfill their
security commitments.
</P>
<P>
After his assuming office last month, Barak pledged to
implement the second stage of withdrawal, but proposed to combine
the third with the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
However, the PNA insisted that the Palestinians would not
enter final status talks until the honest and complete
implementation of the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
The final status talks, which should have started by May 1996,
will deal with the thorniest issues in the Palestinian-Israeli
talks, such as the fate of Jerusalem, borders and refugees.

<HEADLINE> Face-to-Face Talks Between Blair and IRA Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for British Prime
Minister Tony Blair Sunday denied reports that Blair had secret
face-to-face talks with senior members of the Irish Republican
Army (IRA) during last month's peace talks in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
"All the prime minister's contacts with the Republican movement
have been through Sinn Fein," Reuters quoted the spokesman as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Independent newspaper on Sunday said three members of the
IRA's army council offered at the secret meeting with Blair to
give up all weapons by May 2000.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the IRA had passed information through Blair
because it was politically impossible for them to speak directly
to the Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of IRA, also denied the report,
saying it was "absolutely and categorically not true."
</P>
<P>
"The only people who spoke to Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern (the
Irish prime minister) were long-standing Sinn Fein negotiators,"
said a Sinn Fein spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"There were no private republican negotiations taking place.
Our position in respect of establishing the institutions and
decommissioning are all public, there are no private positions,"
the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
During last month's talks between Blair, his Irish counterpart
Ahern and the leaders of Northern Ireland's main political
parties, it emerged that Sinn Fein was prepared to guarantee IRA
decommissioning three months after the setting up of an executive
in the province.
</P>
<P>
But the Ulster Unionists refused to sit in a power-sharing
assembly with Sinn Fein until IRA decommissioning had begun.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has since stalled and is pending a review in
September.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The German government will
donate 8.45 million shillings (about 10,700 U.S. dollars) to help
Tanzania against female genital mutilation.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the German embassy in Dar es Salaam
Sunday said that the amount of money will be given to Network
Against Female Genital Mutilation for the purchase of essential
office and training equipment as well as the organization of
seminars.
</P>
<P>
The network is an association of several initiatives and
individuals who are working actively against female genital
mutilation.
</P>
<P>
The association's sensitization and awareness raising programs
are to help people understand the physical, emotional, social and
psychological impacts produced by female genital mutilation.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the World Health Organization,
Tanzania is  among the 28 African countries still practicing
female circumcision rites. The traditional practice causes
physical sufferings to women, increases maternal mortality and
leads to greater chances of HIV infections.
</P>
<P>
In the traditional belief, women who are not circumcised are
regarded incomplete and cannot get married. During the past
years, the Tanzanian government has made efforts to eliminate
this form of violence against women.

<HEADLINE> Iran Refutes Saddam's Accusations over War, POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry said
Sunday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is trying to
"interpolate historical facts" in a bid to "cover up for his own
defeat and humiliation."
</P>
<P>
Ministry spokesman Hamidreza Assefi was reacting to Saddam's
latest accusation Sunday that Iran tortured and murdered Iraqi
prisoners of war and deceived Baghdad over sheltering military
aircraft during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Marking the 11th anniversary of the end of Iraq's war with Iran
on Sunday, Saddam blamed Iran for the destructive war from
1980-88, in which some 1 million people from the two sides died.
</P>
<P>
"To compensate and cover up for his own defeat and
humiliation, Saddam Hussein is now trying to interpolate the
written history of the region, and the Iraqi authorities
habitually try to refer to their repetitive setbacks as
victories," Assefi said, quoted by the official Islamic Republic
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said "the unfounded statements of the Iraqi president about
his neighbors is not without precedence. It is unfortunate ... he
(Saddam) is still unwilling to abandon his unwise practices in his
relations with other nations."
</P>
<P>
He deplored that the Iraqi president's allegations that Iran
failed to settle the problem of the POWs between the two
countries are against the factual realities.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it has evidence that 13,000 Iraqis are still held in
Iran while Iran said Iraq still keeps nearly 3,000 of its citizens
in captivity.
</P>
<P>
"Despite preliminary agreements with the Iraqis in the course
of a recent visit to Iraq by an Iranian delegation, the Iraqi side
suddenly backed down on all previous agreements arrived at between
Iran and Iraq and drove the talks to an impasse," Assefi said.
</P>
<P>
"We only hope that the Iraqi government will appreciate the
implications of the situation in Iraq and will turn to logical and
internationally acceptable behavior, and that it will opt for good
neighborly relations with its neighbors and for reducing tension
with them and with the international community," he added.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two usually hostile neighbors have been
deteriorating despite progress in solving their long-standing
disputes, including the issue of POWs.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was held here on
Sunday to commemorate Mahmoud Saremi, a correspondent of the
official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) and eight Iranian
diplomats killed in Afghanistan by Taliban troops.
</P>
<P>
Saremi and the diplomats were killed soon after Taliban troops
seized Mazar-i-Sharif, a stronghold of the opposition forces in
northern Afghanistan on August 8, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was attended by representatives of the supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Mohammad Khatami,
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and several cabinet members, IRNA
managing director Fereydoun Vardinejad, and people from various
walks of life.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with the bereaved families last week, Kharrazi said
Iran persists in its request for identification and punishment of
those responsible for the killings.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony showed a hardened Iranian stance by proclaiming
that Iran will not remain silent unless its request is met.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Yulin's Walk of Smile into New Millenium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- "The first thing I treasure on my
hike is smile, which communicates better than anything else," said
Zou Yulin, the 44-year-old Chinese hiker on an ever adventure to
walk around the world on foot.
</P>
<P>
Beaming the tenderness of that smile, the well-tanned Yulin
told Xinhua what he had seen along the road with an eye of a
Chinese folk.
</P>
<P>
You do not have to worry about police who might take you for
anything but normal; you just smile from the bottom of your heart
and use gesture or whatever out of your instinct, then you're sure
to get across, Yulin talked about his encounters with the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).
</P>
<P>
An ordinary looking man of 165 cm., the worker of a southwest
China steel factory has walked over 2,000 kilometers in Canada
through two snow-capped mountains and a virgin forest of nearly
200 kilometer.
</P>
<P>
Starting from the western city of Vancouver, the lonely chap
walked through the jungle of Rokey Mountains down to the
provincial capital of Manitoba, the city of Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
Police followed him once they were informed about a strange
looking man sleeping near a highway. In broken English he had
rushed to learn just before this adventure trip, Yulin told
mounties:"I'm China." He then smiled and pointed to his cap, where
a miniature of the five-starred national red flag was sewn.
</P>
<P>
Mounties are quite friendly and understanding, Yulin recalled,
describing the exchange of heartfelt smiles and gestures: You need
a place of safety for sleep, they suggested.
</P>
<P>
Yulin declined the offer with a "no thanks" smile and a
determined gesture of pointing and looking forward into distance.
Communication is there, without language expertise or more
documents than pieces of news on his world trip -- all in Chinese
and by the Chinese media.
</P>
<P>
Police wished him "a happy journey" or "bon Voyage", perhaps a
bilingual blessing of good luck, he said.
</P>
<P>
The lucky guy, as he called himself, has succeeded in acquiring
the visa into Canada's southern neighbor the United States. So far
so good, the guy said with a sigh of relief after receiving the
visa a few days ago from an understanding U.S. consul, who may
otherwise reject his application on the ground of immigration
suspicion: he has not acquired all the necessary documents or
visas in advance of the trip through a total of 16 countries.
</P>
<P>
Yulin believes in his power of smile from the bottom of heart
of ordinary Chinese people. He likes a comparison of his trip on
foot to that of an ancient-time monk called "Tang Seng", a
character in the Chinese classic "pilgrimage to the West". He may
not have to go through all the ordeals taken by the monk of the
Tang Dynasty in Chinese history, but he's in the hope that his
trip may help enhance understanding and friendship among all the
occidental and Oriental nations his trip is to take him to.
</P>
<P>
He will bid farewell to Canada on Monday and go on with his
planned trip down south into the U.S.A.. His European itinerary
includes U.K., the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany,
Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Russia. He
plans to go back to China through Mongolia by the end of 2000, in
completion of his global trip on foot of 32,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Jointly sponsored by the Chinese People's Association for
Friendship with Foreign Countries and the industrial group of
brewery Wu Liang Ye, the trip was launched in the South China city
of Shenzhen on September 4, 1998. So far, he has completed his
trip of over 8,000 kilometers respectively to Hong Kong, South
Korea and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Namibian President Vows to Crush Separatist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam
Nujoma has vowed to crush an armed separatist movement that last
week mounted an assault on government facilities, leaving 16
people dead, South African Press Association reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting last Monday in the remote Caprivi Strip in
south-central Africa began when a small group of lightly armed
secessionists attempted to seize the local military base, the
police station and briefly occupied the local offices of the
Namibian Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the dead, 25 people were wounded, many of them
civilians caught in a cross-fire.
</P>
<P>
"We will combat and destroy the secessionists, and we will do
so without mercy," Nujoma told a rally Saturday in Katima Mulilo,
a town in the Caprivi Strip, which pokes below Angola and Zambia
and above Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said his government suspected the secessionists, who
want the Caprivi to break away from Namibia, received backing from
the little-known Barotseland Patriotic Front in Zambia and may
have been supplied arms by the Angolan rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
With the help of Angolan and Zambian authorities, Nujoma said
his government intended to pursue the secessionist group to
wherever it is hiding out.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 300 people detained under the state of emergency
regulations that Nujoma imposed are being held incommunicado at
the Grootfontein military base, 1,000 kilometers west of Katima
Mulilo, as prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
Namibian security forces have also arrested a number of police
officers attached to the local police station, local civil
servants, as well as three top employees of the local Namibian
Broadcasting Corporation's offices.
</P>
<P>
The detained officers had been using police vehicles to
transport the rebels, and were leaking information to them.
</P>
<P>
The Caprivi Strip is an impoverished area with about 90 percent
 unemployment and is culturally closer to Zambia than Namibia. The
Namibian government has been slow to start development projects
here, leaving many local residents feeling they have been
neglected.
</P>
<P>
Mishake Muyongo, the leader of the separatist movement, said
from Denmark where he has been granted asylum that his movement
would prevail, even though his fighters failed to take the key
installations last Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is only the beginning," he warned.

<HEADLINE> 0808040 Sierra Leone Rebels Free 20 Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Rebels in Sierra Leone Sunday
released 20 of over 30 hostages taken last Wednesday and efforts
are continuing to secure the release of the remaining hostages,
said reports reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted U.N. sources as saying that among the
released were seven U.N. observers, five members of the west
African peace-keeping force of ECOMOG, two journalists and six
Sierra Leonean drivers.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) led by
Major General Johnny Paul Koroma are still holding about 14
hostages who are mainly U.N. military observers and ECOMOG
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The more than 30 hostages were part of a group of U.N.
observers, ECOMOG soldiers, journalists and Sierra Leoneans who
were seized by the AFRC in the Okra Hills, about 60 kilometers
east of capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The hostages had been trying to persuade the rebel AFRC to
release a large group of women and children abducted in January
this year when the rebels attacked capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The rebel AFRC has been demanding food, medicine and the
release of their leader Koroma.
</P>
<P>
Koroma told west media Saturday in Liberia that he had ordered
his fighters to free their captives immediately, adding that he is
a free man.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader noted that he was making arrangements for
senior commanders of the hostage-takers to travel to Liberia so
that he could brief them fully on the peace agreement signed last
month in Togolese capital of Lome.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader denied that the rebel movement was divided,
adding "we are still united... the marriage is still intact".
</P>
<P>
Togolese Foreign Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh and
representatives of six other west African countries monitoring the
peace agreement on Sierra Leone met in freetown Saturday and urged
the immediate release of the hostages without conditions.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah told journalists
Saturday that the United Nations and foreign relief organizations
should review their policy of refusing assistance to the rebels in
this exceptional case.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nearly Shells Pisa's Leaning Tower, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. army was on the point of
shelling the Italy's Pisa Leaning Tower in the Second World War,
but a sergeant's indecision gave the command time to change its
mind, a U.S. ex-sergeant claims in his war memoirs.
</P>
<P>
Leon Weckstein, 78, now lives in California with his wife Mimi
but in 1944 was a sergeant in the 363rd U.S. infantry regiment,
Italian news agency Ansa reported.
</P>
<P>
"The part I played in saving the Leaning Tower of Pisa is
verifiable: there are documents of that action and I hope that
some witnesses are still alive," he says in the preface of his
memories book, "Through My Eyes" which was published in U.S.
recently.
</P>
<P>
Weckstein's duties during the campaign were to observe the
enemy through powerful binoculars and direct U.S. artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
In August 1944 his regiment occupied Livorno, about 40 km
southwest of Pisa, and in ten days reached the banks of the river
of Arno at Marina di Pisa, under the enemy fire.
</P>
<P>
"It was 10 o'clock in the evening when the colonel said to me
that the general wanted me to leave at dawn with a radio operator
and went as close as I could to the tower, adding that the Germans
might be using it as an observation post," he wrote in his book.
</P>
<P>
Two artillery batteries were pointed at the world-famous
landmark, while a navy cruiser was ready with its heavy guns.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the Leaning Tower was in the hands of Weckstein and
his radio operator, Charles King. Hidden in an olive grove, the
Sergeant pointed his binoculars and brought the building into
focus.
</P>
<P>
"For an instant I was hypnotized by the grace and elegance of
the architecture. I cursed the enemy who was probably using it to
decimate our troops, " he said in his book.
</P>
<P>
But the heat haze prevented Weckstein from getting a clean
sight of the building. He reckoned the Germans were probably
directing their fire from the tower, but he wasn't sure.
</P>
<P>
Weckstein says he struggled for hours against the temptation to
give the signal to the U.S. guns. In the end he found himself
under such a heavy bombardment that he received radio clearance to
pull back.
</P>
<P>
He was told that the generals have decided to spare the tower
in any case.

<HEADLINE> Two British Soldiers Freed in S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Office Minister
Peter Hain confirmed on Sunday that a rebel faction in Sierra
Leone had freed two of the five British soldiers it was holding as
hostages.
</P>
<P>
"We remain hopeful that the release of all the remaining
detainees will take place soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the rebels released Sunday 20 of over 30
hostages on the fifth day of their captivity.
</P>
<P>
The hostages were members of a U.N.-led team that went to a
rebel-held area, some 60 kilometers east of the capital Freetown,
to collect abducted women and children.
</P>
<P>
The rebel faction, supporters of former military ruler Major
General Johnny Paul Koroma, are still holding about 14 hostages
who are mainly U.N. military observers and peace-keeping soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Three More Pan Am Athletes Test Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Two Mexican baseball
players and a Cuban weightlifting gold medalist were confirmed to
test positive Sunday, the last day of the 13th Pan Am Games.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Vizcarra Acosta and Hector Javier Ortiz, memebers of
the Mexican baseball team who had already been disqualified after
one player refused to receive a drug test following their loss to
Canada in the bronze-medal game, both tested for Nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
The doping tests of Vizcarra resulted positive on the A and B
samples. Ortiz resulted positive on the A sample, and the Chief de
Mission of the Mexican delegation accepted this result and refused
its right to practice the test on the B sample.
</P>
<P>
In an another announcement, the Pan American Sports
Organization (PASO) Executive Committee decided to withdraw the
gold medal from Cuban weightlifter William Vargas Trujillo, who
also tested positive for Nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
The men's 62kg gold was re-awarded to Barrio Hernandez of
Colombia,the silver medal to Jimenze Lopez of Guatemala, and the
bronze medal to Sakamaki of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Another unidentified weightlifter has also tested positive in
Sample A, and B sample is being analyzed, the PASO medical
commission chief Eduardo de Rose said.
</P>
<P>
There had been three doping case before Sunday, including Cuba'
s high jumping world record holder Javier Sotomayor.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Games Rarely Showcase World's Best </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Games provided relatively weak competition, with many top
athletes passing them over. And the embarrassment of some high-
profile positive drug tests have overshadowed the two-week sports
performances which witnessed one world record broken.
</P>
<P>
Perennial Pan Am powerhouse the United States finishes with the
most golds (106) and the most total medals (295), even without
having sent its top athletes, who are saving themselves for world
championships or major meets in individual sports later this month.
</P>
<P>
Cuba fended off strong challenges from hosts Canada, who pulled
off their best ever Pan Am record with 64 golds, 52 silvers and 80
bronzes to maintain the runner-up status to the American B team on
a 71-40-47 record.
</P>
<P>
Brazil and Argentina tied on gold medal tally, both at 25, but
the former had more silver and bronze medals (101 to 72) to place
fourth.
</P>
<P>
Many of the world's best athletes took a pass on this year's
Games. The professionals in Brazilian and Argentine soccer teams
stayed home. Sprinters Brunny Surin of Canada, Ato Boldon of
Trinidad and world's fastest man Maurice Greene of the United
States went to run for cash in European meets. Donovan Bailey, who
was paid 200,000 Canadian dollars to be the Games spokesman,
refused to run in the marquee 100-meter race.
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the Pan Am athletics competitions had been
second rate, just as most of the other major events. The United
States and Cuba faced off each landing ten golds in hands, Brazil
and Mexico, whose long-distance runners turned in dominating
performances, following behind with seven golds each to their
credit.
</P>
<P>
The only world record-breaking feat took place in the men's
77kg weightlifting event, where Hidalberto Quintero Aranda hoisted
a total of 205.5kg to improve the previous best mark by 0.5kg
margin.
</P>
<P>
At the Pan Am swimming pool, hosts Canada were remarkable. The
32-member team surfaced with a heavy load of 32 medals, of which
13 were gold, three more than their best performances in 1967,
which was also held in Winnipeg, and 1975 Pan Am Games.
</P>
<P>
Jessica Deglau, the 18-year-old butterfly ace, capped the six-
day competition for the host nation, becoming the most decorated
athlete by winning four gold medals and two silver.
</P>
<P>
The second-choice U.S. squad still proved too much for their
American neighbors, taking a lion's share of the gold medals in
cycling (11), shooting (9), wrestling (8) and weightlifting (5).
Cuba maintained their traditional territories in boxing, where
they ruthlessly snared up nine golds, and successfully kept their
edge in gymnastics and fencing, each with 7 golds.
</P>
<P>
Argentina turned out to be the rowing powerforce in the
continent, breaking the surfaces with 7 golds, while the tiny
island country the Bahamas produced the fastest women in the
continent, whose female sprinters emerged victorious both from
women's 100m and 200m.
</P>
<P>
Like the Bahamas, small countries like Suriname (women's 800m),
Bermuda (equestrian) and Netherlands Antilles (men's 70kg karate)
all found something to cheer for as their athletes went all out to
snatch the more precious gold.
</P>
<P>
Although the PASO President Mario Vazquez Rana rated the
Winnipeg Games as "the best organized, the most carefully planned
and carried-out Games", the lack of world-calibre competitions
still can't go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
And maybe, the Pan Am Games of 1999 will be best remembered as
where the great Cuban world record holder, high jumper Javier
Sotomayor had his fourth Pan Am gold stripped off after testing
positive for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg is also the place where roller-hockey goalie Steve
Vezina betrayed his team and his talent by testing positive for
massive amounts of stimulants and steroids, costing Canada a gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
There have been six doping cases, including three more on the
last day, but Dr. Rana has declared it's a "super clean" Games.
</P>
<P>
"I would rate the doping situation in these Games as below
normal," Dr. Rana said. "We have 3600 athletes tested and only six
positive; it's a very, very clean Games."
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of the Don MacKenzie, president of the Winnipeg
Games, the only problem seem to be the size of the Pan Am Games.
</P>
<P>
Some suggest the Games are too big, too long and they might be
too expensive.
</P>
<P>
"There are way, way too many sports and way too many athletes.
We reduced the events from 435 in Mar del Plata to 330 here. But
the Games should still be smaller."
</P>
<P>
The 1999 Winnipeg Pan Am Games, where more than 5,000 athletes
from 42 countries competed in 41 different sports, are the third
largest Games ever held in the North America outside the Los
Angeles and Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
When the athletes of the Americas meet in four years in Santo
Domingo, Dominican Republic, the Pan American Games are going to
have no more than 30 sports, the Dominican organizers promise, and
all of them Olympics sports.
</P>
<P>
And that's the way Pan American Games should go.

<P>
KATHMANDU, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Minister for Housing and
Physical Planning Bal Bahadur K.C. said at the House of
Representatives Sunday that the government is working with full
commitment for implementation of the Melamchi Drinking Water
Project.
</P>
<P>
Bal Bahadur K.C. said the government has given high priority to
the economic, technical and managerial aspects of the project in
an effort to complete the project within four years.
</P>
<P>
Immediate and long-term policies have been adopted to resolve
the drinking water problem of Kathmandu, he said, adding that in
view of the decreasing underground water level in the Kathmandu
valley, a project will be launched to collect water from rivers
and rivulets and maintain a balance of the water level.
</P>
<P>
The Melamchi Drinking Water Project was designed to divert 510
million liters of water daily from Melamchi, Yangri and Larke
rivers (which lie in Sidhupalchowk district north-east of
Kathmandu) in three phases and is scheduled to be materialized in
2004. It is viewed as the only option to solve the drinking water
shortage of the Kathmandu Valley.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is 272 million U.S. dollars.
Though some western donors have showed signs to fund the project,
it is still short of the required amount of money.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Eleventh-seeded Thomas Johansson
of Sweden won the Canadian Open by beating third-seeded Yevgeny
Kafelnikov of Russia 1-6, 6-3, 6-3 in Montreal on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Johansson, 24, won the biggest title of his career at the ATP
Super 9 event, taking home a winner's prize of 161,000 U.S.
dollars and enough ranking points to move up to 17th from 22nd.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov's runner-up showing moved him from fourth to second,
but he has now lost all four times he has reached a Super 9 final.
</P>
<P>
The two hour, two minute match was a onesided affair in the
early going. Johansson was error prone but he improved
dramatically in the second and third sets.
</P>
<P>
In the last few games of the final set, he hit several
explosive ground strokes that streaked past an increasingly
frustrated Kafelnikov.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Causes Practitioner's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- More evidences has appeared that
Falun Gong has harmed the physical and mental health of
practitioners as well as caused the death of several people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Weimin, a head of a Falun Gong training center in Anhui
Province, died of a stroke while practicing Falun Gong on October
20, 1994. His wife, Liu Bizhen, said that she had never thought
that her 56-year-old husband could die of Falun Gong after
practicing it for only half a year.
</P>
<P>
She said that on the day Jiang suffered a stroke, the deputy-
head of the Anhui training station repeatedly phoned the Falun
Dafa Research Society in Beijing to ask Li Hongzhi, the founder of
Falun Gong, to give a helping hand, but got no response.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that this tragic incident proved that the powerful
Falun Gong was a lie.
</P>
<P>
Li Dekun is another victim in Hefei, capital of Anhui Province.
He began to practise Falun Gong in 1998 in the hope of curing a
disease. But after a year of practising, his physical condition
didn't improve and in fact began to deteriorate. This evidence
showed him that Falun Gong had nothing to do with treating disease
or illness and made him determined to break all connections with
it.
</P>
<P>
More Falun Gong victims have been found in the city of Anshan
in Liaoning Province, where doctors at the Kangning Mental
Hospital say that they have received ten patients who were
suffering from mental problems resulting from Falun Gong. They
warn people to be on guard against Falun Gong's destruction of the
human spirit and say that only science can bring good health to
people.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Geneticist Disputes Falun Gong's Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shanghai, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Tan Jiazhen, a prominent Chinese
geneticist, said that the fallacies of the Falun Gong cult fly in
the face of science and truth and should be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The 90-year-old Tan said that man's evolution has been
confirmed by study over the centuries but many people were still
being cheated by Falun Gong's fallacies and the need to promote
scientific thought among people has become more urgent than ever.
</P>
<P>
It is nonsense to say that man dropped from the universe and
that evil people fell on the earth, he said, but Li Hongzhi, the
founder of Falun Gong, fooled people with his theories about the
course of man. Man's evolution from apes is unquestioned, he said,
and Li's theory about how god created man is utterly absurd.
</P>
<P>
Tan said that with the increase in research on genetics, the
cause of a number of diseases has been found and some formerly
incurable diseases can now be treated. But, Li Hongzhi asked sick
people not to go to the doctor and many people died because of a
lack of treatment. He is the real killer, Tan said.
</P>
<P>
Everyone wants a long and healthy life but only the development
of science and technology can achieve this, he said. Scientists
and doctors have made some headway in this and they are working
harder to improve man's immunity to disease and prolong life, he
added.
</P>
<P>
So, the crucial task is to spread scientific knowledge among
the Chinese to increase their ability to tell right from wrong and
to promote materialism and atheism, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Communist Party Member's Five-Year Struggle Against The Falun Gong( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Liu Jinheng, an office worker at
Shenyang Railway Administration's Jinzhou branch in northeast
China's Liaoning Province, has been successful in avoiding the
Falun Gong for the past five years in spite of threats on his life.
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old Communist Party member began his anti-Falun
Gong struggle in 1994 when the cult was still in its infancy. Out
of curiosity, he had borrowed some books on the Falun Gong only to
find that Li Hongzhi, the founder of the cult, was teaching
superstitions and bragging about himself.
</P>
<P>
Liu later found that some practitioners had died because of
their refusal to take medicines and that others had become distant
from friends after practicing Falun Gong. He managed to persuade
some Falun Gong practitioners to leave the cult and others to give
up the idea of joining the cult by writing articles to expose the
cult.
</P>
<P>
He saw some resemblance between Falun Gong and cults in China
and abroad so he wrote articles in local newspapers to expose the
fallacies of Falun Gong, some of whose followers threatened to
chop off his head.
</P>
<P>
But, his efforts paid off. Some practitioners quit the cult at
Liu's persuasion and his work won the support of local Party
committees and colleagues and quite a number of people began to
rally around him to fight Falun Gong's fallacious teachings.

He recalled that three leaders of the local Falun Gong training
center came to his office on September 30, 1998 and demanded that
the newspaper apologize for an article about a retired worker who
followed Falun Gong and took his own life by cutting open his
stomach.
</P>
<P>
This proved that the sect was strictly organized and had close
links with well-informed members, Li says. An increasing number of
practitioners began to bother the newspaper just four days after
the article appeared, just as the three leaders had done earlier.
</P>
<P>
They had prepared a statement of apology on the paper's behalf,
Li says, and demanded that it be printed without a word changed.
</P>
<P>
They then organized the protest under orders from the Falun
Dafa Research Society, according to Duan Rongxin, the former head
of the Falun Gong training center in Shijiazhuang, the capital of
Hebei.
</P>
<P>
In Shanxi Province, some prominent writers criticized the
fallacies of the Falun Gong, and Ma Feng, an elderly writer, says
that writers and artists have been responsible for heightening
people's ideological awareness and moral integrity. Otherwise,
decadent ideas and practices can be used to take advantage of
people's weak points, Ma says. He has asked writers to get closer
to the people and to reflect their true thoughts and the reality
of the times.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Campaign to Catch Fake Medicines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- China's State Drug Administration
(SDA) has launched a new campaign to crack down on the production
and trading of fake and substandard medicines.
</P>
<P>
The SDA issued a circular over the weekend asking local
branches to tighten up inspection of producers and traders of
medicines, the country's English-language newspaper China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Any units involved in manufacturing or selling fake and
substandard medicines will be severely punished according to
relevant laws, the circular stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the eight months from last August, the SDA received 160
reports on the quality of medicines. Through these, the
administration discovered 32 cases in which fake and substandard
medicines were manufactured or sold.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five factories have had their production licenses for 19
types of medicines revoked and 35 enterprises have been punished
for producing fake medicines, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the SDA introduced a revised guideline
on pharmaceutical production this month -- "good manufacturing
practice" (GMP)-- in order to improve medicine quality.
</P>
<P>
GMP lays down standards for every pharmaceutical manufacturing
process in order to reduce contamination or errors during
production to the minimum.
</P>
<P>
China adopted the system in the early 1980s, issuing a GMP
standard in 1988 and revising it twice since then in accordance
with Chinese conditions.

<HEADLINE> Children Yearn for Tasty Popular Science Books: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- "But it's too boring!" is
children's normal reaction after their parents have spent hours
selecting a popular science book for them, "China Daily" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"It is incredibly hard to find a really good popular science
book for my son, as so many of them are just not up to scratch,"
said Si Yan, mother of 12-year-old Wang Tingji.
</P>
<P>
Si said she wants to make her son interested in science. With
his mother's help, Wang began to read picture books describing
simple scientific concepts in kindergarten. "But now he seems to
be losing his taste for science books," Si said.
</P>
<P>
The contents of these books are more or less the same once the
often lucid front cover has been opened. "It makes people wonder
whether the books are not just copies of one another," Si
complained.
</P>
<P>
"Popular science stories written for children should be short
and stimulating," said Liu Daoyuan, an experienced editor of
popular science books for children.
</P>
<P>
However, popular science writers have no real incentive to
reach the required standard, according to Zheng Yanhui, deputy
director of the Youth Professional Committee of the Association of
Chinese Popular Science Writers.
</P>
<P>
The writers are paid according to the length of their work,
usually about 40 yuan (4.8 U.S. dollars) per 1,000 words, Zheng
said.
</P>
<P>
Almost all of these authors write in their spare time. "No one
can make a living by this," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It usually takes them more time to write a popular science
book for children than to write an academic thesis because the
book has to express something difficult in a language that is easy
to understand," Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
Zheng worries that there is lack of successors to write popular
science books for young people, says the paper.

<HEADLINE> 10 Hot Spots Detected in South Kalimantan, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 hot spots, spread
across five districts, have been pinpointed in South Kalimantan
province, Indonesia, The Jakarta Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The hot spots have been detected since late in July 1999,"
head of the South Kalimantan Environmental Impact Management Board
Madjedi Aseri said.
</P>
<P>
He said the areas were the site of crops and plantations. All
relevant authorities had been warned to prevent fires from
breaking out.
</P>
<P>
"Regents and mayors here (South Kalimantan) are expected to
increase their levels of alertness, so the potential of fires in
this dry season can be reduced to a minimum," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hot spots had also been reported in West Kalimantan. There are
more than 280 hot spots in the province, and it was feared that
they may cover the area with thick smog.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the National Outer Space and Aviation Agency
said satellite images showed 60 hot spots in Kalimantan and six
others in Sumatera.
</P>
<P>
Land clearing for plantations was mostly to blame for the
forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Coordinator of the Indonesian Forest Watch Abnon Nababan said
plantation companies found guilty of slash-and-burn tactics must
be subject to severe punishment instead of fines in order to deter
them.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government immediately revoke the
licenses of the delinquent companies to deter them.
</P>
<P>
Based on the result of an observational study, almost none of
the companies has adequate equipment to fight forest and woodland
fires, he was quoted by the Antara News Agency Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
From mid-1997 until early 1998, approximately 520,000 hectares
of East Kalimantan's 17 million hectares was razed following
serious forest and field fires.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, blazes on Kalimantan and Sumatera swept out of
control, and a huge smoke cloud paralyzed the region. The
Association of Southeast Asian Nations has intensified its
monitoring of the situation through its Regional Haze Action Plan
Coordinating Support Unit, considering the growing recurrence of
the disaster.

<HEADLINE> Summer Holidays, Spur for Divorce in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Far from bringing Italian couples
closer together, summer holidays are often the spur for divorce,
according to a survey released here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the survey, 100 Italian divorce lawyers looked back at some
2,000 cases of divorce. In over half of those cases, 52 percent,
the decision to file for divorce was taken during the annual
holiday.
</P>
<P>
Close proximity for a long time to an already half-estranged
spouse appeared to act as a catalyst for action, magnifying his or
her perceived faults, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
In 69 percent of the cases women filed for divorce, and in 31
percent men did it.
</P>
<P>
Of the reasons women gave for divorce, 26 percent said their
husbands' defects -- slovenliness, lack of personal hygiene,
aggressiveness -- had been "amplified out of all proportion."
</P>
<P>
Another 23 percent complained their husbands' high-handed and
intolerant behavior increased while on holiday, while 18 percent
were exasperated by his unwillingness to share household tasks.
</P>
<P>
Italian husbands had their reasons too. About 27 percent said
they were fed up with "hysterical fits of jealousy"; 21 percent
said their wives were "incapable of meeting my increased sexual
appetite"; and 11 percent said they made their decision because "
the gap between the attractiveness of their wives and that of
other women became glaring in the summertime."
</P>
<P>
The lawyers said a divorce decision is often taken in the
summer because problems that have been bubbling under all year
come to a head, while the self-control and inhibition of workaday
lives falls away in a welter of aggression and mutual
recrimination.

<HEADLINE> Monkeys Reappear In China's Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, August 9 (Xinhua)-- Monkeys have come back to the
Three Gorges area after a more than 20-year absence thanks to
environmental protection efforts.
</P>
<P>
Monkeys jumping around the Three Gorges area was a scene
admiringly described by generations of Chinese poets, but the
extensive logging and quarrying of the 1960s and 1970s pushed them
to the verge of extinction in the scenic region.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of 1980s, however, the area started getting more
environmental protection and forested areas were closed off to the
outside world so the monkeys began to return to their ancestral
home.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, farmers in the area set aside some farmland
for corn, sweet potatoes, and peanuts for the monkeys. During
wintertime, corn is scattered about in places where the monkeys
gather.
</P>
<P>
In Niuzhaping on the southern bank of Xiling Gorge, one of the
Three Gorges, as many as 300 monkeys can be seen at one time.

<HEADLINE> Beijing University Professors Lash out at Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Professors and scholars from the
prestigious Beijing University recently have vowed to fight
against the malicious fallacies of Falun Gong and its founder, Li
Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
Professor Ye Lang, the chairman of the Philosophy Department,
said that Li Hongzhi's ideas are anti-scientific because he denies
modern science with the excuse that human beings cannot understand
all natural phenomena.
</P>
<P>
Ye pointed out that Falun Gong raised more problems about
scientific knowledge hence the urgent need to strengthen Marxist
philosophy and humanities studies.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhao Dunhua of the department said that the Falun
Gong cult has made people realize the importance of ruling the
country in accordance with the law. He said that China guarantees
religious freedoms and the freedom to believe in atheism, but some
Falun Gong followers only allow themselves to believe in
superstition and leave no room for people to believe in atheism.
</P>
<P>
The Falun Gong followers have attacked government offices and
news media organizations and have seriously disrupted social order,
Zhao stressed.
</P>
<P>
The professors agree that the whole society should increase
education in popular science and the humanities to help people
immunize themselves against the Falun Gong cult and other
superstitious beliefs.

<HEADLINE> Unlicensed, Unlabeled Food to Be Banned in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Ministry of
Commerce has issued a directive to ban the sale of unlabeled and
improperly labeled food, in order to secure the safety of food and
people's health.
</P>
<P>
The directive signed on August 2 by Commerce Minister Cham
Prasidh requires retailers to sell only processed food products
with a label that displays nutritional information, an expiration
date and other manufacturer's information. Improperly labeled food
will be confiscated and destroyed, the directive read.
</P>
<P>
The directive, slated to go into effect on October 1, applies
to both imported and locally manufactured products, according to
Monday's Cambodia Daily.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers, importers and retailers have two months to
tackle the problem of potentially dangerous food before the
directive becomes effective.
</P>
<P>
In the last two months, the Commerce Ministry and the Ministry
of Industry conducted an intensive investigation of local markets
and found various counterfeit products, most of which did not have
proper labels or were produced by unlicensed manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, many brands of vinegar contained
poisonous elements, and only two types of vinegar are produced by
licensed manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that with the implementation of the directive
and the joint actions of the two ministries, the quality control
over food products will be enhanced soon in Cambodia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- China may be able to promulgate a
venture capital law in at least two years, Beijing's China
Securities reports today.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Siwei, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress (
NPC) Standing Committee, was quoted as saying recently in Beijing
that a team of experts has already started drafting one, but it is
expected to take a relatively-long period of time. Authorities are
working on a regulations on industrial investment funds that could
provide fiscal and tax preferential policies to venture capital.
</P>
<P>
Further support is expected to be given to venture capital in
an amendment to the Scientific and Technological Progress Law and
the New Technological Development Zone Law.
</P>
<P>
Cheng has called for a cooling-down period for the discussion
of venture capital, saying that China first needs to study the
experiences of other countries carefully and then to balance them
against the reality of Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
He said that for now China does not have the essential
conditions to establish another stock market because it would have
even greater requirements for information disclosures, market
interaction, and regulations than what China could come up with
today.
</P>
<P>
And China needs to be active in promoting the development of a
second stock market in Hong Kong, Cheng noted.

<HEADLINE> Nagasaki Commemorates 54th Anniversary of Atomic Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese city of Nagasaki on
Monday marked the 54th anniversary of the atomic bombing of the
city in 1945, vowing to make new efforts to create a peaceful
world free of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 participants, including atomic-bomb survivors,
bereaved family members and dignitaries, attended the annual Peace
Memorial Ceremony at Nagasaki's Peace Park.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Health and Welfare Minister Sohei Miyashita attended
the ceremony on behalf of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who did not
go to Nagasaki because of parliamentary commitments.
</P>
<P>
Nagasaki Mayor Itcho Ito presented a new list of 2,733 atomic
bomb victims whose deaths have been confirmed since August 1 last
year, bringing the total number of deaths from the bombing to 121,
588.
</P>
<P>
At 11:02 a.m., the time the bomb exploded 500 meters above the
port city more than half a century ago, Nagasaki citizens offered
a minute of silent prayer, while bells of churches and Buddhist
temples resounded through the southwestern Japan city.
</P>
<P>
Ito delivered a peace declaration, urging the Japanese
government to seek a security framework that "does not require a
nuclear umbrella" provided by the United States and saying dynamic
actions taken by non-governmental organizations would lead to
nuclear abolition.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the world's younger generations to "consider
what (they) can do to make the next century one of peace and
prosperity."
</P>
<P>
The mayor, on behalf of the Nagasaki citizens, renewed the
municipal government's determination to make further efforts to
achieve a nuclear-free world.
</P>
<P>
The Health and Welfare Minister read a message from Obuchi,
which emphasized the significance of the resolution adopted by the
U.N. Conference on Disarmament Issues held in Nagasaki last
November.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi pledged in the statement that his government will
actively work toward nuclear abolition.
</P>
<P>
An atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki from a U.S. B-29 bomber
on August 9, 1945, killed an estimated 74,000 people and injured
some 75,000 others immediately after.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of Nagasaki, three days after that of Hiroshima,
was followed by Japan's unconditional surrender in World War II
six days later.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Industrial Production Index Up in First Half 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Industrial
Production Index (IPI) for the first six months of 1999 rose 1.9
percent to 148.3 from 145.5 reported in the same period in 1998,
the Statistics Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The improvement was mainly attributed to the growth in the
manufacturing and electricity sectors by 3.2 percent and 2.3
percent respectively, the department said in releasing the June
IPI figures here.
</P>
<P>
The IPI in the second quarter of this year went up by 6.2
percent to 154.5 against the index of 145.5 recorded in the same
period a year earlier, and was 8.7 percent higher in comparison
with that of 142.1 reported in the first quarter of this year
mainly attributable to the growth of the manufacturing sector, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The IPI for June alone registered an increase of 8.3 percent to
152.27 compared with 141.0 recorded in the same month of last
year, but was 1.7 percent lower against May 1999, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year increase for June was mainly induced by the
growth in the indices of the manufacturing and electricity sectors
by 12.5 percent and 1.2 percent respectively while the decline in
June's IPI over May was largely attributed to the drop in the
indices of the manufacturing and electricity sectors by 2.1
percent and 2.3 percent respectively, it said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Lease Out 10 More Trains to Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The state-run Bangladesh Railway
(BR) is going to lease out service of ten more trains to the
private sector, The New Nation daily newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The BR has already floated tenders in this regard, and the
other formalities to lease out the trains will be completed within
a short time, a top ranking official source of the BR was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The earnings from the ten trains which are going to be leased
out to the private sector would be doubled than that of the trains
at the present after handling them over to the private sector, he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
The government began leasing out the trains as they were
incurring huge losses every year, and besides, the donor agencies
have also played a vital role in leasing out the trains, he
stated.
</P>
<P>
The BR has almost recovered the losses as it was earning 40
million taka (about 0.81 million U.S. dollars) from the public
service obligation and by leasing out some trains to the private
sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
The railway authorities first leased out services of 22 trains
to the private companies in 1998, according to the decision made
by the BR in a bid to increase the sagging revenue income, and the
result has been proved good.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of the allied troops
defending the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
against the rebels are unlikely to be back home by Christmas as
earlier announced, the daily Herald reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Allied Task Force Commander Major-General Amoth Chingombe was
quoted as saying in Congolese capital Kinshasa Sunday that the
departure of the troops by the end of the year was now doubtful
because of the failure of the rebels to sign the cease-fire
agreement reached in Lusaka on July 10 by the six countries
directly involved in the Congo conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The main rebel faction, the Congolese Rally for Democracy , or
RCD, headed by Emile IIlunga, and the smaller one headed by Wamba
dia Wamba in Kisangani, has failed to sign the agreement since
July 10 because of internal bickering.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been worsened by the cease-fire violations by
another rebel group, the Movement for Liberation of Congo, led by
Jean Pierre Bemba in the north. Bemba has already announced that
he is going to withdraw his signature.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad and Namibia deployed troops in the congo
to help Congoleses President Laurent Kabila to fight against the
rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Chingombe said, "The cease-fire is putting itself into effect
but the problem now is that it is one-sided. The rebels and their
allies are taking advantage of the cease-fire to gain ground."
</P>
<P>
He said the cease-fire had been violated 70 times in the last
one month.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had fired at the allied forces' aircraft twice and
attacked troops in Makanza area, about 900 kms north of Kinshasa,
he said, adding that "we will not stand and watch."

<HEADLINE> Hingis Beats Venus Williams for TIG Tennis Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Martina Hingis is back on top
of the women's tennis world and overwhelmed Vennus Williams 6-4, 6-
0 in today's final of the 520,000 U.S. dollars TIG Tennis Classic
in San Diego,California.
</P>
<P>
After back-to-back embarrassing displays at the French Open and
Wimbledon, Hingis completed an impressive return to the No. 1
ranking and did not drop a set all week en route to her WTA Tour-
leading fifth title of the year, 24th of her career and second at
this event in three years. The second seed from Switzerland earned
80,000 U.S. dollars for the victory.
</P>
<P>
"I just got better and better as the tournament went on,"
Hingis said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hingis will reclaim the top spot in the WTA ranking
from American Linsday Davenport, whom the fourth-seeded Williams
beat in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
After the players exchanged breaks in the first four games of
the match, Hingis moved into position to serve out the set as she
broke for a 5-4 lead. Hingis took the set as Williams netted a
backhand volley.
</P>
<P>
"Mentally it was important to win the first set," Hingis said.
"I thought Venus would have a hard time coming back after that."
</P>
<P>
As she has does often in the past, Williams fell apart in the
second set as Hingis displayed brilliant play from the baseline
and well-timed approaches to the net. The American teenager failed
to hold serve in her final four service games as Hingis eventually
served out her seventh win in 10 meetings with Williams.
</P>
<P>
"I was just too tired today," Williams said. "I've played three
weeks in a row on different continents. I wish I could have waited
to be tired till tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Williams was denied her fifth title of 1999 for the second
straight week. She lost to Davenport in the final of last week's
Bank of the West Classic.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon not Keen on Normalizing Ties with Israel: Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese House Speaker Nabih
Berri has stressed that regional harmony depends on an
improvement in inter-Arab relations rather than normalization of
ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arabs can never overstep such issues as Jerusalem, the return
of refugees, the return of Lebanon, the Golan and Arab territories
in order to normalize relations with Israel, he told a mass rally
Sunday in Zahrani, just outside the Israeli occupied border zone
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We tell Arabs that peace is born from the normalization of
inter-Arab relations and from raising the level of solidarity and
common Arab work, and not from the Arab-Israeli normalization of
relations," Berri said.
</P>
<P>
He conditioned Lebanon's signing a treaty with Israel on a full
and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territories and
from Syria's Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks. It caputured the Golan Heights
in the 1967 Middle East war
</P>
<P>
The speaker insisted that Lebanon would continue to support
resistance movements in the country until Israel withdraws its
troops from the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of a buffer zone in the border,
Lebanon's resistance movements spearheaded by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, have been fighting to oust Israeli
forces out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Berri's remarks came in contrast with the widely optimistic
mood in the region toward the anticipated resumption of the peace
talks under Israel's new Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised that he would resume all tracks of the
peace negotiations during his tenure and offered to withdraw
troops from south Lebanon within one year.
</P>
<P>
But, the Lebanese government is suspicious about Israel's
commitment to concluding peace with Arabs based on its experiences
in dealing with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Code of Conduct For Ballot in E. Timor Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The code of conduct for the
August 30 autonomy ballot was signed by U.N. Mission in East Timor
(UNAMET) Chief Ian Martin and representatives of the pro-autonomy
and pro-independence factions in Dili, capital of East Timor, on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Forum for Unity, Democracy and Justice (FPDK)
and Dili district head Domingos Soares, represented the
pro-autonomy camp while coordinator of the Resistance Council of
East Timor (CNRT) Leandro Isaac, represented the pro-independence
group.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the code was also witnessed by Dili Bishop
Carlos Belo, head of the Government Task Force for the
Implementation of the Direct Ballot in East Timor Agus Tarmidzi
and the East Timor Police Chief Col. Timbul Silaen.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antara News Agency, the code of conduct
guarantees that all participants shall enjoy the fundamental right
to a fair ballot, including the freedom to campaign, and that they
shall respect the right and freedom of all other participants to
campaign and disseminate their political ideas and principles
without fear.
</P>
<P>
It stated that in the campaign, all participants will not be
allowed to carry guns or weapons of any kind to attend political
rallies and public meetings.
</P>
<P>
They will also not be allowed to kill, torture, injure, apply
violence, intimidate or threaten any person in connection with
that person's political beliefs, words, writing or action.
</P>
<P>
They will be barred from using language which threatens or
incites violence in any form against any person or group of
persons.
</P>
<P>
The code also called on the people to respect the freedom of
the press and refrain from harassing or obstructing journalists in
the pursuit of their professional activities.
</P>
<P>
The campaign period starts on Saturday, August 14 and ends on
August 27.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day cooling-off period from August 28 to 29, the
people will not be allowed to hold any campaign, the code said.
</P>
<P>
Martin said the two factions had an extraordinary spirit and
cooperation during the discussion and formulation of the code.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the spirit would continue to make the ballot run well
and peacefully," he added.
</P>
<P>
Soares in his speech said the code is an important element of
the ballot process as it aims to guarantee the implementation of a
fair, just and peaceful vote.
</P>
<P>
Isaac, on the other hand, said the code was made with the full
dedication to secure the implementation of a fair, just and free
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The August ballot will allow the territory's people to choose
whether their homeland should become an autonomous region within
Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N., which
still considers Portugal as the administering power of the
territory.

<HEADLINE> Refugees in Kenya Ordered to Register with UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has ordered unregistered
foreigners from illegal refugee camps to immediately register with
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and be relocated,
or be rounded up and face repatriation, mass media reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Minister Shariff Nassir Sunday warned refugees who hide
 themselves from the authorities and escape detection, saying that
the Kenyan government will catch up with them.
</P>
<P>
"Refugees should come forward before being sought out by
police," Nassir said as he saw off 1,000 Somali refugees at the
port of Mombasa for Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya's Rift Valley
Province.
</P>
<P>
The minister for home affairs, national heritage, culture and
social service said that all refugee camps in Coast Province in
eastern Kenya had been closed more than a year ago, adding that
his government only recognizes the Kakuma and Dadaab refugee camps
in North Eastern Province.
</P>
<P>
Nassir noted that the St. Anne Somali refugee camp in Mombasa
was illegal, saying that the ongoing registration exercise at a
makeshift camp near the Fort Jesus will continue until all
refugees are relocated.
</P>
<P>
The illegal refugee saga in Mombasa started last Monday when
Mombasa District Commissioner Wilfred Legei ordered the closure of
the St. Anne refugee camp hosting some 2,500 Somalis.
</P>
<P>
Work on the relocation of refugees is being assisted by the
NUHCR, with the U.N. agency arranging transport means for the
registered refugees to the Kakuma and Dadaab camps.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with background Yeltsin Sacks Stepashin Cabinet, Names New Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Monday dismissed the cabinet of Sergei Stepashin and named
Vladimir Putin as the country's acting prime minister.
</P>
<P>
This is the second government sacking this year since former
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov lost his job last May.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has asked the State Duma, or lower house of parliament,
to confirm Putin as prime minister, the presidential press service
said.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin's ouster is believed to a result of his failure to
effectively stop, or control, the alliance formed last week
between the "Fatherland" movement led by Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
and the "All Russia" bloc of powerful regional governors.
</P>
<P>
The All Russia-Fatherland alliance would put the Kremlin in
major disadvantage in the parliamentary elections later this year
and the presidential race next June.
</P>
<P>
Putin, 46, has been relieved from his post of head of the
Federal Security Service, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He graduated from the law department of the Leningrad State
University in 1975 and began his career with the Foreign
Intelligence Service of the USSR State Security Committee.
</P>
<P>
After a long assignment in Germany, Putin became deputy head
for International Affairs of the Leningrad State University.

<P>
Putin served as deputy head of the Kremlin Property Department
in 1996-1997 and head of Kremlin's Chief Control Department in
1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed head of the Federal Security Service in July
1998 and secretary of the Security Council in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Moskovskiye Novosti newspaper had earlier speculated that
the State Duma would never approve Putin as prime minister, which
would prompt Yeltsin to dismiss the lower house of parliament and
then quickly resign, leaving Putin as the acting president.

<HEADLINE> China Establishes 5-Million-Yuan State Supreme Science Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- China announced here today that
the establishment of a State Supreme Science and Technology Award
beginning this year, to be given each year to not more than two
scientists of Chinese nationality, and worth 5 million yuan (about
600,000 U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Xu Guanhua, Vice Minister of Science and Technology, said at a
press conference that the award will granted to those who have
achieved major breakthroughs on the frontiers of contemporary
science and technology or have made outstanding contributions to
the development of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
He added that those who have been responsible for great
economic returns or social benefits in blazing new trails in
science and technology, in realizing scientific and technological
results, and in industrializing high technology will also be
eligible for the award.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister said that out of the 5 million yuan, 500,000
yuan (about 60,000 U.S. dollars) will go to the individual, with
the rest of the money required to be used as research funds for
any scientific projects the award winner chooses.
</P>
<P>
Xu added that the Chinese State President will sign the award
document and confer it upon the winners each year.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Xu said the money for first prize of
the State Natural Science Award and State Technical Invention
Award will be raised as of this year from 60,000 yuan ( about 7,
400 U.S. dollars) to 90,000 yuan (about 10,840 U.S. dollars) and
that first prize in the State Science and Technology Advance Award
will also be 90,000 yuan, double the original figure.
</P>
<P>
He said the second prize for the above three awards will also
be increased from 30,000 yuan (about 3,700 U.S. dollars) to 60,000
(about 7,400 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The vice minister said he believes that the reform of the State
science awards system will encourage invention, the combining of
scientific research with economic development, and the early
industrialization of high-tech discoveries.
</P>
<P>

State science awards will be reduced by half, to fewer than 400

<HEADLINE> S. African President Hosts Talks on Congo Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki and his counterparts of Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania
held talks in Pretoria Sunday evening to discuss the situation in
the Democratic Republic of Congo, mass media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
No details of the talks were given. But observers here said
the presidents surely discussed the fragile cease-fire agreement
reached in Lusaka on July 10 by the six countries directly
involved in the Congo conflict.
</P>
<P>
The alleged bombing in northern Congolese city of Kisangani has
 threatened to bring setbacks to the faltering peace process in
the third largest African country, the observers said.
</P>
<P>
Several African leaders are working hard to persuade the rebels
to sign the cease-fire agreement. One major rebel group, the
Rally for Congolese Democracy, did not sign due to a leadership
dispute from within. Rwanda and Uganda are supporting the rebels
fighting to topple Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Ministry spokesman Daniel Ngoepe said
that Mbeki, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni and Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa first had
lunch together before the meeting.

<HEADLINE> China Accelerates Reform of Accounting System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- China is accelerating the reform
of its accounting system in order to improve the quality of work
and the transparency of accounting information, Beijing-based
China Securities said today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Feng Shuping, head of the Department of
Accounting of the Ministry of Finance as saying that China is
amending its accounting law to improve the supervision of
accountants and further clarify legal responsibility for accounts.
</P>
<P>
The amendment makes fraudulent accounting a punishable crime,
Feng said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the government has issued nine codes for
enterprise accounting, and 33 more will be issued by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The government has also drafted plans for the continued
education and training of accountants to improve their quality,
she said.
</P>
<P>
The official confirmed that the Chinese government is taking a
positive attitude towards bringing its accounting system closer to
the international practices.
</P>
<P>
But she reiterated that many aspects of China's economy are
unique to the country, which will inevitably produce an accounting
system unique to China.

<HEADLINE> Labor, Alliance Still Ahead: New Zealand Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Party, the main
opposition party in New Zealand, and its ally the Alliance hold a
14-seat majority over the ruling National Party and its ally the
ACT if an election were held now, a poll released Monday shows.
</P>
<P>
Just three months out from the general election, the latest
Herald-DigiPoll survey shows the Labor Party was supported by 41.8
percent, dropping three percentage points since the last poll in
May.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance's support rate was 8.9 percent, up one percentage
point over the last poll.
</P>
<P>
The National Party had a support rate of 34.6 percent in the
latest poll, down two percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The ACT's 5.1 percent was just above the threshold required for
allocation of proportional seats under the current voting system
of Mixed Member Proportional (MMP).
</P>
<P>
Based on this poll, taken over one week and completed Sunday,
the Labor Party would win 55 seats in the 120-seat Parliament,
the National Party 46, the Alliance 12 and the ACT seven. That
would give the Labor Party and the Alliance 67 seats between them.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one seats are required for forming a government.
</P>
<P>
MMP consists of individual elections in single-member electoral
districts plus an allocation of seats to political parties based
on the total votes won nationwide by each party in a separate
party vote. Each party's share of all the seats in Parliament will
closely reflect its share of the nationwide party vote.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Claims 50 PKK Camps in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- There are currently about 50 camps
of Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in Iran, in which 1,200 PKK rebels
are being trained every year, the local Daily News reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
These PKK militants are being brought to the Turkish border by
military planes belonging to Iran, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officers are training PKK guerrillas in northern Iraq,
said the paper, adding that Iranian intelligence service Savama
agent Agay Muhammedi is responsible for maintaining coordination
between the PKK camps in Iran and northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that Iran has given 900,000 U.S. dollars
to the PKK from 1995 until now and also given logistic support to
PKK militants.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels has also been receiving logistic support from
Iran's Maku-Dambat district which the PKK regards as a storage
area, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meawhile, the paper said that Iran failed to obey an
agreement between Turkey and Iran signed on April 6, 1999 for a
simultaneous and joint operation against the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Iran and Turkey were strained when Iran claimed
that Turkish warplanes hit an Iranian military post and tents
belonging to Iranian tribesmen on July 18.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the bombardment had killed five people
and injured 10 others in the Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and Iranian officials are expected to discuss why
Iran had reportedly allowed the PKK militnats to move into the
Iranian territory during a Tuesday meeting in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been waging a separatist war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
Conflicts between the Turkish security forces and the PKK rebels
have claimed over 37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Investors Keen on Zambian Copper Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The long awaited privatization of
the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) is being monitored
globally with investors keen to see the final disposition of the
mining firm by late 1999 before they invest.
</P>
<P>
Particular interest in the sale of the mining conglomerate was
expressed by the investors from the United States, who watches
closely the developments taking place in Zambia, the Zambia Daily
Mail newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, U.S. based Pangaea/EMI Securities noted
that the delay to sell ZCCM last year resulted in international
investors losing more than 50 percent of the value of their
investments in the Zambian stock market.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the delay to dispose the the mining
conglomerate, the Zambian currency kwacha also fell by over 60
percent in value, said Eric Postel, director of the group which
has offices in Britain, South Africa, Bangladesh, Turkey and
Zambia and is listed on Lusaka Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Postel said on the live global financial news network program,
Bloomberg, that he has had several meetings with investors willing
to re-invest in Zambia if the remaining mine sales were concluded
this year and good governance prevailed.
</P>
<P>
Bloomberg financial news, which is broadcast live via cable and
internet and reaches the desks of more than 10,000 traders,
brokers and investors around the world, attempted to describe a
number of positive developments taking place in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, talks are presently going on between the Zambian
government negotiating team and Anglo-American Corporation and the
South American Chilean based Codelco to finalize the ZCCM sale
deal, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> UAE Introduces New Rules on Safe Use of Tents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The government of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) has imposed strict rules on the use of large
tents for weddings and other big gatherings to ensure the safety
of people.
</P>
<P>
The regulations have been drawn up in the wake of a wedding
tragedy in Saudi Arabia, in which more than 50 people died and
hundreds more injured as fire swept through the tent where
the celebrations were held.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, hundreds of people were lucky to escape
with their lives after a fire swept through two huge marquees
housing mobile markets in the outlying districts of Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
The measures, to be applied throughout the UAE, have been
implemented by the Directorate General of Civil Defense (DGCD) at
the Interior Ministry, the Gulf News daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tents are widely used in Gulf countries on such occasions as
parties, banquets, outings, exhibitions and weddings, said Gharib
Shaban, an official of the DGCD.
</P>
<P>
"Tents can catch fire easily, and this could result in many
deaths," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the tents can accommodate 200 people and others 2,000
at a time, and ignorance could lead to the loss of these lives, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, all traders and hiring companies are
required to only supply tents made of fireproof materials. They
should also be resistant to heavy winds and excessive heat.
</P>
<P>
Qualified staff members are also required to be present where a
tent is being used.
</P>
<P>
"They should be able to swiftly dismantle tents in an
emergency, be able to use firefighting equipments, and know where
the nearest fire-brigade station is and how to contact it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The regulations will apply not only to tent traders and
dealers, but also to those who use them, even within their own
premises.
</P>
<P>
"Those who fail to comply with the new rules will be dealt
with according to the law," he warned.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
decided to cut down staff at all its missions abroad and at the
headquarters due to lack of fund.
</P>
<P>
Part of the measure would see some of the missions abroad
reduced in staff size to three people and one of them to one
diplomat, the New Vision newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Foreign Minister Eriya Kategaya was quoted as saying in
a policy statement to parliament that the ministry had reduced the
number of activities including travel and hosting of receptions.
</P>
<P>
Foreign service officers, as a result of the new policy, will
now be required to leave their families behind while serving
abroad, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has further addressed the issue of relocation as
well as closing some of the 26 embassies and sell off some of the
buildings.
</P>
<P>
Most of the missions are in deplorable state and require 5.3
billion shillings (four million U.S. dollars) to maintain and
renovate.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has difficulty in paying rent, salaries and
allowances to foreign service workers and owes international and
regional organizations 7.9 billion shillings or six million
dollars.

Australian Prime Minister John Howard told reporters the change

LUSAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will launch an import
monitoring scheme to ensure that goods imported into the country
are of acceptable standards.
</P>
<P>
Acting director of the Zambia Bureau of Standards Mataa

electrical appliances, were of inferior standards and in most
cases imitations.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police in Sesheke
bordering Namibia are holding 19 suspected rebels from Namibia,
Angola and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Both Sesheke police and district council secretary Martin
Mutale confirmed the arrests made last week, Zambia Daily Mail
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police said they are holding them because they did not possess
any form of identity to determine their nationality.
</P>
<P>
Eleven of them are women and most of them are from Angola and
Namibia and others are Zambian women married in Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The suspected rebels were running away from sporadic gunfire
which rocked Caprivi Strip of Namibia last Monday when the
Namibian government forces exchanged gunfire with secessionists in
the narrow strip bordering Botswana, Angola and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Zambian Western province Deputy Minister Michael
Mabenga has warned Zambians especially those of the province not
to be involved in any fighting in Caprivi Strip because Namibia is
a sovereign independent state.
</P>
<P>
He said all peace-loving Zambians should not be involved in
supporting rebel groups against a legitimately elected government.
</P>
<P>
Mabenga said Zambia does not in any way support secession of
Caprivi Strip and condemns those calling for secession.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Names Kremlin Darling as New Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Monday sacked the cabinet of Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin and
replaced him with Vladimir Putin, director of the powerful Federal
Security Service and secretary of the top advisory Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Putin's quick ascent from a career intelligence officer to a
Kremlin darling was attributed to his ability to make tough
decisions, his authority with the power structures, and his
loyalty to the Kremlin establishment.
</P>
<P>
Monday's reshuffle is the second government sacking this year
since former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov lost his job last May.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has asked the State Duma, or lower house of parliament,
to confirm Putin as prime minister, the presidential press service
said.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, who met Yeltsin and learned of his dismissal early
Monday, described Putin as "a decent, worthy man" and wished him "
luck, just luck."
</P>
<P>
Luck Putin really needs. He is the fifth man to be named
premier by Yeltsin in about a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin's ouster is believed to be a result of his failure to
effectively stop, or control, the alliance formed last week
between the "Fatherland" movement led by Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
and the "All Russia" bloc of powerful regional governors.
</P>
<P>
The All Russia-Fatherland alliance would put the Kremlin in
major disadvantage in the parliamentary elections late this year
and the presidential race next June.
</P>
<P>
Replacing Stepashin with Putin would apparently strengthen the
Kremlin's hand in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow News weekly had earlier speculated that the State
Duma would never approve Putin as prime minister, which would
prompt Yeltsin to disband the lower house of parliament and then
quickly resign, leaving Putin as the acting president.
</P>
<P>
Putin graduated from the law department of the Leningrad State
University in 1975 and began his career with the Foreign
Intelligence Service of the Soviet State Security Committee, or
KGB.
</P>
<P>
After a long assignment in Germany, Putin became deputy head
for International Affairs of the Leningrad State University.
</P>
<P>
Putin served as deputy head of the Kremlin Property Department
in 1996-1997 and head of Kremlin's Chief Control Department in
1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed head of the Federal Security Service, the main
successor to the KGB, in July 1998 and secretary of the Security
Council in March 1999.

Rafidah said Malaysia's total trade with South countries
increased more than four-fold from 20.9 billion ringgit (about
5.5 billion dollars) in 1990 to 90.4 billion ringgit (about 23.8
billion dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The minister said there was a scope for wider trade between
Malaysia and South countries as many Malaysian products are
already well received in international markets and with the
current depreciated ringgit, there is potential for these
countries to source Malaysian products.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, with the increasing cost of importing products from
developed countries, there are opportunities for South countries
to market their products here, she added.
</P>
<P>
Through the familiarization program, the six consecutive one
organized by the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority,
Malaysia can share its development experiences in the promotion
and coordination of investments and the management of industrial
developments with investment promotion agencies from South
countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
The program this year attracted 67 registered participants from
31 countries of Africa, South America, West Indies, the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), ASEAN, Middle East and
the Pacific Islands.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia remains committed to South-South cooperation based on
the desire to contribute to mutual prosperity, and technical
cooperation will continue to be implemented by Malaysia as a
useful tool to promote South-South cooperation, Rafidah said.

<P>
The ground cracked as a result of a summer storm which lasted
about two hours in Shagou village of Jingyang county, about 30

</P>
<P>
Local geologists have rushed to the site for field research,
who said the fissure runs across the whole village, and is of

<P>
The land fissure is a typical geological phenomenon in joint

Local officials said the villagers will be relocated to ensure
their safety and a new village site has been chosen for the

<P>
However, the villagers are still living in some makeshift
houses since the local government said it will take some time to
raise the over 800,000 yuan in relocation funds.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Announces State Duma Election Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Monday signed a decree announcing December 19 as the date for
elections to the State Duma, or lower house of parliament, the
Kremlin press service said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the election date effectively opens the
election campaign and dissipates rumors that Yeltsin could
postpone the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
It came after the dismissal of the cabinet of Prime Minister
Sergei Stepashin and nomination of Vladimir Putin as the new
premier earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin's ouster is believed to a result of his failure to
effectively stop, or control, the alliance formed last week
between the "Fatherland" movement led by Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
and the "All Russia" bloc of powerful regional governors.
</P>
<P>
The All Russia-Fatherland alliance would put the Kremlin in
major disadvantage in the parliamentary elections and the
presidential race next June.
</P>
<P>
Before his Monday appointment, the 46-year-old Putin has been
serving as heads of the Federal Security Service, the main
successor to the Soviet KGB, and the Security Council, a top
advisory body.

<P>
The center is a 10-storey building with two large spherical

called "China: The Next 50 Years," and will focus on business
opportunities and challenges, economic issues, and practical
realities related to conducting business in China today and in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai forum is expected to be the most important yet,
since the annual event was initiated in 1995. Previous forums were

<HEADLINE> Philippine Congress Urged to Raise Pay For Govt Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada on Monday urged Congress to back the government's plan to
increase pay for more than one million government employees next
year.
</P>
<P>
A presidential statement released here said the
5.2-billion-peso (130 million U.S. dollars) outlay, which is
included in the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of 651 billion
pesos (1.6 billion dollars) next year, has been submitted to
Congress to cover adjustments in the salaries for 821,376 civilian
employees and 263,185 uniformed and military personnel.
</P>
<P>
"These compensation and benefit enhancement measures are
intended to improve the bureaucracy's productivity and
performance," the statement quoted Estrada as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Averaging 10 percent, the salary upgrading will be implemented
during the last four months of 2000," Estrada said in his budget
message to Congress.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president vowed to make the massive
administration body "lean and more effective." As a result, the
number of government personnel will fall from 1,099,817 this year
to 1,098,775 in 2000, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The steady drop in general overhead expenses would also be
sustained, he said, from a 20.8-percent share of the 1998 budget
to 11.1 percent this year to a lower 10 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he explained, the 7.3 percent growth in personal
services expenditure from 1999 to 2000 remains the lowest since
1994 despite salary increases.
</P>
<P>
"By limiting the growth of personal services expenditures, we
would be able to rationalize budgetary costs so that we can
provide more employees benefits and increase funds for our basic
services," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- People connected with the tourist
industry gathered here today to refute Lee Teng-hui's splittist
statements.
</P>
<P>
Sun Gang, deputy head of the National Tourism Administration,
said at the meeting that Lee Teng-hui's "two states" remark
revealed his splittist desire, and has damaged the basis for
promotion of cross-straits relations and the reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Sun said, "We greatly treasure the present situation of cross-
straits relations fostered over the past decades."
</P>
<P>
He added that between 1988 and 1998, the number of Taiwan
compatriots coming to the mainland as tourists and for visiting
relatives reached 14.66 million, and in the first half of this
year, the number of arrivals by Taiwan compatriots was 1.23
million, up 19.52 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Sun pointed out that criticism of the "two states" remark is
directed at Lee Teng-hui and a small number of splittists in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that "we welcome more Taiwan compatriots to visit
the famous scenic spots in inland areas, and we will ensure their
legitimate rights and interests."
</P>
<P>
During today's meeting, representatives from the tourism
association, hotel association, and travel agencies expressed

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- More Falun Gong practitioners in
China have broken away from the cult, saying that they have been
fooled by its founder Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
Song Xiujuan, head of the Falun Gong instruction station in the
northwestern city of Xi'an, vowed that she will have no more to do
with the cult.
</P>
<P>
She also called on fellow practitioners to see through the
political nature of the cult and the grave harm it caused the
country, and wake up from blind faith.
</P>
<P>
Many more people like Song across China have repented since the
government banned the cult last month.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 people gathered in the northeastern city of Anshan to
denounce the cult, and turned in various publications related to
Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
In the cities of Tangshan and Changchun large numbers of former
Falun Gong practitioners have also cut their ties with the cult.
</P>
<P>
As for those who still can't see the evil face of Li Hongzhi
and his Falun Gong, there are "help units" to assist them.
</P>
<P>
The coastal city of Tianjin has set up about 3,500 such units
in the neighborhoods and they are proving quite effective.
</P>
<P>
In Hohhot, capital of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
hundreds of former practitioners now realize their errors in
believing in Li Hongzhi and his Falun Gong, and have broken away
from the cult.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank announced
here today that foreign banks in Shanghai and Shenzhen are now
allowed to engage in yuan-based business in more localities, as
some restrictions concerning the scale of such business have been
eased as well.

A source from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said that the
latest decision aims to increase foreign banks' yuan funding
source and promote the healthy development of their yuan business.

</P>
<P>

The ratio of foreign banks' yuan debt to foreign exchange debt
has been raised from 35 percent to 50 percent, and for the first
time foreign banks are allowed to do interbank transactions in the
yuan.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, foreign banks doing yuan business are
required to charge obligation and management fees when organizing

which is Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping
Theory.
</P>
<P>
Cao held that what Li Hongzhi and his illegal organization
Falun Gong did has severely trampled the relevant laws of China,
and that Li should bear civil liability for Falun Dafa's role in
causing a large number of practitioners to lose their lives.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guoming, vice president of the Shanghai Academy of Social
Sciences, said that Li Hongzhi used his Falun Gong cult to stir up
followers to attack the government, newspapers, and TV stations
with the purpose of pressuring the Party and the government, which
totally violated Chinese laws.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese citizens should realize their rights according to
legal processes, and not by doing whatever they want to do," said
Shen.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Li Guoji said that Li Hongzhi and his Falun Dafa
Research Society committed crimes, for the society is an illegal
unregistered organization which endangered the safety of the
country and caused the deaths of many people. Because of this, Li
Hongzhi should be severely punished, he said.

<HEADLINE> Stepashin Ouster Plunges Ruble, Cuts Vacations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia's government change Monday
has sent the national currency tumbling to 25.9 rubles to one U.S.
dollar on the currency market and made many politicians to cut
their vacations and rush back to the capital.
</P>
<P>
The ruble closed at 24.8 rubles to one dollar on Friday and
traders had expected it to climb on Monday, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
The Prime-Tass news agency quoted a representative from the
Kommertsbank as saying that in spite of the Central Bank's
interference with huge dollar injections "the banks are still
aggressively inclined to buy dollars."
</P>
<P>
"It can be said that the market is dominated by panic," the
representative said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian State Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov is
calling an emergency meeting of parliamentary faction leaders
Monday evening. He is interrupting his vacation near St.
Petersburg for discussions of a letter sent him by Yeltsin
reporting the dismissal of the Cabinet of Sergei Stepashin and
requesting the lower house of parliament's approval of Vladimir
Putin as the country's new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov said that the date for an extraordinary Duma session
for discussions of the president's nomination will be set at the
meeting Monday evening. The Duma is currently in recess.
</P>
<P>
By law, the Duma should do this within one week.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov refused to comment on the reasons behind the cabinet
dismissal, saying that he does not yet know the details, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin's ouster is believed to be a result of his failure to
effectively stop, or control, the alliance formed last week
between the "Fatherland" movement led by Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
and the "All Russia" bloc of powerful regional governors.
</P>
<P>
The All Russia-Fatherland alliance would put the Kremlin in
major disadvantage in the parliamentary elections late this year
and the presidential race next June.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev ended his vacation on Monday,
along with numerous heads of departments in his ministry.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who was to start his vacation
Monday, is also expected to return to work, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, who met Yeltsin and learned of his ouster earlier
Monday, said the three months he was in office "were not wasted"
and that his cabinet "managed to keep the situation in Russia
under control."
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with cabinet members following his dismissal,
Stepashin said, "There was confidence in us, belief that there is
a civilized, uncorrupted government."
</P>
<P>
He said he realized this during his recent visits to the United
States and Sarajevo, Bosnia, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin said he "openly expressed my attitude regarding my
dismissal to Boris Yeltsin."
</P>
<P>
"However, that is his right, he is the president, he is the
supreme commander-in-chief," Stepashin said stressing that he was
and will remain with "the president to the end."
</P>
<P>
"I am grateful to this man for bringing me, a boy, into big-
time politics," Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
He described acting head of government Vladimir Putin as "a
decent, worthy person" and wished him "luck, just luck."
</P>
<P>
And luck Putin needs. The 46-year-old Putin, who headed the
Federal Security Service and the Security Council, is the fifth
man to be appointed prime minister in about one year and a half.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Journalists Back After Detainment by Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Three Ugandan journalists, who
were detained for nine hours over the weekend by the rebels of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), have been back safe and sound.
</P>
<P>
A source with the government-sponsored New Vision daily told
Xinhua in a telephone interview that Emmy Allio, a journalist who
writes mostly about the Congo war, has been back from Kisangani in
northern Congo.
</P>
<P>
"He is back and will come to work in his office this
afternoon," the source said.
</P>
<P>
"He was held for nine hours by Rwanda-backed rebels of the
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) during the weekend clashes
between the RCD-Goma and Ugandan troops," she added.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision newspaper reported Monday that Emmy Allio,
together with two other Ugandan journalists, were picked up from
their hotel at 9:20 a.m. Saturday soon after the street battle
began.
</P>
<P>
They allegedly went there to cover the planned visit of
Zambian-led regional ministers touring areas controlled by various
rebel groups fighting Kinshasa government.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan military sources were quoted as saying that Ugandan
troops suffer minor causalities during the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The RCD split on May 19 this year into two groups: Wamba dia
Wamba based in Kisangani backed by Uganda and Emile Illunga group
based in Congolese east town of Goma with support from Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The internal split led to the failure of rebels to sign the
Lusaka cease- fire agreement and cast shadows over the fragile
Congo peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart
Pasteur Bizimungu are in Pretoria at the invitation of South
African President Thabo Mbeki to iron out their differences.

<HEADLINE> China to Promote Reproductive Health Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- China has been cooperating with
the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF) to provide better
reproductive health service to people of fertility age and
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
As a project, the Contraceptive Service Center of the State
Family Planning Committee is cooperating with the UNPF to promote
the sale of contraceptive pills and devices in China.
</P>
<P>
Sales promotions for contraceptives are still a new concept in
China, where pills and other methods of contraception have been
distributed for free among married couples and people of fertility
age, said Zhang Yuqin, deputy director of the State Family
Planning Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that easy access to contraceptives and their
effectiveness is important for promoting better reproductive
service. Sales of contraceptives can meet the needs of people of
fertility age, and can also prevent the spread of sexually-
transmitted diseases including AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Since the project was launched in November 1998, market
research has been conducted in pilot areas, and enterprises have
been chosen to produce quality condoms.
</P>
<P>
The next step will be to start the promotion of contraceptives
in pilot areas, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Population Fund has invested 14 million U.S.
dollars in China to run a number of reproductive health and family
planning projects, and these project were expected to conclude by
the end of next year.

<HEADLINE> New Philippine Air Terminal to Boost Tourism: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Monday the opening of the Ninoy Aquino International
Airport (NAIA) Centennial Terminal 2 will boost the tourism
industry and strengthen investors' confidence in the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration of the new airport facility,
Estrada said the construction of the terminal was part of his
administration's efforts to make air travel in the country
globally competitive and put the nation back on the growth path.
</P>
<P>
The NAIA-2, a V-shaped terminal with a total floor area of
73,000 square meters, will be the new home for the nation's flag
carrier, Philippine Airlines (PAL), to spare more parking space at
the Manila Domestic Airport for other local airlines.
</P>
<P>
The 5.3-billion-peso (130 million U.S. dollars) terminal was
designed to accommodate 9 million passengers annually, or twice
the capacity of the old Manila Domestic Airport.
</P>
<P>
The NAIA-2 terminal will also house a section for international
flights to ease the current congestion at the NAIA-1 terminal.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the construction of the 65-hectare
NAIA-3 terminal is now in progress and is expected to be completed
in 2001. This terminal will replace the existing international
passenger terminal.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Publishing houses affiliated to
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have produced a series of books
recently advocating materialism and atheism, and criticizing Falun
Gong's advocacy of superstition and pseudo-science.
</P>
<P>
An 8-volume series entitled "Chinese People Should Wake up--the

as organizing his followers to oppose science, society, and the
government.
</P>
<P>
Another book, "100 Anti-superstition Stories," a production of
the PLA Publishing House, upholds the high spirit of the ancient
Chinese people fighting against ghosts by selecting 100 pithy
stories from Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, the Public Security Bureau in the city of Anshan
in northeast China's Liaoning Province has cracked down on the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The latest survey by the State
Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision shows that the quality
of shirts produced in China has been improving since early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted in the second quarter this year, involved
some 171 brands of shirts made by 196 enterprises in Beijing,
Tianjin, Shanghai, Zhejiang Province, and eight other Chinese
regions.
</P>
<P>
It was found that 86.8 percent of the surveyed products, or 145
brands, are of good quality, while the other 26 brands were
determined to be substandard products.
</P>
<P>
A similar survey in 1998 showed that 85.2 percent of the shirts
were of good quality, compared with 68.9 percent in 1996, 74.7
percent in 1993, and 71.9 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has told major department stores to improve their
quality-control systems, as 25 of the 26 substandard brands can be
found in these stores.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, China's 3,000-plus shirt
manufacturers produced 1.64 billion shirts in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Parliament Enacts Flag-Anthem Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Diet (parliament) on Monday
enacted a bill to legally recognize the Hinomaru as the country's
national flag and "Kimigayo" as the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
The House of Councilors (upper house) passed the bill in its
plenary session with the support of the Liberal Democratic Party,
its coalition partner the Liberal Party (LP) and the New Komeito
party.
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)
submitted an alternative bill that would only recognize the
Hinomaru, but the bill was voted down.
</P>
<P>
The law, which will come into force Friday, consists of two
articles, one for the flag and the other the anthem, and has no
clauses obliging the public to show respect for them or
stipulating punishment for not doing so.
</P>
<P>
The Hinomaru (the rising sun) and "Kimigayo," unofficially
translated as "his majesty's reign," have served as Japan's de
facto national symbols since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
The question of whether to legally recognize them has been
sensitive because of their links to Japan's Imperial system and
wartime militarism.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government began studying legislation on the flag
and the anthem in early March, following the suicide February 28
of a high school principal in Hiroshima Prefecture, western Japan.
</P>
<P>
The principal had been ordered by the prefectural board of
education to hoist the flag and have the anthem sung at the school
's graduation ceremony February 29, while teachers at the school
had opposed the idea, especially the singing of "Kimigayo."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Advised Not to Relax Currency Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia should not relax
currency controls until its financial system has been
restructured, an Islamic Development Bank official said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"My advise to Malaysia is not to do away with exchange
restrictions until the financial market has been restructured to
make it difficult for speculators to play around," Mabid Ali
Al-Jarhi, director of Islamic Development Bank's Islamic research
and training institute told reporters after the opening of the
three-day International Conference On Islamic Economics in the
21st Century.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia imposed the currency controls in early September last
year following the sharp fall of the stock market due to alleged
attacks by speculators.
</P>
<P>
The official described the currency controls as the only way to
resolve problems at the time of financial crisis, but cautioned
that this approach should be lifted after one or two years.
</P>
<P>
Since (currency) control is necessary as the first step, the
second step is to study the market structure, he said, adding that
in this case, policy-makers must study the rules to make it
difficult for speculators to come in as well as minimize the free
flow of funds or "hot money" into the country for the development
of an orderly market.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that in restructuring the capital market, Malaysia
adopt an Islamic financial model that can justify between
investment and economic growth, saying an Islamic financial system
has its investments based on profit sharing, not short-term
speculation.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Names Putin Preferred Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said Monday that Vladimir Putin, the newly appointed prime
minister, is his choice who should succeed him in the Kremlin in
2000.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to the nation, Yeltsin told the Russians
that the presidential elections will go ahead as scheduled in
about a year and that Putin will be able to consolidate the
Russian society at the turn of the century and "renew great Russia.
"
</P>
<P>
Putin, director of the powerful Federal Security Service and
secretary of the top advisory Security Council, replaced outgoing
Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin in another surprise government
shakeup announced by Yeltsin earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin thanked Stepashin for his "good work" during the three
months heading the government.
</P>
<P>
"I decided to call a man, who in my opinion is able to
consolidate society and, leaning on the broadest political forces,
to ensure the continuation of reforms in Russia," Yeltsin said,
referring to Putin.
</P>
<P>
"He will be able to rally behind him those who are to renew
great Russia in the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
"Working in this high post, he will be of much use to the
country, and the Russians will have possibility to access the
human and business qualities of Putin," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Putin's quick ascent from a career intelligence officer to a
Kremlin darling was attributed to his ability to make tough
decisions, his authority with the power structures, and his
loyalty to the Kremlin establishment.
</P>
<P>
Monday's reshuffle is the second government sacking this year
since the former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov lost his job last
May. Putin is the fifth premier Yeltsin has named in about a year
and a half.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has asked the State Duma, or lower house of parliament,
to confirm Putin as prime minister, the presidential press service
said.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, who met Yeltsin and learned of his dismissal early
Monday, described Putin as "a decent, worthy man" and wished him "
luck, just luck," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin's ouster is believed to be a result of his failure to
effectively stop, or control, the alliance formed last week
between the "Fatherland" movement led by Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
and the "All Russia" bloc of powerful regional governors.
</P>
<P>
The All Russia-Fatherland alliance would put the Kremlin in
major disadvantage in the parliamentary elections late this year
and the presidential race next June.
</P>
<P>
Replacing Stepashin with Putin would apparently strengthen the
Kremlin's hand in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow News weekly had earlier speculated that the State
Duma would never approve Putin as prime minister, which would
prompt Yeltsin to dismiss the lower house of parliament and then
quickly resign, leaving Putin as the acting president.
</P>
<P>
Putin graduated from the law department of the Leningrad State
University in 1975 and began his career with the Foreign
Intelligence Service of the Soviet State Security Committee, or
KGB.
</P>
<P>
After a long assignment in Germany, Putin became deputy head
for International Affairs of the Leningrad State University.
</P>
<P>
Putin served as deputy head of the Kremlin Property Department
in 1996-1997 and head of Kremlin's Chief Control Department in
1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed head of the Federal Security Service, the main
successor to the KGB, in July 1998 and secretary of the Security
Council in March 1999.

<HEADLINE> China Facing Great Challenges in Combating Drug: Jia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAOTOU, August 9 (Xinhua) -- China has become both a conduit
for international drug trafficking and a consumer of drugs, and
faces greater challenges in combating drug-related crimes than
ever, Minister of Public Security Jia Chunwang said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national meeting on drug control, Jia pointed
out that China can not expect to solve this crisis brought about
by the worldwide flood of drugs in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the police have cracked down
more than 110,000 drug-related cases and arrested nearly 140,000
suspects, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
China has intensified its efforts to combat drugs since 1997,
and has achieved splendid results, he said, noting that a total of
15.4 tons of heroin and 3.9 tons of the synthetic narcotic
methamphetamine, or "ice," have been seized so far in two and a
half years.
</P>
<P>
Jia said China also is making an effort to help drug addicts
quit their habit by establishing and expanding drug rehabilitation
centers. The country has helped 320,000 drug addicts kick their
habit by compulsory means and has reeducated 210,000 through labor
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to Jia, in the 1980s, the drug problem in China was
mainly one of international drug trafficking, and only existed in
limited areas. The problem has become more serious with the spread
of drug abuse nationwide in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China had nearly 600,000 registered
addicts last year, eight times the number in 1990, while the real
number is probably far above that figure.
</P>
<P>
"With expanding domestic drug consumption, illicit drug
trafficking is more serious, and now has organized and violent
tendencies," Jia said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great challenge for China to control the flood of drug
and solve the drug problem," he admitted.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Warns of Possible Repeat of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Monday warned about a possible repeat of the forest fire disaster
that occurred in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"I have received a report on the forest fires in several areas
in (the islands of) Sumatera and Kalimantan and the smog that has
interrupted the people's activities," Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
While opening the 2nd National Coordination Meeting on
Environmental Management at the state palace here, the president
underscored the importance of readiness for all instances to face
the forest fires and their impacts.
</P>
<P>
He said the relevant ministries and agencies should immediately
coordinate in taking measures to prevent the forest fires from
spreading.
</P>
<P>
"No forest fire should occur again due to our carelessness," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said a repeat of the 1997 forest fire disaster would harm
the country's environment all the more.
</P>
<P>
"Our time, thoughts and energy would be wasted," he said.
</P>
<P>
Based on data collected by the Indonesian Outerspace and
Aviation Agency, there are 45 hot spots in Riau, 13 in North
Sumatera, nine in South Sumatera, 14 in West Kalimantan and two in
Central Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has formed a
team which has begun monitoring the smog that has covered Brunei
Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore for the past weeks,
the ASEAN Secretariat said in a press statement available here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, blazes on Kalimantan and Sumatera spread out of
control, and a huge smoke cloud paralyzed the region. The 1997
fires destroyed about 5 million hectares of forest in the country
with an economic loss of about 4 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Manila Takes Action to Help Landslide Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has ordered the Department of Justice to assist residents
of the landslide-hit Cherry Hills subdivision in Antipolo City in
suing the private developer of the housing project.
</P>
<P>
Jesus Remulla, assistant secretary of the presidential
management staff said Monday the president wants to help the
victims recover from the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Remulla, who heads an inter-agency fact-finding committee
created by the President on August 5, was charged to look into the
causes of the tragedy and pinpoint those responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the President, Remulla said the developer of
the Cherry Hills subdivision, along with several government
agencies involved in issuing permits and clearances to the
project, could be held criminally, civilly and administratively
liable for the tragedy which occurred on the night of August 3.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy left scores of people dead and several others
injured and trapped in the rubble caused by the landslide.
</P>
<P>
Remulla said the Justice Department, along with the National
Bureau of Investigation), would also investigate further the
liabilities of government officials and private parties in the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"Who signed the permit? Who inspected the project and approved
it? Those who sign the permit are not the ones who actually
inspect the site because they have a staff to do it for them.
Usually they involve high-ranking officials. So this has to be an
integrated probe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Remulla said, the fact-finding agency has recommended the
rationalization of standards in building housing projects and the
designation of one agency to ensure that developers prevent such
tragedies in the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Carla del Ponte, the Swiss federal prosecutor, will replace
Louise Arbour as the head of the International Criminal Tribunal
for former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. A specialist in anti-mafia files,
the new iron lady has not hesitated in showing her determination
in fighting organized crimes from South American drug traffickers
to the Russian Mafia.
</P>
<P>
-- Yaguine Koita and Fode Tounkara, the two Guineas teenagers
who froze to death in a landing train of a Belgian plane flying
from Africa to Europe last week, were given almost a state funeral
by the Guineas government in Conakry on Sunday. Many of the
Guineas regard the two youths as "martyrs of Africa" and "
spokesman of Africa to deliver a message" to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The annual manifestation of Corsican nationalists, the
Journees Internationales de Corte, which ended on Sunday, showed
that the Corsican nationalists are far away from giving up
violence against the French government. This year's manifestation
was marked by a reaffirmed support to the men who claimed the
assassination of the former Corsican governor Erignac two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
-- Clashes took place on Saturday and Sunday between the French
peace-keeping forces and Kosovar Albanians, who tried to break
into the Serb enclave in the city of Mitrovica in northern Kosovo.
French soldiers stopped Albanians from marching into the Serb
district of the city, separated from the other part of the city by
a bridge which has become a symbol of hatred between the two
ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> China's Financial Circles Criticize Lee's  Separatist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Financial Work Committee of
the Communist Party of China Central Committee held a symposium
here today to criticize the separatist remarks of Taiwan leader
Lee Tung-hui.
</P>
<P>
Participants pointed out that Lee's redefinition of cross-
strait relations as "state-to-state" relations runs counter to the
historical trend, as well as the will of the Chinese people,
including Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Yan Haiwang, deputy secretary of the CPC Central Committee
Financial Work Committee, said that financial workers should
strive for the healthy growth of the national economy and the
increase of national strength in order to contribute to the
peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 prominent bankers, overseas Chinese business moguls,
and other well-known financial figures attended today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
They said that the Chinese nation has historically valued the
concept of unity, and the spirit of opposing separatism has been
imbedded in their blood. Lee will be forsaken by all Chinese
people, including the Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Lee's separatist remarks have also caused outcries from peace-
loving people worldwide, and many countries have reiterated their
endorsement of the "one China" principle.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson Attacks Football "Greed" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United manager Sir Alex
Ferguson has attacked greed in football, saying it is tarnishing
the profession.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme, Ferguson
said spiralling player wages were now "extraordinarily high", with
some earning "unbelievable" amounts.
</P>
<P>
He said: "This thing where greed comes and various other
aspects come out, it does the game no good at all.
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about a small percentage who have let everyone
down, so to speak, they have let their profession down."
</P>
<P>
He sympathised with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger over the "
kick in the teeth" that was the Nicolas Anelka affair.
</P>
<P>
Anelka has been condemned for quitting Arsenal to join Spanish
club Real Madrid for 23.5 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said selling Anelka must have been a "terribly
difficult decision" for Wenger.
</P>
<P>
The Manchester United manager also ruled out ever taking on the
England manager's job, although he said he wanted to keep an "
active role" in football when his contract ends.
</P>
<P>
But he said he would be "delighted" to get out of management,
especially the media commitments the job entails in the modern era.
</P>
<P>
He even hinted he would consider getting involved in politics
once his football career comes to an end.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he had ever considered standing for Parliament he
said: "I don't know enough about politics to get involved in that.
"
</P>
<P>
But he added: "I possibly could, because once you take the
challenge of something then it changes your whole perspective of
things."
</P>
<P>
Sir Alex also said he "wouldn't put a penny" on Manchester
United playing in this season's FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
He said the reaction to United's withdrawal from the
competition had "frustrated him" and accused the government and FA
of taking a "back step" after public outcry at the move.
</P>
<P>
The club took what it thought was the "best decision for
English football", he said.
</P>
<P>
The interview came amid reports that Ferguson is to be
questioned by detectives investigating the 40,000 pounds he was
given by a foreign agent, allegedly during the sale of Andrei
Kanchelskis to Everton.
</P>
<P>
The manager said: "The best thing a manager can do now, and
this is going to be very important, is don't get involved in the
money side of it, because I am sure the temptation is going to be
there."

<HEADLINE> China Expedition Detects Inversion Layer above Arctic Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, August 9 (Xinhua)-- A thick inversion layer,
which is believed to accelerate the melting of sea ice in summer
and enlarge the ice area in winter, has been detected at low
levels above the Arctic Ocean by the scientists of China's first
Polar expedition.
</P>
<P>
Professor Qu Shaohou of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics
attached to the Chinese Academy of Sciences was in charge of the
experiment.
</P>
<P>
The scientists indicate that the inversion layer was detected
above a floating ice area at 73.26 degrees north latitude and 164.
59 degrees west longitude. In the 180 meters thick inversion layer,
temperature increases by one degree Centigrade every ten meters.
</P>
<P>
According to the scientists, eight experiments lasting a total
of 20 hours were carried out to detect atmospheric temperature.
</P>
<P>
Qu explained that the inversion layer is different from the
troposphere, where temperatures decline as height increases. About
40 to 50 percent of the heat from the sun is reflected by the ice,
warming the atmosphere and resulting in the inversion layer.
</P>
<P>
The layer, referred to by scientists as a "quilt," is a unique
feature of the Polar atmosphere, said Qu.
</P>
<P>
The inversion layer is the major element affecting the weather
of the Arctic Ocean, and is of great importance for the study of
global climate changes. Qu indicated that they will continue with
inversion layer experiments over the coming weeks.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong: Illegal Organization with Cult Features (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Falun Gong is an illegal
organization with every feature of a cult, according to a signed
article.
</P>
<P>
The world has witnessed many cults since the 1970s, some of
which have engendered a series of mass suicides and attacks on
society, such as the suicides of more than 900 people of the
California-based People's Temple in Guyana in South America some
20 years ago, the more than 80 people of a sect led by David
Koresh who burned to death in Texas in the United States during a
government raid in 1993, and dozens of people of the Sun Temple
who killed themselves in Canada, Switzerland, and France, among
other places, An Wenru's article said.
</P>
<P>
A cult is not religion, but a kind of evil force in the
disguise of religion, the article said. Usually, it distorts
religious doctrine, makes up so-called principles, and deifies its
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The crimes committed by cults include extortion, exploitation,
injuries, and even deaths and break-up of families. They also
spread rumors of things like "Doomsday" to create chaos and
disorder.
</P>
<P>
"Cult leaders' inflated desires for power are destined to
result in political forces that are anti-government and anti-State,
" the article said.
</P>
<P>
In essence, cults are evil forces that are against the tenets
of conventional religions, and against society, the government,
and the people, making them very dangerous to society.
</P>
<P>
"In recent weeks, China's religious circles have talked a lot
about this. After comparing cults with Falun Gong, they have
concluded that Falun Gong is an illegal organization with every
feature of cults," the article noted.
</P>
<P>
Cults are against science and promote superstition and pseudo-
science, the article said. Li Hongzhi, founder of Falun Gong,
proclaimed that he doesn't accept modern science and all
scientific achievements, though he included some scientific
jargons in his preachings.
</P>
<P>
Li, by taking advantage of the unexplained phenomenon of the
world, has promoted mythism, and boasted that his Falun Dafa
represents the most profound and superb science in the world, and
that only through Falun Dafa can people know and change the world.
</P>
<P>
Li also claimed that illness is actually the result of
offenses left over from previous lives, and can only be cured
through practicing Falun Dafa. This has actually deprived
practitioners of their rights to life and health, the article said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Approves Troop Deployment in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has approved the deployment of soldiers to the riverine
areas of Ondo State following the escalation of the ethnic
conflict between Ijaw-Arogbo and Ugbo-Ilaje communities in the
southeast.
</P>
<P>
Ondo State Governor Chief Adebayo Adefarati said in a broadcast
at the weekend that the measure became necessary because of the
failure of the two parties to respect the peace agreement signed
two days ago, The Punch newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sad to say that the situation has seriously deteriorated
in the past two days," the governor noted, adding that "unless
there is a cease- fire within 24 hours from this time of my
broadcast, the security forces would be deployed as they have been
put on the red alert."
</P>
<P>
The paper said that about 300 people were feared dead since
renewed hostilities broke out in the area two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Nigerian government's warning of armed intervention
in the Ijaw/Ilaje conflict, fresh violence reportedly erupted
between the two communities in the early hours of Sunday, the
paper added.
</P>
<P>
The government's warning was reiterated by General Officer
Commanding 2nd Mechanized Division Major General Ekpo Archibong,
who held a closed door meeting with representatives of the two
communities Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He told the press after the meeting that he was sent by
President Obasanjo to find a lasting solution to the ethnic
conflict in the area.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Pipeline Vandalization Catches New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Like a recurring vengeance, another
pipeline vandalization caused flames, killing at least one person
and hurting two in Mosogar, Nigeria's southern Delta State Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place in a place only a short stop from Jesse
of the state where about 1,000 residents died in a similar
pipeline fire on October 17 last year, the Guardian newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Three persons were known to have been hurt in the Mosogar fire
Sunday night. One identified as only Sabe was burnt beyond
recognition and was lying by a charred Mitsibushi bus near the
flaming pipeline, less than one kilometer from the vandalized pit
valve that caught fire at Jesse last year.
</P>
<P>
Two others, named James Eko and Aboki Eforie respectively, are
on admission at the Sapele Central Hospital, same place where many
victims of the Jesse fire were admitted last year.
</P>
<P>
Area Manager of the Petroleum Products Marketing Company,
Clement Okolie who raced to the scene Sunday, said that it was
another case of pipe vandalization.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 men, women and children who died in the Jesse fire
last year were killed from burns sustained while scooping petrol
from the vandalized pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Okolie said his company effected repairs to two vandalized
pipeline at Oghara and Jameson River creeks a few days ago, only
to be alerted Sunday of the problem at Mosagar.
</P>
<P>
"We only started pumping fuel Saturday. Now, we have to stop,"
said the irate manager.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong: Illegal Organization with Cult Features (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cults are against traditional religions. They are dangerous for
their tendency toward extremism, for fabricating malicious
heresies by mixing together several concepts and teachings
borrowed from religion with superstition, pseudo-science, and
occultism, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong did exactly this by claiming to be able to release
souls from purgatory, it added.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi, who claimed he was the only savior, dominating the
universe and superior to Buddha and Jesus, is the grand ruler of
the Falun Dafa organization, the article pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Falun Dafa Society formed by Li Hongzhi is like a
mysterious underground realm. The organizations under the society
are very systematic in spreading orders from Li Hongzhi and
information via modern communications, it said.
</P>
<P>
Li, like Jim Jones of the People's Temple, and David Koresh,
brainwashed practitioners by ordering them to read his books and
teachings every day. Gradually, these people became entirely
controlled by the Falun Gong organization, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Cults are anti-society, they hate human beings and try to
escape from this life and destroy society and reality. One common
method is to spread the eschatology of human catastrophe, it said.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi claimed that the Earth will explode, and that only
he could postpone the date of doom, and that only Falun Dafa could
save the human race, it added.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "truth, benevolence, and forbearance" espoused by
Falun Dafa was part of the claim that only Li Hongzhi was true,
all the others were fake; only Li Hongzhi was kind, and all the
others were sinful; and that practitioners could only forebear
under Li's control, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Li, wiser than other cultists who were eager for quick success
and instant benefits, said that he has postponed the date of doom
for 30 years with his magic power. As a matter of fact, this claim
has helped him practice his evil activities, giving him plenty of
time and space, it said.
</P>
<P>
Cults are anti-government, and most of their leaders have
political ambitions. They are not contented with being the rulers
of their mysterious realms. They also attempt to take the place of
the government, it added.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi, like other cult leaders, accumulated wealth by
fraud, but he focused more on political activities and created a
political scheme for Falun Gong, it pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Overhaul Health Care Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A rejuvenation of the proposed
Nigerian National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) will alleviate
health problems among Nigerians, Minister of State for Health
Aminat Ndalolo said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mdalolo, who described health as an expensive venture, however,
ruled out a national free health program on the grounds of
democratic immaturity, the Guardian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
She said in eastern Kwara State at the weekend that existing
health programs in Nigeria would be overhauled within a month to
accommodate the downtrodden in the society.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kwara-born minister, even though the planned
health care scheme was initially conceived to take care of civil
servants and private workers, "we want to spread it to everybody,
including the poor masses."
</P>
<P>
She disclosed government's readiness to make available
sophisticated equipment and specialized medical personnel in order
to ensure smooth implementation of the scheme.
</P>
<P>
She also canvassed for the support of Nigerians to ensure the
success of the NHIS.
</P>
<P>
"Let me assure my fellow women in Kwara State in particular,
and the nation in general, that the (Olusegun) Obasanjo
administration is duly committed to improving our lot and giving
the Nigerian women equal opportunities like our male counterparts
in our collective drive to move the nation forward."

<HEADLINE> Putin: No Major Change of Russian Government Makeup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia's newly appointed Prime
Minister, Vladimir Putin, said Monday that all key members of the
previous cabinet would keep their job.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no spontaneous dismissals or appointments," the
Interfax news agency quoted Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old former head of the Federal Security Service and
the Security Council replaced former prime minister Sergei
Stepashin in the fifth government sacking by President Boris
Yeltsin in one year and a half.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to the nation, Yeltsin thanked Stepashin
for his "good work" in the past three months as premier and said
Putin is his preferred successor in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Putin, in response, said he will "undoubtedly run" in the
presidential race scheduled for next June.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expressed his hope that the Russian electorate will
support Putin, whom he described as an individual capable of
consolidating the nation and ensuring the continuation of reforms.
</P>
<P>
"He is capable of uniting around himself those who in the new
21st century will face the task of renewing great Russia," Yeltsin
said.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that in this important capacity he will greatly
benefit the country, and Russians will have the opportunity to
appreciate Putin's human and professional qualities," Yeltsin
said. "I am confident in him, but I want everyone who goes to the
polling stations to make their choice in July 2000 to be confident
in him, too," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Stepashin, a long-time Yeltsin loyalist, was offered
the post of secretary of the Security Council, a position Putin
had occupied since last March.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin was also presented with a number of alternative
proposals during his meeting with Yeltsin early Monday morning,
Interfax quoted sources close to Stepashin as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said that Stepashin "would not accept any
government jobs," noting that "this would be inexpedient in the
current, complex situation."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Jisheng, a 10-year-old Siberian
tiger, recently gave birth to twin cubs in the Beijing Zoo, her
third successful delivery in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Jisheng gave birth to a litter of four cubs in May last year,
and veterinarians have been giving her special care and prescribed
food, which helped her to soon give birth again, in March this
year, before giving birth to the twin cubs at the end of July.
</P>
<P>
Jisheng was given the title "Heroine Mother Tiger" by her
guardians for her record of delivering 21 cubs in seven
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
The two new tiger cubs each weigh over one kilogram and are
healthy and energetic.
</P>
<P>
Siberian tigers are generally larger than other tiger varieties,
and their number has been shrinking in recent years, putting them
on the list of the most protected animals in China.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 tigers of various kinds, including south China tigers
and Sumatran tigers, have been born in the Beijing Zoo, and the
first successful breeding of a Siberian tiger was in 1956.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong: Illegal Organization with Cult Features (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li Hongzhi described the earth as a "dustbin" of the universe,
and society an awful mess. He said that no government can solve
the problem, and that current social norms can only make things
worse. The only way to escape is to do as Li Hongzhi said, and
establish an Elysium dominated by him, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi got some intellectuals from the Chinese Communist
Party and civil servants to function as his political consultants,
it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Li stole information from government organizations through his
followers, and thought of ways to oppose the Party and the
government, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Li stirred up his followers to attack press organizations and
governments, to pressure the Party and government, and threaten
legal authority, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Li knew clearly that he is doomed to fail, and he searched for
backing overseas, aiming to leave an escape hatch for himself, as
well as preparing to oppose the government for the long term.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out, the direct result of cults is to
severely damage the body and mind of those who believe in them.
The latest information shows that Falun Gong has caused the deaths
of over 2,000 practitioners. Falun Gong also organized over 300
besieges around press organizations and governments since April 25.
</P>
<P>
"From this point, Falun Gong has a more obvious political
purpose than common cults, and that is the basis for calling Falun
Gong an illegal organization with every cult feature," the article
stressed.

<P>
The article also noted that ordinary Falun Gong practitioners
must separate themselves from its key members, who harbor evil
political purposes. The majority of Falun Gong practitioners
wished for good health, and didn't have a clear understanding of
the evil political ambitions of Falun Gong, let alone its cult
feature, it added.
</P>
<P>
Once they realized the true features of the organization, they
separated from it, the article said, calling on the entire society
to give them a hand.
</P>
<P>
The article stressed that though China has eradicated cults
since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
people should still remain vigilant toward the emergence of cults
in "modern" forms.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Interest Rates Rise No Big Threat to Thai Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai economy is unlikely to
be seriously affected by the expected U.S. move of raising its
short-term interest rates, the official Thai News Agency (TNA)
quoted a senior official from Thailand's central bank as saying
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kiattisak Meecharoen, Bank of Thailand's assistant governor,
was quoted by TNA as saying that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board
(FED) was expected to announce its decision to raise short-term
interest rates after its meeting on August 24.
</P>
<P>
The move, aiming to curb the upbeat of the U.S. economy, was
believed to have less effects on the Thai economy, as demand from
Thailand's other key trading partners, including Japan and the
European Union (EU), was still strong as their economies are
steadily reviving from the downturn, Kiattisak said.
</P>
<P>
The economic recovery of Thailand would not just depend on
exports and other factors, namely, domestic demand and increasing
consumers' purchasing power, also count, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Finance Ministry is creating an environment to
enhance consumers' demand and purchasing power through strategic
initiatives, while maintaining low interest rates to reduce
production costs and stimulate economic activities.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the rising of U.S. interest rates
would somewhat lower Thailand's exports, like those of other
countries, as Washington is a key market for Thai exporters.

LUANDA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Angola's soft drink production of
about 602, 000 hectoliters (hundred liters) in the first half of
1999 was three times of the 200,000 hectoliters in the same period
of 1998, the Journal of Angola newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Soft drink "Covic", made in Cabinda, a northwest enclave in
Angola, created a miracle with its production over 500,000
hectoliters, ranking first in the list of Angola's gas beverage
production.
</P>
<P>
Cuca BGI, a famous beer brand in Angola, ranks the second in
the list, with a supply to market of 328,000 hectoliters,
decreasing by 25 percent from the amount in the second half of
1998 (450,000 hectoliters).
</P>
<P>
The first half of 1999 saw sharp falls in the production of
other brand beers. The outputs of Sorea and Frasal were less than
8,000 hectoliters, while Sefa stopped its production.
</P>
<P>
But wines are still popular in the country, with a growth rate
of 264 percent as compared with the production in the second half
of 1998.  Wine producing companies, such as Cifal and Sofogor,
had revenues of 76 billion and 440 million readjusted kwanza

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Develop Communications System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- African countries have been urged
to make efforts to develop an efficient and continent-wide
transport and communications system.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Minister of Foreign Affairs Keli Walubita said here
Monday that an efficient and continent-wide transport and
communications system is vital to improving the Africa's
competitive edge in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the call at a luncheon in honor of Kingsiey
Amoako, Undersecretary-General of the United Nations and the
Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA).
</P>
<P>
Walubita said that the provision of infrastructure services is
also central to poverty reduction. The lack of access to
infrastructure is a real welfare issue, particularly in the rural
areas where poverty is most predominant.
</P>
<P>
Adequate infrastructure such as feeder roads, access to safe
drinking water and sanitation, electrification and irrigation, is
essential to successful rural transformation and agricultural
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Commission for Africa has an important role to
play in Africa's development in the economic, social and
environmental spheres, said Walubita.
</P>
<P>
The ECA played a pivotal role in the establishment of the
preferential trade area for east and southern African states
(PTA), which has now been transformed into the Common Market for
East and Southern African States (COMESA), the largest economic
integration grouping in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The minister further noted that Africa cannot hope to benefit
from open regionalism without the involvement of the ECA.
</P>
<P>
The ECA should also promote international cooperation for
African debt relief, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Amoako is in Zambia for a four-day visit to the country and he
will hold talks with officials of the COMESA during the visit.

SHANGHAI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Wang Liping, chairman of the
Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), met here today with a visiting
delegation of Taiwan's Alliance for the Reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which arrived here last night, issued a written
announcement, criticizing Lee Teng-hui's "two states" remark.
</P>
<P>
It said that Lee's remark seriously disrupted the existing
international order and cross-straits relations, going against the
globally acknowledged "one China" principle, and will not be
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that Lee's "two states" claim only represents
the stance of the Taiwan authorities headed by Lee Teng-hui, but
by no means the will of the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
The delegation members said that they will firmly stick to
China's territorial integrity and the "one China" principle, and
will exchange views with people of all walks of people on the
mainland on the peaceful reunification of China, and express the
Taiwan compatriots' aspirations for peace and reunification.

<HEADLINE> No Plans to Regulate Gold Imports: Indian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- India Monday ruled out any move
to regulate gold imports in the wake of a sharp increase in the
flow of the yellow metal from abroad in recent months.
</P>
<P>
"Under the present policy, gold imports are permitted. So you
can not prevent people from importing," Finance Minister Yashwant
Sinha told reporters here Monday.
</P>
<P>
With continued decline of gold prices in the global market,
India's gold imports shot up 230 percent to 80 tons in June from
24 tons recorded in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Gold imports went down in India in the first few months of the
current financial year, allegedly for the increase of duty the
finance minister had brought about in his budget in April, the
first month of the financial year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve Bank of India, during the first
quarter of the current fiscal year, gold imports stood at 187
tons, 32 percent higher than the 142 tons recorded a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
India is a major gold importer in the world. The country
imported 736 tons of gold in 1997 and 185 tons of gold in 1998.

city of Kisangani Tuesday with a Zambian delegation led by
Zambia's Minister for Presidential Affairs, Eric Silwamba.
</P>
<P>
They are supposed to hold talks with leaders of the Congolese
Rally for Democracy (RCD), the main rebel movement fighting to
overthrow Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The RCD split into two rival factions on May 19 this year. Now
both factions claimed they have the right to sign the Lusaka
accord already inked by the other players in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Congo Liberation Movement (MLC) and six countries
directly involved in the war have signed the document, but the
fractured RCD cannot agree on which faction should sign the
cease-fire accord.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda are believed to back different factions of
the RCD.
</P>
<P>
The main faction of the RCD, headed by Emile Illunga, is based
in Congo's eastern town of Goma and has Rwandan support, while the
other is run from Kisangani with backing from Uganda by Ernest
Wamba dia Wamba.

<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Technical officers from the
Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the People's Armed
Police are using their scientific knowledge to unmask and
criticize the evil nature of Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Chen Qizhi, a leading expert on rocket engines, said that the
earth is only a small planet in the solar system and the beautiful
home of mankind, instead of a "trash station" claimed by Li
Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
He said that scientists have the responsibility to defend and
popularize scientific knowledge and educate people to break away
from superstition.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi's Falun Dafa (another name for Falun Gong) opposes
modern sciences and human civilization, said technical officers at
a naval base, adding that without science and technology they
could not have scored so many achievements in the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jin, a research fellow with the Military Academy of
Medical Sciences of the PLA, said that with the development of
modern medical sciences, most diseases can be cured or controlled.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi's advocacy of cure for diseases through practising
Falun Gong is a sheer fallacy, and has led to a number of deaths,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from further criticizing superstition and pseudo-science,
the technical officers have also made great efforts to popularize
knowledge of science within the armed forces and the general
public.

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientists Urged to Develop Space Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Indian Vice President Krishan
Kant Monday urged scientists to develop advanced indigenous space
technology to safeguard national security, saying space
surveillance systems would dominate future battles.
</P>
<P>
India "should possess indigenously developed technologies
advanced enough to enable us to confidently meet such threats",
Kant said after presenting the Gujar Mal Modi award to noted space
scientist and former chairman of Indian Space Research
Organization U. R. Rao here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Since space technologies play a crucial role in safeguarding
national security, such technologies were needed urgently, he
said, adding that space surveillance systems dominate battles on
land, water and air.
</P>
<P>
Citing the examples of the recent wars in Kosovo and the Gulf,
he said exclusive access to space technologies enabled the United
States and its allies to wage war with very less casualties to
their own side.
</P>
<P>
The Indian vice president cautioned against attempts of
advanced nations to prevent other countries from developing space
technology and monopolize the power and benefits of the
technology.

<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing

Outstanding Youth, headed by Chang Hsin-kang, president of the

China is now at an important juncture when it is carrying forward
the cause pioneered by its revolutionary predecessors and forging
ahead into the future.
</P>

Over the past 50 years, particularly in the 20 years since the
policies of reform and opening were introduced, China has found a
way to build socialism with Chinese characteristics, he said.
China is now deepening its economic restructuring, with its
national strength continuing to grow, and the people's living
standard keeps improving.
</P>
<P>
Li said that over the past two years the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region has successfully implemented the principle
of "One Country, Two Systems". Macao will also return to the
motherland late this year, the vice-premier said. "We have the
determination, the capability and confidence to ultimately settle
the Taiwan issue and realize reunification."

revitalizing the country through education and science, and the on-
going reform in higher education and science and technology.

knowledge of overseas Chinese about China. Li also invited them to
contribute to the development of the mainland.

Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), was
present at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> S. African President Calls for End to Women Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki Monday called for the advancement of women and urged
men to stop abusing women and children.
</P>
<P>
"Today, August 9th is National Women's Day. On this day, as a
nation, we re-commit ourselves to the advancement of women at all
levels of our society," Mbeki said in a televised speech to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
The president asked for an end to the abuse of any violence
against women.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for all of us to end the cycles of abuse and
violence against women and children that have engulfed our
communities."
</P>
<P>
He said special measures have been put in place for the
criminal justice system to deal sensitively with the survivors of
rape. He also asked to speed up the establishment of one-stop
centers for abused women and children.
</P>
<P>
"I would like all South Africans, individually and
collectively, to pause and reflect on the incalculable damage that
this violence has inflicted on our society, the way in which it
reduces us to less than human and destroys the possibility to
rebuild the fabric of our society."
</P>
<P>
South Africa has the highest rape rate in the world, with one
rape case every 26 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki noted that poverty, joblessness, lack of education and
lack of security are among the many problems facing South African
women.
</P>
<P>
"For many years, the majority of women in our country,
particularly in the rural areas and the townships, have borne the
brunt of poverty and hardship. The lives of these women were, and,
indeed, still are, characterized by low levels of literacy and
inequitable access to education, health, housing, water, fuel
sources and employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"Many among the women of this country have experienced
violence, abuse, rape, sexual harassment and are the worst
affected by the scourge of HIV/ AIDS. They daily carry the scars
of their suffering often in solitary silence and without adequate
counselling and support."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki asked for more efforts to curb the spread of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
August 9 was named South Africa's National Women's Day to
commemorate the massive women's march to Pretoria on August 9,
1956 to protest against the discriminative passes law.

KAMPALA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has come back home from a short working visit to South Africa
during which he held talks with his counterparts from Tanzania,
Rwanda and the host country on the Congo issue.
</P>
<P>
The talks took place Sunday afternoon at the Presidential Guest
House in Pretoria and continued well into the night, a press
release from the President's Office said here Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During their discussions, the four leaders reviewed the
progress made so far in the peace process in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) and exchanged views and ideas about how to
advance that process even further.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda are said to have been urged to persuade
rebels in the Congo to sign the Lusaka cease-fire agreement.
Lately, there have been signs of breaking of the accord, posing
the most serious threat to the fragile peace process in the vast
central African country.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that rebels backed by the Rwandan
government exchanged fire with Ugandan troops deployed in
northeastern Congo Saturday and casualties were reported on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda are said to have backed one of the two
factions each, after the main rebel group Congolese Rally for
Democracy split into two factions in mid-May this year.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Taliban militia have
asked Canada to help construct highways and airports as well as
laying railway lines, the News Network International said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A Canadian team recently visited the Afghan capital of Kabul
and held in-depth talks with Taliban officials on the construction
of highways, airports, roads, railway lines and other projects in
the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian team will soon conduct a survey and prepare a
feasibility report, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Muhammad Naeem, an official of Afghanistan's
Bakhtar news agency, as saying that the railway project will be
initiated after holding further talks with the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan has no railway lines and all previous efforts to
have the facility have failed. In the 1970s, a project to lay
railway lines was initiated with the financial support of some
Arab states and Iran. However, it was abandoned with the topple of
the Dawood government.
</P>
<P>
It is still not known who will fund the proposed railway line
project between Canada and Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Prices at 15-year Peak in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada's natural gas prices are
soaring and at a 15-year peak this summer, with consumers facing
an extra charge of up to 5.00 Canadian dollars (about 3.30 U.S.
dollars) a month, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Industry prices for Alberta natural gas have almost doubled
over last August's average, rising 40 percent in the past five
months and jumping past the important 3.00 Canadian dollar (about
1.99 U.S. dollars) barrier the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Although price increases are normal for winter heating bills,
it is quite unusual that natural gas prices are up in summer when
warm weather reduces demand from businesses and homes, according
to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said a combination of factors have created
this summer's rising market.
</P>
<P>
Current tight gas supplies across western Canada and the
prospect of growing demand from the United States this coming
winter have contributed to the unusual mid-year surge, the
newspaper quoted a senior gas-supply planning engineer Timo
Makinen as saying.
</P>
<P>
Other factors resulting in the price hike include a shortage of
gas drilling this year and a heat wave in many parts of North
America, where people used gas-operated air conditioners, the
newspaper added.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Closely Follow Situation in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan voiced concern Monday over
the political uncertainty in Russia after Russian President Boris
Yeltsin dismissed Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin and his cabinet
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government will "closely follow developments" in
Russia to determine the impact of the renewed turbulence, Chief
Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
But Nonaka expressed confidence that Yeltsin will overcome
Russia's fresh political turmoil and proceed with reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that President Yeltsin will exert his
leadership to overcome various problems under the big wave of
reforms and democratization," the top government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday Yeltsin sacked Stepashin and his cabinet and
named Vladimir Putin, secretary of the advisory Security Council,
as acting premier.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth time in 18 months that Yeltsin dismissed his
prime minister. The move came less than three months after Yeltsin
sacked the former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and named
Stepashin as successor.
</P>
<P>
Nonaka said Japan remained committed to "continuing to
strengthen cooperation and improve relations with Russia."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Shunji Yanai told a
separate press conference that Japan "is closely following
developments...and gathering information" to determine the fate of
the planned top-level consultations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo and Moscow have been working to set Yeltsin's official
visit to Japan this fall in a bid to boost bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
They have also been arranging a meeting between Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi and Stepashin on the sidelines of the annual
informal summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum,
slated for September 12-13 in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Russian political uncertainty has repeatedly frustrated Japan
in its bid to resolve a long-standing territorial row and realize
a peace treaty with Russia by the end of next year, as the two
countries earlier pledged.

<HEADLINE> French Union Rejects Work Order to Truck Drivers on Eclipse Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The French labor union Force
Ouvriere (FO) rejected on Monday an order by managers of truck
drivers that trucks should remain on the road during the impending
eclipse on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
FO said the appeal, made by the French National Union of Bosses
in the Trucking Industry (UNOSTRA) operating in the central region
of Bourgogne and the eastern region of Franche-Comte, is "
irresponsible."
</P>
<P>
The French Ministry of Transport issued an order banning heavy
trucks from moving on the roads during the hours of eclipse from
10:00 a.m. till 15:00 p.m. on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The northern Part of France will see a total eclipse of the sun
by the moon in the early afternoon on that day, while all of
France will be affected by the eclipse to differing degrees.
</P>
<P>
The UNOSTRA in Bourgogne and Franche-Comte said that trucks
should keep moving during the time of eclipse, because there are
not enough parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
The FO also condemned the decision by UNOSTRA that truckers
would not be paid during the time they were not moving.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Deny Claims by Kashmiri Militant Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban have denied the
claims of Naseer Ahmed, a commander of the Kashmiri militant
Al-Bedr organization, that he had met with Saudi dissident Osama
bin Laden near the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad.
</P>
<P>
Taliban spokesman Amir Khan Mutaqqi was quoted by the Afghan
Islamic Press as saying Monday that "only the special committee
(of the Taliban) knows whereabouts of Osama bin Laden."
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that the Al-Bedr group itself has denied
the meeting of any of its officers with Osama who is now
reportedly hiding in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
However, the Al-Bedr group expressed sympathy for Osama who has
been accused by the United States of masterminding the bombings of
the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August last year.
</P>
<P>
Naseer Ahmed had claimed that he met Osama in Jalalabad last
Friday amidst heightened security. He also warned the United
States against launching attacks on Osama, saying that "the United
States should know that attack on Afghanistan will prove (to be)
very expensive for it."

<HEADLINE> How Lee Teng-hui Fools Public Opinion (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A Xinhua commentary today exposed
Lee Teng-hui's hypocrisy of his splittist remarks.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Lee again trotted out his "two states" remarks,
wrapped up in the written speech of Koo Chen-fu and the written
explanation of the "Mainland Affairs Council", the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities had to publish the two documents one
after another in an attempt to escape from embarrassment because
Lee's "two states" remarks met with strong condemnation both on
and outside the island. However, the common nature of the two
documents is their falsity, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Lee said on July 9 that cross-straits relations should be
defined as "state-to-state or at least special state-to-state
relations". And this was echoed immediately by some Taiwanese
officials, causing a temporary clamor in the island's press.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee replaced his "state-to-state" claim with the
expression "special state-to-state" once he found that the
situation was not in his favor, openly declaring that he had never
made any "two states" remarks and that it was all cooked up by the
media, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
A Taiwan newspaper said that the "two states" statement has
dragged Taiwan into a new, unstable and dangerous situation, and
that Lee himself should take the responsibility for what he said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper further commented that this was not the first
time Lee had claimed that the media had misreported him.

<TEXT>
<P>
The written speech of Koo Chen-fu, the written explanation of
the "Mainland Affairs Council", and remarks made by some Taiwanese
officials recently have repeatedly said that the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and the Straits
Exchanges Foundation (SEF) achieved a common understanding on the
"one China" principle in 1992, the commentator said.
</P>
<P>
But Lee and some Taiwanese officials have distorted the
principle. And what's more, relations within one China can never
be interpreted as "state-to-state" or "two states", no matter how
people try to explain it, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Lee and his followers tried to find excuses for their farce.
They argued that President Jiang Zemin has said that the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits could discuss anything and, of course, the "
two states" statement could be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin has said that the two sides can discuss any thing
under the "one China" principle, and Lee purposefully dropped the
prerequisite in a move to deny the "one China" principle, harm
cross-straits relations, and split Taiwan from the motherland, the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
After Lee and his followers destroyed the "one China" principle,
the base under which the two sides had contacts, communication and
talks, they expressed time and again their welcome for ARATS
chairman Wang Daohan to visit Taiwan. As is known to all, they
were just playing a farce, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Lee once said that he would like to act like Moses in the Bible,
leading the Israelites out of Egypt to establish a new country.
And later he said in a book that China should be divided into
seven parts.
</P>
<P>
Lee has been making splittist efforts, and simultaneously
trying to fool the world public opinion into believing that he has
been contributing to regional peace and stability, the commentary
concluded, pointing out that Lee is actually part of the scum of
the Chinese nation.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday released two
Turkish soldiers who had been arrested three weeks ago inside the
Iranian border, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The release came after the two countries' foreign ministers
held talks to promote understanding and further bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The two soldiers have been handed over to Turkish authorities
in an unspecified border area, according to the official Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA).
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said the release took place "on
humanitarian ground and after Ankara had assured Tehran that the
aggression was not intentional."
</P>
<P>
Iran said the two soldiers were captured during a Turkish
military incursion into Iran late last month, but Turkey said they
entered Iran by mistake and had repeatedly asked Iran to release
them.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Have No Interest for League Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, Liaoning Province, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning
Fushun head coach Zhang Yin did not think the Chinese first-
division league title do any good to his young team.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said on Monday that he had no interest to win the league
trophy as his team was only promoted to the league for the first
time, despite it overtook Shandong Luneng for the top place after
its 2-1 win over Qingdao Hainiu on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"My squad is too young to handle the easy victory," Zhang said.
"The players could be arrogant after triumph and the league title
will do more harm than good to the rebuilding of the young team."
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, who promoted to the top-level league after it won the
second division last season, had won all the latest five round
matches since July 18 and collected 34 points, one point adrift
over the second-placed Shandong.
</P>
<P>
"The past five round opponents are handful to us, and the big
challenge will come in the rest of the season," Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
Qu Shengxin topped the league's scorers list with 15 goals,
alongwith Zhang Yuning, top striker in the China's Olympic team,
and Li Jinyu, who had scored four goals in five games after he
came back from French side Nancy on loan, to compose of the most
fearful attacking force in the league.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning will travel to Guangzhou to meet Guangzhou Songri in
the next round.

ISLAMABAD, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Twelve swimmers from Pakistan
will take part in the swimming competitions of the next month's
South Asia Federation (SAF) Games.
</P>
<P>
The size of the squad was decided at the General Council of

"It is a golden opportunity for all swimmers not only for
winning medals but also for having a chance of qualifying for the
Sydney olympics," Butt said.

However, he said Pakistan's realistic hope of qualifying for
the Olympics hinge on Kamal Salman Masud, one of the country's
bright stars, who is training and studying in John Hopkins

HONG KONG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Customs cracked
down an international drug smuggling syndicate following the
seizure of 5.1 kilograms of suspected methylamphetamine "ice" at
the airport Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The drugs, worth about 2.8 million HK dollars (359,000 U.S.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran released the two detained
Turkish soldiers Monday in a bid to ease the tension between the
two countries, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The pair were handed over to a Turkish delegation formed by
Baskale town Governor Sevket Cinbir and Colonel Halil Ibrahim
Yaman at the Kapikoy Border Gendarme Station in Saray town in
Turkey's eastern province of Van.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the pair were detained for entering
the Iranian territory on July 22.
</P>
<P>
Iran has promised to let the pair go before the sixth meeting
of the Turkey-Iran Higher Council on Security, which is scheduled
to be held in Ankara on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Local Hurriyet (Freedom) daily has said that Iran's release of
the two soldiers will show a "sign of goodwill" to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has told Iran at recent meetings between the two
countries that the continued detention of the two Turkish soldiers
was creating unwanted tension in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two countries were strained after Iran claimed
that Turkish warplanes attacked an Iranian military post and tents
belonging to Iranian tribesmen on July 18, during which five
people were killed and 10 others injured.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has said that the attack was aimed at the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which uses bases in northern Iraq
for hit-and-run attacks on Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has complained that Iran allowed the PKK rebels to move
into the Iranian territory and then the rebels often entered the
Turkish territory to launch attacks against the Turkish military
and civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Conflicts between the
Turkish security forces and the PKK militants have claimed over
37,000 lives.

KUWAIT CITY, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam

bilateral ties especially in the field of economy.
</P>

The agency said this is Nujoma's second visit to the Gulf
state since November 1995, when he held talks with Kuwaiti
leaders aimed at boosting bilateral ties and regional and

<HEADLINE> India Rules Out Early Resumption of Talks With Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- India Monday ruled out an early
resumption of bilateral talks with Pakistan so long as
"cross-border terrorism" sponsored by Islamabad continued.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to resume the Lahore process" which started last
February when then Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee took
bus to the Pakistani city of Lahore, and the composite dialogue
which followed, a spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry told
the press here Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "Pakistan must facilitate the creation of an
atmosphere conducive to such resumption by abandoning the path of
hostility and confrontation and its state terrorism against
India."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's High Commissioner in New Delhi Ashraf Jehangir Qazi
proposed Sunday a meeting with Indian leaders during the United
Nations General Assembly session in New York next month, saying
the stalled dialogue process should not be held hostage by the
election campaign scheduled in September in India.
</P>
<P>
But the Indian spokesman denied any knowledge of the proposal,
saying that for the present there was no proposal for a meeting at
the political level during the forthcoming U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Islamabad said that Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz also dismissed the possibility of the resumption of
dialogue between the two neighbors during the U.N. session.
</P>
<P>
"The session is being held at a time when India will be busy
with general elections and there will be no government in New
Delhi, how can talks be possible in this scenario?" Aziz
reportedly told a mass-circulated daily.
</P>
<P>
The Indian spokesman repeated the three preconditions for the
resumption of talks with Pakistan put forward before the end of
the latest conflict in Kashmir, emphasizing that "in any event the
real issue is the need for Pakistan to respect the inviolability
and sanctity of the Line of Control (LoC)," the de facto border
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"The continuance of cross-border terrorism is a clear violation
of the LoC and must cease forthwith," he added.

<HEADLINE> International Day of World's Indigenous People  Marked at U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Day of
World's Indigenous people, which falls on Monday, is celebrated at
the United Nations headquarters in New York with two days of
workshops and events, including a cultural event paying tribute to
indigenous human rights defender, a Sacred Pipe Ceremony and the
official opening of an exhibit of Australian Aboriginal art.
</P>
<P>
Topics for the workshops include the relationship of indigenous
peoples to land and how indigenous peoples can lobby governments.
</P>
<P>
Indigenous peoples from around the world will gather for the
events, which are open to the public here.
</P>
<P>
The International Day of the World's Indigenous People is an
opportunity for indigenous peoples and groups, working together
with other interested parties, to organize activities which raise
awareness about indigenous peoples, their history, their cultures,
their aspirations and their contemporary concerns. U.N. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
It was first proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly
in 1994 to be observed each year during the International Decade
of the World's Indigenous People (1995-2004).
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are at least 5,000 indigenous groups
composed of 300 million people living in more than 70 countries on
five continents. Their way of life, livelihood, religion and
culture are inextricably interwined with and dependent on the
traditional environment in which they live, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
In many parts of the world, the cultures of indigenous peoples
are precariously balanced on the edge of extinction, the officials
added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Policemen Issue With U.N. Should Be Taken Seriously: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
asked the country's permanent mission at the United Nations to
take up the matter of its police contingent sent to Kosovo with
the concerned UN officials, Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Our permanent representative has been asked to take up the
matter seriously," Azad told newsmen, referring to press reports
which said Bangladeshi policemen who went to Kosovo to take up the
"peace assignment" are being sent back for their failure to pass
certain tests.
</P>
<P>
Azad reiterated that till Monday his ministry has not been
officially informed by the U.N. of anything regarding the reported
sending back of Bangladeshi policemen from Kosovo. "What we have
come to know on the matter is all unofficial," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
Forty-nine Bangladeshi policemen experienced in the U.N.
peacekeeping mission were recruited in the contingent after they
fulfilled all the U.N. specifications of their recruitment in the
peacekeeping job, and they were sent to Kosovo on July 27.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, which has been taking part in U.N. peace missions
since the late 1980s, has so far sent a few thousand troops and
policemen who had already completed their 16 peace missions.
</P>
<P>
Of the eight U.N. peace missions currently in operation,
Bangladeshi policemen have been assigned in three places --
Bosnia, East Timor and Kosovo. And earlier, Bangladeshi policemen
served in U.N. peace missions in Angola, Cambodia, Haiti,
Mozambique, Namibia and Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> U.N., E. Timor Police Sign Accord on Poll Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. civil police in East
Timor and the local police Monday concluded an agreement to handle
security in the run-up to and during the U.N.-administered
autonomy ballot on the territory's political future by the end of
August.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by East Timor Police Chief Col. Timbul
Silaen and U.N. Civil Police Commissioner Alan Mills in Dili,
capital of East Timor, according to the Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the U.N. civil police would provide advice
to the local police relevant to the consultation process.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the East Timor police, as the sole
institution responsible for the maintenance of security in the
territory, is expected to consider seriously whatever advice given
by the U.N. police.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also requires the U.N. police to be neutral while
providing advice fairly and carrying out duties in line with the
tripartite agreement singed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
and Indonesian and Portuguese foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. civil police could not directly or indirectly carry
out the Indonesian police's jobs such as investigation, detaining
a person or other activities related to the upholding of law and
public order.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is organizing a direct ballot in East Timor
to enable the East Timorese to accept or reject a wide-ranging
autonomy offered by the Indonesian government early this year.
</P>
<P>
A rejection of the autonomy proposal will mean independence for
the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was integrated into Indonesia in 1976, a move never
recognized by the United Nations.
