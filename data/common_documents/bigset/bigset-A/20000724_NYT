   AZERBAIJAN-REFUGEES (Aghjabedi, Azerbaijan) _ A population of 1
million refugees who fled the invasion by neighboring Armenia into
Azerbaijan's mountainous enclave of Nagorno Karabakh in 1992 is
scattered throughout 40 or more camps in this former Soviet
republic where promised oil riches have yet to materialize and per
capita income is less than $2,000 a year. Long after the fighting
stopped, the refugees remain victims of a little-noticed war,
forgotten by the outside world, insufficiently cared for by their
government and on the verge of abandonment by international aid
organizations. They live without running water, electricity or
medical care in railroad cars, tents, temporary prefabricated
houses and holes in the ground, surviving on a few dollars a month,
on handouts and heartache. By Douglas Frantz.

   U.N.-WAR-VICTIMS (United Nations) _ From the Caucasus to Kosovo,
Congo, Colombia and East Timor, millions of people have been
displaced by civil war or ethnic violence. But almost everywhere,
particularly in Africa, they struggle to survive without
international help because they have not crossed an international
border and are not, strictly speaking, refugees. By Barbara
Crossette.

   TEXAS-DROUGHT (Throckmorton, Texas) _ Almost every corner of
Texas knows the grip of drought this year. But here, more than
anywhere else, that grip is a choke hold. In about 50 days, maybe
60, officials say, the lake that provides water for the 1,063
residents here will go dry _ unless there is a miraculous turn in
the weather. So last week the town began a variation of an old-time
barn raising: volunteers are working to dig about 20 miles of
underground pipeline to connect with a water system in the nearby
town of Elbert before time, and water, run out. By Jim Yardley.

<P>
   MEDICARE-POLITICS _ Republicans warn of the dangers of a big,
``one-size fits-all'' prescription drug program for the elderly,
run by the heavy hand of government bureaucrats. Democrats rail
against the prospect of elderly Americans at the mercy of
profit-hungry pharmaceutical companies, and scoff at Republican
efforts to provide drug coverage through the private sector. For
months now, pollsters and strategists in both parties have been
testing and honing these arguments. But as the recent drug bill
passed by House Republicans underscored, all the positioning comes
down to an old philosophical division between the parties, many
analysts say: How big a role should the government play in

   RICHARDSON _ Not long ago, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson's
name was exactly where he wanted it to be, near the top of every
list of likely Democratic vice presidential nominees. A few even
guessed the nomination was his to lose. Then June rolled around,
and a confluence of events _ the Washington version of ``The
Perfect Storm'' _ swallowed Richardson whole. On the heels of a
scandal possibly involving espionage, two computer hard drives
containing nuclear secrets went missing at Los Alamos, gasoline
prices skyrocketed, and Congress turned on the former House member
with a vengeance. Now Richardson's name is no longer on any list.

   CORPORATE-MIGRATION (Jacksonville, Fla.) _ Companies have been
migrating for decades, moving operations both within the United
States and overseas for many reasons, including the search for
cheaper labor. But since 1996, corporate migration within the
country has soared, roughly doubling to more than 11,000 moves a

in Los Angeles and New York that make up the commercial production

how much the strike has cost, but the Entertainment Industry
Development Corp., a quasi-public organization, estimates that Los
Angeles County is losing about $1 million a day. The association
that represents camera rental companies figures that that business
is off by 15 percent. Other trade groups say things are even worse.

fading, perhaps signaling an end to a costly, five-year cycle that
saw several major movie studios build their own traditional
animation divisions in an attempt to steal a bit of Disney's
thunder. Audiences seem to be demanding up-to-the-minute digital
magic and shying away from the kind of traditional animation they
remember from years past _ unless the movie has the name Disney

BOEING ROLLS OUT NEWEST, MAYBE LAST OF 737 FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a ceremony that spanned the Atlantic, The Boeing Co.
Sunday rolled out the newest, longest and what is likely to be the
final member of its next-generation 737 family, the popular
twinjets that will soon be produced in record numbers to meet
strong sales.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a team of Alaskan sled dogs, symbolic of launch customer
Alaska Airlines, the 737-900 slowly left the Renton factory to the
cheers of several thousand employees.
</P>
<P>
   The event was televised live by satellite to a hotel ballroom in
downtown London, where Boeing executives, including Chairman Phil
Condit and commercial airplane boss Alan Mulally, held an evening
reception for customers, suppliers and guests on the eve of the
Farnborough International air show.
</P>
<P>
   ``What an exciting way to start out the air show,'' Mulally said
as three-time Iditarod race champion Doug Swingley of Montana and
his dogs escorted the new jet from the factory.
</P>
<P>
   The 737-900 program was begun in November 1997 with an order for
10 planes from Alaska, which wanted a jet that would seat about 15
more passengers than the 737-800. The airline has since ordered one
additional jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here today ... because Boeing, like any
industry-leading company, did what is so vitally important _ they
listened to their customer,'' John Kelly, chairman of Alaska
Airlines, said as he watched in Renton with Alaska Airlines
employees.
</P>
<P>
   That first 737-900 will be delivered to Alaska in April after
flight testing.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said Alaska will eventually use the new jets on its
Seattle-Anchorage runs, replacing older model 737-400s that seat
138 passengers. The 737-900 can carry up to 177 passengers in a
two-class configuration.
</P>
<P>
   Because fewer planes will be needed to haul the same number of
passengers, Alaska expects to save $18 million a year on its
Seattle-Anchorage flights, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Alaska kicked off the 737-900 program, Continental
Airlines has ordered 15, Korean Airlines 16 and KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines four, for a total of 46 firm orders.
</P>
<P>
   Like Alaska, the three carriers will take delivery of their
first 737-900s next year.
</P>
<P>
   The 737-900 joins three smaller siblings in the next-generation
family _ the -600, -700 and -800 series.
</P>
<P>
   The 737-700 has the greatest range, and Alaska recently started
using that model to fly from Anchorage to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   This is the last offspring, according to Boeing, though it is
studying an even longer-range version of the 737-700.
</P>
<P>
   The 737-900 is a stretched version of the 737-800. Boeing added
a forward body plug of 62 inches and an aft plug of 42 inches,
which increased the overall length by 8 feet 8 inches. It is the
longest 737 ever.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum seating capacity of the 737-900 is 189, a limit
imposed by federal regulation based on the number of exit doors and
how quickly passengers can get out in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   All four next-generation models have the same wingspan.
</P>
<P>
   The -600 series is the shortest of the four, at 102 feet 6
inches. It carries about 110 passengers in a two-class
configuration.
</P>
<P>
   The 737-900 is 138 feet 2 inches in length. The 737-900
fuselage, which includes everything but the tail section and the
nose radome, is 124 feet 4 inches long. That's 4 feet longer than
the Wright brothers' first flight.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has so far racked up 1,602 orders for its next-generation
737s. So far this year, Boeing has 244 firm 737 orders. That's
better than the 737 did in all of 1999. Last month, on the heels of
a record Southwest order for 94 737-700s, Boeing announced plans to
increase production next year.
</P>
<P>
   The rate will increase from the current 24 per month to 28 with
deliveries in the third quarter of 2001. That will be the most 737s
Boeing has ever produced in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing could announce additional 737 orders at the Farnborough
show that opens Monday outside London. But the Boeing plane getting
most of the attention will be the super-long-range 777X, which was
launched earlier this year. Boeing Monday is expected to announce
up to 30 orders worth more than $5 billion at list prices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rival Airbus Industrie is expected Monday to announce
the first firm order for its A3XX, the 555-seater that could be
launched by the end of the year if Airbus gets enough customers.
Emirates Airlines could be the first to buy the plane. It
reportedly wants up to 10 of the jets, which will have a list price
of about $230 million.

BRAVES SHUT OUT METS, 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Trades and non-trades haunted the New York Mets on
Sunday. In the morning, General Manager Steve Phillips acknowledged
that the Cincinnati Reds' Barry Larkin had turned down a deal to
the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon, as the Mets lounged in their Turner Field
clubhouse, some of them watched on television as the All-Star Jason
Isringhausen _ who was traded by the Mets last July _ closed out a
victory for the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sunday night, the Mets were beaten, 1-0, by the Atlanta
Braves, who got a magnificent pitching performance from Andy Ashby,
who just came over in a trade from the Philadelphia Philllies.
Phillips received even more frustrating news during the game when
he heard that Larkin had signed a contract extension with the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby threw a complete game in blanking the Mets on four hits.
The Braves took two of three games from the Mets this weekend and
increased their lead in the National League East to six games. They
beat Bobby J. Jones, whose record fell to 4-5 despite a solid
outing and some sparkling defense from Derek Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who has made diving catches all season, made perhaps his
most dramatic catch yet in the fifth inning. With two runners on
and two outs, Chipper Jones lofted a high fly to right. Bell
drifted back, timed his leap and stretched his arm over the fence
for the catch. Beaming, Bell held his glove high for several
seconds as he skipped in from right field. But the Braves' charge
was only momentarily stopped. Brian Jordan singled to lead off the
sixth, and scored when Wally Joyner doubled down the right-field
line. After a ground out and an intentional walk put runners at the
corners, Dennis Cook came in to retire Keith Lockhart and Ashby.
</P>
<P>
   Jones lasted only five and one-third innings, his shortest stint
since he returned from Class AAA Norfolk a month ago. But with each
start, he is answering more questions. Jones had a 10.19 earned run
average in eight starts before going to the minors; in seven starts
since, he has a 3.25 ERA. Jones is still hittable _ he has allowed
17 hits in his last 111/3 innings _ but has better command of his
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Both starters escaped bases-loaded jams in the early innings.
Jones allowed a one-out single to Javy Lopez in the second, then
walked the next two hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Mike Piazza came to the mound, and after Jones threw a
ball on the first pitch to Ashby, the pitching coach Dave Wallace
came out for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   His advice must have worked. Ashby popped out and Rafael Furcal
flied to left to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth _ after Lenny Harris was picked off first by the
catcher, Lopez, following his leadoff single _ Bell walked and Jay
Payton doubled off the left-field wall. Piazza walked to load the
bases, but Todd Zeile bounced to the shortstop, starting a double
play that ended the inning and kept the game scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets spoke to the Phillies about Ashby, but Phillips has
said the talks never got far. Ashby can be a free agent after the
year, and the Mets had no young, major league-ready pitchers they
could spare in the deal, as the Braves did when they sent Bruce
Chen to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby got himself in trouble in the ninth, when he overthrew
first baseman Joyner on Payton's soft leadoff grounder. Payton got
to second, but Piazza grounded out and Zeile lined out after
fouling off four pitches with two strikes. Benny Agbayani just
missed a line-drive hit down the right-field line that would have
tied the game, then grounded to short for the final out. &QL;

CANADA OFFERS SAME PRESCRIPTIONS AS U.S. AT CHEAPER PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SURREY, B.C. _ Woody Crandall's epiphany came near the
prescription counter at the back of London Drugs.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed and shook his head at the wonder of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes medication that costs 62 cents a pill back home in
Marysville costs only 7 cents a pill in British Columbia. An ulcer
medicine costs him $1.03 a pill at home. He can get the same
medicine for 13 cents a pill in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same damn company and the same damn pills,'' said
Crandall, 64.
</P>
<P>
   Crandall has joined a growing corps of Washington state senior
citizens who are crossing the border and abandoning their
neighborhood drug stores for British Columbia. Saddled with fixed
incomes and monthly prescription bills in the hundreds or thousands
of dollars, they have found a pharmacy haven just across the 49th
parallel.
</P>
<P>
   The savings are enormous. A recent survey by the office of U.S.
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., shows that the 10 most commonly
prescribed drugs in Washington are an average of 61 percent cheaper
in British Columbia. That includes not only the lower cost of drugs
but also a favorable exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   A trickle of American customers to pharmacies just across the
border has become a stream in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 Americans a day walk into the Peninsula Medical Clinic
to see a doctor and meet the British Columbia requirement of having
a prescription written by a local physician, said Dr. Paul Zickler.
The clinic is in the same south Surrey shopping center as London
Drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dewey Tichi and his wife, Agnes, both of Seattle, were there in
May and saved nearly $500.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can save $500 bucks every three months, shoot, I can put
that money to better use,'' Dewey Tichi said.
</P>
<P>
   Business for writing prescriptions ``in Canadian'' for the
Tichis and others has gotten so brisk that the Peninsula clinic
will open a second facility a few doors away just to cater to
Americans. At the same time, the clinic is trying to get an
Internet site running so that its physicians can correspond
electronically with the doctors treating the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, a private company may soon make regular bus runs to
Surrey to accommodate cost-conscious seniors, Zickler said.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is startling, especially if you saw the smiles on
the faces of Crandall, his wife, Sylvia, and her sister Jean
Allison as they sat on a bench outside London Drugs. In all, they
saved more than $4,000 on 11 prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot of money,'' Allison said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of prescription drugs has gotten the attention of
politicians nationwide in addition to that of the senior citizens
in Washington state. In Washington, D.C., Congress is debating ways
of increasing insurance coverage for prescription medicines.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, consumer, labor and seniors groups hope to
persuade the Legislature to adopt a measure similar to Maine's that
would result in lower negotiated prices or regulated prices for
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The price of prescription drugs in the United States has been
fodder for political debate for at least 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the world's industrialized nations, only the United
States does not control the price of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Drug makers say unregulated prices give them the incentive to
spend more on research and development. Indeed, the U.S. leads the
world in introducing new drugs to the market.
</P>
<P>
   And the pharmaceutical industry is richly rewarded. Typically,
the industry ranks as the most profitable in the Fortune 500
ranking of the largest companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, about one in four Americans don't have
insurance coverage for prescription drugs. Medicare, which is for
older Americans, pays for drugs in hospitals and nursing homes but
not elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly significant because seniors consume about a
third of all the prescriptions filled in the United States. Still,
two of every three seniors have some sort of coverage that helps to
pay for prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Drug coverage varies widely from generous payments to slight
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Allison, for example, gets $1,000 annually for drugs from a
Teamsters union program. That doesn't go far, however, because her
drugs cost her nearly $500 a month in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She gets by. Her sister Sylvia Crandall says they know how to do
that. After all, they grew up in a Connecticut home where eight
children slept in one bed.
</P>
<P>
   Allison and her companion Richard Dupuis live in an RV,
following the sun through the year. Dupuis, 66, said he can pick up
work when he wants it _ fixing a tractor in Marysville or maybe
tending bar in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Crandalls live part of the year in an RV near Marysville and
the rest in their RV in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Crandall says they live happily and without a telephone,
cable television or a computer.
</P>
<P>
   They also sometimes have to live without all the medicine they
need.
</P>
<P>
   Crandall says he would have to pay more than $600 a month for
prescriptions out of his own pocket in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told my doctor, `If I have to pay that, I'm not going to
take it,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to live just to take pills,'' added his wife,
Sylvia.
</P>
<P>
   So they've learned to economize with medicines as they have
learned to economize elsewhere. They might just take a pill every
other day, Sylvia Crandall said.
</P>
<P>
   Allison, who just had cataract surgery, said she sometimes cuts
a pill in half to make one dosage last two days.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only Allison and the Crandalls. ``A lot of people who
come here have not been taking their medications,'' said Zickler,
the Surrey physician. ``They can't afford them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, Americans buy prescriptions in bulk _ enough to last
six months. And they pay the clinic $30 for which they get their
prescription rewritten and a consultation with a physician who asks
about their health and makes sure they understand what the
medicines are for.
</P>
<P>
   That seniors are willing to drive two hours to a foreign country
underscores that something is wrong in the United States, some
people who study the pharmaceutical industry say.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the face of it, it's silly that people have to do this,''
said Thomas Hazlet, an assistant pharmacy professor at the
University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But many senior citizens are too frail or too poor to get to
Canada. That leaves them at the mercy of local drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   Are they too high?
</P>
<P>
   To critics like Art Zoloth, drug companies charge ``whatever the
market will bear'' in the United States. Zoloth is a former
director of pharmacy at Virginia Mason Medical Center and also
served on the state pharmacy board.
</P>
<P>
   ``What jumps out at you is that the system is out of control.
The industry has really taken advantage of the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry is secretive about prices. But it's no secret
that it sells its drugs in Canada or France or England for less
than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in prices represents return on investment, which
allows the company to sustain research and development, said Jeff
Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America.
</P>
<P>
   Research and development has become the drug industry's armor
against price control.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. drug companies are responsible for about half of all new
medicines developed each year. The industry will spend $26.5
billion on research this year, Trewhitt said. But only one of every
five medicines that reaches clinical trials ever makes it to the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Other nations enjoy the benefits of U.S. innovation while
American consumers pay for it, drug companies say.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian drug industry, for example, ``doesn't register on
the radar screen, largely because of price controls,'' Trewhitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had the same rigid Canadian-style price controls in this
country, it would be difficult if not impossible to sustain the
same level of innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton aims to rectify price differences. He has introduced
legislation that would invoke a law against price discrimination.
In theory, it would increase prices abroad and lower them at home.
</P>
<P>
   Zoloth doesn't believe the drug companies' line about research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any sense that a research-intensive industry
is going to say, `Whoops, no more research.'''
</P>
<P>
   The solution for the drug industry is to get people insurance
coverage so they can afford prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Congress may decide to do that later this year.
</P>
<P>
   People like Dewey Tichi don't have a vote in Congress. But
Tichi, who has high-blood pressure, high cholesterol and a
pacemaker, can vote with his pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   When the 90 days worth of pills he and his wife bought in Surrey
runs out, they will head north.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not poor, but I'm not rich either,'' he said. ``Gosh, I
don't want to give all my money to those drug companies.''

SPARKS MOVE INTO FIRST
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The three-time defending champion Houston
Comets had already lost to New York earlier Sunday, opening the
door for the Sparks to seize first place for the first time ever
this late in the WNBA season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento Monarchs tried to steal the opportunity with a
late rush, but the Sparks rose to the challenge and emerged with a
73-68 victory that gives them a 1/2-game lead over the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again we're not looking at this as staying in first place,''
Sparks coach Michael Cooper said. ``We just have to take care of
our business and let other people worry about theirs and if we stay
in first place fine. But I think we set a pattern for what we want
and that's going into the playoffs on a strong note.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks improved to 21-3 on the season, while the Comets
dropped to 21-4, their first loss since losing for the second time
to the Sparks on July 14. The Sparks have two more home games
(Tuesday against Orlando, Thursday against Seattle), before
embarking on a six-game road trip that begins in Houston Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The victory in front of 8,482 at the Forum gave the Sparks their
fifth consecutive win and 15th in the last 16 games. The Monarchs
(15-10) tried their best to snap the WNBA's hottest team's current
streak, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks saw their 12-point margin midway through the second
half evaporate after an onslaught by the Monarchs. A layup by
Yolanda Griffith (19 points) with 3:55 to play tied the score at
66, but she missed a free throw that would have given the Monarchs
the advantage for the first time since early in the game (3-2).
</P>
<P>
   A free throw by forward DeLisha Milton (13 points, 11 rebounds)
and a basket by guard Tamecka Dixon (14 points, seven assists) gave
the Sparks a three-point lead, but Monarch's guard Ruthie
Bolton-Holifield knocked down a 12-footer to bring her team within
one.
</P>
<P>
   Center Lisa Leslie (20 points, eight rebounds) made a 10-foot
jumper to put the Sparks back up by three with 1:09 remaining.
About minute later reserve Allison Feaster, who had a career game
off the bench, came up with a key rebound after Bolton-Holifield
missed a 3-point attempt that could have tied the game with seconds
to play.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon went to the line and made two free throws to seal the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big night for Feaster, who had career-high 18 points,
five rebounds and three assists. She was 6 of 10 from the field,
and 3 of 5 from 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches give me a lot of confidence and my teammates give
me great passes and set me up really well,'' said Feaster, who led
the NCAA in scoring in her final season at Harvard in 1997-98.
``All that's left to do is make the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   And she didn't disappoint.

BUSH MUM AS SIGNS STILL POINT TO CHENEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ As a drenching rain pounded the Texas hill country
Sunday, George W. Bush remained secluded at his ranch, weighing his
choice of a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said no announcement is likely before Tuesday, and all
signs continued to point to Richard B. Cheney, the former defense
secretary, former congressman and former White House chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, the Texas governor had made no telephone
calls informing any of the potential candidates for vice president
that they had been cut from his short list.
</P>
<P>
   But Karl Rove, Bush's campaign manager, and Karen Hughes, his
communications director, took to the Sunday morning talk shows to
knock down any discussion that Arizona Senator John McCain was in
the mix. Both of Bush's top aides said the governor took McCain at
his word when he said several months ago that he was not interested
in the vice presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush spent several hours last week in Chicago with
former Missouri Senator John Danforth, Danforth said Sunday that he
expects Cheney, the man in charge of Bush's selection process, to
be named as the governor's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's Cheney. You know, with the registration change,
that's what I believe,'' Danforth told The Associated Press before
walking into church in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Cheney flew to Wyoming and switched his voter
registration to the state he represented in Congress for 12 years,
rather than continuing to vote in Texas. Cheney had been living in
Dallas and running an oil and engineering firm. But the US
Constitution prohibits electoral college members from voting for a
presidential and vice presidential candidate from the same state.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible candidates on a list that Bush has said is
shrinking include: Governors Frank Keating of Oklahoma, George
Pataki of New York, Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, and Senator Chuck
Hagel of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   On the talk shows, both Rove and Hughes vigorously defended
Cheney as a quality candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Rove, for example, said Cheney's three heart attacks and
quadruple bypass surgery would not be a liability in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those heart attacks occurred in the '70s and '80s and he then
served as secretary of defense in President Bush's administration
and presided over Desert Storm,'' Rove said on CBS's Face the
Nation.``I don't know of a more stressful situation than being
secretary of defense during an armed combat, and he seemed to do
just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   With gasoline prices high and with Vice President Al Gore
blaming the oil industry for huge profits, Rove and Hughes waved
off suggestions that Cheney's association with the oil industry
would be an issue in the campaign. Bush, too, is a former oil
industry executive.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Bush picking a Washington insider, Rove said
that choosing Cheney would not hurt Bush at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is running to change the tone of Washington, but
that doesn't mean he's anti-Washington,'' Rove said on ABC's This
Week. ``There are a number of people who have served in Washington
who could help bring about that change.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Republicans dealt with the speculation and the waiting
game, aides to Gore pounded Bush for making a spectacle out of an
important decision with profound consequences for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear that the Bush campaign, who've had no
message for weeks, are turning what should be a very serious
decision into a political photo op,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore, in contrast, recognizes this is a very serious
decision and the process he's using reflects that. He's protecting
the integrity of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Gore will campaign in Michigan, Ohio and Illinois,
and he will emphasize what he considers to be Bush's poor handling
of the Texas state budget, which has a $1.4 billion surplus, far
less than originally expected because of miscalculations in the
Medicaid program and the cost of state prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``His campaign is spending too much time on the vice
presidential selection process and not enough time on the budget
and it seems like they've got a shortfall in both,'' Lehane said.
``They certainly seem to be having difficulty making up their
minds.''

`BIG BROTHER'S' FIRST CASTOUT SPARS WITH PRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ William Collins, the first houseguest
banished from CBS' voyeuristic ``Big Brother'' show, faced
reporters for the first time Sunday, talking a lot but shedding
little light on his controversial political affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Before his banishment last week, Collins was reported to be a
member of the New Black Panther Party, led by reputed hate-monger
Khalid Abdul Muhammad. Collins, also known as Mega, arrived at the
Ritz Carlton Hotel with a reported five-car security detail.
</P>
<P>
   He was there for the ``Big Brother'' panel of CBS' summer press
tour, three days in which the hot topic was reality TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' has a lock on the summer ratings, but ``Big
Brother,'' airing six nights a week from Studio City, was the
attention-getter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to show books he brought with him, Collins held up a Bible
(``You've seen me with my gun, but you haven't seen me with my
God''), a Webster's Dictionary (helpful, he said, in understanding
and using ``the words of our enemy''), and a copy of ``48 Laws of
Power'' by Robert Greene and Joost Elffers, one of the books he
used ``in manipulating the houseguests.''
</P>
<P>
   His tone turned brusque when asked who he sees as his enemies.
``Those who oppose God. The unrighteous. The evil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He asked to be addressed as ``Will Mega.'' When a reporter from
his hometown, Philadelphia, wanted to ask him a question, he
demanded she first tell him what she had written about him,
prompting other reporters to boo.
</P>
<P>
   He complained that the few ``Big Brother'' shows he has seen
portrayed ``a major imbalance,'' showing only the confrontations
and not the more peaceful Will Mega who prayed at least twice a
day. But Executive Producer Paul Romer said Collins' confrontations
were a compelling part of the daily highlights packed into each
22-minute program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people out there who say this show is boring,''
Romer said. ``What would be boring is if we showed the lowlights.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins refused to elaborate on his comment Thursday about which
of Muhammad's beliefs he still ascribes to and which he has
rejected. He said he was not surprised to learn that the story
about his affiliation came out, saying the New York Police
Department probably leaked it because he has loudly criticized the
NYPD for brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to predict which of his housemates will be the three
finalists, Collins said, ``Cassandra, because she's the smartest
person in the house; Eddie, because he understands that it's a
contest; and Josh, because he's the all-American white boy.''
</P>
<P>
   He also was asked whether he truly hoped to win the $500,000
grand prize or if he was trying to get himself voted out in order
to get a national media platform for his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``My competitive nature makes me want to win everything that I
engage in. (But) there wasn't enough mental stimulus.'' he said.
``That was the major battle _ my will to win combined with not
having enough mental stimuli.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm X said in his autobiography that prison was the
second-best place a man could go to get his mind right,'' Collins
went on. ``It was this experience for me that allowed me to really
understand what he meant, in that when all of those things in your
life, all those basic responsibilities are taken care of and basic
needs are met ... when you're quarantined, it forces you to dwell
within yourself and within your soul.''
</P>
<P>
   During the ``Survivor'' panel, Gretchen Cordy said she thinks
living under ``Big Brother'' conditions would be much harder than
what she endured marooned in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd much rather be out in nature,'' she said. ``If B.B.
(Andersen) and I got a little tired of each other, we could walk
off. To be in that nest? No thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, CBS President Leslie Moonves announced that
``Survivor 2: the Australian Outback'' will debut immediately
following Super Bowl XXXV. He praised ``Survivor'' and ``Big
Brother'' for bringing CBS back to the water cooler, something that
probably has not happened since ``Murphy Brown'' and ``Northern
Exposure'' about 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, when confronted with questions about the ethical issues
of ``Big Brother,'' or its less-than-stellar ratings, he
characterized it as ``an experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   One time Moonves sidestepped with ``doesn't anybody have a 'Yes,
Dear' question?'' referring to one of his new sitcoms

AT BUSHES' REQUEST, CARDIAC SURGEON CONSULTS ON CHENEY'S HEALTH  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 5th graf and adds new 6th graf to provide credit to ABC News
and to add information)  By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A cardiac surgeon in Houston who described
himself as a longtime friend of the Bush family said Sunday that
both Gov. George W. Bush and his father, former President Bush, had
asked him on Friday to consult by telephone with one of Dick
Cheney's physicians and help determine if Cheney ``was up to a
strenuous campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Sunday, the surgeon, Denton A. Cooley,
said that after the Bushes made that request, he spoke almost
immediately with Cheney's physician. And several hours later,
Cooley said, both the governor and the former president got back in
touch with him to check his findings about Cheney, which were
favorable.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, the former defense secretary and the man supervising the
process by which Gov. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, chooses a running mate, emerged over the last few days as
a leading contender for the No. 2 spot on the ticket. And one
reason many Republican officials were surprised by that development
was Cheney's health. More than a decade ago, he had three mild
heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney has apparently not had any heart trouble in recent
years, and Cooley said that he told both of the Bushes, who placed
separate calls to him, that Cheney's physician in Washington
``thought he was certainly capable and fit enough to go through a
national campaign.'' Cooley added that the governor and former
president both seemed pleased by that news.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley's actions, first reported on Sunday by ABC News, were yet
another sign of the seriousness with which Cheney, whom one
high-ranking Republican official described on Sunday as the
front-runner to share the Republican ticket with Governor Bush, is
being considered for the job. On the same day that the Bushes were
reaching out to Cooley, Cheney changed his voter registration from
Texas to Wyoming, a state he represented in Congress for many
years, thereby eliminating a potential constitutional hurdle to
being the vice-presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   And late last week, according to a report by the Associated
Press on Sunday, Cheney began telling business associates at
Halliburton, the Dallas energy company where he is a top executive,
that there was a ``good chance'' he would be the vice presidential
nominee. Cheney reportedly wanted to alert them because he had
previously indicated that he was not interested in being the
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The way in which Cooley's help was solicited raised questions
about the extent of President Bush's involvement in his son's
deliberations over a running mate. The Texas governor said on
Friday that his father, in whose administration Cheney served as
the defense secretary, had mainly played the role of ``a good
listener.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Sunday night about President Bush's role in the selection
process, Karen P. Hughes, the communications director for the Bush
campaign, said, ``Only the governor can answer that question, and
I'm sure he will be happy to once the process is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said she could neither confirm nor deny that Cooley had
acted on the Bushes' request to help them assess Cheney's health.
Referring to the various people whose names have been floated as
vice-presidential prospects for Bush, Hughes said, ``I think it's
important to respect the privacy of all these individuals until
such time as Governor Bush makes a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   One adviser to Bush said Sunday night that the Texas governor
had not yet contacted any of his closest aides or anyone on his
list of potential vice presidents to say that he had made his
decision, which he is expected to announce sometime this week. The
comments of several of Bush's advisers indicated that Tuesday would
be the likeliest day for that announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent Sunday in the peace, quiet and seclusion of his ranch
more than 90 miles northwest of here, and he was not planning to
return to Austin, where the announcement will almost certainly be
made, until midday Monday, his aides said. Bush said on Friday that
he would spend the weekend making his final deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   One of his aides cautioned anew Sunday that despite all of the
speculation about Cheney and, to a lesser extent, about former Sen.
John C. Danforth of Missouri, with whom the Texas governor met for
several hours on Tuesday, Bush might yet have a surprise in store.
But a high-ranking Republican official said that Cheney appeared to
be the leading candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Even Danforth seemed to agree. The Associated Press reported
that as he headed into a church in St. Louis Sunday morning, he
said: ``I think it's Cheney. You know, with the registration
change, that's what I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a flurry of additional indicators that Cheney might be
Bush's pick, including reports of Cheney telling business
associates that he might be taking on a new kind of assignment. One
Republican official said that before Cooley's telephone call,
Cheney had undergone a thorough physical examination last week.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear whether the exam was performed by the
physician with whom Cooley spoke. Cooley could not recall the
physician's name, and remembered only that this physician's review
of Cheney's health had been performed sometime within the last few
weeks or months.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Bush's senior advisers and other prominent
Republicans fanned out on the morning news programs, where much of
what they said amounted to defenses of potential criticisms of
Cheney's selection and arguments for why Cheney represented a
terrific choice. They repeatedly said, however, that Bush had not
made a decision.
</P>
<P>
   On the NBC program ``Meet the Press,'' Hughes dismissed the
notion that because Cheney was an executive with an energy company
in Dallas and Bush once ran an oil company in Midland, Texas, a
Bush-Cheney ticket would get tagged as an ally and pawn of the oil
industry. She said it would simply mean that Bush and Cheney would
be better at formulating national energy policy than the Clinton
administration had been.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' Karl Rove, the chief strategist for
the Bush campaign, said that Cheney's history of heart trouble was
not cause for concern. ``Those heart attacks occurred in the '70s
and '80s and he then served as secretary of defense in President
Bush's administration and presided over Desert Storm,'' Rove noted.
</P>
<P>
   The three heart attacks in 1978, 1984 and 1988 that Cheney, 59,
suffered were all mild, and he had bypass surgery in 1988, before
his high-profile assignment in the Bush administration. In addition
to being a congressman from Wyoming, Cheney had previously served
as President Ford's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley said that he did not review specific test results or
medical data with Cheney's physician, but simply listened carefully
to that man's assessment of Cheney's health.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley said that what the Bushes wanted to know about Cheney was
``how fit he was, and was he up to a strenuous campaign.'' Cooley
concluded that he was.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cheney and Danforth, 63, are in many ways dissimilar,
both have decades of experience in government that stand in bold
counterpoint to Bush's five and a half years as Texas governor, the
only government office he has ever held. Some Republican
strategists said Sunday that the willingness of Bush, 54, to turn
to older political veterans suggested how confident and comfortable
he was with his own abilities.
</P>
<P>
   But others said it was a possible sign that Bush or his advisers
were acting to blunt any concerns among voters that Bush did not
have enough seasoning to lead the country.

SHOWDOWN COMES UP LAME
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO -- The Sactown Showdown? A meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene each pulled up lame in the
200-meter final on a scorching summer Sunday afternoon in
Sacramento, ruining one of the most anticipated races in years on
American soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world wanted to see a great show,'' Greene said.
``Unfortunately, Michael and myself weren't able to give them the
show they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed, because it was a goal of mine'' to win
another 200-meter Olympic gold medal, Johnson said. ``But you can't
have everything .''
</P>
<P>
   The closing event of the 2000 U.S. Olympic Track and Field
Trials turned into a war of attrition won by 21-year-old John Capel
in a fastest-of -the-weekend time of 19.85 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Capel hit the finish line, with Floyd Heard and Coby
Miller close behind, Johnson was lying back on the curve, grimacing
in pain from a cramped left hamstring, and Greene was limping 50
meters further up the track, also a victim of a spasming hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Neither will run the 200 at the Sydney Olympics two months
hence. ``It's frustrating for everybody,'' said Marion Jones,
women's 200-meter champ. ``The fact you have two of the fastest men
in the world and they both go down ... it's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning conclusion to a race pitting infrequent
competitors, unfriendly rivals and world-record holders in the 100
(Greene, 9.79), 2 00 (Johnson, 19.32) and 400 (Johnson, 43.18)
meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling you, it's not just Michael and Maurice, Michael
and Maurice,'' Johnson said. ``It ended up (ticking) the other guys
off, and they went out and ran real fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Capel's time was .01 faster than Greene's career best in the
200, and quicker than all but one time Johnson has recorded in the
event this year.
</P>
<P>
   In other action on a day featuring an orgy of 10 finals, Jones
set up her bid to become the first woman to win five track and
field gold medals at the Olympics by winning the 200 in 21.94
seconds; Gail Devers set an American record in the women's
100-meter hurdles; The Clark Family went 1-2-3 in the women's 800;
and pole-vaulter Stacy Dragila set the only world record of the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila cleared 15 feet, 2 1/4 inches, clipping her own world
mark of 15-1 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted was to make the team,'' Dragila said. ``To get
the world record is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   The final event of the eight-day meet was also the closest
watched -- the Johnson-Greene duel. They had sniped verbally for
months, each had won an event here earlier (Greene the 100, Johnson
the 400) and were headed for a collision in the 200, the only event
they each run.
</P>
<P>
   Chances of a classic collision took a hit Saturday, when Johnson
reported a cramp in his right quadriceps. But he appeared for his
semifinal heat Sunday and, running carefully, defeated Greene 20.03
to 20.30. It was only the third time they have raced, and Johnson's
second victory.
</P>
<P>
   Capel won the semi in 20.03.
</P>
<P>
   Only 90 minutes later, on an afternoon where temperatures soared
over 100 degrees, Johnson and Greene were out on the track again.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the short turnaround on a torrid day may have been
a factor in his injury. And Greene's. ``You're more likely to cramp
on a hot day,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson began limping only 50 meters into the race, and
eventually tumbled to the track, holding up his left leg. ``It was
a really severe cramp,'' he said. ``It just wouldn't let go.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, running inside Johnson in Lane 2, was unaware his rival
had gone down when he began limping heavily. He clutched at his
left hamstring as he came to a halt at the top of the straight.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was taken off the track in a cart. Greene hobbled off
under his own power.
</P>
<P>
   Each believes his injury is not serious, and should not impede
attempts to win gold in the 100 and 400 at Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   -- Jones appeared to struggle the final 100 meters of the
women's 200, but held off Inger Miller, who clocked 22.09. Nanceen
Perry was third. Jones wants to win gold in the 100, 200, long jump
and both relays. She won the 100, 200 and long jump here, and said,
``It's been a long week, and I'm glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A desperate lunge at the finish line made it an all-Clark
affair in the women's 800. Hazel Clark won in 1:58.97, and
sister-in-law Jearl Miles-Clark, the American-record holder was
second.
</P>
<P>
   Joetta Clark-Diggs, Hazel's half-sister, caught Meredith
Rainey-Valmon on the last stride of the race, and finished in
1:59.49 -- .01 ahead of Rainey-Valmon.
</P>
<P>
   All three women are coached by J.J. Clark, brother of Hazel and
Joetta and husband of Jearl. They hugged and broke into tears.
</P>
<P>
   -- Devers broke her own American record in the women's 100-meter
hurdles, clocking 12.33 (No.4 all-time) and establishing herself as
the favorite to win gold at Sydney. Devers twice won the 100-meter
gold, but has never medaled in an Olympic hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   -- Defending Olympic gold-medalist and American-record holder
Charles Austin, 32, won high-jump qualifying with a mark of 7-7
1/4, holding off the younger generation led by Arkansas junior
Kenny Evans, 21 and Nathan Leeper, 23. Evans and Leeper each
cleared 7-5 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   -- Andy Setliff, a part-timer actor, stole the show in the men's
discus final, winning with a mark of 209-10. John Godina, 1996
silver-medalist in the shot who failed to make the 2000 team in the
event, finished second in the discus at 208-8, and 1999 world
champion Anthony Washington was third at 207-10.
</P>
<P>
   -- Allen Johnson, Olympic gold-medalist in 1996, won the men's
110-meter hurdles in 12.97 seconds, fastest time in the world this
year. Mark Crear was second in 13.11, and rising star Terrence
Trammell third in 13. 19.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mark Everett qualified for his third Olympics, winning the
men's 80 0 in 1:45.67. Rich Kenah and Bryan Woodward ran 2-3.
</P>
<P>
   -- Robert Howard won the men's triple jump in 55-9, followed by
LaMark Carter and Walter Davis. Davis also qualified for the
Olympic team in the long jump.

RANGERS RUIN SEATTLE SWEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If this three-game series against Texas proved
anything, it was that the Mariners, as good as they have been in
the 2000 season, haven't quite mastered the art of the kill.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners came into Sunday's game having won the first two
games against an obviously downtrodden Rangers team. Texas is the
defending AL West champion, true, but last year's success won't buy
the Rangers a ticket to the postseason this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle had a chance to fit the Rangers for a three-game pine
box, but couldn't get the measurements done. The Rangers did just
enough right and the Mariners just enough wrong to earn Texas a 3-2
win over Seattle, denying the Mariners a sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let one get away today,'' left fielder Rickey Henderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Oakland, the team that many picked to win the AL West this
year, comes to Safeco Field to begin a three-game series Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a big series, but it's an important series,''
Henderson said, quickly explaining the difference. ``The big series
don't start for another month or so, when there aren't that many
games left.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you play teams in your division, it's always
important.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are in first place, four games ahead of the
second-place A's, and the outcome of this series could do much to
sculpt the form of the AL West race the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the guys chasing us,'' center fielder Mike Cameron
said of the A's. ``These are the guys we have to battle.''
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for this battle, Seattle has added one game to
its lead over the A's in the West since the All-Star break,
including splitting a pair of games in Oakland last week.
</P>
<P>
   The lead increase would have been two games if the Mariners had
been able to walk away from Sunday's game a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they made a couple of small mistakes that had big
consequences. In the top of the fourth, catcher Dan Wilson let a
pitch from starter Freddy Garcia get past him for a passed ball,
allowing a run to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bonehead play on my part,'' Wilson said. ``I cost us
the game. I guess you could say that about a lot of things, but
Freddy pitched too good for us to lose this one.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the fourth, John Olerud reached third base with
no one out and didn't score. Cameron, Jay Buhner and David Bell
couldn't get the run home against Rick Helling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a couple of chances to get something done,'' Cameron
said. ``I know I had one and didn't come through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we don't worry about that anymore. We've got important
games coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Helling's gritty pitching as much as anything that
brought the Rangers home and kept Seattle at bay. The Mariners,
down 2-0 after the Wilson passed ball and a subsequent run-scoring
grounder by Mike Lamb in the fourth, got single runs in the fifth
and seventh to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Helling's specialty of the day was making sure each rally was
worth just one run. It was just the kind of performance you'd
expect from a battle-tested starting pitcher on a veteran team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it one pitch at a time, one batter at a time,'' Helling
said. ``When you face a lineup like they have in a park where they
rarely lose, you have to. I just focused on doing my job. And if
you can get eight innings out of that, that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers actually had a chance to blow the game open in the
sixth and seventh, leaving the bases loaded in both innings. In the
sixth, Garcia struck out Luis Alicea, leaving the leadoff hitter
pounding the ground in front of home plate with his bat.
</P>
<P>
   An error, a double and a walk loaded the bases with no one out
an inning later with Rob Ramsay pitching. Again the Rangers were
denied. Ramsay got former Mariner David Segui to pop out, and Brett
Tomko came out of the bullpen to shut down pinch-hitter Frank
Catalanotto and center fielder Gabe Kapler.
</P>
<P>
   That was sweet relief for Seattle, but it ultimately didn't
prove to be enough. Lefty Arthur Rhodes, pitching with two out and
a man on first in the eighth, twice thought he had Rusty Greer
struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes did what he wanted to do, hitting Wilson's glove with a
slider and with a fastball. Neither pitch was called a strike by
umpire Scott Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen that umpire before,'' Rhodes said. ``Either
one of those could have been called a strike. When I see him the
next time, I'm going to ask him where the slider was. Where the
fastball was.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in the strike zone, evidently, which meant that Greer drew a
walk, giving Rafael Palmeiro a chance to hit. Palmeiro looped a
soft single to right, breaking the tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just threw me a slider which was kind of tough, actually,''
Palmeiro said. ``I just put the bat on the ball. He's given me
problems. He's very tough on left-handers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes figures to get a chance to prove the truth of that last
statement with very little time elapsing. The A's are stocked from
the bill of their caps to the soles of their spikes with
left-handed sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mariners' bullpen in the next three games, it's a good
bet that all roads lead to Rhodes.

TIGERS HITS GRAND SLAM 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Walking upon hallowed ground that always
has been considered the route to lasting greatness for men of his
profession, Tiger Woods followed a script that has been in place
for years.
</P>
<P>
   He won the 129th British Open at St. Andrews Sunday to become,
at the tender age of 24, the youngest of just five men to win all
four tournaments of the modern grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   That he did it with his fourth brilliant round, a 3-under 69,
was no surprise. That he pushed to 19-under 269 and broke the
scoring record for the 25 British Opens that have been held at the
birthplace of golf was no surprise. That he followed up his
record-smashing 15-shot win in last month's US Open with an
eight-stroke triumph was no surprise. That he navigated the
rock-hard fairways, beguiling swales, and tricky crosswinds coming
off the Firth of Tay to post 22 birdies against three measly bogeys
was no surprise, either.
</P>
<P>
   That's because through it all, you get the feeling he expected
this of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Since he first came into view hitting golf balls at the age of 2
on ``The Mike Douglas Show,'' Woods has had a part on the golf
stage. Now it belongs solely to him, and a casual exchange when it
was all over helps explain why.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some talk about if you went in a bunker this week,''
Woods was asked. St. Andrews's 112 bunkers are death sentences and
there are two golden rules here: Don't go in the bunkers; and don't
forget rule No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Woods looked surprised. ``Bunker?'' he responded. ``I was in a
bunker every day I've been here, but it was at the practice
green.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he followed the script and didn't go in them.
Truthfully, he hadn't even seen the bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   Perfectly aware of all the pressure that ushered him into this
event _ given the hype about his chance to join Gene Sarazen, Ben
Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player as the only men to win the
Masters, US Open, British Open, and PGA Championship _ Woods never
flinched. He parred the first eight holes in Round 1, fell five
shots behind, then played the next 64 majestically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a spectacular performance, to say the least,'' said
David Duval, who was this tournament's Washington Generals to
Woods's Harlem Globetrotters. ``He simply did not make the mistakes
and capitalized on the holes you would expect him to.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as if he needed the challenge, Woods watched approvingly
as Duval birdied the par-4 second and par-4 third, making the turn
in 32 to plug a little excitement into the festivities. Six down to
start, Duval was at 14 under, three behind Woods, whose frontside
35 included a birdie at the par-4 fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got close out there a little bit,'' said Woods, who has won
16 of 17 PGA Tour events in which he has held a 54-hole lead.
``There were only three shots separating us at the time, which
isn't that much considering all the trouble that's lurking out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble? That's not in the script either, as Woods proved once
again around ``the loop'' and onto the backside of St. Andrews.
They are not overly demanding holes, playing much shorter because
of the firm turf, and amount to nothing more than drive-and-pitch
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Simple. So long as you follow the script and hit it straight.
Woods did it almost flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, he played the incoming nine in 11 under, compared
with 2 over for Duval. Ernie Els (69_277) and Thomas Bjorn (71),
who took advantage of a 17th-hole collapse by Duval to finish tied
for second, were each 3 under on the back.
</P>
<P>
   The Duval challenge was short-lived thanks to Woods's mastery of
the back, which started when he drove the 379-yard par-4 10th. He
two-putted from 80 feet to get to 18 under, moving four shots ahead
when Duval was unable to get it up-and-down for birdie from a swale
in front of the green.
</P>
<P>
   They matched par 3s at the 11th, then saw the curtain come down,
for all intents and purposes, at a hole Woods would gladly take
home with him _ the 314-yard par-4 12th. As he had done the
previous three rounds, Woods made birdie, his drive coming to rest
30 feet from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   Two putts, another birdie, and when Duval bogeyed after his
pitch from in front of the green rolled back at him down the slope,
there were six shots separating them with six to play. If it were
match play, it would have been over on the next hole, but because
it was medal, the drama dragged on, coming to a painful scene at
the Road Hole.
</P>
<P>
   Pinned beneath a lip of the Road Bunker, Duval needed four to
get out, made a quadruple bogey, and crashed from a share of second
to a small piece of 11th thanks to an incoming 43.
</P>
<P>
   Woods's walk up the 18th fairway was casual _ another bomb off
the tee into a fairway that can hardly be missed, then a sand wedge
onto the green _ but almost spiritual in a historical context.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 500 years have passed since the game was first played
here and reminders are everywhere _ The Tom Morris Golf Shop, the
Swilken Bridge, the Royal &AMP; Ancient Clubhouse. This is the fairway
where Jack Nicklaus twice made victory walks in British Opens. It
is the town that embraced Bobby Jones, who then told Nicklaus, who,
in turn, told Woods: ``All great golfers must have a British Open
victory on their resume.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitting, then, said Woods, that the stamp of greatness was
applied at the Old Course. He had completed the career grand slam
in 15 tournaments; it took Nicklaus, against whom all players are
measured, 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very special coming up and looking at the surroundings
and to see what was transpiring,'' said Woods. ``It really is hard
to put into words, the emotions and the feelings going through
me.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to fight back tears. He was cool and gracious.
And after making all the right shots, he had all the right words.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he had followed the script perfectly.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO - And on the eighth day we learned why the world's
most wondrous athletes should concentrate on running their races
and not their mouths. The U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials, it
was made shockingly clear Sunday, is not like your Madison Square
Garden variety World Wrestling Federation event.
</P>
<P>
   The order of finish is not preordained. Races can't be counted
on to follow any script at all. And when two mouthy marquee names
absorb terrible blows, they hurt, naturally, but nationalism takes
it on the chin, too.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown between Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene in the
200 meters was supposed to provide a colossal climax to these
Trials. Didn't Johnson and Greene say so in the weeks leading up to
their first head-to-head meeting in the event since 1998? Didn't
NBC design it to be so, using its considerable muscle to move the
event to the end of the Trials schedule?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the world-record holder in the 200, warmed up for the
running of the bull-headed competitors by criticizing everything
about Greene but his taste in sneakers (Johnson and Greene both are
paid handsomely to wear the same brand).
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who was crowned the world champion in the 200 last year
in the absence of an injured Johnson, loosened up by accusing
Johnson of skirting him these past two years.
</P>
<P>
   It made for great theater, if your taste runs to melodramas.
</P>
<P>
   In sports, unlike on the stage, it's hard to know who to cheer,
who to boo. Even when you're positive you know where the plot is
going, you often don't.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the script can seem so predictable as to be almost
trite: Tiger Woods takes the lead at the British Open and doesn't
flinch, becoming the youngest golfer to win all four majors; Lance
Armstrong wins the Tour de France for the second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, though, sports gives us endings out of left
field: Armstrong wins his first Tour de France after surviving an
advanced case of cancer; Jeff Hartwig doesn't make the Olympic team
in the pole vault despite owning the American record in the event.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-meter final was more Hartwig than heartwarming; Johnson
pulled up lame 50 meters into the race with a strained left
hamstring and Greene did the same some 100 meters later. As fast as
two muscles can twitch, the Olympic 200 was stripped of most of its
glamour and the U.S. gold medal prospects in Sydney dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   Or did they?
</P>
<P>
   As Johnson and Greene hobbled into the sunset, their readiness
for Sydney suddenly shrouded in doubt, there was a hue and cry to
let this cruel way of assembling an Olympic team die already.
</P>
<P>
   If past performances were part of the selection equation,
Hartwig would be added to the team. So would Bob Kennedy, the
American-record holder in the 5,000 meters, who was slowed in
recent months by injuries suffered in an auto accident and didn't
run well here.
</P>
<P>
   Canoga Park's Larry Wade, who rebounded from a near-death
experience to nearly make the Olympic team in the high hurdles (he
missed a berth by seven-hundredths of a second) certainly would be
headed to Sydney by virtue of his No. 2 national ranking in the
event last year. So would 100-meter hurdler Anjanette Kirkland, who
had the second-fastest time in her specialty this year but stumbled
on a hurdle in the final Sunday and didn't finish the race.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team would be better for having those athletes on it,
right? That's one side of the argument. The other side is this: If
the Olympic team was picked on previous performances, Gail Devers
probably would have been left off; a month ago, the former UCLA
standout had a boot cast on her foot and didn't think she was going
to be able to compete for a fourth Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there Devers was Sunday, breaking her year-old American
record in the 100-meter hurdles, seizing the moment.
</P>
<P>
   If reputations mattered much, Dominique Arnold's coming-out
party probably would have had to wait. The 110-meter high hurdler
from North Hills turned a few eyes by winning a stacked semifinal
heat that included Wade and 1996 Olympic champion Allen Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He stumbled on a hurdle midway through the final and didn't
finish the race. Once Arnold's tears dry, he'll see that he'll be
faster in the future for having experienced the pressure and the
pathos and the pride, the likes of which cannot be simulated
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. The U.S.
Trials, for all their imperfections, are fair. If they are cruelly
so sometimes, well, then, they are merely mirroring sports itself.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in all the moaning over the misfortune of Johnson and
Greene was this: John Capel, who went on to win the 200, had beaten
both runners in a semifinal heat. Afterward, Capel said a major
part of his motivation going into the final was ``showing the crowd
that I belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, finally, talk that isn't cheap. To show and not tell; isn't
that why we really tune into sports?

PEREZ PROVES LATIN PIONEER 
</HEADLINE>
 OF FAME-PEREZ-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ For a long time, it seemed the wall that
kept Tony Perez out of the baseball Hall of Fame would be too high
for any Latin player to scale in our time. But clearly, times are
changing.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Perez and onetime Red Sox teammate Carlton Fisk received
their Hall of Fame plaques with pride and dignity. It's about time.
The voting of the Baseball Writers Association of America had, in
recent years, produced mixed results and controversy ranging from
favoritism to racism. And it hurts to point that out.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk was no surprise. As the all-time leader for catchers in
games played, he easily earned enshrinement by garnering 397 votes,
after falling short in 1999 because the ballot was stacked with
Robin Yount, Nolan Ryan, and George Brett.
</P>
<P>
   Perez didn't make it, either. He had failed eight straight times
before finishing second to Fisk last winter. Suddenly, the Latin
curtain had been lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade or so, Latin hopefuls have included Minnie
Minoso, Tony Oliva, Dave Concepcion, Luis Tiant, and Perez. They
all had high-profile careers, but for some reason, the votes were
never there. (Players must get 75 percent for election.)
</P>
<P>
   With the breakthrough by Perez, perhaps the voting can now send
the best players to the Hall of Fame. But if Perez hadn't received
some help from fan groups in Cincinnati and Florida, he still might
be on the outside looking in.
</P>
<P>
   What they did comes under the heading of ``old-fashioned
marketing.'' One fan group did an active mail campaign. T-shirts
with Perez's face could be found in Riverfront and Pro Player
Stadium. Perez always had the statistics to get into the Hall and
the support of his teammates from the Big Red Machine, the
Phillies, and the Red Sox. But until the Latin players conquer the
communication gap, there will still be some who don't get the honor
they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will help,'' said Perez. ``We've got some great
talent coming along _ Alex Rodriguez, Sammy Sosa, Pedro Martinez,
Juan Gonzalez. They're having great years and I'd like to see them
make it into the Hall . . . But it would be nice to also see some
of the older players who were our heroes make it into the Hall.
They belong here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez would like to see Concepcion and Pete Rose, two teammates
on the Big Red Machine, in the Hall. But Cooperstown already boasts
three members from that 1975-76 Reds team, as well as its manager,
Sparky Anderson. Joe Morgan and Johnny Bench couldn't miss. In this
era of power-hitting shortstops, Concepcion pales by comparison.
For Rose to make it, the world would have to change, and to be
truthful, the Big Red Machine doesn't deserve five Hall of Famers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played against Tony in 1975 and I found out why they called
him the top dog,'' said Fisk. ``Unless you're the lead dog, the
scenery doesn't change. But it changed for Tony. He was't just a
big dog. He was the lead dog. And the Big Red Machine would have
sputtered without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Most writers will say their voting has nothing to do with race
or origin. Perez was a winner with the Reds, Phillies, and Red Sox
because they were good teams. Fisk and Perez were together in 1980.
Perez, Mike Schmidt, and Rose were teammates in 1983. But there is
such a thing as too much greatness. Carl Yastrzemski, Jim Rice, and
Fisk were teammates in the '70s. Only two are in the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 ballot will include first-timers Kirby Puckett and Dave
Winfield. Rice can't afford another bad year that would put him at
risk of falling off the ballot. The Red Sox can help by finding the
hidden support that has made him a fan favorite since 1974. A good
word from them and his impressive power numbers might do the trick.
If not, he's not going to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that will be awful,'' said Perez. ``The guys whom we're
talking about are the heroes. They should be here because the
feeling is wonderful. It's not a matter of black and white. It's
about the game. I tell players today to respect the uniform you're
wearing. Respect your friends. Most important, respect the game of
baseball. Who knows what can happen to you?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fisk dominated the three-hour program that attracted about
25,000 to Cooperstown High School. It was about half the crowd that
showed up in 1999. Perez and Anderson represented the Reds,
although both played with other clubs. Perez was with the Red Sox
(1980-82) and Phillies (1983) before returning to the Reds
(1984-86). Anderson spent nine years in Cincinnati (1970-78) and
moved to the Tigers (1979-95), winning 2,194 games.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also inducted into the Hall were Norman ``Turkey'' Stearnes, a
Negro leagues power hitter who won six batting titles and topped
.300 in 14 of the 18 seasons he played, and Bid McPhee, who played
between 1882 and 1899, and was the last of the barehanded second
basemen. He had 2,250 hits, mostly for the Cincinnati Red
Stockings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The J.G. Taylor Spink award for print media went to Hal
Lebovitz, a longtime Cleveland writer. The Reds' Marty Brennaman
was named winner of the Ford C. Frick Award.

WOMEN SET EXAMPLE OF CAMARADERIE AT TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Lest one suspect that the elite levels of
track and field are mostly about intrigue, jealousies and
pettiness, a glance at the women's pole vault during Sunday's U.S.
Olympic Trials revealed all the animosity of a teenage sleepover.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of hugs, giggles and a party-down atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge difference between us and the sprinters,'' said
third-place finisher Melissa Mueller. ``Thank God.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever deity or cosmic force is responsible for the
distinctions, a grateful track nation offers its sincere
appreciation. Had the female vaulters been more like the male
sprinters, the carnage might have been unfit for family newspaper
description.
</P>
<P>
   The vault produced a world record in the person of Pocatello,
Idaho, resident Stacy Dragila, destined to be a media darling at
the Sydney Olympics. The sprints, specifically the much-anticipated
200 meters, produced a debacle, destined to make for a months-long
media debate.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene each came up lame
and fell to the track _ a 118-degree surface _ in front of a
stunned sellout of 24,072 sun-blistered fans at Sacramento State's
Hornet Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the most talked-about footrace in years, the 200
instead became the biggest disappointment since ``Harry Potter and
the Goblet of Phlegm.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson last weekend won the 400 meters here and Greene
the 100, meaning both will be in Sydney, neither will run the 200
by virtue of the failures Sunday. They executed the worst nightmare
of USA Track &AMP; Field CEO Craig Masback, who said Thursday that the
endless woofing between Johnson and Greene was fine with him ``as
long as nobody gets hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to say what impact the race's overblown pressure
had on each athlete. It's also impossible to avoid speculation that
the rivalry contributed in some indirect way to the bizarre
similarity and simultaneousness of the injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the source of the problem, it ended an otherwise
superlative nine-day meet on a downer. But only because it was the
last and most anticipated event. Otherwise, Sunday was full of
wonderful stories, the two most remarkable belonging to the women.
</P>
<P>
   In the 800 meters, the three Olympic berths went to one New
Jersey family. Hazel Clark, 22, won the race; her sister, four-time
Olympian Joetta Clark-Diggs, 37, finished third; and sister-in-law
Jearl Miles-Clark, 33 and a three-time Olympian, finished second.
Jearl is married to the crew's coach, J.J. Clark, a middle-distance
All-America runner at Villanova who now coaches at Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat that family tree quickly, and you, too, will win an
Olympic berth. Anyway, it was the first time a family had swept
berths in an Olympic track event.
</P>
<P>
   The other first was watching Dragila clear 15 feet, 2\ inches _
the highest a female earthling has flown aided by mere fiberglass.
While it's true that the women's vault has been around the track
scene only four years _ the event was an exhibition at the '96
Trials _ the improvements have been large.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Mueller and second-place finisher Kellie Suttle,
each of whom reached more than 14 feet Sunday, cleared 11-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us (vaulters) have been through this whole experience
as a group for several years,'' Suttle said. ``The great thing is
that these are people that I would hang out with even if we weren't
pole-vaulting.''
</P>
<P>
   Dare Johnson and Greene to say that.
</P>
<P>
   The camaraderie was evident after Dragila set this meet's only
world record, beating her own mark of 15-1}. Other vaulters rushed
the pit for a group hug. The nearest portion of the crowd _ Dragila
was born and raised in Auburn, Calif., 30 miles away _ cheered
wildly for the hometown hero.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila, 29, came up short three times attempting to elevate her
record to 15-5. That remains for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 16 feet is just around the corner,'' she said. ``But
to set the record and win before the hometown fans, it's a dream
come true.''
</P>
<P>
   As a good but unrecruited track athlete out of high school,
Dragila burned off some of her athletic energy as a cowgirl engaged
in rodeo goat-roping.
</P>
<P>
   She went to Yuba City Community College, where a coach started
her in the heptathlon, then one day asked the heptathletes to pick
up a pole. Dragila said they thought clearing six feet was the
coolest thing. Until they started going upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple trillion times trying to go over the bar were
pretty frightening,'' she said. ``It was scary for me, going upside
down and not knowing where I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear proved not to be a lingering issue. She was recruited by
coach Dave Nielson to Idaho State in Pocatello, where she worked in
virtual isolation, emerging to win the world championship in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Since then she has broken her own world record seven times, has
her own credit-card commercial on TV, is a striking representative
for a potential glamor event at the Olympics and is besieged almost
daily by media requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about today,'' she said, ``was gaining the
confidence to know I can jump even better under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard to know if having the full support of your rivals is
helpful. But there was painful evidence as the Trials ended Sunday
that not having it doesn't help a bit.

FISK HAD HELP REACHING HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ The acceptance speech was reminiscent of a
classic Carlton Fisk at-bat. It was meticulous, comprehensive,
precise, methodical, and detailed.
</P>
<P>
   All right, it was long.
</P>
<P>
   Well, so was his career.
</P>
<P>
   Has anyone ever worked harder in the game of baseball to put
himself in a position to be in a circumstance such as this? The
answer happens to be no.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sunstroke issue, either, so if Pudge Fisk chose to
go a wee bit past the recommended time limit for speeches (a
rumored 15 minutes), so what? This is, after all, Cooperstown.
Where exactly was anyone going to go? Oneonta?
</P>
<P>
   Pudge had to touch a lot of bases. After telling Sparky Anderson
he wished he had been able to play for him, he paid immediate
homage to his high school coach, Ralph Silva, and that was the
first of many thank yous, some extremely emotional. So? Do we want
someone to get up there and say, ``I did it all myself''?
</P>
<P>
   Often portrayed as the quintessential flinty New Englander,
Carlton Fisk revealed himself to have a strongly developed, shall
we say, Alan Alda side. He broke down more than Sparky and Tony
Perez combined _ either four or five times, depending on your
personal definition _ and there certainly was nothing forced or
phony about it.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped up to that podium believing he was fully prepared.
And then he found out a harsh truth. You really can't fully prepare
for anything like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you're ready,'' he would later say. ``It sounded all
right in the bathroom. It sounded all right in front of the mirror.
It sounded all right in the garage. But, wow, is it different once
you get up there. It's like taking batting practice. You can take
all you want, but that doesn't prepare you to face Randy Johnson,
Tom Seaver, or Bob Gibson. It gives you groundwork, but that's
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk dared to stick his toes into at least one pond in front of
which there is generally a large ``No Swimming'' sign. How often
does a newly minted Hall of Famer thank Curt Flood, Marvin Miller,
Donald Fehr, Andy Messersmith, and Dave McNally? But this speaks to
the extraordinary sweep of his career. Carlton Fisk came into
baseball in one era, with one set of stars and one set of life
circumstances (the minimum salary was still four figures), and
played long enough to see more than one set of new stars take over
the game in an entirely new set of life circumstances that would
benefit, among others, himself.
</P>
<P>
   The contractual mumbo-jumbo that led to his becoming a free
agent in December 1980 was an unimaginable concept when he began
his major league career with a cameo (two-game, five at-bat)
appearance 11 years earlier. And by the time he retired (1993), the
labor-management pendulum had swung even more dramatically in favor
of the players.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and how about this? Pudge Fisk managed to bring up the
Vietnam War. In fact, this is where he first broke down, while
mentioning Sgt. Robert Kenyon and Lt. John Carroll. Again, this is
venturing into normally uncharted territory at one of these
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   But the preponderance of his speech was pure baseball-oriented
and was sprinkled with great baseball names ranging from Rac Slider
to Don Zimmer (``Zimmy, you were the easiest manager I ever played
for''). He said the single most memorable piece of baseball wisdom
he ever got came from Mace Brown in the Florida Instructional
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell you somethin' my daddy told me,'' he recalled
Brown saying. ``He said, `If you hadn't wanted to work, you
shouldn't have hired out.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's not as if Pudge Fisk, son of Cecil, was unfamiliar
with the concept of work. We've all heard plenty about his New
Hampshire values. But at this particular point in time, Pudge Fisk
was trying to make his living as a baseball player and he had a
great deal to learn. He needed a boot in the mental fanny, and Mace
Brown gave it to him.
</P>
<P>
   Credit, credit, credit. He gave credit to Darrell Johnson, for
teaching him while they were both in Louisville that ``there was
more to catching than just squatting down and wiggling fingers.''
He gave credit to fitness guru Phil Clausen ``for introducing me
into the world of strength and fitness. I will always remember him
and will be forever grateful.'' He gave credit to Walter Hriniak,
which led to yet another breakdown as he struggled to explain how
much he owed to this oft-maligned batting coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be standing here, Walter,'' he said, dabbing a
handkerchief to his eyes. ``I wouldn't be standing here if it
wasn't for you.''
</P>
<P>
   He went over some of the players he was associated with in both
Boston and Chicago, paying particular tribute to Luis Tiant, ``the
best and most colorful (pitcher) ever in a Red Sox uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was being diplomatic, going into the Hall with a Red
Sox cap and all, but he went out of his way to label his experience
with the 1983 White Sox as ``the most complete season of any team
I've been with.'' That team was beaten by the Orioles in the ALCS,
but Fisk insisted that ``I look back on that, and if only we could
have played a seven-game series, we'd have won.''
</P>
<P>
   The names and remembrances kept coming. He told about the time
he was young and ignorant and found himself making a mound visit to
see crusty Gary Peters, who was in a jam and in no mood for a
conversation with a kid catcher. `` `What the hell are you doing
out here?' '' Fisk recalled Peters saying, only ``those weren't the
exact words.'' He talked about hitting his 300th career homer and
having his son, Casey, then a White Sox bat boy, be the first one
to greet him at the plate. He talked about the thrill of catching
Tom Seaver's 300th victory, which, he said in a mischievous voice,
``was against the Yaaaankees.'' Did he allude to those epic Red
Sox-Yankee games of the 1970s? Is ``Survivor'' a ratings hit?
</P>
<P>
   He talked, time and again, about his love for the game, the
pride he took in playing it so long, and the sheer amount of
drudgery necessary to enjoy the good times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I stayed true to my passion,'' he said. `` 'Cause
there's certainly no glory in those weight rooms, I'll tell you
that.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the glory comes with those three-run homers and in catching
those shutouts and in knowing that you gave everything to help the
cause. And the glory now comes in your induction into the Hall of
Fame. Only Fisk knows everything that took place in order to get
him up on that podium.
</P>
<P>
   Pudge Fisk has never done anything half-assed in his life. What
makes anybody think he was going to start with the most important
speech of his life?

WEBB RUNS AWAY WITH OPEN CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
 WOMEN'S OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURNEE, Ill. _ The words come quickly, straight from the soul.
``I still can't believe I've achieved what I've achieved,'' said
Karrie Webb, all of 25 years old. ``It's been like I've been living
a dream the last five years.''
</P>
<P>
   And when question after question was asked about her dominance
of women's golf compared with Tiger Woods's domination of men's
golf, again the words came quickly. Again straight from the soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I don't understand what I'm doing up here (on the
winner's dais),'' said Webb, the mystery evident on her face. ``I
still don't. I just think I was given a gift to play golf and to be
mentally strong. I don't know how this has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But happened it has as Webb won her first United States Women's
Open Championship Sunday at the Merit Club, shooting 1-over-par 73
Sunday to finish with a 6-under 282 when only two of the other 155
women could best par at all, and they were far back at 1 under.
Webb, like Woods, won the third of the last four majors she has
played.
</P>
<P>
   Webb's victory earned her enough points to qualify for the LPGA
Tour Hall of Fame, a very exclusive club of 19 members. That's what
she's most proud of, Webb said, ``because the LPGA Hall of Fame is
so great. Every single person in there was the best player of her
era.''
</P>
<P>
   And so is Webb. At the age of 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, as I look back at what I've achieved, I just shake
my head,'' said the Australian. ``I can't believe that I've done so
much so soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Australian'' in Webb's pedigree must be emphasized. As
excited as she is to win the Open, she will be as excited ``when I
carry the Olympic torch in Sydney the day before the Olympics.''
And if golf were ever included in the Olympic panoply of sports,
said Webb, ``I'd be there with bells on to represent Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first 14 holes Sunday, Webb sensed the distinct feel of
``USA vs. the foreigners'' among the large galleries here in
America's heartland. Indeed, said Natick, Mass., native Meg Mallon,
Webb's closest challenger, ``I wore my (red, white, and blue) flag
colors today. You kidding me? I tried everything today.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the 15th hole, when Webb spotted a giant flag of
Australia, ``I had to calm myself down. I got tears in my eyes,''
she said. ``It was just a great sight. To see that great big
Australian flag just made me feel really good, that there were some
Australians out there supporting me.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, on the seventh and eighth holes, Webb's only supporting
cast was herself, and that support was none too firm. She started
the day four strokes up on Mallon but a bogey on the fourth
whittled her lead to three. Then, on the par-3 seventh, Webb pulled
her drive into a pond to the left of the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't feel comfortable over the ball,'' Webb said of
her errant drive. ``It just was a bad swing and pretty much as soon
as I hit it I knew it was not going to carry the left edge of the
water.'' Webb got onto the green with a hit from the drop area, but
missed the putt for bogey and her lead was down to one stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth seemed worse. Once again, Webb pulled her drive on
the 522-yard par-5 and her ball landed in the rough. ``And then I
made a pretty stupid choice on my second shot, to try and hit it
over the tree,'' she said. ``I thought I had a pretty good lie in
the rough but it wasn't as good as I thought. And I hit it into the
tree.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mallon comfortably on the green in three, Webb needed four
strokes to finally reach the putting surface. ``I was really
talking to myself then,'' said Webb. ``I was telling myself, `Just
play smart and hang in there. You're still leading the tournament.'
''
</P>
<P>
   And when Mallon missed her birdie putt, settling for a par, Webb
followed by making a tricky 7-footer downhill, also for a par.
Webb, in pieces only moments earlier, regained her equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon birdied the ninth, tying Webb at 4 under par, and it
seemed the race was on. But Mallon made a horrendous approach putt
on the 10th green, leaving a 75-foot putt 20 feet short of the hole
``and that's Karrie right there,'' said Mallon. ``When she smells
blood, she's like an animal.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mallon three-putting the 10th for a bogey, Webb sank her
birdie putt ``and after that,'' said Webb, ``I don't think I missed
a green the rest of the way.'' Mallon, however, was missing putt
after putt, dropping further and further behind Webb.
</P>
<P>
   Webb's lead was five strokes as she began her victory stroll up
the 18th fairway, and ``walking up 18 was the dream of dreams for
me,'' said Webb. ``And to walk it with a friend (Mallon) made it
even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb earned the highest payoff for a woman golfer in a
full-field event, $500,000, topping the $315,000 won by Juli
Inkster in the 1999 Open. And if there was a shadow to dim Webb's
day, it only could be that her victory happened the same day Woods
was garnering so much acclaim at St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say that about my whole career then,'' said
Webb, who won the Open on her fifth try. ``Because I was rookie of
the year the same year he was rookie of the year and I had a great
year last year and he had a great year last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The USGA's Rhonda Glenn then informed Webb, ``It took Tiger six
tries to win the (US) Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Karrie Webb did have one up on Tiger Woods.

MARTINEZ MASTERS WHITE SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-WHITE SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Clear another wall in the Baseball Hall of Artistry for
a masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Turning a tiny hill on the Fenway diamond into a public studio,
Pedro Martinez submitted his tour de force in a dazzling, 1-0
victory Sunday over the Chicago White Sox, a classic he made look
almost as easy as painting by numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, with all but the most distracted of the 33,284 patrons
on their feet, sealed the 15-strikeout performance with a virtuoso
effort that crushed Chicago's last-gasp rally in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   After a freak leadoff double put the tying run on second and the
go-ahead run at the plate, Martinez said afterward, ``I figured it
was time to really bring the best out of me. And the best out of me
is the fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   Unleashing 95-mile-per-hour bullets to one of the most dangerous
teams in baseball, Martinez mowed down the last three hitters,
forcing one to pop up and striking out the other two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about you,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said,
``but for me that's as good as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   With his third shutout of the season, tops in the majors,
Martinez (11-3) helped Boston win the three-game series against the
surging White Sox and kept the Red Sox in second place in the
American League East, a game behind the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, the two-time Cy Young Award winner shared a
hug on the field with his much-maligned rookie teammate, Izzy
Alcantara, who scored the only run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best,'' Alcantara said, ending three weeks of
self-imposed public silence since his lackluster effort contributed
to an embarrassing loss to the White Sox in Chicago. ``The guy is
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the outcome was in doubt until Martinez's final pitch, his
131st of the game. And shortstop Nomar Garciaparra blamed the
perilous ending, in part, on the condition of the Fenway field.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago slugger Magglio Ordonez, hitless in his first three
at-bats, started the ninth by hitting what looked like a routine
grounder to Garciaparra. The shortstop, who had helped save a
victory Friday night by making a spectacular grab of a bad-hop
bouncer, said he was ``definitely confident'' this play would be
easy.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, the ball hit something in the infield dirt, this
time misdirecting it past Garciaparra and sending it into left for
a bizarre double.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unfortunate that the field almost cost us the game,''
Garciaparra said, on his 27th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had no control over the landscaping. But he had the
White Sox within his grasp, paralyzing them with his changeup until
he challenged them in the ninth with his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   With remarkable control, Martinez did not throw three balls to a
batter until the sixth inning. And other than the ninth inning, he
allowed only one runner to reach second base.
</P>
<P>
   That occurred with one out in the second inning, when he hit
Paul Konerko with a pitch and allowed a bloop single to left by
Chris Singleton. But he promptly struck out Carlos Lee and Herbert
Perry to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the premier pitchers in the game, no question
about it,'' said Chicago manager Jerry Manuel, who was ejected in
the eighth inning for complaining that home plate umpire Brian
O'Nora was giving Martinez more strike calls than he merited.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago coach Von Joshua was also ejected when he wagged a towel
at the umps and suggested they were making Martinez's strike zone
as wide as the towel. ``I told them, `If you're going to make it
bigger, let us know about it,' '' Joshua said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Martinez: ``If they made it that big, I would have struck
out 20 of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez overshadowed a superb effort by Chicago's Mike Sirotka
(9-8), who allowed only five hits and two walks. The only Red Sox
run was unearned, made possible when Chicago shortstop Jose
Valentin picked up a routine grounder by Alcantara in the fourth
inning and launched it into the Red Sox dugout, allowing Alcantara
to take second.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, Jason Varitek, singled a 1-2 pitch up the
middle to knock in Alcantara.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring the winning run was sweet for Alcantara, who has been
vilified since his abysmal effort in Chicago. He was 1 for 3 Sunday
and is hitting .391 in 23 at-bats since joining the team last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good because I helped Pedro win the game,'' he said,
struggling to speak English.
</P>
<P>
   As for his misdeeds in Chicago, he said, ``I feel good because I
know every player has a bad day. You just keep your head up and try
to do a good job the next time you get a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had several other opportunities to score Sunday, but
Ed Sprague, batting cleanup in place of the resting Carl Everett,
three times hit inning-ending grounders with runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Sprague said. ``But Sirotka pitched me
very well. He pitched a helluva game.''
</P>
<P>
   As did Martinez, who excelled in the ninth when other pitchers
might have come undone after a bad hop became a leadoff double in a
1-0 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shows how big he is,'' said Varitek. ``He didn't let the
moment take him over. He seized the moment instead of the moment
seizing him.''

ARMSTRONG REPEATS FEAT 
</HEADLINE>
 DE FRANCE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Yellow _ with a splash of red, white, and blue _ was the
color in vogue on the Champs Elysees Sunday as American Lance
Armstrong won the Tour de France for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   His gloves were yellow, his helmet was yellow, and the spokes on
his bike were yellow as he made the journey into Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Standing alone on the podium after the three-week race,
Armstrong took off his yellow cap and put it over his winner's
yellow jersey as ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' played and fans
wildly waved American flags.
</P>
<P>
   Then his wife, Kristin, and 9-month-old son, Luke, joined him on
the stage, and the winner put his son _ also in a yellow jersey _
on his shoulders as he waved to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little guy gave me a lot of motivation in the past
year,'' said Armstrong, 28. ``It's been a hard Tour de France, but
this is my first as a father, so it's very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who earned more than $300,000 for winning the
21-stage, 2,250-mile Tour by 6 minutes 2 seconds over his nearest
pursuer, was the first rider to win the Tour in consecutive years
since Spaniard Miguel Indurain in 1995 (he had won the previous
four years).
</P>
<P>
   But there was such a difference between Armstrong's two
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I arrived in Paris last year mentally tired, and I'm
arriving this year physically tired,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's win was clouded with subplots. First, Armstrong, who
had been diagnosed with testicular cancer in late 1996, became
known as ``Tour leader, cancer survivor.'' Then some of the
European press took it a step further and asked: How could he turn
in a performance like that without being enhanced by drugs?
</P>
<P>
   Hounded by the media, Armstrong seemed to be scowling
constantly. He tried to ingratiate himself to the Europeans by
speaking French, but that didn't work; he said he was
misinterpreted. So he went back to English _ and scowling.
</P>
<P>
   The final zing came when his victory was called hollow because
none of his chief rivals were there. Former Tour winners Marco
Pantani and Jan Ullrich were no-shows, as was former fourth-place
finisher Laurent Jalabert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't control who wasn't here, but I know it made people
critical of my performance, and I thought a lot about that,'' he
said. ``A lot. All winter, all spring, all May and June, and all up
the mountains. There was a whole list of people who thought they
could win the Tour after Lance Armstrong won the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, yes, this is a vindication.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Armstrong seemed at home in the yellow jersey. He
fielded questions about his struggle on the last climb; he admitted
that ``giving'' Pantani the win one day was a mistake, but laughed
it off, calling Pantani ``Elephantino,'' as he's dubbed in the
Paris papers.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong bided his time the first week as he rode well enough
to stay up front, but not enough to take the overall lead, choosing
to let others assume the pressure of wearing the yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the second week, as the Tour arrived at the
Pyrenees, Armstrong made his move.
</P>
<P>
   He plowed up the first mountain stage in the cold and rain to
the summit at Lourdes-Hautacam. He didn't win the stage, but had
ridden well enough to claim the yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   It was, perhaps, his finest moment of the race, he said later.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong never relinquished the yellow jersey, and his lead
would grow to six minutes over second-place finisher Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
   Johan Bruyneel, the director of Armstrong's US Postal Service
team, said his star rider is more formidable than he was in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's stronger now than last year, and is still improving,''
Bruyneel said. ``He's pretty scary; if he gets stronger, it's not
looking good for the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said even though he is glad the talk this year focused
more on his racing than on his having survived cancer, he has mixed
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm still part of that family (of cancer survivors) and
will always be part of that family,'' he said. ``And I knew also
that the media were not going to talk about it that much this year,
because it was such a story last year that I didn't think it would
come about.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains, he won two Tours after being diagnosed
with cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain. That's still
the message he wants to get across.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still healthy, and it's always a struggle,'' he said. ``My
health is not guaranteed forever, but the fact that I'm still here
and cancer-free is still the most important thing in my life. That
will always be my message.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he's not ready to talk about what kind of legacy
he'll leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``With one and two (Tour wins), you don't leave a legacy, and
with three, well, I don't know,'' he said. ``And I don't know how
somebody wins this five times.''
</P>
<P>
   But he will be back to go for a third, he said, and to wear
yellow on the Champs Elysees one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll definitely be back next year, I promise you that,'' he
said.''

DODGERS BACK IN `THICK OF THINGS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Davey Johnson walked into the dugout before
Sunday's game and proclaimed, ``It's a beautiful day in paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers manager didn't have any reason to feel differently
after the game as nearly everything went the Dodgers' way in a 5-0
victory against the San Francisco Giants in front of 47,969 at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Dreifort allowed just two hits and struck out nine in
seven innings, Shawn Green hit two home runs and Todd Hollandsworth
added his eighth homer of the season. The offseason stadium
renovations that moved the backstop 25 feet closer to home plate
also played in the Dodgers' favor with an unusual play that
preserved the shutout, as did home-plate umpire Doug Eddings being
hit and keeping the ball close to the plate on another wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Dodgers two wins in the three-game series
against the second-place Giants and pulled the Dodgers within four
games of first-place Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-4 record on the homestand gives the Dodgers their most
wins in a homestand since they won 8 of 12 in a 1998 homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to have a big homestand, which we did,'' Green said.
``Now we're in the thick of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, who threw 90 pitches, did not give up a hit until
Barry Bonds singled up the middle with one out in the fourth. The
following batter, Jeff Kent, reached on an error when Green and
Hollandsworth collided on the play in right-center field. A wild
pitch with Bonds on third nearly ended the shutout, but the ball
hit the wall behind home plate and quickly bounced back to catcher
Chad Kreuter, prompting Bonds to return to third.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Estalella doubled in the fifth for San Francisco's only
other hit. He also walked with one out in the third to become the
Giants' first base runner.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (6-7) struck out the side in order in the second to
give him four consecutive strikeouts, all against .300-plus
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started in the top of the first,'' Dreifort said.
``Hollandsworth made a great catch. ... Then he hit a home run and
Green hit a home run. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You jump out to a 3-0 lead, it makes pitching a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   A leadoff home run by Hollandsworth and a two-run shot by Green
gave Dreifort the three-run cushion in the first inning. Gary
Sheffield doubled and scored on a two-out bloop single by Adrian
Beltre in the third inning and Green led off the eighth with his
16th homer for the game's final run.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Adams and Jeff Shaw combined to pitch a hitless final two
innings for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an outstanding ballgame,'' said Johnson, whose team
is just the second to shut out the Giants this season. ``(Dreifort)
really didn't have much trouble. (Green) looks like he's heating
up. There's a lot of good things. Two of three against the Giants,
it sets a good tone going on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco starter Russ Ortiz (5-9), a graduate of Montclair
Prep of Van Nuys, gave up eight hits in seven innings. He finished
with seven strikeouts, including the side in order in the fourth.

200-METER DUAL HAMSTRUNG

 OLYMPIC TRIALS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Fighting off the effects of a first-round muscle
twinge that threatened to derail the marquee matchup of the US
Olympic Track and Field Trials, Michael Johnson made it to the
starting line Sunday against rival Maurice Greene.
</P>
<P>
   But in a shocking turnabout, neither he nor Greene could make it
to the finish, leaving both the defending Olympic gold medalist and
the reigning world champion off the US 200-meter team for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world wanted to see a great show, and unfortunately,
me and Michael weren't able to give them the show that they
wanted,'' said Greene, whose 26th birthday was tarnished by the
preliminary diagnosis of a strained left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The standing-room-only crowd of 24,072 in Hornet Stadium
breathed a sigh of relief to see Johnson in the starting blocks for
the semifinal, and both he and Greene, who finished 2-3 behind John
Capel, seemed to come through unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final, Johnson cramped up in the middle of the turn,
grimacing and stumbling as he grabbed his left hamstring in agony
before crumpling to the track. But this would be no reprise of the
1997 Johnson-Donovan Bailey match race, in which Johnson pulled up
midway and Bailey taunted him as cowardly, because even as Johnson
lay there Sunday, Greene slowed to a limp about 60 meters up the
track: His left hamstring, too, had failed him.
</P>
<P>
   Greene was able to walk slowly away, while an obviously pained
Johnson had to be driven off. About 30 minutes later, after easing
himself out of a golf cart and walking gingerly into a news
conference, Johnson said he doubted a pull or tear and cited
cramping in a calf muscle and both hips even before the race,
perhaps a result of the 118-degree temperature on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing because it was a goal of mine,'' Johnson
said of the chance to repeat his Olympic double in the 200 and 400.
``But you can't have everything. I'll move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The carnage left the victory to Capel, a 21-year-old who
withdrew this spring from the University of Florida, where he was a
wide receiver on the football team and the 1999 NCAA outdoor 200
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Capel's 19.85 makes him the sixth-fastest American in history
and ninth best in the world. Floyd Heard's 19.88 was good for
second, while Coby Miller's 19.96 gave him third.
</P>
<P>
   To end a bizarre 12 days here, in which Johnson and Greene
jockeyed for a psychological advantage, they met up during postrace
drug testing. As Greene relayed the encounter, ``I told him to get
well.'' Asked what Johnson replied, Greene said: ``Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men will still be going to Sydney, Johnson in the 400 and
Greene in the 100, provided there is no lingering physical damage
from Sunday's debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Among the day's other action, and there was other action:
</P>
<P>
   --With a 21.94 victory, Marion Jones fended off a late charge by
world champion Inger Miller to win the 200 meters. Coupled with her
earlier victories here in the 100 meters and long jump, the win
keeps Jones on track to pursue five gold medals in Sydney. Miller
was second in 22.09, with Nanceen Perry third in 22.38. ``I'm just
happy these eight days are over,'' said Jones, noting she was
relieved to make the team in all three events and calling the
victory sweep ``a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   --The finish line of the women's 800 meters turned out to be the
site of a family reunion when 37-year-old Joetta Clark Diggs
(1:59.49) nipped 1990 Harvard graduate Meredith Rainey-Valmon for
third, to join 22-year-old sister Hazel Clark (1:58.97) and
sister-in-law Jearl Miles-Clark (1:59.12) to form a cozy US team
for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   --Pole vaulter Stacy Dragila, who grew up in nearby Auburn,
bettered her own world record by a half-inch when she jumped 15
feet 2 1/4 inches to win the competition. After missing three
attempts at 15-5, she waved both arms in salute to the standing
ovation from her hometown crowd.
</P>
<P>
   --Easing any lingering disappointment over failing to make the
100-meter team so she could defend her two-time Olympic title, Gail
Devers broke her American record in the 100-meter hurdles with a
12:33 win that will make her a favorite in Sydney to win her first
Olympic medal in that event, after three unsuccessful attempts.

FRYE RIPS GM OVER STANLEY'S RELEASE

 SOX-FRYE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dan Duquette was in Cooperstown watching Carlton Fisk
be bronzed for immortality Sunday afternoon, so he missed out on
the latest from Pedro Martinez, which deserves to be hung across
the Fens in the MFA, alongside the Monets and Renoirs and all the
other Impressionist masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, of course, is the largest bauble in Duquette's
personal trophy case. Nomar? The Duke has to share the credit for
that one with Wayne Britton and the Sox scouting staff. But
Martinez is no less than a career-maker for the Duke, who twice
traded for him, the second time saving the Sox from permanent
post-Rocket burnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fans have this . . . they hold the general manager
in high regard because of some of the moves he's made, with Pedro,
Jason Varitek, Derek Lowe,'' said second baseman Jeff Frye, whose
recent back spasms have limited him to the role of spectator.
</P>
<P>
   Frye won't begrudge Duquette his due for some of the deals he's
made. But Frye wants people to understand there is another side to
Duquette, one he believes is illustrated by Sunday's release of
veteran Mike Stanley. The ink had not yet dried on Stanley's
walking papers before Garciaparra, who would sooner bat lefthanded
than invite controversy, called it a ``horrible'' move. That was
Saturday, when the Sox were still pretending they hadn't decided
what to do with Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Frye went even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an injustice when a veteran player like Mike
Stanley is just thrown out on the woodpile and not treated with the
respect he's earned,'' Frye said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in the league 14 years, he's the leader on this
team, the classiest guy I've ever played with. He comes to the
ballpark ready to play every day, but you're going to get rid of
him and you have the assistant general manager come down here and
tell him? Then Mike asked if he should even bother coming in today
and he gets a phone call in the clubhouse from the assistant
general manager saying, `Don't bother to come.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that how you get rid of your leaders? I've been here for
five years and I've seen Roger Clemens, Mo Vaughn, Mike Greenwell,
Tim Naehring treated that way. Scott Hatteberg and myself, Reggie
Jefferson, Tim Wakefield, Flash Gordon, John Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flash and Val, they threatened to void their contracts over
some formality or whatever. I know that players take notice of
that. The fans of Boston deserve a winner, but free agents are not
going to come here when they see how players over here _ whether
they're first-year players or 14-year players _ when they see how
they are treated over here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see Mike Stanley yesterday leaving the clubhouse with
almost tears in his eyes and to know what he meant to this team, it
kills you. I just want (Duquette) to be accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley was batting .222 in 57 games when he was released. He
hadn't played in almost three weeks, held hostage on the disabled
list by a nonexistent shoulder injury. Maybe Duquette was buying
time to try to make a deal for Stanley and thus avoid having to
release him. Maybe he was just buying time until he decided what he
wanted to do with the 37-year-old first baseman/DH, who hadn't
homered since May 30.
</P>
<P>
   But Frye said it was wrong to let Stanley go on the basis of 185
at-bats this season, when he had been such a big-game performer for
the Sox in their playoff runs the last two years. Last September,
as the Sox were fighting for a wild-card berth, he knocked in 17
runs and batted .333, then hit .500 against the Indians in the
Division Series. The year before, after coming back to the Sox in a
deadline deal with Toronto, he hit 12 home runs and drove in 32
runs in 47 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of rookie players that could easily be sent
out instead of just dumping the veteran leader of our team in the
middle of a pennant race,'' Frye said.
</P>
<P>
   Where does Jimy Williams fit in all of this? ``He'll land on his
feet,'' Williams said of Stanley. ``You know how I feel. I like
Mike a lot. He's a special player, a special teammate, a big help
for this ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   Does letting Stanley go undermine Williams's credibility in the
clubhouse?
</P>
<P>
   No, said Frye. ``Mike Stanley is one of my best friends on the
team, he's been keeping me posted as to how things are going,''
Frye said. ``I saw Jimy going up to him Sunday and ask him, `What's
going on?' So obviously, Jimy might not have been in the loop, you
know. You ask Jimy, he probably wants Mike Stanley on the team.
When we come to September and need a big hit off the bench, who do
we want, Mike Stanley or a rookie?''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't all about bashing Izzy, either. Somewhat belatedly,
some teammates, including Martinez, have come to the defense of
Izzy Alcantara, who Sunday started for the second time since his
fiasco in Chicago, reached on Jose Valentin's two-base throwing
error in the fourth, and scored the game's only run on Jason
Varitek's single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Izzy's being blamed for a lot of things,'' Frye said,
``when all he did was have one game where he didn't play up to par.
When he's been in there, he's done a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, Frye believes a choice between keeping Izzy or
Stanley is no choice at all. That could be chalked up to
friendship, too, except that Garciaparra, Bret Saberhagen, and to
some degree Martinez (when asked about Stanley, he said Sunday,
``Go ask Duquette'') obviously feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Frye talked about outfielder Curtis Pride passing up a chance to
go to Japan for big money to come here, then getting to play just
nine games before being designated for assignment. He recalled how
pitcher Kip Gross, who had a finger injury, was told by the team
doctor to wear a brace for two or three weeks. According to Frye,
Duquette ordered him to take off the brace and pitch. When he
didn't, he was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about the circumstances of Naehring's career-ending
elbow injury. ``How can you let a guy like that leave this
organization?'' Frye asked. ``A lot of questionable things happened
when Tim had his surgery. How many guys have had that surgery and
come back to play? This guy was one of the favorites of everybody
on the team, another class guy. He has surgery, he wasn't the same,
they just brushed him off. Now he's moving up the chain in the
Reds' organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timmy told me he wants to be the guy who bridges the gap. He
knows what players think and what the front office thinks. We don't
have anybody to bridge that gap here. We've got people who play the
game and people who never played and look at stats. Stats don't
tell people how much heart a guy has.''
</P>
<P>
   Blasting the general manager, of course, is not usually
considered a good career move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't give a (expletive),'' Frye said. ``I'll let my
abilities determine what's going to happen with me. I just think
it's time somebody lets people know what's going on around here.
I've seen too many of my friends just pushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Stanley is kind of like the last straw. If they can do
this to Reggie and Flash and Val and Timmy and Mo, what's going to
happen when Nomar and Pedro get older? Is the same thing going to
happen to them?''
</P>

WHITE SOX BATS SILENCED, NOT MOUTHS 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is the most potent team in baseball, with a major
league-leading 605 runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   It has six players batting .300 or better and a team batting
average of .289. Frank Thomas and Magglio Ordonez have 172 RBIs
between them.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at Fenway Park, though, the Chicago White Sox had those
Murderer's Row bats turned into matchsticks by Pedro Martinez, who
outdueled Mike Sirotka in an all-too-rare 1-0 game.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago had six hits off the Red Sox ace, five of them singles.
The only extra-base hit was a double by Ordonez leading off the
ninth on a ground ball that skidded past Nomar Garciaparra after
hitting the lip of the infield grass.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox batters went down on strikes 15 times _ five of them
called _ and only Chris Singleton, who had two of the five singles,
escaped a Martinez K. Herbert Perry was a three-time victim.
</P>
<P>
   But the masterpiece didn't come without controversy. White Sox
manager Jerry Manuel thought umpire Brian O'Nora was too generous
with the width of the strike zone, and he was given the heave-ho in
the eighth after coming out to question a called third strike
against Ray Durham.
</P>
<P>
   Then third-base umpire Wally Bell ousted hitting coach Von
Joshua after Joshua spread a towel at the foot of the dugout to
weigh in on the strike zone controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just threw the towel down and tried to show him how wide the
strike zone was,'' said Joshua. ``I told him if they were going to
make it bigger, they should let us know.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel had more to say about the issue afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Martinez) didn't need any help, anyway,'' said Manuel. ``But
that's from my point of view. I'm sure from their point of view, we
were probably getting pitches as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the thing that probably bothers me the most is that
(Major League Baseball) sent out a memo about the batter's box, the
catcher's box, and all these different things. Yet still you have
to bring it to everyone's attention to where the guys are, and
things aren't getting enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy's called to stay in a certain place and then a pitch
is away and everyone can tell it's away, it's a different thing. I
just told them I didn't think our guys could cover both sides of
the plate that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the premier pitchers in the game. Today he came at
us soft early, and then when he needed his fastball, he reared back
and had it at the 90-95 that he's accustomed to. He's the elite
pitcher in the league and I'm not trying to take that away from
him. I'm just talking about the strike zone itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Sirotka, the tough-luck loser who fell to 9-8, praised Martinez,
who upped his record to 11-3 and lowered his earned run average to
1.38. Sirotka had no complaints about the umpiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was going to be tough _ that's pretty obvious _ so I
knew I'd have to pitch well,'' he said. ``I haven't seen what he
got, but the umpire was fair to me. I didn't really get a chance to
see what Pedro was doing, but I had no problems with the umpire. He
did a nice job.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Jeff Abbott, who had three hits Saturday, wasn't in
the lineup Sunday, but he still was impressed by Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty amazing when a guy throws 90 the whole game and
gets you out and then all of a sudden in the ninth he has enough to
throw 95,'' he said. ``There's not too many pitchers that can do
that. To gain five miles an hour in the ninth is pretty
incredible.''

DUVAL DIGS HIMSELF INTO A HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-DUVAL-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE BOSTON GLOBE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ When the afternoon began, David Duval
faced a challenge that was almost impossible. It ended with one
just as difficult.
</P>
<P>
   He had failed to overcome a six-shot deficit Sunday against
Tiger Woods in the last round of the 129th British Open, but there
wasn't anyone in the crowd who could say Duval hadn't given it a
spirited run. He had played so well, in fact, that Woods stood on
the 17th green rooting, he said, for ``David to finish second.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the only wish all week that didn't come true for Woods,
because Duval's hopes for second place died a slow, painful death
in a place that has crushed the spirits of golfers for hundreds of
years. They call it the Road Bunker, and if you ignore every other
rule when you tee off on the Old Course at St. Andrews, you must
adhere to this one _ stay out of that dastardly bunker at the par-4
17th.
</P>
<P>
   Fair or unfair? Duval was asked after he had taken four shots to
get out of that bunker. He made a quadruple-bogey 8 and fell from
11 under and a share of second to 7 under and a nine-way tie for
11th. His bank account was noticeably lighter, but his dignity was
intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't judge fair or unfair,'' said Duval, whose frontside 32
was forgotten in his backside 43. ``It is what it is. We can
discuss whether it is fair or unfair, but you know going in you've
got to not hit it in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval stood during the press conference because his back has
bothered him all week, but what really hurt him was the way he
finished. His fourth birdie going out, at the par-4 seventh, had
pushed him to 14 and he trailed Woods by three. Little did he know
it would be his last birdie and as close as he would get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm disappointed with the finish. I thought that
what I accomplished on the front nine was probably exactly what I
needed to do, cut the deficit, and then just start from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But just as everything turned good on the front nine, that's
as bad as everything turned on the back.''
</P>
<P>
   It started at the par-4 10th, when Woods drove the green and
two-putted to get to 18 under, increasing his lead to four shots
when Duval pitched poorly from short of the green and left his
birdie putt dead center, a few inches short.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could have made a difference,'' said Duval.
</P>
<P>
   Woods birdied three of the first five holes on the back; Duval
made bogeys at Nos. 12 and 13, and the deficit was seven shots with
five holes to play. Yes, second place was all Duval had left.
</P>
<P>
   That got buried at the Road Bunker as Duval stared helplessly at
his approach, which had come to rest close to the steep lip. ``I
was figuring out whether it would be smarter to play it left or
right,'' said Duval, who decided that straight ahead was just as
good an option.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. It hit the lip and came back in.
</P>
<P>
   With the second shot out of the bunker _ his fourth on the hole
_ ``you're just trying to look around to figure the best option to
get out,'' he said, but he found none. That, too, hit the wall and
came to rest even tighter against the lip.
</P>
<P>
   Now all Duval could do was backhand it away from the lip, giving
himself a full swing out. He navigated that perfectly onto the
green, but, fittingly, missed the putt for triple bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 181 yards to get by the bunker,'' said Duval. ``That's
what I was trying to do. I hit a poor shot.''

 OPEN-WOODS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ They had travel plans, it was cold, they
hadn't played particularly well, and the week had ended. But one by
one, players who had just been knocked silly by Tiger Woods said
they were sticking around for the finish of the 129th British Open
Sunday at St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to witness history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be back here,'' said Mark Calcavecchia after finishing
his round. ``Yes, I will. Probably when he's on 16, I'll sneak out
of the hotel and walk out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``History is probably the last part. But he's my friend. He's
American. And we both work with Butch (Harmon).''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Elkington also stuck around. Mark O'Meara, perhaps Woods's
closest friend on the PGA Tour, changed his clothes after playing
and headed out to walk in the gallery. The groups that finished
right ahead of Woods _ Darren Clarke and Thomas Bjorn, David Toms
and Loren Roberts, and Tom Lehman and Dennis Paulson _ were also in
the vicinity of the 18th green as Woods closed out his historic
win.
</P>
<P>
   To many players, it was a day that validated their firm belief
we are watching the game's greatest player ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't long ago when I said there'd never be another Jack
Nicklaus, but we're looking at one. He is it. He is the chosen
one,'' said Calcavecchia, a Tour member since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   As a young kid growing up in North Palm Beach, Fla.,
Calcavecchia idolized a local resident named Jack Nicklaus. ``I met
him when I was 13. He was great to me back then, and I played with
him when I was 14. I still don't think I've ever been that nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you want my honest opinion, (Woods) is the best player
who has ever played the game. Right now. And he's only 24. Jack
Nicklaus was the greatest of all time and he's got the greatest
record of all time, and by the time all is said and done, maybe
he'll still have the greatest record of all time. But if Jack were
in his prime today, I don't think he could keep up with Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong stuff, but there were similar sentiments from many
players.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson has won five British Opens, two Masters, and a US
Open, some going head-to-head with Nicklaus. So he saw firsthand
the greatness of the Golden Bear. What he has seen in Woods,
however, makes him shake his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone is going to have to use some flubber in the bottom of
their shoes to be able to jump over (the bar that Woods has
raised),'' Watson said. ``He is something supernatural.''
</P>
<P>
   So utterly dominating was Woods that the local bookmaker took
him off the board. Usually you can bet each day on a player to win
the tournament, the odds naturally longer the further back a player
stands. But there was no action being taken on Woods, who went off
at 15-8, the smallest odds ever.
</P>
<P>
   All of which put a damper on a great golf tournament, said Fred
Couples. ``If he wasn't in (the field), it would be a thrilling
finish,'' Couples said. ``This is crazy, shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to O'Meara, who has nurtured Woods since the kid came on the
Tour in the fall of 1996. ``It doesn't surprise me to see what he
is doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara won the Masters in 1998, but Woods already had earned a
green jacket. It was when O'Meara followed that win at Augusta with
a British Open triumph at Royal Birkdale that Woods took note.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought the claret jug back on the plane to the States with
Tiger, and he looked at it. He held it, and he knew that he wanted
it someday,'' O'Meara said.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a matter of time, because Woods shatters one of the
great myths that has been perpetuated in golf, said Calcavecchia.
``Nobody has it all, but he does,'' Calcavecchia marveled. ``Jack
had it all mentally, but I think Tiger is even his equal
mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   But golf being golf, ``He's not going to do this every major,''
Calcavecchia added. Then he paused. ``At least I hope not.''

NO FUN FACING WOODS ON COURSE _ OR OFF 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-PLAYERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ It is a tired refrain, one many of them
have heard weekly since January, so it's no surprise that
frustration is setting in for those who must compete against Tiger
Woods. Not only can't they win, they can't turn around without
having a reporter ask about the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one way, it's incredible to watch someone who is so much
better than the rest of the world,'' said Ernie Els, ``but on the
other hand, it's tough to sit down and talk about it all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Els had made a hasty exit Saturday after effectively shooting
himself out of the 129th British Open with a 2-under 70. He was
discouraged and knew that everything would center around Woods.
Nothing personal, but he wasn't in the mood for that.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, after posting a 69_277 that pushed him into a tie for
second, Els relented, though the pain was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm watching on film, seeing Tiger making putts and I'm not
making those putts,'' said Els, a runner-up in all three majors so
far this season. He pondered another question, shrugged, and seemed
to sign the declaration of surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I really played as good as I could, I don't think I
would have got to 20 under like Tiger. I was eight shots behind. I
really did not feel like going out there and trying to fight to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Els wasn't alone in his exasperation. Davis Love made a quick
exit from the scorer's trailer, waving off requests to talk. Even a
round of 67_281 (he tied for 11th) had not lifted his spirits.
</P>
<P>
   In his pre-tournament press conference, Colin Montgomerie faced
an early question about Woods's domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``First American question,'' snapped Montgomerie, ``first
question about Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   You've got to understand, said Paul Azinger, that frustration
has set in. ``What really stinks about it,'' he said, ``is the fact
that you can't control (Woods). In every other sport you can
control your opponent except for in this sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us, I think, are taken aback by it a little bit,'' said
Azinger. ``If I were in my 20s and knew that I'd never have a
chance to be the best player, or have no hope of being considered
the best player, that would be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kite is not one of those younger guys; he's a member of the
Senior PGA Tour. Though impressed with Woods, he's more
disenchanted with the lack of competition. ``Unfortunately, nobody
is stepping up,'' said Kite, who shot 74_294 here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a dominant player on the US Tour until Tiger
came along. I just wish David (Duval) or Phil (Mickelson) or Colin
(Montgomerie) would win one so people would get off their backs,''
said Kite. He was talking about major championships, of which Woods
has now won four. Duval, Mickelson, and Montgomerie are majorless
and Kite theorizes this is a big reason why these marquee names
have never been able to challenge Woods. ``Jack (Nicklaus) had
Arnold (Palmer) and Gary (Player) _ we don't have that now.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested that Woods was handling the pressure this
week, Kite bristled. ``What pressure? He's got a six-shot lead.
There isn't any chance of catching him unless he sleeps in.''
</P>
<P>
   After building a three-shot lead through 36 holes, Woods was
asked what he would think if he were in his opponents' shoes. He
paused, shook his head no, and said, ``I can't say because I'm not
in their shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   They know that. They've been hearing it all year.

HARKES STEPS UP AS BACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ When John Harkes played the back position
Saturday, it was only the second time in his soccer career he had
done so. The first time? More than 10 years ago, in a University of
Virginia intrasquad scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution captain stepped in for Mauricio Wright, sidelined
with three yellow cards, because the only other center back, Brian
Dunseth, was out with a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were low in the number of backs, so (coach) Fernando
(Clavijo) and I talked about playing there, with me giving some
experience to the young backs that we have,'' said Harkes, whose
Revolution beat the Earthquakes, 2-1, in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed myself back there, although I haven't played the
back position much. The key is being sharp at all times. There's
certainly not as much running back there as there is at the
midfield position.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkes, a midfielder by trade, said it takes focus to refrain
from creeping up in the play. ``You have to maintain your
discipline and stay back and pass the ball,'' he said. ``You have
to make sacrifices for the betterment of the team. You have to play
for one another out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory marked two road wins in a row for the Revolution,
who defeated the Kansas City Wizards, 1-0, Wednesday. New England
takes its 9-9-5 record (32 points) into an 11-day All-Star break.
Seven of the remaining nine games are at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had two great wins in a row, and both were hard to come
by,'' Harkes said. ``We happened to catch Kansas City when it
wasn't performing well, while we were. And then with this win
against San Jose, we got the extra three points that we needed and
we're in the (playoff) hunt because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkes believes the time off will be good for the Revolution,
giving the injured players _ including newcomer Eric Wynalda (right
calf) _ time to heal. It also will allow newcomer Juan Luis Morales
to get in shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good having the time off after taking some long trips,
jumping on planes, and being in hotels. This gives us time to
regroup,'' Harkes said. ``Plus, it gives us more time to work on
things we need to do as a team, like our patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, who have made the playoffs only once in the four
Major League Soccer seasons, look much better now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rough spell for us, only making the playoffs
once,'' Harkes said. ``It helps that our team has a better attitude
this season, and the playoffs is in our grasp.''

   Heard finally benefits from twists of fate in 200
</P>
<P>
   BY JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene came to
rewrite history, but a lesson in perseverance broke out.
</P>
<P>
   If you're disappointed that the vaunted Johnson-Greene 200-meter
showdown limped into infamy, don't be. This was better.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the greatest Olympic story isn't the one you read
about, but the one you forgot about. Sometimes the men with the
golden shoes and the neon running suits can learn something from a
guy with a solid gold heart.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Heard was Michael Johnson before there was a Michael
Johnson. Heard was Maurice Greene when Greene still was running
middle-school meets.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere along the way, Heard, the Texas A&AMP;M ex, became the
forgotten Santa Monica Track Club sprinter and the epitome of
heartbreak and disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic Trials can be cruel,'' Heard, 34, said. ``They can
be the cruelest thing in the world. I know.''
</P>
<P>
   If you considered Johnson's leg cramp and Greene's hamstring
strain in Sunday's 200-meter final a tough break, then you don't
know tough breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Heard was the No. 1-ranked 200-meter man in the world in 1987, a
sizzling sprinter considered a better bet for gold at the 1988
Games than even his world-class Houston training partners _ Carl
Lewis, Leroy Burrell, Michael Marsh and Joe DeLoach. But before the
1988 Trials, Heard suffered a stress fracture in his foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `OK, I'll be there in '92,''' Heard said.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't. Heard underperformed, was outdone in 1992 and
didn't make the team. In 1996, he made it into the 200-meter finals
again but finished seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The once-golden career seemed over. For nine years, Heard
trained so much in the background of his Santa Monica Club
teammates that his nickname should have been Wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   For nine years, he won so many international sprints and even
performed at the World Championships, but the world's greatest
Games never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to watch the Olympics because it hurt so much,
but I always did because those were my teammates out there,'' Heard
said. ``We had some great ones _ Carl, Leroy, Mike, Joe. But I was
the only one that never made it to the Olympics. It was very
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson and Greene were asking ``Why me?'' after both came up
short on Sunday, they don't know what self-doubt and angst truly
can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Olympics didn't happen, I thought I could have ended my
career still satisfied,'' Heard said. ``This sport has always been
fun and something I love. You don't go through what I've gone
through if you don't love competing. But I guess in my heart I
always would have had a little emptiness.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dream finally was fulfilled Sunday. The most heroic
performance was the one you never thought you'd see.
</P>
<P>
   Some 14 years after bursting onto the international scene as a
phenom every bit as touted and talented as Johnson, Heard did what
Johnson and Greene could not. He finished second behind youngster
John Capel to qualify for the Olympic team in maybe the fastest 200
field ever to perform on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   Some 12 years after first breaking the 20-second barrier and
turning so many heads, Heard finally did it again. Only months
after facing long odds in his attempt to try one more time to
fulfill his Olympic dream _ ``To be honest, I had some doubts
myself,'' Heard said _ the long, solitary hours of training at
Robertson Stadium finally led to the ultimate prize.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hype and contention between Johnson and Greene,
perseverance and maturity won out in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Santa Monica colors are flying again,'' Heard said. ``I
can't explain the feeling. I just ran my very best. I didn't really
know what was going on behind me with (Johnson and Greene). I just
knew that I had to make this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the hype never bothered me at all. At 34, I've seen a lot
of things in my career. I've heard it all. In fact, everything with
those guys (Johnson and Greene) I thought was kind of funny.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you think Heard's making the team was a fluke, some kind
of lucky break considering the tough breaks experienced by Johnson
and Greene, you weren't paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Heard's first-round qualifying time in the 200 was barely more
than one-tenth of a second off Johnson's qualifying time _ and
Johnson was pushed in his race, while Heard cruised.
</P>
<P>
   And in Sunday's semifinal round, Capel, who went on to win the
final, defeated Johnson head-to-head, while Heard's semifinal time
was .15 seconds faster than Greene's.
</P>
<P>
   This was billed as Johnson and Greene's race, but it belonged to
Capel and Heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw Floyd run (20.18) on Saturday, I knew he was
ready,'' said Lewis, who flew into Sacramento only hours before
Sunday's final to offer support to his teammate and business
partner. ``The (Johnson and Greene feud), I could care less about
that. That's not why I was here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was here to see Heard finally fulfill a dream. When Heard
walked off the track Sunday, the first person to congratulate him
was Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us that trained together all those years are retired,
so nobody counted (Heard) as a contender,'' Lewis said.``But he ran
the race of his life. For him to go through what he did and do what
he did, it's just unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Making history took a back seat to making amends.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I heard from Carl all day was, `You're going to make this
team. . . . You're going to make this team,''' Heard said. ``I
honestly didn't know, but I never gave up, I'll say that. I don't
think anyone here knew better than me that the Olympic Trials can
break your heart. But you know, they can make you feel like you're
on top of the world, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Heard is.

   Six-homer binge in-Spiers Astros
</P>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   If asked to pick the Astro most likely to have two homers and
six RBIs in a game that included a grand slam and an unprecedented
curtain call, anyone who chose Bill Spiers would be a candidate for
a straitjacket.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it was a crazy day at Enron Field, where the Astros
walloped the St. Louis Cardinals 15-7 Sunday before the fifth
consecutive sellout crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not me,'' Spiers said of his powerful performance. ``I
was lucky, real lucky. They always kid me around here about having
no pop, which I don't. I just got lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it was more than luck.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers, the utility player deluxe, led a 14-hit attack for the
Astros, who won a series for just the eighth time this season. They
took two of three games from the National League Central-leading
Cardinals and won consecutive games for the first time since June
13-14 at Colorado and for the first time at Enron Field since May
25-26.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the first game of the series by a season-worst 11
runs, the Astros outscored St. Louis 25-12 over the final two
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at this and see how strange this season has been,''
said Astros right fielder Lance Berkman, who had two of the Astros'
franchise-record-tying six home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the talent to play with anyone. We just haven't played
or pitched with any consistency to give ourselves a chance. The
pitching is getting better, and position by position, we're as good
as any team in baseball. We just haven't put it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the past two days can serve as a beginning for the
Astros, who have played .500 baseball over the past 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing some good signs,'' said Spiers, who was 3-for-5.
``Hopefully, we will play better ball for the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a breakout day for Astros righthander Shane
Reynolds, who snapped a career-high-tying four-game losing streak,
not to mention a four-game losing streak at Enron Field dating to
May 27. Overall, Reynolds (7-7) had not won since June 13 at
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely felt good to win again,'' said Reynolds, who
allowed six runs (five earned) in 6 innings. ``The offense and
defense were just great. Those guys did their jobs, no doubt about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio and Julio Lugo joined Spiers in the three-hit club,
while Berkman and Richard Hidalgo each drove in three runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took a 3-0 lead in the first inning on Moises Alou's
sacrifice fly and a two-run double by Hidalgo. The trouble
continued for Cardinals starter Andy Benes (10-5) in the second
when the Astros scored six runs on six hits, including four home
runs _ a franchise record for a single inning _ by Spiers, Jeff
Bagwell, Berkman and Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   By allowing four home runs in an inning, Benes tied a
major-league record. The infamous feat had been accomplished on 16
previous occasions, most recently by Astros righthander Jose Lima,
who allowed four homers in an inning earlier this season against
the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Benes had not allowed a home run in the 27 innings
leading up to the power surge.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' offense took the next four innings off, allowing the
Cardinals to pull within three runs entering the bottom of the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vina's three-run homer started the Cardinals' comeback
bid in the fifth after Reynolds had held them to just two hits over
the first four innings. St. Louis added another run in the sixth,
and Fernando Tatis' two-run single decreased the Astros' lead to
9-6 in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``By that point, the momentum had shifted the other way,''
Astros manager Larry Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   That soon changed.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros put the game under lock and key with six runs in the
seventh on Spiers' third career grand slam and a two-run homer by
Berkman, giving them a season-high 15 runs for the game.
</P>
<P>
   After going 113 at-bats since his only other homer this season,
Spiers hit two in a span of four at-bats Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The grand slam moved the Enron Field crowd of 42,684 to elicit a
curtain call from Spiers _ the first curtain call in the brief
history of the Astros' new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a curtain call before, and I wasn't going out
there for that one,'' the extremely reserved Spiers said. ``But the
guys kept pushing me out there. It happened so quick, but it was
nice. I'm just trying to do my job and do what they ask me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he went above and beyond.

   British Open a Slam dunk for Woods
</P>
<P>
   By EDDIE SEFKO
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ There's no defense in golf. You can't
tackle your opponent. You can't put a hand in his face. And you
can't pick up his ball and throw it in a bunker.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean people haven't thought about it with Tiger
Woods. When he's running into the history books while he's running
away with the British Open by eight strokes, crazy notions enter
their mind. They'll even tell him about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the players, I'm going to say it was Calc (Mark
Calcavecchia), was imitating the Bill Murray line about slicing the
hamstring,'' Woods said. ``He did it so well. It's a funny line.
And he said it just like him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Caddyshack line called for cutting Judge Smails' hamstring.
``He'll leave everything out to the right; he'll quit the game,''
says Murray's character, assistant greenskeeper Carl Spackler.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really stinks about it is you can't control him,'' said
Paul Azinger. ``In every other sport, you can control your
opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   There's not a thing anybody can do about Woods, except try to
get better. A lot better.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' victory Sunday on a cool, cloudy Scottish evening gave
him a career Grand Slam, putting him in elite company with Jack
Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval tried to hang with Woods in the final round. But he
faded on the back nine and crashed with a quadruple-bogey 8 on the
17th hole. Runners-up Ernie Els and Thomas Bjorn fired and fell
back, and nobody else could get close as Woods shot a closing 69
for a 72-hole total of 19-under 269.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he had done in winning the U.S. Open by 15 strokes last
month, Woods left everybody in awe again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to do this every major _ at least I hope not,''
said Calcavecchia, a former British champ. ``You just have to take
your hat off to him. The way he has dominated in today's game, when
there are as many good players as there are, is really incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that long ago that I said there would never be
another Jack Nicklaus. But in fact, we're looking at one. He is the
chosen one. He's the best player who has played the game right now.
And he's only 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Nicklaus was the greatest of all time, and he has the
greatest record of all time. And when it's all said and done, he
still might have the greatest record of all time. But if Jack was
in his prime today, I don't think he could keep up with Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Woods' numbers are as good or better as any that have
been amassed in the past 50 years:
</P>
<P>
   At 24, he's the youngest player to complete the career Grand
Slam, beating out Nicklaus, who did it when he was 26.
</P>
<P>
   His 19-under score is the lowest in relation to par in any major
championship.
</P>
<P>
   He has won 13 of the last 23 PGA Tour events he has played,
which means he's winning 57 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   He has won six times in 2000 and 14 times since the beginning of
the 1999 season. The last player to win 14 times in two years was
Nicklaus in 1972-73.
</P>
<P>
   He is only the third British Open champion to shoot four rounds
in the 60s, joining Greg Norman in '93 at Royal St. George's and
Nick Price in '94 at Turnberry.
</P>
<P>
   He's the sixth player to win the U.S. and British Opens in the
same year and the first since Tom Watson in '82.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, he now holds three major championship trophies,
including last year's PGA, which he will defend next month. The
last person to hold three majors at the same time was Nicklaus in
'72.
</P>
<P>
   He's missed only one cut in 83 tournaments as a professional.
</P>
<P>
   There now are only 24 players in history who have more Tour wins
than Woods' 21. If he doesn't win anymore this year and averages
four per year starting next year, he'll pass record-holder Sam
Snead's 81 victories in 2016, when he's 40.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods, who constantly uses Nicklaus as his yardstick,
doesn't feel compelled to make comparisons at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you ever want to be the next Tiger Woods or the
next Jack Nicklaus or the next Michael Jordan or whatever,'' Woods
said. ``Try to be the best you can be. Don't try to be like us. Try
to be yourself. That's something I've tried to do. I will continue
to try to do that, and I hope other kids will try to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there is no way to compare Woods with anybody who is
actively playing and competing on the PGA Tour. And it's getting
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it is,'' said Els. ``In one way, it's incredible to
watch a guy play so much better than the rest of the world. And in
another way, it's tough to sit down here and talk about him every
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I might have to get used to it. I'm probably living in an
era with the next great player. I've got to play really well, and
he has to have a mediocre week (for Els to win).''
</P>
<P>
   Woods mowed down 22 birdies for the week and had only three
bogeys. The one he had Sunday, on the 17th, didn't matter because
he had a nine-shot cushion at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Added Duval: ``It was a spectacular performance to say the
least. He simply did not make the mistakes and capitalized on the
holes you expect him to capitalize on. He's playing very
efficiently. I think that's the best way to put it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Faldo, whose record of 18 under par at St. Andrews is _
like everything else this week _ history, has some advice for
anybody who plans on taking a bite out of Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these 15-year-olds, they have to stop eating the
doughnuts,'' said Faldo. ``He's thrown all these old myths out the
window _ that you can't physically train for golf, that you can't
be strong or you'll lose your touch. It's no good sitting back and
thinking, `I won't go and practice because it's raining.' If you're
going to compete and beat Tiger, you have to be out there doing as
much if not more.''
</P>
<P>
   He's stronger and smarter than everybody else in the game. And,
maybe, than anybody else who's ever played the game.

Capel takes 200 as Johnson, Greene go down
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JERRY WIZIG
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Talk about anticlimactic. Even in the
dullest of pre-hyped Super Bowls, they play 60 minutes of football.
</P>
<P>
   But in the hyped-up Super Bowl of the 2000 U.S. Olympic Track
and Field Trials, the men's 200 meters, world-record holders
Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene lasted 50 and 100 meters,
respectively, in Sunday's final event of the closing program.
</P>
<P>
   Before Johnson and Greene hit the track, Marion Jones assured
herself of an opportunity to go for five gold medals at the Sydney
Olympic Games, winning the 200 in a sizzling 21.94 seconds to add
to her previous wins here in the 100 and long jump. Assuming her
inclusion on the 400 and 1,600 relays, Jones finally was able to
take a deep breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``To use one word, I'm glad it's over,'' she said. ``That's more
than one word, but it explains how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, fastest in history in the 200 and 400, underwent
treatment for what was diagnosed as a cramp in his right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed I won't be running in Sydney in the 200, but
I'm 32 years old and at the end of my career,'' Johnson said. ``But
I have a gold in the 400 and the (1,600) relay, and I can try for
another in the 400 (in which he was first here). I don't think it's
a tear or anything serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had felt a twinge in the left quadriceps in Saturday's
first round of the 200 but declared himself healthy after warming
up for the semifinals, in which he and Greene were seeded
side-by-side in the same heat.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours later, Greene, like Johnson before him, was
transported via golf cart to the press tent. Greene's trainer
diagnosed his injury as a strained hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't know if there is a tear until the doctor looks at
it,'' Greene said. ``I felt OK in the semifinal and just intended
to run my best. I don't know how long it would take for me to get
back if it is a tear. I don't think it was the heat or the rivalry
(with Johnson). My body wasn't ready to do what I asked it to do,
and it stopped me.''
</P>
<P>
   With only five runners crossing the finish line (Brian Lewis was
a scratch), John Capel, a Florida sophomore who gave up his
scholarship earlier this season to start a professional track
career, won the 200 in 19.85 seconds. Earning his first Olympic
berth in second was Floyd Heard, 34, in 19.88.
</P>
<P>
   Both Capel and Heard, a Houstonian, ran their lifetime bests.
Auburn senior Coby Miller was third in 19.96, the first time in
Trials history all three Games qualifiers have cracked 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Johnson said he would not accept a ``wild card''
into the 200 at the Olympics even if offered one as defending
champion, a procedure used in the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it (wild card) was already there, OK, but not now,'' he
said. ``You guys (the press) would kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson added: ``I think we all learned a lesson from this
(pre-race hype). Somebody got hurt the last time, too (his own
quadriceps injury during the 1998 match race with Donovan Bailey,
which Johnson also failed to finish). All it did was (tick) all the
other guys off. I've been through these kinds of `showdowns'
before, and once it gets rolling, you can't stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Jones talked briefly with Johnson between the semis
and finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pooped and worried about having time (nearly two hours)
to recover from it,'' Jones said. ``I told Mike, `They're trying to
kill us,' and he said, `Get used to it. It gets worse at Sydney.'''
</P>
<P>
   Inger Miller, the 1999 world champion, was second behind Jones
in 22.09 in just her fourth 200 of the year. University of Texas ex
Nanceen Perry was third in 22.38.

Enjoy the ride with `chosen one'
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ This is what greatness looks like.
</P>
<P>
   Its eyes are cold and deadly. Its arms are long and larcenous.
It hangs over the history and the heather like a cloud, and it
hangs around the pins and the record books as if they were a
birthright.
</P>
<P>
   It can have a prickly disposition. An inexorable heart. It
dresses in red and also wears the emotions of a snorting, charging
bull.
</P>
<P>
   It scores in smothering waves _ sudden, shuddering tsunamis.
</P>
<P>
   Greatness looks like the perfection of Tiger Woods'
follow-through on a tee shot and the zero-gravity ease with which
his ball always seems to float toward the hole.
</P>
<P>
   With Woods taking the fabled Old Course at St. Andrews by the
throat for his first British Open title _ does this make him the
Claret Jug-gernaut? _ these major tournaments are becoming less
competition and more coronation ceremony than anything this side of
Westminster Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's latest roar has made it clear he is as singular a figure
_ in his or any other sport _ as there is on the landscape today.
</P>
<P>
   He dominated the U.S. Open last month at Pebble Beach, and he
mastered the most confounding of games again in the land of its
Scottish roots. And the margin both times was as large as the ocean
that separates the countries.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, he was 19 under par, an all-time best for any
major, and his closest pursuers _ Ernie Els and Thomas Bjorn _ were
eight shots back. At one point, David Duval drew within three
shots, but he slowly cracked and then crumbled at the Road Hole,
spending more time in the bunker than Eva Braun. But those are mere
facts, which no longer define Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   He has gone beyond athlete to the artist's realm now, operating
on a level most of us cannot comprehend, speaking a language that
is pure genius with his clubs, his shots, his unbending, laser-beam
focus, and his sheer will.
</P>
<P>
   By lapping the field, he stripped this venerable event as bare
as the female streaker who did a maypole dance around the pin on
the 18th green.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's game should not be dissected, merely admired. It should
not be placed in a display case in a museum behind protective
glass, but embraced and enjoyed by an appreciative world that,
because of him, is now flocking to what was once an elitist sport.
</P>
<P>
   The official list now tells us he joins four golf immortals _
Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player _ as the
only players to win the modern Grand Slam in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Our own eyes tell us that he stands on a Mount Olympus peak of
his own, because he is only 24 years old. That winning smile is so
young and childlike, yet the whole face seems to possess the
Yoda-like wisdom of a thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny Friday afternoon, the Open bid farewell to Nicklaus,
to date the greatest golfer who has ever lived. In the seaside
chill of Sunday evening, the home of the Royal &AMP; Ancient may have
seen everything we ever thought we knew about the future of golf
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that long ago when I said there'd never be another
Jack Nicklaus,'' said Mark Calcavecchia. ``But we're looking at
one. He's it. He's the chosen one.''
</P>
<P>
   We should not try to dig too deep to find out what makes Woods
tick or what will tick him off. Instead, we should understand that
he possesses a special gift and let him unwrap it and reveal it at
his own pace and time.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger has the aura of Muhammad Ali without the arrogance and
confrontational nature. He has the raw talent, the taste for blood,
the killer instinct of Michael Jordan and, in his sport, no
teammates to occasionally weigh him down.
</P>
<P>
   After conquering the Colonies, he came to Britain and did a
reverse version of the Beatles' invasion. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like
Lennon and McCartney, he is writing words and music that will
endure, and the key for the rest of us is to let his deeds and
accomplishments sink in, store the images, and be able to say years
from now that we were there. We saw him.
</P>
<P>
   They still talk at St. Andrews of Old Tom Morris and Young Tom
Morris, the father-son combination who were the early Open dynasty.
But they have never, ever seen anything like Woods.
</P>
<P>
   He won the two toughest tournaments in the world by a combined
23 strokes, and he did it without making a single shot that truly
sticks in your mind. That's because he was clean, efficient and
skilled, like a Swiss watchmaker or a surgeon. Yet full of poetry,
listening to his own muse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can eliminate some of the loose shots in my game,'' he said.
``No doubt about it. I can play better.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what greatness sounds like.

DODGERS ACTIVATE WHITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Devon White's pregame workout was enough to
convince the Dodgers he didn't need to wait another day.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after manager Davey Johnson said he expected White to be
activated from the disabled list today, the Dodgers announced that
the outfielder was being reinstated before Sunday's game against
the San Francisco Giants. To make room for White on the 25-man
active roster, right-handed pitcher Al Reyes was optioned to
Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Although White did not play Sunday, Johnson said he wanted him
available as a pinch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   If the seven-time Gold Glove winner replaces Todd Hollandsworth
in center field, he should help solve the Dodgers' search for a
leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   White is hitting .289 with three home runs and nine RBI in 22
games this season. He batted leadoff in two rehabilitation starts
for Single-A San Bernardino and had two hits and reached base in 4
of 9 plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' recent search for a spark at the top of the order
included a different leadoff hitter for each game of the three-game
series against San Francisco. Catcher Paul LoDuca even was used in
the top slot Friday.
</P>
<P>
   White, 37, was placed on the disabled list May 5 after partially
tearing his left rotator cuff diving for a ball.
</P>
<P>
   In his only appearance with the Dodgers, Reyes retired all three
batters he faced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A bid to stay: Shortly after learning of White's activation,
Hollandsworth did his best to show he deserves to remain in the
starting lineup. He ran down a fly ball in the gap by Marvin Benard
to start the game, then hit a home run on the first pitch of the
bottom half of the first. Hollandsworth, who also singled in the
seventh, entered the game batting .236.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling at home: The Dodgers' win Sunday gave them a 7-4 record
on the 11-game homestand, boosting their season record at home to
better than .500. For most of the season, the Dodgers have had a
winning record on the road, but struggled at home. They depart on a
10-game road trip with winning records at home (26-23) and away
(25-23).
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers play 19 of their final 28 games at home.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Catcher Todd Hundley (fractured thumb) is
eligible to come off the disabled list today but likely will not be
activated for at least another week, according to Johnson. ...
Shawn Green and Gary Sheffield had hitting streaks of six and 12
games respectively snapped Saturday. Both had hits Sunday. ...
Adrian Beltre batted .385 in the homestand, getting at least one
hit in eight of the 11 games, to raise his average from .251 to
.268. ... Carlos Perez beat Giants pitcher Kirk Rueter in a pregame
Oreo stacking contest Sunday. They were joined by 10 children who
were local finalists in the promotion sponsored by Major League
Baseball. The winners from each age group earned a $10,000 savings
bond and advanced to the regional finals to be held at Dodger
Stadium in September.

 &HT;    GROWTH FRIENDLY TO PEOPLE(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By MARK SHAFFER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back when the Fain family ran cattle on their ranch along
Arizona 69, the last thing people in these parts thought about was
having a high-density, pedestrian-friendly downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, it was a big deal when the first Circle K set up shop
along the highway just more than 20 years ago, when Prescott Valley
was a pit stop of 2,000 on the way to Prescott.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the planners of Prescott Valley, now the
fastest-growing town in Arizona outside the Valley, never even
considered having a downtown as subdivisions and stoplights
sprouted like wildflowers around a square mile of grasslands owned
by the Fains.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that is about to change radically.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent urban planners from around the country have praised
Prescott Valley, population an estimated 26,000, for being a leader
in ``new urbanism'' thinking and say the town's planned downtown
area will be much more akin to a European village than Prescott's
Whiskey Row.
</P>
<P>
   The anchors are just about in place.
</P>
<P>
   A large, futuristic, three-story Town Hall was opened last year
on the north side of the property with special emphasis placed on
glass, open areas and atriums.
</P>
<P>
   Harkins Theaters broke ground recently on a large cineplex and
the walls started going up earlier this month on the south side of
the property. The theaters are expected to be open in March.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the area between town hall and the cineplex that has
caught the attention of urban planners.
</P>
<P>
   Walking and biking are in. Cars are out. Merchants living above
their businesses are in. Houses in suburbia are out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis is going to be on large, wide sidewalks with bike
routes, major public squares and open areas,'' said Richard Parker,
Prescott Valley's community development director. ``The intent here
is to have a downtown of pedestrian-friendly businesses like old
Main Street from a town 100 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker and other town officials say they plan to attract a
second hospital to the central Yavapai County area on the east side
of the property, and an existing community college campus on the
west side is expected to be neighboring high-tech research and
development firms in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Town planners are searching for a major hotel chain to build a
large hotel just south of Town Hall. The area around the hotel
would be filled in with apartments and town houses, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said Prescott Valley has a lot going for it, which will
be attractive to business. The key to making the downtown project
go has been having a targeted area with only one landowner. And a
landowner, the Fain family, willing to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have cashed out on their place to developers a long
time ago,'' said Joe Brett, a spokesman for the Fain Signature
Group. ``But they've had the ranch in their family since the 1870s
and they want to create a special place where people can enjoy
forever rather than just a bunch of strip malls.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Browning, a Prescott architect who has been involved in
the downtown planning, said it has been a unique experience in
Arizona, creating a downtown area after subdivisions already were
in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prescott Valley hasn't been much except strip development
which accommodated the outflow of people from Prescott,'' Browning
said. ``There has been no defined center. Now, we will be able to
offer people a chance of being in a really special place, one
that's going to be very different from Prescott.''

 &HT;    TAMING DESERT FLOODS(a)

 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a)

<P>
   Floods in the desert?
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers to the Valley think it must be a joke. After all, this
is a place that goes months without rain and brings in Colorado
River water along hundreds of miles of canals.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding not only happens but it also packs a special fury in
the desert.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley's history is punctuated with inundations.
</P>
<P>
   Take 1921, when Cave Creek roared into Phoenix, soaking the
Capitol building, after a storm dumped 6 inches of rain in two
days. Seven large floods drenched central Arizona from 1977 to
1980, and Phoenix was declared a disaster area three times.
</P>
<P>
   Each bout of flooding has typically triggered a rush to build
dams, culverts and other protective barriers of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   The Maricopa County Flood Control District says it make more
sense and costs a lot less to let nature tame the storm water in
many areas of future development.
</P>
<P>
   Cities are starting to go along. In May, Peoria decided to block
large developments along 2.5 miles of the New River so floodwaters
can surge through without causing damage. The Phoenix City Council
voted in June to let natural washes act as drainage for an area
east of Interstate 17.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the pluses and minuses of nature vs. concrete, one
must look at the peculiar behavior of water in the desert: the way
it goes out of control, the flood plains and the enormous power of
erosion.
</P>
<P>
   Navajos divide rain into two types, male and female. They
correspond to the two types of flooding in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Winter brings the gentler female rain, falling steadily for long
stretches in storms that cover large areas. The runoff, especially
combined with melting snow in the mountains, can cause devastating
regional flooding.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy winter rains of 1993 sent the Salt, Gila and Santa
Cruz rivers over their banks, causing $400 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Violent summer thunderstorms, the male rains, bring flash floods
that ravage smaller areas. Three years ago, Tropical Storm Nora
doused northwest Maricopa County with up to 12 inches of rain in 24
hours, a state record. Thundering down washes, the water breached a
dam while central Phoenix barely recorded rain.
</P>
<P>
   The force of floodwater in the desert can be staggering, because
it moves so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Force is the square of the velocity, so if speed doubles, the
power of the water quadruples.
</P>
<P>
   A person standing in waist-deep water running 6 feet per second
will be hit with the weight of a football tackle - 140 pounds of
pressure on each leg. And washes may run at triple that speed.
</P>
<P>
   Flood protection in Arizona generally is designed to handle a
100-year event, the type of severe flooding that has a 1 percent
chance of occurring in any given year.
</P>
<P>
   Many people mistakenly believe that means such floods happen
only once a century. But they can occur back to back: The Salt
River in the Phoenix area had three in a row: 1978, 1979 and 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The area that would be underwater in such a severe flood is
called the 100-year flood plain, and it's difficult to map out in a
recently developed state like Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The East has written records that go back for several centuries
and ``a culture that generation to generation has farmed the
land,'' said Amir Motamedi, Maricopa County hydrologist. ``They
know where not to build.''
</P>
<P>
   As an added complication, the sandy washes and dry riverbeds
that carry the Valley's storm water may move back and forth over
time.
</P>
<P>
   The county uses many tools to map the flood plain and movement
of the watercourses, including historical records, aerial photos,
location of debris, soil analyses and test trenches dug to check
for sediment.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetation gives a clue about where flooding has occurred.
Saguaros, for instance, have shallow roots and can't withstand
strong water flows.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists can trace the irrigation system dug by the
Hohokam Indians from about A.D. 1 through the 1400s and figure out
where and at what level the washes must have run.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional approach to flood plains is to eliminate them by
filling in the low spots next to a wash and riverbed. That allows
development on land that would otherwise be flood-prone.
</P>
<P>
   The drawback is that the storm water can't spread out, so it
runs deeper and faster in the washes and riverbeds, which must be
reinforced with concrete or stone. That's expensive - building a
concrete channel costs $2 million a mile and more plus maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The go-with-the-flow solution, letting natural washes carry
storm water, has a different price: keeping development off the
flood plain.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is wrestling with that
inescapable fact nationwide as it tries to move away from shunting
water into concrete channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take more property or preserve more land,'' said
Richard DiBuono, a hydraulic engineer with the Corps. ``It's hard
to do in the middle of an urban area.''
</P>
<P>
   The natural approach may also be impractical in areas of the
Valley with sheet- flooding, where there aren't deeply defined
washes to carry large flows so water spreads out evenly over a
broad area.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see another Indian Bend Wash either. The long, grassy
corridor in Scottsdale, combining flood control with ball fields
and parks, couldn't be built under today's water-use rules, which
prohibit so much turf in the public right of way. Flood control
used to focus on the sheer volume of water. But now attention is
shifting to the danger of erosion and sediment.
</P>
<P>
   The erosive power of desert floods was vividly obvious in 1983,
when torrents of water devoured up to 300 feet of river banks in
Tucson, ripping the ground out from under buildings.
</P>
<P>
   When homes were built in that area, no one had paid much
attention to the risk that the dry riverbed would move and erode.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the floods. ``All of a sudden, the bank is under the
living room,'' said Tempe geomorphologist Jonathan Fuller, ``and
the house is toppling into the stream.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which runs the national
flood insurance program, has just finished a study about mapping
erosion along rivers, the companion to a study of coastal erosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very significant issue,'' said Matthew Miller, chief
of hazards study in FEMA's mitigation directorate.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on what Congress decides, FEMA could raise the
insurance rates in erosion-prone areas or it could adopt guidelines
calling for building to be restricted to a certain distance from
the banks of rivers and washes.
</P>
<P>
   Water surging down a wash looks almost alive, like a writhing,
ravenous beast, and that's not far off. Hydrologists think of water
as hungry for sediment.
</P>
<P>
   As water moves faster, it picks up more sand, rocks and debris.
Double the speed of the water, and it has 16 times the carrying
capacity, with the muscle to grab large rocks. Floods at Skunk
Creek in north Phoenix have left melon-sized boulders stuck in the
branches of trees.
</P>
<P>
   A typical stream in the East carries less than 1 percent of its
volume in sand. On flooded washes in Arizona, the concentration of
sediment can go as high as 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When storm water is routed down a concrete channel, it moves
swiftly and remains clear. It will chew voraciously into any
unprotected area it encounters, so banks must be protected the full
length of the watercourse.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk occurs when water slows down and loses some
carrying capacity. Then it begins dumping sediment - so there's
less room for storm water in the future and properties are flooded
that never got wet before.
</P>
<P>
   But predicting just what desert washes or rivers will do is
tricky. ``There are so many unknowns,'' Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   He has a table that predicts how certain variables affect stream
behavior, and there are upwards of 100 factors, from depth and
slope to water temperature and soil type.
</P>
<P>
   The complexity leads Fuller to a simple formula: ``The more we
leave them alone, the less we have to fix.''

 &HT;    URBANIZING WHITE TANKS(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By SHAUN MCKINNON(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Javelina and mule deer roam the rugged White Tank Mountains
barely 35 miles from downtown Phoenix, sharing the
(beginitalic)bajada(enditalic) with coyotes, raccoons, squirrels,
rattlesnakes and sometimes a wandering mountain lion or a
determined hiker.
</P>
<P>
   It's still a relatively quiet corner of the Valley, unfamiliar
to a lot of folks, but that's about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Construction has begun on the first custom homes at the base of
the mountains in Buckeye and developers have filed plans for tens
of thousands more along the western edge of the range. Planners
predict that by 2025, more than 125,000 people will live within
three miles of the 4,000-foot peaks.
</P>
<P>
   State and local officials are working on various land-use
blueprints that would protect the most sensitive parts of the White
Tanks, but conservationists worry that growth will isolate the
mountains and transform a diverse and thriving ecosystem into just
another urban island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even know what the far-reaching effects are going to
be when we start changing the desert,'' said Sandra Mobley, an
educator at the 26,000-acre White Tank Mountains Regional Park, run
by Maricopa County. ``It might not be apparent on the surface, but
you throw everything all out of whack when you put too many people
in a given area.''
</P>
<P>
   Although home builders are still a few years from clearing wide
swaths of land around the mountains, the range is drawing a lot of
attention:
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County, behind Supervisor Jan Brewer, has applied for
title to 2,800 acres along the park's west side now controlled by
the Bureau of Land Management. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has
endorsed the idea, urging greater protection for a park he sees as
an ``island that will inevitably be isolated by an onslaught of
tens of thousands of homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maricopa County Flood Control District has proposed to
include McMicken Dam in a network of trails that could maintain
critical migratory paths for mountain lions, deer and other
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Buckeye annexed a huge area west of the mountains and developers
moved in quickly with plans for several master-planned communities.
Homes already are sprouting on the old Caterpillar proving grounds,
8,800 acres now owned by DMB.
</P>
<P>
   The State Land Department has allowed Del Webb and Johnson
International to prepare conceptual plans for more than 15,000
acres on the east side of the White Tanks. A citizens group opposes
the potential sale and has filed its own plan, but the developers
likely will have a chance to bid on the land.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the White Tanks Concerned Citizens Group worry that
growth will swallow the range, invoking images of Ahwatukee
climbing up the side of South Mountain in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep developing around the mountains, there's not going
to be anyplace for people to get away,'' Carolyn Robles said.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley said residents of the communities likely will see a lot
of their wildlife neighbors at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have human and mountain lion interaction,
which is usually not good, especially for the mountain lion because
they end up being relocated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Too many homes, she said, will cut off the routes some animals
need to travel between mountain ranges. A mountain lion, for
example, needs a huge territory and can prowl from the White Tanks
all the way to the Bradshaws, the Harquahalas or even the Harcuvars
in Yavapai County.
</P>
<P>
   Other mountain park officials say they're holding on in spite of
encroaching development. South Mountain is hemmed in on nearly
every side by homes and businesses, yet ranger supervisor Bob
Burnett said it's not the ecological wasteland some
environmentalists describe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're doing a good job,'' he said. ``There's still a
lot of wildlife left in the mountains here.''
</P>
<P>
   Javelina, coyotes, ringtail cats, foxes and hawks live in the
16,500 acres, and it's not unheard of to spot a mountain lion. A
master plan has allowed the city to keep up with human demands,
Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
   Usery Mountain Recreation Area in the far East Valley watched a
new master planned community roll up to the park's south boundary,
but educator Jerry Waehner said the county-run preserve is
adapting, working with the home builder during construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are part of a much larger ecosystem, much larger desert
area,'' he said. ``Our boundaries open up on the Tonto National
Forest and that works to our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Land-use plans in the far West Valley address the White Tanks,
but don't always agree with each other. Maricopa County has
proposed low-density development on the northern and eastern edges
of the park, calling for no more than one home per acre. The State
Land Department, conversely, believes the land would be better
managed with mixed uses, higher-density neighborhoods next to open
space.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise's general plan update offers something down the middle,
with low- to medium-density housing proposed along the northern
edges of the mountains, but with a greenbelt buffer at the park
boundary.
</P>
<P>
   State Land Commissioner Michael Anable believes mile upon mile
of one-acre lots are ``a recipe for sprawl.'' Park educator Mobley
tends to agree, reasoning that any space left open could help in
the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix has changed so much, it bears very little resemblance
to the Sonoran Desert,'' she said. ``It's amazing when people come
out here and they realize they finally know what the desert looks
like.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   St. Mary's Elementary School is coming down, opening yet another
gap in Jerry Green's already frayed connection to his home town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to hell with St. Mary's, to hell with Phoenix Union, to
hell with Phoenix Tech, to hell with Montgomery Stadium,'' Green
said, ticking off the vanishing landmarks of his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total separation from the traditional, old Phoenix,''
said the 1951 graduate of St. Mary's Elementary and a graduate of
St. Mary's High - itself demolished to make room for the Arizona
Center.
</P>
<P>
   In Green's family, the concern spans generations. Granddaughter
Alicia, 14, attended St. Mary's Elementary, at Fourth and Van Buren
streets, until it closed in 1994 due to lack of enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm heartbroken,'' Alicia said Thursday, when news broke that
the Phoenix Catholic Diocese plans to tear down the 74-year-old
school. ``When we got up this morning, it's all we talked about.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a common sentiment, but only one side of a debate that pits
preservation against progress, a reverence for history against the
spirit of hustle that many Phoenix residents say has always been
central to the city's identity.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, all but four buildings on the Phoenix Union
High School campus came down. Also removed were the 71-year-old
Safeway Bakery in the city's Warehouse District, plus an entire
block once owned by Borden.
</P>
<P>
   Besides St. Mary's Elementary, other Phoenix historic buildings
that could be demolished include:
</P>
<P>
   Adams/Grace Court School, 800 W. Adams St., built in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe School, N. 215 N. Seventh St, built in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Union's four remaining buildings, built between 1912 and
1921 .
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Feed &AMP; Seed Co. Warehouse, 411 S. Second St., built in
1905.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery Homestead, 1721 S. Seventh Ave., built in 1880.
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists insist that historic buildings, even those in
private hands, belong to the city's culture and should be saved and
reused. They are a draw for tourists and a priceless aspect of the
city's identity.
</P>
<P>
   But John Jacquemart of the Phoenix Historic Preservation
Commission notes that preservationists' outrage seldom builds into
political will. That's in part because most of the city's historic
homes and commercial buildings date to the 1920s and 30s - not very
old to residents transplanted from the country's older cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are new,'' Jacquemart said. ``That not saying we're not
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the debate are owners of many of the most
endangered historic buildings who plan to demolish them. They say
their downtown property is more valuable without the structures
because they are too costly to restore.
</P>
<P>
   When Ella Young's Montgomery Homestead made the Phoenix Historic
Preservation Commission's list of most endangered buildings in May,
her response was to the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a widow,'' Young said, ``and I have to do what I can and
make money.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Phoenix Feed &AMP;Seed Co. warehouse was equally
blunt when asked about the fate of the building in May, calling
restoration ``economically unviable.''
</P>
<P>
   But if a study group can be seen as progress, maybe the city is
inching toward a compromise. Phoenix officials were embarrassed by
the city-orchestrated demolition of the 78-year-old Phoenix Union
High School industrial arts building in April .
</P>
<P>
   Since then, city managers and several council members, including
Phil Gordon, have been putting together a panel of foes -
preservationists, developers, property rights champions.
</P>
<P>
   The panel will try to plot a new course by fall for saving the
city's grandest landmarks - one all sides can embrace. The city
needs to make owning a historic building an asset instead of a
headache, Gordon said, perhaps with tax and fee waivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is a process to vent, express, propose and make
suggestions for change,'' he said. ``What we have is such a
divide.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a divide that often splits over the bottom line. Despite
pleas from alumni such as the Greens, for example, Diocesan
officials said the Spanish Colonial Revival school is just too
expensive to save and reconfigure into a workable building.
</P>
<P>
   After a one-year moratorium, imposed on all buildings listed on
the Phoenix Historic Register, St. Mary's is coming down along with
the diocese's office building, constructed in 1950, which also
houses a 1926 chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders want to buy and close the part of Fourth Street
that divides the properties and create a campus, which would
include a new Diocesan office building, conference center and
parking spaces, to open in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Conference centers and parking lots are important, Ignacio San
Martin said. But if they prevail too completely, Phoenix might end
up with little to offer visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't go to cities to look at suburbs,'' said the Arizona
State University professor, who researches the history of cities
and urban planning. A city that doesn't care about its past, he
added, may not have an interest in its future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's just an interest in the here and now,'' said San
Martin, who calls such a city ``a rock candy mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a view the world has of America that everything is for
the taking-now. Taking and not giving,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he wonders if that's not an apt description of Phoenix,
where historic buildings are coming down and freeways are going up.
Meanwhile, he said, many cities around the country and world are
renewing efforts to save, restore, and reuse historical buildings
and landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading the landscape of a city is about understanding where
it is, where it's been and where it's going,'' San Martin said.
``We are very young and unsure of where we're going.''

 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    (REPEATING)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beverly Hills - Harrison Ford may be the star of the modern-day
ghost story (beginitalic)What Lies Beneath(enditalic), but that
doesn't necessarily mean he likes horror movies.
</P>
<P>
   Or even watches them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last scary movie I went to and enjoyed was
(beginitalic)Bambi(enditalic),'' Ford says in a recent interview.
``I was about 6 years old, and it scared the bejesus out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)What Lies Beneath (enditalic)is Ford's first real
foray into the supernatural, unless you count the occult elements
in the Indiana Jones series. He says he took the role because it's
different from what he's done lately and allowed him to work with
director Bob Zemeckis and co-star Michelle Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   He also liked the script, or as he puts it, ``the quality of the
set-up, the establishing of the relationship and the surprises the
plot holds for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very emotionally truthful film,'' Ford adds. ``And I
think that's one of the reasons you get sucked into it as an
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 58, plays Dr. Norman Spencer, a respected researcher
married to the beautiful Claire (Pfeiffer). The couple's idyllic
life begins to unravel after their picturesque Vermont lake house
is haunted by the spirit of a woman who looks remarkably like
Claire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events are seen from her perspective,'' Ford says. ``It's
her point of view, because she's the one with the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's stylistic camera work smacks a little of Alfred
Hitchcock, though Ford says (beginitalic)What Lies Beneath
(enditalic)takes it up a notch from the ``master of suspense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I admire the tradition of Hitchcock {ellipsis} I
never really believed his characters,'' he says, ``to the extent
that I think these characters are believable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we invested a lot more in the emotional reality of
these characters and less in the plotting elements that were
typical of Hitchcock.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ford's fans, this is a departure from roles like Han Solo,
Indiana Jones and the president of the United States, which he
played in (beginitalic)Air Force One(enditalic). Ford, who thinks
of his fans as customers, says that's the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people who have been my customers over the years
have enjoyed the fact that we don't serve the same meal every
time,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains, however, that Ford gained his fame as an
action hero, from (beginitalic)Star Wars (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)Raiders of the Lost (enditalic)(beginitalic)Ark
(enditalic)to films like (beginitalic)The Fugitive (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)Patriot Games(enditalic). But he hasn't done much
action-adventure in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really read anything in the action genre in the last
couple of years I thought was good enough to do,'' he says. ``I'm a
bit tired of the motivations for action that they generally use.
Retribution and revenge bore me now.''
</P>
<P>
   In his films, Ford says, he tries to establish that violence has
costs, both for the victim and the perpetrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate gratuitous violence,'' he explains. ``I hate
indiscriminate gunplay for its entertainment value.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford also talked about recent revelations about the cult classic
(beginitalic)Blade Runner(enditalic), in which he plays a detective
trying to hunt down rogue ``replicants'' - artificial life forms
that resemble humans. After the release of the movie's ``director's
cut'' on DVD, fans began to see more clues that Ford's character,
Deckard, was a replicant himself.
</P>
<P>
   Director Ridley Scott recently removed all doubt, telling the
BBC that Deckard was indeed a replicant.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford says that as far as he's concerned, the character in
the 1982 film was human. He says that during the filming, he
battled Scott to keep Deckard human, ``because I think the audience
deserved one proxy on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was aware that Ridley did not fully agree with me.
{ellipsis} He kept slipping in little details which indicate I was
a replicant,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Ford maintains that it would be difficult to replicate
(beginitalic)What Lies Beneath(enditalic), which he considers
top-notch:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary, surprising, unexpected, accomplished and fun.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   You can always rank a horror movie by how high you jump during
its really scary parts.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)What Lies Beneath (enditalic)has just raised the
bar.
</P>
<P>
   This taut supernatural thriller is the scariest movie since
(beginitalic)Poltergeist(enditalic), building suspense throughout
with sly camera work and a creepy, claustrophobic feel. Michelle
Pfeiffer is brilliant in the leading role, elevating her already
formidable game to another level.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer plays Claire, wife of Dr. Norman Spencer (Harrison
Ford), a respected researcher with a hidden past. But Claire begins
to learn the truth after she sees the wraithlike figure of a young
woman and hears mysterious sounds echo through the couple's
rambling two-story lake house.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just where this slam-bang ghost story starts. You'll
have to put your head on a swivel to keep up with the twists and
turns in this expertly constructed tale of distrust, betrayal and
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)What Lies Beneath (enditalic)also contains one of
the most terrifying sequences since the two priests entered the
bedroom in (beginitalic)The Exorcist(enditalic). The movie should
include one of those sensational warnings from the '50s: ``No one
will be admitted in the last 10 minutes of this film!'''
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, the movie isn't that different from others of the
genre, except in its execution. You could have taken the same story
and filmed it with different actors and another director, and you
would have some sad (beginitalic)Amityville Horror
(enditalic)sequel.
</P>
<P>
   But director Robert Zemeckis ((beginitalic)Forrest Gump, Who
Framed Roger Rabbit) (enditalic)takes a simple horror story and
turns it into something special. He steers away from the
slasher-film formula, concentrating instead on Claire's
psychological deterioration during her ordeal, which is
particularly torturous because the ghost looks just like her.
</P>
<P>
   To keep us on our toes while Claire unravels, Zemeckis employs
well-worn cinematic devices: spooky mirrors, billowing steam and
those tight camera shots that have the whole audience yelling,
``Look out behind you!'' He pays homage to several Hitchcock films,
including (beginitalic)Rear Window (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)Psycho(enditalic), but that doesn't distract from or
interrupt the movie's flow.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, you start to get nervous anytime a character
walks into the house and flips on a light switch. There's just no
telling what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen all these moves before, but the camera work, pacing
and acting put this film on a higher plane. The story is quirky and
creative enough to keep the audience interested, even during the
setup.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting actors - especially Diana Scarwid, who portrays
Claire's wisecracking best friend - play their roles with
enthusiastic vigor. Scarwid helps the movie maintain a wry sense of
humor, and Zemeckis uses that light tone to meticulously build
Pfeiffer's character throughout the first hour. When things start
to fall apart, the audience is clearly rooting for her.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer, who is on the screen in almost every scene, deserves
plenty of credit for the movie's success, and perhaps even an Oscar
nomination. Her performance runs the gamut from silly to sultry,
from confused to terrified. She smoothly handles her transformation
from all-American mom to haunted woman.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the first hour, Ford is almost window dressing,
though there is clearly chemistry between Pfeiffer and him while
they cavort as a happily married couple. As Pfeiffer's paranoia
builds and strange things start happening, Ford's character plays a
more pivotal role.
</P>
<P>
   The final 30 minutes are as frightening as it gets. If you're
not scared, you're probably covering your eyes. As far as that
goes, I can hardly blame you.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In (beginitalic)Loser(enditalic), Jason Biggs plays a character
from a small town.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more like he's from Mars. His character, Paul, is so
unfamiliar with common phrases (he's apparently never heard of a
six-pack), it's like he just stepped off a spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   Though supposedly the winner of an academic scholarship, Paul is
an incredible dope. He gets duped by his sleazy roommates so many
times you have to wonder if he has short-term-memory loss. Fool me
once, shame on you. Fool me 27 times, and we're doing a CAT scan.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is a contrived, tangled mess, following Paul as he
leaves home and goes to college in New York. Because he's such a
darn nerd, he's not accepted by his moronic, sadistic roommates
(big loss there), and ends up sleeping in a veterinary clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Dora (Mena Suvari), a street-smart kid trying to work her
way through college. She's also having an affair with her
literature professor (Greg Kinnear), who treats her like a doormat.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we've just got to get those two crazy kids together.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, there's really no one to root for in this movie.
Both Paul and Dora are professional victims, and Paul's roommates
are drug-dealing date rapists. Kinnear's character is equally
creepy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Paul and Dora stumble through a bunch of scenes
ripped off from other movies. The plot dredges up this old
chestnut: He loves her, but she's oblivious despite the fact he
buys her flowers and hangs on her every word. Unlike, of course,
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The only surprise ending is in the credits: This film was
directed by Amy Heckerling, who also did the delightful
(beginitalic)Fast Times at Ridgemont High(enditalic) as well as
(beginitalic)Clueless.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The posters for (beginitalic)The In Crowd (enditalic)are tagged
with the line: ``What would you do to get in?''
</P>
<P>
   After the first 45 minutes, you'll be asking: ``What can I do to
get out?''
</P>
<P>
   It's really not clear what they're trying to accomplish with
this movie, a poor man's (beginitalic)Cruel Intentions
(enditalic)without Sarah Michelle Gellar or even the slightest
shred of a script.
</P>
<P>
   The first half plays like an extended episode of
(beginitalic)Baywatch(enditalic), as we watch snobby
twentysomethings frolic on the beach and make catty remarks to each
other. They're led by Brittany (soap star Susan Ward), a poor
little rich girl who likes to manipulate her friends while she
romances the local tennis pro.
</P>
<P>
   If this doesn't sound familiar, I want to congratulate you for
escaping from the gulag.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half the movie turns dark, as Brittany clashes
with Adrien (Lori Heuring), a country club worker who has been just
been released from a mental hospital, where she suffered from
something called ``erotomania.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the movie's only claim on the erotic thriller genre,
since most of the film is neither erotic nor thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Brittany has a dark secret, which we figure out in the first 20
minutes of the movie. She spends the rest of the time scheming
about this and that, but after awhile, we don't care anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The film also suffers from a bad case of (beginitalic)Chariots
of Fire (enditalic)syndrome: Many of the male characters look
alike, so it makes the silly plot that much harder to follow.
</P>
<P>
   And just when we think we'll escape, the movie gives us a
drawn-out ending, punishment perhaps, for trying to join
(beginitalic)The In Crowd(enditalic).

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jason Gill is clocking 80 mph in his green Miata convertible,
heading north out of San Diego. The 31-year-old computer software
consultant is doing what he often does on weekends _ looking for
someplace new to live. He hates the idea of giving up his bungalow
one block from the beach in La Jolla, Calif. But three years after
he moved in, the neighborhood is not what it once was.
</P>
<P>
   The couple next door have had a baby, and with the lots so close
together, Gill can hear every wail and whimper. The family on the
other side has a baby girl and two young sons who used to peer at
Gill through the grape-stake fence until he replaced it with a
solid redwood one. Now the boys use that fence as a soccer goal.
The teen-agers down the block have formed a rock band.
</P>
<P>
   Countless fences divide the American landscape, and while some,
like race, loom large and visible, others are deceptively
transparent, subdividing people who are the same except for the
choices they have made. Mothers with jobs vs. mothers without.
Those who own guns vs. those who would abolish them. Smokers vs.
nonsmokers. Home-schoolers vs. public-schoolers vs.
private-schoolers. And, most recently and vociferously, those who
have children vs. those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   We believe we can see through these fences; we can even pretend
they aren't there. But like mottled glass, they warp and distort,
so that what we see from where we stand is not how things look from
the other side. As the mother of two young sons and as a writer on
work-life issues, here's what I see when I look at the world:
parents who are stressed. Workplace policies that try to ease that
stress but can go only so far. The cost of child care and summer
camp and orthodontics, which makes it tough to save for tomorrow's
cost of college.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Jason Gill sees when he looks at that same world:
colleagues who are stressed, yes, but only because they choose to
have children. Employers who expect people like him to work longer
hours so that employees who are parents can balance their lives.
Benefits packages full of maternity leave, pregnancy coverage,
dependent health insurance and other benefits that mean parents
effectively earn more than nonparents. Infants who cry during
R-rated movies.
</P>
<P>
   He is hardly the only one with that view. An organization called
No Kidding! which schedules social events for those who remain
childless, had just two chapters five years ago; today it has 47.
And there is no way to count the number of ``child free'' sites
online (with names like Brats! and
alt.support.childfree.moderated), but together they make up a
parallel and expanding universe where the printable names for
children include ``anklebiters'' ``crib lizards'' and ``sprogs.''
In this world, couples in which one parent stays home are called
SITCOMS (Single Income, Two Children, Oppressive Mortgage). Those
enlightened enough not to have children are THINKERS (Two Healthy
Incomes, No Kids, Early Retirement).
</P>
<P>
   There have always been people with children and people without.
Why all this anger now? The answer lies in the confluence of nearly
every major social and economic trend of the past 30 years. Start
with the birth control pill, which transformed parenthood from an
assumption to a choice. Add the women's rights movement, which sent
women into the workplace in record numbers. Mix in the baby boomers
(who have produced a baby boomlet of their own) and technology
(which allows infertile couples and gay and lesbian couples to have
children). Then there's the fact that, statistically, parents are
older and more affluent, meaning youngsters can now be found
everywhere _ at the theater, in upscale restaurants, kicking the
back of your airplane seat. The world as we know it can sometimes
seem infested with children.
</P>
<P>
   When I first heard the phrase ``child free,'' I rolled my eyes.
Here's another politically correct and therefore politically loaded
term, I thought, and a combative one at that. It smacks of
eradication, like ``smoke free'' or ``pesticide free.'' Those who
use it, however, say it's not about hating children (some do; some
don't). ``Childless'' has connotations of loss or regret; ``child
free'' implies satisfaction and deliberate choice. To be child
free, they argue, means giving far more thought to not having
children than most parents give to having them.
</P>
<P>
   Melody Fohr, 30, who works as a telephone operator at a national
chain store outside of Pittsburgh, has a similar story. ``I knew
from an early age that I didn't want to be a mommy,'' she says.
``It just never appealed to me. I was never a kid like the other
kids. It took the relatives a long time to realize that I never
played with dolls. They kept buying them for me.''
</P>
<P>
   I have heard this tale before. In fact, I have lived this tale,
to a point. When my friends began producing newborns, I held them
awkwardly, and only when I couldn't find a way out. Four years into
my marriage I was still waiting for my maternal urge to kick in,
and when it didn't, I closed my eyes and took a leap of faith. Not
until my son's first smile did I catch the fever and become a
besotted parent.
</P>
<P>
   It might be easy to find a moral here, but those who call
themselves child free warn the rest of us to stop assuming that
they will somehow see the light. ``No one goes up to the
goo-goo-eyed mother of a baby and says, 'I'm sure you'll change
your mind,''' Gill says. In fact, he would argue that my life is an
example of how society pressures people to have children against
their better judgment. There would be fewer neglected children, he
says, and fewer stressed and miserable adults, if more people felt
free not to reproduce. ``This isn't some cute stage that I'll grow
out of,'' he says. ``It's a legitimate life choice.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the last day of school at Prior Lake High School in
suburban Minneapolis, and Elinor Burkett wanders the halls,
gossiping with the graduating seniors. Burkett, 53, is the author
of ``The Baby Boon: How Family-Friendly America Cheats the
Childless,'' a book that accuses parents of wanting ``their child
and their Lexus, too'' and describes having children as ``squirting
out spawn.'' (Burkett doesn't actually use that term herself, but
approvingly quotes someone who does.)
</P>
<P>
   Burkett's next book will be about a year at Prior Lake, which
means she has spent an entire year with teen-agers. When I comment
on the fact that the ``Betty Friedan of the childless'' has
surrounded herself with children, she dismisses it as missing the
point. Too many childless people, she says, focus on the wrong
things _ the undisciplined toddler at the next table; the
insensitive comment by Aunt Marge. ``This isn't about hurt
feelings,'' Burkett says. ``This is about a political and economic
structure which relegates the childless to second-class citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of Burkett's list of targets is the federal tax code,
which has long allowed a ``dependent deduction'' ($2,800 at the
moment, which is worth about $784 to a family taxed at 28 percent).
To that is added a dependent-care credit (up to $4,800 in expenses
for two or more children, which is worth about $960 to that same
family) or, if sponsored by an employer, a dependent-care spending
account (up to $5,000, worth $1,400). Then, in 1997 _ ``just when
political consultants became obsessed with soccer moms'' _ Congress
added a $500 per child tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett is in favor of the deduction for dependent care. ``That
says that we as a society believe that those people who take care
of dependent people _ children or adults _ need some help. I don't
have a problem with that.'' Nor would she have had a problem, she
says, if Congress had increased that existing deduction by $500 so
that it applied to all dependents. But by creating a tax credit
solely for the care of children, she explains, ``we said implicitly
that we think that socially that's more valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   How is this different, I ask, from something like a mortgage
deduction, in which the tax code is used to shape behavior or
reflect social priorities?
</P>
<P>
   It isn't, Burkett replies, adding that mortgage deductions are
just as arbitrary. ``There are renters who are not terribly happy
about it, I can tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the tax credits would not infuriate her if they were not
part of a definite and very recent trend. During the 106th Congress
alone, she says, dozens of bills designed to lighten the tax burden
of parents were introduced, including ones that would increase the
child tax credit to $900. Most ``absurd'' of all, she says, is an
executive order, signed back in May, prohibiting discrimination
against parents in all areas of federal employment. Forget the fact
that the White House could not produce a single convincing example
of a parent who had actually faced such discrimination, Burkett
says. More troubling to her is the fact that the law takes sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``If employers are refusing to hire or promote parents because
they believe they won't work as hard as nonparents, that's
unconscionable,'' she says. ``But I also think that if that is
illegal, discrimination against nonparents should be illegal as
well. Why not bar discrimination on the basis of family status? Why
not make it illegal to presuppose that a nonparent is free to work
the night shift or presuppose that nonparents are more able to work
on Christmas than parents?''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the workplace, which promises to be the
bloodiest beachhead in the brewing war between parents and
nonparents. From where I sit, the increasing insistence by
employees that employers accommodate their lives has been a welcome
revolution _ and I don't think that ``revolution'' is too strong a
word. But where I see progress, Burkett sees something else
entirely. All these fancy benefits, for instance, like on-site
child care, and even the most basic ones, like health insurance for
dependents, are examples of perks the childless are not getting.
</P>
<P>
   A more rational approach, she suggests, in a voice that says,
``See, I can be reasonable,'' is a ``menu'' of benefit options.
Every employee would be given a dollar allotment for benefits that
they might divide as they choose. A parent might spend most of
those dollars on health insurance. A nonparent might choose
additional vacation time.
</P>
<P>
   When the conversation shifts to workplace flexibility, Burkett
loses her ``let's be reasonable'' tone. ``Every time someone takes
off for that sick child or that school conference, then someone
else has to pick up the extra work,'' she says. ``And the
supposition on the part of management almost always is that the
person without kids is more able _ and it's true _ to do that than
a parent. And it happens again and again and again. After a while
you're doing two jobs for one salary.''
</P>
<P>
   The unwritten rule at work here, Burkett says, is that people
with greater needs should receive more, and people with fewer needs
should do more, which goes against the doctrine of equal pay for
equal work and is a step back to the days when married men were
paid more than single men because they had families to feed.
Childless workers have ``had it up to here'' with this, she warns,
and those childless workers are the one of the fastest growing
segments of the work force. The childless also make up nearly 10
percent of registered voters, meaning employers and politicians
better start to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Already there are signs that the ``child free'' are taking a
page from Burkett, who has become a cult figure in these circles.
``The book put hard numbers to my feeling of being ignored by
politicians and my vague sense of being ripped off in general,''
Jason Gill says. ``I've gotten more politicized,'' he adds. ``I
used to keep my mouth shut to be polite, but now I'm more willing
to tell people what I think.''
</P>
<P>
   I spent weeks interviewing childless people, and hearing how
sick they've become of parents who chatter endlessly about their
children. In fact, escape from that kind of talk was one reason
Jerry Steinberg, a Canadian schoolteacher, became ``founding
nonfather'' of the group No Kidding! in the first place.
``Conversations with my child-burdened friends became monologues,''
he says. ``I'd say, 'How's it going?' and they'd bombard me with
information about the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jason Gill well knows, the ``child free'' do not live in a
world by themselves. Sylvia Ann Hewlett, a Harvard-educated
economist who founded the National Parenting Association, said at a
recent meeting of the organization: ``There are 63 million
parents'' _ of children under 18 _ ``in the United States, and if
they were to vote as a bloc they could swing the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett is the co-author (with Cornel West) of ``The War Against
Parents,'' and from her side of the looking glass parents are
anything but pampered and powerful. Everywhere parents turn, she
says, they are told they are doing a bad job _ simultaneously
ignoring and spoiling their children so that they grow into obese
adolescents whose reading and math scores are low and who are
likely to blow up the school cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing represents this backlash better than what Hewlett calls
that ``contemptible'' book. ``Baby Boon'' (which mentions Hewlett
numerous of times, none of them complimentary) ``is making my blood
boil,'' she says in an interview in the association's offices in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pernicious, it's brand-new, it's gaining traction,''
she bristles, as she proceeds to take ``Baby Boon'' apart fact by
fact. Yes, there is a new per-child tax credit, she says, ticking
her objections off on her fingers, but that paltry $500 hardly
``redistributes the nation's wealth to those with children,'' as
Burkett claims. Hewlett says the standard dependent deduction has
decreased as a percentage of income, and parents are getting far
less help from the government than they did a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``That deduction,'' she fumes, ``is one of the things she harps
on because it's one of the few things you can hang your hat on
because it's one of the few things parents do get.'' But look at
the cost side of the balance sheet, she says. She points out that a
two-parent household with an income of up to $62,000 a year will
spend about $160,000 to feed, clothe and shelter a child until the
age of 18. Quoting data from a 1998 study, Hewlett says that
childless women now earn 90 percent of what their male counterparts
earn, while mothers earn only 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett's contention that benefits packages and family-friendly
policies are de facto bonuses for parents also rankles Hewlett. How
many working parents, she asks, actually receive such benefits?
According to a 1998 study by the Families and Work Institute, 46.8
percent of companies with 100 or more employees offer a
family-friendly package that includes flex time, paid parental
leave and child-care assistance. But, Hewlett points out, ``We must
remember that the majority of women work for firms smaller than
this, and these firms typically offer much less.''
</P>
<P>
   In France, new mothers are guaranteed 16 to 26 weeks of paid
maternity leave. In Ireland, children are welcomed everywhere
(including the family-friendly local pub). If parents are to get
all they deserve, Hewlett argues, they must flex their political
muscles as well as their economic ones.
</P>
<P>
   The language of politics over the past four years hints that
this is happening. Gun control used to be about reducing crime; now
it is about protecting children. The fight against smoking used to
be about lung cancer; now it is about Joe Camel's influence on
youngsters. ``It's absolutely exploitative and disgusting,'' Gill
says.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett, not surprisingly, sees progress where Gill sees
pandering. Framing policies in terms of children, she says, is the
only way to challenge the belief at the core of the ``child free''
worldview _ that caring for children is in no way an obligation of
the childless. The dismissal of parenting as a ``choice'' is
``outrageous,'' Hewlett says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This assumes that having a child is the moral equivalent of
buying a boat or getting a manicure,'' she says. ``True, not having
children is an option for each individual. In some cases it is an
honorable choice. But childlessness is not a choice for society.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonparents have heard that before, and point out that
overpopulation is a bigger problem than underpopulation, and that
parents rarely decide to be parents out of a perceived obligation
to humankind. Parents have children, nonparents say, because they
are selfish _ because they want a baby to coo over, or a genetic
link to the future, or the family of their own childhood dreams.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this whole debate can be distilled down to the word
``selfish,'' and Ruth Wooden, president of the National Parenting
Association, throws it right back at the child free. Parenting, she
says, means ``realizing that someone else's needs are more
important than your own.'' In that way, she argues, becoming a
parent means becoming ``a grown-up,'' and as the percentage of
childless adults increases, the result is a society that is ``not
as mature.''
</P>
<P>
   As a parent, my answer to those who think my life intrudes on
theirs is simple: Every person with children was once a person
without children, so you have to take our word when we say we can't
do it without help and without spilling over into your space all
too regularly. The life of any given parent is more complicated,
stressful and expensive than the life of that same person would be
if he or she were not a parent. Feel sorry for us if you'd like.
Avoid us if you need to. And, in several decades, when the children
are grown, we can all live side by side again, in child-free
retirement homes.

 By ANDREW SULLIVAN  
 c.2000 Andrew Sullivan  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you first think about it, it's a no-brainer. When the final
stages of mapping the human genome were hyped last month, both
President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain called
for a swift, extensive ban on using genetic information to
discriminate in employment or insurance. Clinton had already signed
an executive order back in February, banning such discrimination
for federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, both politicians had polling data to support them.
A 1998 survey of 1,000 randomly selected Americans found that 63
percent of them balked at any genetic testing if an employer or
health insurer could have access to the data. So a ban on genetic
discrimination not only secures privacy and fairness; it also
protects good research by reassuring study volunteers that the
information they provide is in completely safe hands.
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like? Well, quite a lot, actually. Like most
notions that command almost universal assent, the proposed ban on
genetic discrimination makes far less sense the more you think
about it. A few brave souls, like the writer Michael Kinsley, have
pointed this out, but even he admitted that he wasn't sure what
conclusion to draw. So here goes: genetic discrimination, however
troubling, is both rational and inevitable. And the sooner we get
over our hand-wringing, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the analogy to racial discrimination. It's bogus. The
point of laws against racial bias is to outlaw irrational
discrimination based on irrelevant characteristics. The point of
laws against genetic discrimination is to outlaw rational bias
based on relevant information. The two principles aren't merely
different; they're opposite. We perform individual, rational acts
of discrimination all the time. In fact, it would be hard to
function without them. Deciding not to put an art historian in
charge of a nuclear power plant is not bias but common sense.
Similarly, discriminating against a blind person when hiring a
baseball umpire is certainly not a function of hostility to blind
people in general and wouldn't even be illegal under the Americans
with Disabilities Act. Sure, it's discrimination _ but it's
rational discrimination and is not, and shouldn't be, illegal. So
why should genetic discrimination?
</P>
<P>
   The best answer to this is that most genetic information is
speculative. It doesn't tell you what a person is; it tells you
what she may be. Right now, it could tell an employer that a job
applicant might have a propensity for heart trouble in the future,
or for Parkinson's disease. Within the foreseeable future, it might
even reveal that a person's genetic spatial skills are particularly
good or that her verbal fluency is genetically high. But it won't
tell you what a person has actually made of her natural gifts or
whether she might be lucky and avoid certain likely genetic fates.
It might tell you that a person has the genes to make a fine
pianist, but it won't tell you if he has practiced or even knows
how to read music.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's executive order rested on this distinction. It bans
the use of genetic testing to determine if a person has a
propensity for being bad at a certain job or for having a specific
physical ailment in the future, but it allows such testing to see
if a person has an actual existing condition that makes him less
able to perform a certain task. So it's O.K. to test if a fighter
pilot has a genetic condition that makes him liable now to have a
sudden heart attack on the job; but it's not O.K. to test him to
see if his genes suggest that he could develop Alzheimer's in
preretirement years.
</P>
<P>
   I get the distinction. I just don't see the ethical difference
between using genes to hazard future performance and using other
means to do so. After all, we already use countless ways of
discriminating rationally on the basis of the likelihood of future
ability. What else is an SAT score, if not an attempt to predict
future performance? Or a garden-variety letter of recommendation?
What are these but predictors exactly analogous to genetic testing
_ not destiny as such, but pretty reliable guides? The real
question, then, is, Why should imprecise and often dangerous
predictors (like SAT results) be morally acceptable but more
precise methods (like genes) be morally repugnant? If anything,
genetic testing for future capacities is less objectionable because
it's more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Most of our current worries stem, of course, from insurance.
What's to prevent insurers, we fret, from demanding genetic tests
to see if someone is more likely to have breast cancer or heart
disease than another random person? The result could be the end of
insurance pools as we know them. But it's worth noting one thing.
Genetic testing is not a reversal of the principle behind
insurance; it's just an elaboration of it. All insurance is about
predicting the future based on imperfect knowledge of the present.
The point of genetic testing is to give us a better idea of the
present and future. Young single males, for example, have a harder
time getting car insurance than married middle-age women. We accept
this principle as a recognition of reality. But why is it less
objectionable than testing individuals for a genetic predisposition
to high blood pressure? At least that doesn't extrapolate from a
general population to an individual.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening is that the veil of ignorance that once covered
our inner lives is wearing increasingly thin. The change will
thrill and dismay us, whatever our politics. It seems to me, to
take one obvious consequence, that socialized medicine is now all
but inevitable. It's inevitable not because it's inherently better
than an insurance-based system. It almost certainly isn't. It's
inevitable because the ignorance on which an insurance-based system
necessarily rests is slowly disappearing. We'll either have to
force insurers to ignore glaring, easily obtainable facts relevant
to their business - and see the numbers of private entrepreneurs
prepared to enter the market gradually shrink - or we'll have to
make it illegal for individuals with great genetic results to use
and market that information to insurers for cheaper coverage.
Eventually, as the writer Clive Crook has argued, the private
sector will either be so expensive it will be beyond most of our
reach or so regulated it will look like a public system anyway. In
the long run, only the government will be dumb enough or
enlightened enough to mandate a national insurance pool that works.
</P>
<P>
   Simply ban all genetic testing of any kind? That would mean
losing a historic chance to cure countless diseases and develop
unique health strategies for individuals who will want them.
Prevent employers and governments from testing? Sure, but what do
you do when private individuals get their own tests done and then
bring them to job interviews? How do you practically stop an
employer from being influenced by that information in a free
society? And if some employers are high-minded enough to keep their
eyes shut in a fiercely competitive market, others will realize
that ignorance is too costly a financial risk to bear.
</P>
<P>
   The twists won't end there. As the potential for rational
discrimination grows, the space for old-fashioned bias may shrink.
Men and women will increasingly be judged not by the color of their
skin but by the content of their chromosomes. The irrational
cruelty of bias will be replaced by the rational cruelty of fate.
In retrospect, we may miss the evils we could do something about.

 By ELIZABETH WEIL  
 c.2000 Elizabeth Weil  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a story about wealth and space and America and Russia,
and it begins with one man, Walter Anderson _ 46 and worth almost a
billion dollars. He lives in Washington _ the city he grew up in, a
city he hates; his hatred of the government is, as he puts it,
``personal'' _ in an apartment adorned with a painting he
commissioned based on a Smashing Pumpkins lyric, ``I am still just
a rat in a cage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we are,'' Anderson explains, ``rats in a cage. And
we're going to gnaw through the bars because we've got about a
30-year window here, and we'll starve if we don't get out.'' The
cage Anderson refers to is Earth itself, and he has taken it upon
himself to ensure we get off. In 1989, Anderson gave $80,000 to the
International Space University; in 1991, $100,000 to the Space
Frontier Foundation; in 1995, $5 million to start the Foundation
for the International Nongovernmental Development of Space; and
between 1996 and 1999, $35 million to build the Roton, a manned,
reusable spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few months ago, in one of our periodic check-ins, he
rang me up. ``I'm calling from the little phone!'' he said. ``I'm
in Russia!'' Anderson was midway through three days of talks with
Yuri Semyonov, president of the private Russian space corporation
Energia, and in a move that would later marginalize NASA from the
Anderson-Russia-America love triangle, he was arranging on behalf
of a new company, called MirCorp, to lease the space station Mir.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had been dreaming of leaving Earth since he was a
little boy. He wired the Russians $7 million before he even signed
Mir's lease. Anderson put up $21 million in seed money toward a
lease that will eventually cost $200 million a year. It will give
MirCorp the rights to Mir for the remainder of its lifetime, the
use of two or three manned Soyuz rockets and two or three unmanned
Progress rockets annually, exclusive control over Mir's visitors
and technologies, 40 days of active operation and the privilege of
fixing Mir up. All of this has put Anderson more cozily into bed
financially with Energia, thereby creating a situation highly
threatening to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   The American space agency, after all, was already embroiled with
the Russians in the way-over-schedule, way-over-budget, politically
Pollyanna-ish International Space Station, a project announced 17
years ago under President Ronald Reagan, one that was already the
subject of several congressional hearings and that space patriots
in Washington were determined to make ``the only space in space.''
Specifically, at the time Anderson leased Mir, NASA was blaming the
Russians for being two years behind in launching the service
module, or living quarters, for the International Space Station.
(It was finally launched on July 11.)
</P>
<P>
   A less brusque man than Anderson might have chosen to sweet-talk
and pacify the NASA brass. But Anderson is arrogant in such
matters, and is, as he terms himself, an anarcho-capitalist. He
flies around the world in his private jet pledging allegiance to
the laws of global free trade. Thus, instead of calling NASA,
Anderson called his friend Chirinjeev ``Baboo'' Kathuria, 35, a
megamillionaire Sikh. Kathuria told Anderson that he, too, was
``interested'' in Mir, which in megamillionaire-speak meant he was
willing to chip in $4 million to help form MirCorp and start
upending the last century's notions of international relations in
space.
</P>
<P>
   MirCorp is registered in Bermuda, run out of Amsterdam and
structured as a 40-60 partnership with Energia (38 percent of which
is owned by the Russian government). Anderson's plans include
rehabbing the station and expanding its volume to nine or 10 times
its present size. He wants to sell joy rides on Mir to wealthy
individuals (Dennis Tito, a 59-year-old money manager and former
rocket engineer, is the first to sign on, planning to spend 10 days
on Mir sometime early next year) and advertising on Mir to
commercial companies (``We'll paint it up like a Nascar'').
Anderson expects to offer access to Mir equipment to corporations
and governments and to sell intellectual rights on Mir's
considerable patents so that, as Anderson puts it optimistically,
``NASA won't be able to build so much as an air lock without paying
MirCorp something first.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he intends to move into even more dubious but
potentially lucrative markets, like in-orbit satellite assembly and
satellite repair. I do not know if Anderson's vision amounts to a
dream or a pipe dream, a gift or a curse.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is loose-limbed and gangly, with an oddly
unused-looking body. He favors black jeans, suede sport coats and
moccasins. Ever distrustful of his fellow men, he zealously guards
his personal privacy; his name is not on the marquee of his office
in Washington, and neither are the names of his companies. In the
alternative space underground, which Anderson has bankrolled pretty
much singlehandedly, he is known, by those who know him at all, for
being generous, ruthless, overimpassioned, incisive, philanthropic,
libertarian and shy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Anderson was one of the first 300 employees at MCI; in
1984 he founded Mid Atlantic Telecom, a regional long-distance
carrier and the first to integrate phone and voicemail service.
Seven years later he started Esprit Telecom Group, cracking into
the newly deregulated European market. That same year, he created a
British Virgin Islands-based holding company called Gold &AMP; Appel,
named after ``The Golden Apple,'' the second volume in the 1970s
sex-and-conspiracy-theory cult pulp trilogy, ``The Illuminatus!
Trilogy.'' He has more or less doubled his capital every year
since. In 1998, Anderson sold Esprit for $1 billion in stock and
assumed debt. He presumed he would need all that money to build
rockets and space colonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now with this Mir thing,'' Anderson says, tapping the tips of
his fingers together, ``if it works, it's such a nice shortcut.''
</P>
<P>
   I ask if it won't make NASA extremely nervous _ a lone,
superwealthy ubercitizen challenging its authority and dominance in
space?
</P>
<P>
   ``In my life,'' he says, his eyes lighting up like a
teen-ager's, ``if the U.S. government doesn't try to kill me, I
probably won't have succeeded in meeting my long-term goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Among spacers _ the polite name for space obsessives _ such
sentiments are not uncommon. Anderson was 4 when Sputnik flew, 15
when Neil Armstrong first stepped on the moon, 19 when Eugene
Cernan left the last moon-dusted boot mark. And Anderson still
seems not to have recovered fully from the magic of those memories,
from the implicit promise, now broken, that someday soon we will
all be living in the heavens, shouldering power packs and wearing
jumpsuits in a better, higher, lighter world.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old, 130-ton Soviet space station Mir, designed to
orbit only five years, has been spinning almost a decade beyond its
expected life. The station suffers many nicknames _ the porcupine,
the dragonfly _ most referring to its ungainly assortment of
modules and solar arrays. Inside, it's sorely in need of
remodeling. For the past 10 years, the station has been beset by
significant money problems. As early as 1992, top Russian officials
were comparing their own space program to a chicken: ``You cut off
its head, and it runs around the yard for a while thinking it's
still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the late 1990s, Mir suffered a string of high-profile,
high-altitude disasters _ a collision, a fire, several massive
computer shutdowns _ troubles so vast and so economically
intimidating that Energia's president, Semyonov, decided to deorbit
his outpost and call in his final crew. NASA, ever covetous of
Russian resources for the International Space Station, waxed
ecstatic. That is, until in a move that the chairman of the House
Science Committee would call ``a real kick in the jaw,'' Anderson
flew in his jet to Moscow to meet with Semyonov, playing the board
game Risk on the way. Among the first things Anderson said to
Semyonov was, ``I don't necessarily agree with the views of my
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's first foray into the commercial space sector proved a
huge debacle. He financed the development and construction of what
he hoped would be the first generation of privately financed manned
space transports: the Roton rocket, a vehicle initially conceived
to be 65 feet tall and shaped like an upturned egg. On the skyward
end of the Roton, four rocket-tipped rotor blades were to flail,
while the landward end would feature a 22-foot-diameter rotating
rocket engine ringed with 96 fuel nozzles, each slightly larger
than a can of Coke. When complete, the Roton was to be the world's
first single-stage-to-orbit, fully reusable rocket. But when the
project ended, Anderson had instead spent $40 million on the
oddest, tallest helicopter on earth. In its last flight test, the
Roton flew 1,400 yards down a runway in Mojave, Calif., at a speed
of 53 mph and an altitude of 75 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's second foray, MirCorp, seems to be going better,
thanks largely to his decision to handle MirCorp, he says, ``like a
business,'' something almost all other private space companies
neglect to do. To make MirCorp financially sound, Anderson joined
forces with a newcomer to the space world, his fellow telecom
tycoon Kathuria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mir is definitely a real business,'' Kathuria says,
``definitely undervalued'' and ``definitely cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Anderson not amassed nearly a billion-dollar fortune from an
offshore holding company or had he not nurtured a libertarian
obsession with government evil, you might wonder if he has
intentionally upset the historic and economic status quo. But
Anderson is a 21st-century antihero. He clearly knows how to
manipulate economic arrangements to produce the effects he wants.
Thus you have to assume it's by design that the Russians sound
swoony and triumphant about the MirCorp deal (``Investment not so
good from their part,'' a chief Energia officer gloats, suggesting
he outmaneuvered Anderson) while Daniel Goldin, the NASA
administrator, sounds defensive, embarrassed and left out. ``My
feelings are bruised,'' Goldin uncorks effusively in a thick Bronx
accent from his Washington office. ``I have a hurt. I'm not saying
MirCorp shouldn't have done what they did. I'm just saying I'm in
the book, they've got my number and it might have been nice if they
called.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin sounds conflicted and disrespected, like a sidelined
mafioso. Conflicted because, theoretically at least, he favors
space commercialization. ``Competition is great!'' rings one of his
mantras. Under Goldin's watch, NASA has contracted out some $3
billion annually with fledgling space businesses. At the same time,
however, his lumbering bureaucracy has burned through, almost
literally, some $60 billion on the International Space Station. In
1999, NASA suffered one of its worst years ever, losing two robotic
Mars landers.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich credited Goldin with making ``space as boring as
possible.'' The Economist magazine dubbed the International Space
Station ``the black hole in the sky.'' Thus Goldin is sincere in
saying, ``If MirCorp can finance Mir and get an unsubsidized
positive cash flow, I think that's fabulous!'' But he also finds it
deeply humiliating to explain to Congress why (a) he lacks the
clout to force the Russians to abandon Mir and meet their
International Space Station milestones and (b) a certain
international financier is able to negotiate far better prices with
the Russians than he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that money is being diverted,'' Goldin
protests, intimating that the Russians may be siphoning money from
the International Space Station and dumping it into Mir. ``I'm just
saying the arithmetic doesn't add up. I read in the papers that
private United States investors paid $20 million for six weeks of
operation of the Mir space station, a Soyuz vehicle, a Progress
vehicle. They got the operations center. They got the training. And
now I understand they're going to get another flight up there? The
Russians charged us, last year, $65 million for one Soyuz vehicle!
And $135 million for two! I'm just saying that it's frustrating,
year after year, when the Russian government doesn't give us any
vehicles to work with. So like I said, I have some bruised
feelings. And the arithmetic! I'm confused.''
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, MirCorp will send Dennis Tito, its first
citizen-explorer, into orbit. Energia will provide Tito with rocket
transportation and cosmonaut training while NASA, on the sidelines,
will continue feeling bruised and hurt, continue its public
kvetching, continue exerting pressure on Putin to dump his old heap
into the sea.

   MIDEAST-JERUSALEM-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ Jerusalem is at the heart
of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, an issue so complex that peace
negotiators simply put it off until now. Common sense seems to
dictate that the easiest basis for a settlement would be to share
the heritage and guarantee all groups access to the holy sites. But
for decades, achieving that kind of formula has only become harder,
as new layers of grievance, resentment and reason for distrust have
been added on both sides, only reinforcing in many Israeli and
Palestinian minds that their one best guarantee of access to the
shrines is sole political control or all or part of the city. By
John Kifner. (Moved in `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   ECON-EDUCATION-REVIEW (Undated) _ For all the curative powers of
a booming economy, the overflowing prosperity of the last four
years has failed to change the second-class incomes of the
one-third of Americans over age 24 who have not gone beyond high
school. Through good times and bad, that proportion has barely
fluctuated for more than 30 years, despite all the recent
encouragement to go on to college. In the computerized modern
economy, business and government count on college to raise a
person's income and close the gap between the haves _ the college
graduates _ and the have nots. But nearly 60 million adults have
failed to make the leap into higher education. By Louis Uchitelle.

   ANTICRIME-DESIGN-REVIEW (Detroit) _ Some holsters for a cellular
phone look just like those for pistols. New houses often have their
porches not in the front yard but in the back, shielded and hidden.
Sport utility vehicles are often designed to intimidate would-be
criminals as well as other motorists. America seems to be winning
the war against crime, but don't tell that to product designers.
Companies are tapping into customers' deepest fears of crime with
products subtly or ostentatiously designed to protect and reassure
the owner and, sometimes, intimidate potential attackers. By Keith
Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   EMAIL-SURVEILLANCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ New computer technology
enables law-enforcement authorities to troll through millions of
e-mails, honing in on the correspondences of suspects. But unlike
traditional telephone wiretaps, the technology also can capture
communications of others not suspected of a crime, raising concerns
that it could be employed to monitor people and groups far beyond
the suspected mobsters and drug kingpins who have been the
traditional targets of telephone wiretaps. By Stephen Labaton.

   BIRTHCONTROL-INCENTIVES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the use of
cash incentives for preventing unwanted pregnancies and population
control in general. One organization that pays drug-addicted women
to be sterilized uses the slogan `Don't Let A Pregnancy Interfere
With Your Drug Habit.' Financial incentives for promoting
pregnancy, and for organ donation, are also discussed. By Jeff
Stryker.

   URBAN-POVERTY-REVIEW (Manila, Philippines) _ Hundreds died here
two weeks ago when a mountain, loosened by monsoon rains, collapsed
on their shantytown. They lived amid the filth and flies and
degradation because, by their standards, the living was good. They
were part of the changing face of poverty _ a vast population shift
occurring throughout much of the world from the joblessness and
hunger of the countryside to the comparative wealth of the cities.
By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-GIRLS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The most relentless struggle over
the social restrictions of the Islamic Revolution has concerned
what women wear. Last week it was announced that prepubescent
schoolgirls would be allowed to wear colors to school. One concern
has been that porosis has increased among women, even young women,
because sunlight, which helps the body form Vitamin D, does not
penetrate their dark clothing. And dermatologists have complained
that the rubbing of the chador head covering against the skin
contributes to acne and rashes. By Elaine Sciolino.

   MANILA, Philippines _ Roberto Aquino, 14, says he finds ``false
gold'' in garbage. A scavenger on Manila's garbage mountain when he
is not in school, he specializes in copper wire. On a good day he
can earn half as much as his fifth-grade teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people died here two weeks ago when the
seven-story-high mountain, loosened by monsoon rains, collapsed on
their shantytown. Like their neighbors, they lived here amid the
filth and flies and degradation because the living was good. Mostly
upwardly mobile migrants from the barren countryside, they were
feeding their families and putting their children through school.
Like Roberto, they had struck gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you have a family of four,'' said Matthew Westfall, an
urban development specialist with the Asian Development Bank, which
is based here. ``The kids go to school part time and pick trash
part time. You could get up to 15,000 or 16,000 pesos a month,
possibly.'' That sum, about $400, ``puts you above the poverty
line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The people of the dumpsite, which they call Promised Land, are
not an aberration. They are part of the changing face of poverty _
a vast population shift taking place in much of the world, from the
joblessness and hunger of the countryside to the comparative wealth
of the cities. But for most of these migrants, that comparative
wealth is found in places like the Manila dumpsite, part of a
growing sea of poverty that laps at the edges of small, high-rise
islands of urban affluence.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, where cities of 10 million people or more are spreading
as fast as anywhere in the world, this urban landscape is replacing
the fields and trees of the villages for an increasing proportion
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years ago, Westfall said, only one in five Asians
lived in cities. Today the ratio is one in three. Twenty years from
now, more than half the population will be urban. In 1990, he said,
the region's cities needed a total of $38 billion a year to provide
urban services like water, sanitation and transport. In 20 years
that figure is expected to rise to an impossible $292 billion.
</P>
<P>
   These huge ``megacities,'' groaning with their burden of the
disenfranchised poor, will dominate the 21st century, it is said,
the way the nation-state dominated the 20th century and empires
ruled in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Urbanization, of course, is not just an Asian phenomenon. Nor is
the misery of the poor. Garbage mountains rise in Latin America and
Africa as well. But it is in Asia, perhaps, with its enormous
population pressures, that the issue is drawn most strikingly.
</P>
<P>
   Manila today, for example, has 13 percent of the Philippines' 74
million people but generates 30 to 40 percent of the nation's
wealth. Bangkok has 10 percent of Thailand's population but
generates 40 percent of its wealth. ``People in rural areas have no
alternative but to migrate,'' said Anil Deolalikar, a professor of
economics at the University of Washington in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But garbage dumps aside, said Naved Hamid, a senior policy
planner with the Asian Development Bank, these poor see little of
the cities' wealth.
</P>
<P>
   There is no one pattern for urban poverty and therefore no
single cure. In China, the pattern is predominantly one of a vast
floating population of migrant workers who follow jobs from city to
city. In Manila, where many urban services have broken down, it
also includes people like civil servants and teachers, whose pay
puts them above the poverty line but who often have no alternative
to living in the ugliest of slums.
</P>
<P>
   The urban underclass for the most part lives apart from the
social and economic structure of its city, invisible to most
residents and without the political weight to demand their share of
services. So they create their own separate _ though dependent _
economies. Some 80,000 squatters cluster around Manila's garbage
mountain, for example. They include perhaps 3,000 scavengers and
another 9,000 or so people whose livelihoods depend directly on
what urban experts call ``the recycling waste chain.''
</P>
<P>
   As planners seek new ways to address the growing disaster of
urban poverty, the world's millions of slum dwellers find their own
ways to survive. The art of scavenging, it appears, is one of the
great tributes to human inventiveness. There are children who dive
for golf balls in the water hazards of golf courses and there are
daring teen-agers who scurry for brass shell casings on military
firing ranges.
</P>
<P>
   In Laos, people use old bombshells to construct their houses. In
America, the urban poor dig for aluminum cans (and cold slices of
pizza) in garbage bins.
</P>
<P>
   In Nigeria this month _ in a tragedy that is a companion to the
garbage landslide in Manila _ hundreds of scavengers died in an
explosion and fire while trying to earn their living by puncturing
a pipeline and siphoning off gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   People like this not only make a living; they make a home for
themselves. The shanties at Manila's dump are hung with flower pots
and posters of soccer teams. There are tiny barbershops and ice
cream stands. There are births and weddings and school graduations.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people in the family of Jennifer Gino Evangelista died in
the landslide, including her parents. Twenty-one survived. None of
them want to move away.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, said Evangelista, 27, her father brought the
family here from the countryside after taking them from place to
place in search of a living. ``Every year we would move,'' she
said. ``We never had a permanent address. We were tourists in our
own country.''
</P>
<P>
   That homeless life ended here on the fringes of the Promised
Land dump.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where we've stayed the longest _ 12 years,'' she said.
``This is where we've multiplied. This is where we've put down
roots. So this is our home now.''

   HOLLYWOOD _ The story goes like this: Several people are walking
down the middle of the street in the middle of the night. Suddenly,
a truck comes along and flattens them. How can you tell which one
is the movie studio executive? He's the guy who jumps up and says,
``Here's why that just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect hindsight is a common Hollywood trait. So is the ability
to explain, as though to a simpleton, exactly why such-and-such a
movie was a box-office bomb or why some superstar's latest movie
failed to open at the levels anticipated. The constantly shifting
ground upon which the Current Prevailing Wisdom rests must be
updated each weekend _ especially when something comes along that
contradicts the prevailing wisdom going into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up the issue of PG-13 _ at the top of the Current
Prevailing Wisdom list at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, Hollywood studios are insisting that filmmakers
guarantee they will deliver a movie that will get at most a PG-13
rating from the Motion Picture Association of America _ and not an
R, which requires any moviegoer under 18 to be accompanied
(theoretically) by a parent or guardian. This is stressed in cases
of big summer releases, when it is important to get as many people
into the theaters as possible and grease _ not restrictions _ is
needed at the turnstiles. ``The question is, where does the largest
audience lie?'' said Dan Fellman, president of distribution for
Warner Brothers. ``At the end of the day, it's within the PG-13.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense on paper. Certainly if more people are allowed
into a movie theater, then the pool of ticket buyers is larger and
a movie should, by rights, have a better shot at making a bigger
pile of money. But is this Current Prevailing Wisdom really
correct?
</P>
<P>
   Follow the bouncing ball:
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend just before the Fourth of July, two major movies
were expected to compete to be No. 1 at the box office: ``The
Perfect Storm'' from Warner Brothers (rated PG-13) and ``The
Patriot'' from Columbia Pictures (rated R). In the run-up to the
weekend, ``The Patriot'' was widely seen as the likelier winner.
Both films had top-notch directors, but ``Patriot'' had a more
bankable star in Mel Gibson. Prerelease polling indicated that
audiences were more eager to see the period epic. Instead,
``Perfect Storm'' ended up making almost twice as much as
``Patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monday-morning quarterbacking settled on three explanations.
``The Patriot'' ran too long for summer audiences (160 minutes).
Audiences don't really like Colonial-era stories. ``Patriot'' was
rated R.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it was said, PG-13 trumps R in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the next weekend. The only major opening was ``Scary
Movie,'' a decidedly R-rated spoof of horror films. Predicted to be
a decent-sized hit, it was a phenomenon, earning more than $40
million, the largest opening ever for an R-rated film. Wham!
Anybody get the number of that truck?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this was the movie that was the exception to the rule,''
said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, which
monitors box-office performance. ``They don't come along every day,
but there are some movies where the rating doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so PG-13 is better than R _ except sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, ``X-Men'' opened. Again, the polling predicted a
sizable hit. Instead, it opened huge, earning more than $54
million. Its rating: PG-13.
</P>
<P>
   To get some historical context into this debate, Exhibitor
Relations crunched the box-office numbers for the last three
summers, the four months in which the studios do 40 percent of
their annual business.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the films that finished in first place in each of the
18 weekends from early May to Labor Day in 1999, a record year at
the movie box office, 11 weekends saw a PG-13 movie in first place,
three weekends saw a PG, one weekend saw a G and only two weekends
saw an R. In 1998, it was a closer call; eight weekends had a PG-13
movie in first place, eight weekends had an R and two had a PG.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 11 weeks of this summer, PG-13 films were in first
place on five weekends, R films on five weekends and a PG film on
one weekend.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps the difference between PG-13 and R isn't so great
after all? Not so fast, Dergarabedian said. One must also look at
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitor Relations looked at all 265 films released last
summer. The largest number of them, 157, were rated R. Less than
half, 67, were rated PG-13. The average R film made $20 million
while the average PG-13 made $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stands to reason,'' Dergarabedian said. ``That's what R
means, restricted. You're restricting the audience. But I'd hate
for this somehow to cause a chilling effect on the artistic
process.''

NEVER SAY DIE. JUST EXECUTE.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you want to escape into the dark, violent world of a graphic
novel? Do you want to act out its ghastly denouement with its last,
grim death laugh? Try flipping a tiny switch and carrying out a
miniature execution.
</P>
<P>
   Death Row Marv, the rock-jawed anti-hero of the graphic comic,
``Sin City,'' by Frank Miller (Dark Horse Comics, 1994), is the
latest toy from McFarlane Toys, which is owned by Todd McFarlane,
the creator of Spawn, another comic-book anti-hero.
</P>
<P>
   Marv, who apparently needs no last name, is railroaded to the
electric chair, condemned to die for what he regards as a
justifiable revenge killing. The battery-operated toy, which is
sold in specialty shops and music stores for about $20 and marketed
for ages 13 and up, is not for the faint of heart: ``Watch Marv
convulse as the switch is thrown,'' say the words on the box,
``then hear him say, `That the best you can do?''' His eyes ``glow
red as he fries.''
</P>
<P>
   The toy's typical buyer is the 15- to 45-year-old male.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first production was completely sold out in pre-order
sales, before we even shipped,'' said Beau Smith, director of
marketing at McFarlane Toys, who did not provide production
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon, as I saw Marv _ oh, man! _ I had to have one,'' said
Eric Wahland, 34, a customer service representative and salesperson
at Spider's Web, a comic store in Seattle that is the largest
outlet for McFarlane Toys. ``We keep them up front, on top of the
counter, 10 to 15 feet from the register. Already 500 of 700 deluxe
sets ordered have been sold in just four weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Marv is half convict, half hero. He is the guy who never gets
the girl because his face is a cross between Freddy Kreuger and
Bluto; his body is a muscular mass that is as wide as it is long.
To some, he is the loser they desperately want to see win. OK, he's
an anti-hero with no charisma, good looks or any redeeming social
value.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Sin City,'' before his death sentence is carried out, Marv
has the opportunity to kill the cannibalistic sociopath who
murdered the woman he loved, a prostitute named Goldie. That gave
him a sense of vindication.

<P>
   Time was when a professional athlete who wanted a second career
would become a sports commentator, an actor or a restaurateur. Not
anymore. Today, the path off the playing field is leading
increasingly into the recording studio. Shaquille O'Neal of the Los
Angeles Lakers, his teammate Kobe Bryant and Ricky Watters of the
Seattle Seahawks have all recently made rap albums.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most extreme example of this crossover is the former
sumo wrestler Konishiki, whose debut rap/reggae/R &AMP; B compact disk,
``Konishiki KMS'' _ short for ``Konishiki Master Sumo'' _ has just
been released by 125th Street Records. Born as Salevaa Atisanoe in
Hawaii to Samoan parents, Konishiki (pronounced co-NEESH-kee and
meaning Delicate Embroidery) retired from the ring in 1998 after a
16-year career in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his new CD, he says, ``There are aspects of sumo
like the concept of `makenai-desu' _ an attitude of, `I will not
lose' _ which I've used in the ring.'' Indeed, the influence of
sumo, which in its modern form dates to the 17th century, permeates
the album in, well, unusual ways.

UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GIFTS, COUPONS AND CASH 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
(Eds: Boldface word in 8th graf should be set in italics.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   If money changes everything, why not use it on people?
</P>
<P>
   It is the cash the women want, says Barbara Harris of Anaheim,
Calif., founder of Children Require a Caring Kommunity, known by
its acronym Crack, which since 1997 has paid drug users $200 to be
sterilized or to use contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Not only cash but discount coupons, gifts and vouchers have
become incentives in programs to encourage healthy behavior,
whether the issue involves reproduction, drug treatment or even
organ donation. Yet some experts question whether such methods
actually work in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   At least 246 women have taken up the offer, according to Crack's
Web site: www.cracksterilization.com. Harris hopes a new $50
referral bonus will bring in additional clients.
</P>
<P>
   Crack's promotional slogan _ ``Don't Let a Pregnancy Interfere
With Your Drug Habit'' _ bluntly conveys why cash can be such a
powerful motivator for drug addicts, many of whom become pregnant
repeatedly and whose babies are underweight and at risk for birth
defects. Although Harris does not track how the women spend the
money, she said, ``Sure, some use it to buy more drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years before Crack began its program, a dollar-a-day
program was established in Colorado to persuade young women to
delay pregnancy. The cash is part of a program that includes weekly
support-group meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But criticism has dogged international population-planning
efforts. Widespread condemnation followed revelations in 1998 that
Peruvian women were being sterilized in exchange for dresses,
T-shirts and food in cases where informed consent was doubtful and
post-operative care inadequate. In March, members of Congress
questioned whether aid to Peru was violating prohibitions against
the use of federal funds for forced family planning abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Incentives have also encouraged women to  &UR; have &LR;  children. In
Scotland, the Catholic Church undertook an initiative in 1997 to
pay women not to terminate their pregnancies, in one case paying
the family of a 12-year-old girl. Elsewhere, moral objections over
abortion are not the issue; low birthrates are. In Japan, private
companies are offering cash bonuses to employees who have more than
one child.
</P>
<P>
   Whether cash is an undue inducement depends on the
circumstances. ``Cash is a very effective incentive that we use all
the time,'' said Bonnie Steinbock, chairwoman of the philosophy
department at the State University of New York at Albany, who has
studied incentives in reproductive decision-making. ``It isn't
necessarily coercive.''
</P>
<P>
   Offers of cash to do good are nothing new. And paying donors for
plasma, for example, has caused officials at blood banks to worry
about needy participants lying about their health histories.
</P>
<P>
   But do incentives involving reproductive decisions really work?
Sometimes, say Dr. Cheri Pies and Dr. Sarah Samuels, researchers
with the Incentives Project, a two-year program of the School of
Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley. They
found only 11 rigorous studies of such inducements, which varied
from cash and small gifts to coupons for infant formula combined
with education, support and counseling. The cash incentives could
not be linked to the success or failure of the programs in the
studies, said Pies and Samuels, who advocate using money for
achievable short-term outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Cash has also been dangled to keep teen-agers off drugs. In
Florida, Arkansas and Pennsylvania programs, participants get
discounts at local shops and exemptions from curfew rules when they
pass a voluntary urine test and agree to future random tests.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schlichter, a financial adviser and member of the
Chamber of Commerce in Chambersburg, Pa., lobbied to bring the
Arkansas anti-drug program Truce, the acronym for Teens Resisting
Unhealthy Choices Everyday, to his rural community. About 20
percent of the students in grades 8 through 12 have been
voluntarily tested. ``It was the first program we heard about that
involved a carrot and not a stick,'' Schlichter said.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal law prohibits commerce in human organs and
tissues (with an exemption for replenishable material like blood,
plasma, sperm or eggs), Pennsylvania health officials attracted
attention last year with a proposal that circumvented the 1984
statute. They designed an experimental program in which families of
organ donors would receive a $300 reimbursement for funeral
expenses. Fearful of violating the law, they recently scaled back
and now propose paying some hotel and travel costs for donor
families directly to the lodging and transportation providers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that the introduction of cash incentives could
result in fewer people donating their organs. Money has the
potential for dirtying the process, said Bob Spieldenner, a
spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing. ``Paying might
very well drive out altruism,'' Spieldenner said.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the debate about money versus altruism might be
gullibility as far as organ donation is concerned. The Department
of Health and Human Services recently began to investigate certain
practices in harvesting tissues, including skin, tendons, bones and
foreskins. Many people may be unaware that their freely given
donations may end up fattening lips or enlarging penises in what
has now become the vast, lucrative enterprise of cosmetic surgery.
Federal rules limit reimbursement for tissue to reasonable
administrative and processing costs, although some interpret those
rules expansively.
</P>
<P>
   Although the examples of cold, hard cash enlisted to encourage
health and good works is growing, one particular program has failed
to catch on. The Frederick Christian Fellowship in Frederick, Md.,
gave $10 bills to first-time visitors in 1994, which succeeded in
almost doubling attendance. Few churches, though, have followed
suit.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the curative powers of a booming economy, the
overflowing prosperity of the last four years has failed to raise
the second-class incomes of the one-third of American adults who
have not gone beyond high school.
</P>
<P>
   Just as near-universal high school education was one of the
great achievements of 20th-century America, politicians and
business leaders have long sought to lure more students to college,
reasoning that the college-educated would earn more in a ``new
economy'' that now more than ever rewards a bachelor's degree.
College, they believed, could help close the gap between the
economic haves and have nots. Yet the proportion of Americans who
have only a high school diploma has barely budged for 30 years,
through good times and bad.
</P>
<P>
   Where many saw college as the answer, nearly everyone also
counted on the booming economy as a way to narrow the income gap.
Prosperity created a tight labor market that drove up wages, which
have indeed risen faster than inflation for everyone. But as
college graduates' earnings rose even more quickly, the wage gap
widened, not shrank.
</P>
<P>
   These stubborn education and income gaps are barely mentioned on
the campaign trail. Politicians and policy-makers speak mainly of
sending more people to college, without recognizing that a steady
third of adults 25 and older have only finished high school _ and
that percentage does not seem likely to come down soon. For a host
of reasons _ age, lack of tuition money, inadequate secondary
schooling, reluctance to study, discouragement from family and
friends _ college is not a viable option for a significant portion
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The data suggest that neither a robust economy nor policies that
try to push people through college can significantly narrow the
income gap.
</P>
<P>
   Harry J. Holzer, a labor economist and a visiting fellow at the
Urban Institute, would improve the lot of the lower-paid through
greater ``institutional support'' _ more government subsidies for
health care, for example, better unemployment insurance, a broader
earned income tax credit and larger subsidies for child care and
housing.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration endorses some of these steps, while
Gov. George W. Bush emphasizes tax cuts that would leave low-income
workers with more take-home pay. But college has become the favored
approach, the one that business most applauds. Nearly $13 billion
in federal funding has gone this year into college scholarships and
tax credits for college tuition. Bush favors similar subsidies and
so does Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who do not go past high school, and that will
always be the case,'' said Martin Bailey, chairman of President
Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. ``Over time, however, the
goal is to reduce that proportion, because in this new economy, a
college education is increasingly important.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of the nation's 131.6 million jobs are classified by the
Labor Department as not requiring a college education. Yet for many
employers, high school diplomas are simply not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a bachelor's degree just to apply for the best
jobs,'' said Stephen Rose, a senior economist at the Educational
Testing Service. ``That is as it should be for doctors, lawyers,
scientists, engineers, computer specialists. But look at
middle-level managers. In 1960, only 40 percent had a bachelor's
degree and today it is 80 percent.'' Many such jobs don't
necessarily require a B.A., he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But in the high-technology economy, employers say they
value a college degree as evidence that a job applicant has learned
to think and to master new ways of working, and is also
sufficiently disciplined to work hard. The high school diploma no
longer sends that message to employers.
</P>
<P>
   Education has always raised incomes. For more than a century,
the college educated have been at the top of the earnings pyramid,
the masters of each new, complicated technology. High school
prepared hundreds of millions of ordinary workers for the modern
workplace and helped to lift their incomes, shrinking the gap
between their pay and that of the college educated. But since 1980,
that gap has widened again. The economic boom did narrow the
earnings gap a bit in the mid-1990s, as employers competed to hire
low-wage workers. But starting in 1997, the wages of college
graduates pulled ahead, according to the Economic Policy
Institute's latest figures.
</P>
<P>
   Higher-level jobs for the college educated are among the fastest
growing, the Labor Department reports _ those for computer
analysts, engineers, upper level executives and secondary-school
teachers. But lower-paying jobs that require only high school
training are also among the fastest growing _ jobs for retail sales
people, cashiers, truck drivers, office clerks and home health care
aides.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this demand, the wages of people with only a high school
diploma _ rather solid in the days of unionized blue collar factory
work _ have fallen steadily behind for 20 years, making college
seem the only route to the $20.58 an hour that college graduates
earned, on average, last year, according to the Economic Policy
Institute. By comparison, the high school educated averaged only
$11.83; adjusted for inflation, the earnings gap has risen nearly
70 percent since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The gap has widened partly because union strength has declined,
and with it many of the higher-paying jobs once available to high
school graduates. And the minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, is
not as high today as it was in the late 1960s. ``The deterioration
of unions and the minimum wage probably explains up to one-third of
the increase in the earnings gap in the past 20 years,'' Holzer
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R-ECON-EDUCATION-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: Holzer said. &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These financial pressures have indeed pushed more Americans into
college. College graduates now represent nearly 25 percent of all
adults, up from 17 percent in 1980. The proportion of workers with
only a high school diploma has correspondingly fallen to 34 percent
from 39 percent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if one-third of the population continues to balk at moving
past high school, then one solution is to raise the quality of that
education. More than 40 states are now requiring students to pass
achievement exams at various stages of their schooling. In the
attempt to raise standards, governments and school districts have
stepped up spending to train teachers, reduce class size, improve
courses, provide vocational training or apprenticeships, expand
Head Start and link schools to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is a downside, however, to raising standards and then
failing students who don't meet them. A system could emerge that is
less forgiving than American public schools have traditionally
been, less willing to give poor students a second or third or
fourth chance, says Paul Attewell, a sociologist at the College of
the City University of New York. ``It has not happened yet, but in
such a system you are likely to produce a large number of poor kids
and minority kids who drop out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, he added, may be a case in point: Hundreds of
young people failed qualifying exams but didn't show up for
compulsory schooling this summer. Richard Murnane, an economist at
Harvard's Graduate School of Education, acknowledges the risk.
``That is a problem,'' he said, ``but the alternative of graduating
students without stronger skills will penalize them for a
lifetime.''

LEARNING TO LIVE WITH BIG BROTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1928, the Supreme Court took up the case of Roy
``Big Boy'' Olmstead, a bootlegger whose phones had been tapped by
federal agents without a warrant. The court ruled that evidence
obtained in that way was legal, prompting a remarkable dissent by
Judge Louis D. Brandeis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The progress of science in furnishing the government with the
means of espionage is not likely to stop with wiretapping,''
Justice Brandeis wrote in a dissent that the court adopted as the
law nearly 40 years later. ``Ways may some day be developed by
which the government, without removing papers from secret drawers,
can reproduce them in court, and by which it will be enabled to
expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the ubiquity of e-mail and the ingenuity of the FBI,
that day has arrived. Over the last couple of weeks it has been
widely reported that the FBI is now using a computer program called
Carnivore, which, once installed on the network of an Internet
service provider, can troll through millions of e-mail messages and
hone in on the electronic correspondence of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the FBI has reported using the program fewer than 25
times since it was developed 18 months ago, but that number is
expected to grow quickly, since the the bureau expects it to become
an indispensable law enforcement tool, particularly in
international espionage and terrorism cases.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, say critics, but Carnivore is also capable of
simultaneously monitoring the communications of people not
suspected of a crime. That has caused civil liberties groups and
privacy advocates to worry that the technology might be used to
monitor unpopular groups or political enemies, and not just
suspected criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as lawmakers on Capitol Hill began voicing their
concerns, the White House moved to calm the growing storm. John
Podesta, President Clinton's chief of staff, outlined legislative
proposals that would set legal requirements for surveillance in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that some kind of legislation is needed to make
sense of the existing patchwork of laws and court cases on
electronic surveillance. At present, for example, e-mail sent via
cable modem is more strictly protected that any other communication
form _ even telephone conversations _ while law enforcement
requests for lists of telephone calls to or from a particular line
must be granted without question by a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The White House proposed replacing these illogical distinctions
with a uniform, rational set of standards. Civil liberties and
privacy groups support this idea in principle, but are highly
critical of the administration for refusing to explain how broadly
it intends to use Carnivore or to describe what safeguards are in
place for preventing its abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say that computer systems like
Carnivore are necessary because e-mail is becoming more frequently
used for communication among criminals. And the officials note that
these cybermonitors can actually be set to record communications
much more selectively than a phone tap.
</P>
<P>
   Carnivore could, for instance, be programmed to pick up the
e-mail from only one sender and a particular computer, while
excluding such e-mail as messages to or from, say, the sender's
lawyer or wife. Phone taps, on the other hand, pick up everything.
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing on Friday, top FBI officials also announced
plans to submit Carnivore to analysis by independent academics, and
noted that the system kept a log of what it was asked to pick up,
which could be used by a court to spot any violations.
</P>
<P>
   In making their case, supporters of cybersurveillance say that
the only way to track e-mail is by combing through all of the
messages on a particular network, because e-mail consists of a
series of digital packets that are broken apart at the sending end
and transmitted along multiple electronic paths before being
reconstituted by the recipient's computer.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, privacy groups and some Internet service providers,
or ISPs, say there remains a less intrusive alternative. The
providers, like AOL or the Microsoft Network, could be ordered by a
court to turn over specific material, rather than give the FBI
unlimited access to a network. That is precisely how telephone
companies are treated; they cooperate with warrants for wiretaps
and lists of telephone numbers called from a particular phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is who should be in control,'' said James X.
Dempsey, staff attorney for the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a civil liberties group in Washington. ``It upsets the
balance among competing interests and privacy for law enforcement
to, in essence, kick the companies out of the way, hook up a black
box, and say, don't touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said that it was time for a reappraisal of all the
standards used by the government to eavesdrop, particularly as the
world moves into an era of digital communications that can be more
readily monitored by computers and more easily masked by
encryption.
</P>
<P>
   As even household appliances begin to be wired into the Internet
and many of our most personal thoughts and associations are now
shared with the computer, the issue has taken on a new imperative
and is being debated on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   The British government (whose house-to-house searches in the
English colonies led to the Fourth Amendment prohibition against
unreasonable searches) is near to adopting a law, the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Bill, or RIP, that would require Internet
service companies to finance the permanent installation of a
Carnivore-like system for government use.
</P>
<P>
   A similar system is already in place in Russia, while in the
Netherlands a debate is raging over whether the government should
have the authority to tap into e-mail at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This debate really cries out for a return to first
principles,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic
Privacy Information Center, a research organization that studies
privacy issues and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most important of such principles, he said, is that
the government should always use the least intrusive investigative
techniques before taking the invasive step of trying to intercept
telephone calls or e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the solution?'' he asked. ``A lot of oversight, a lot
of accountability, and a great deal of concern about the potential
surveillance capabilities of the electronic police state.''

THE LATEST FASHION: FEAR-OF-CRIME DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER

   DETROIT _ Walk into a department store these days and you can
buy a holster for a cellular phone that looks just like a holster
for a snub-nosed pistol. Visit a consumer electronics store and
you'll find that the computers are no longer white and
cheery-looking but black, sleek and faintly menacing. Stop at an
auto dealership and there will be an array of tall sport utility
vehicles designed to intimidate other motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Designers of a wide variety of consumer products say that the
American public is increasingly entranced by styling that suggests
a high level of aggression. They point to the popularity of black,
red and white as colors, the prevalence of crisp, even sharp, edges
for many products, and a declining emphasis on personal comfort in
everything from furniture to clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like `sex sells' _ in this case, violence
sells,'' said William Stumpf, a Minneapolis-based designer best
known as the inventor of the Aeron chair. ``There's a meanness
aesthetic being developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce R. Hannah, a professor of industrial design at the Pratt
Institute in New York, said his young design students were
particularly captivated by ideas that emphasized rawness and even
pain over comfort. One student, for example, was interested in
spiky jewelry that would be painful to wear and light switches with
sharp edges. And Hannah sees the same extremism at work in young
people's fashion. ``There are these big, black, chunky, almost
storm-trooper shoes and crisp trousers; there isn't the rumpled
look of the '60s and '70s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some older designers complain that there is little on the market
that they want to buy. Clyde Foles, the 56-year-old chairman of the
industrial design department at the Center for Creative Studies, a
design institute in Detroit, said he had been unable to find a
radio for his summer cottage because the clean, rectangular,
Bauhaus-style designs he was looking for had given way to alarming
combinations of curves and sharp edges. The prevalent design these
days, ``looks like Darth Vader's helmet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Where this aggression is coming from is a mystery. Designers and
market researchers most commonly cite video games, with their
emphasis on violence and exotic yet menacing shapes for androids,
space aliens and other threats. Others point to Jung's observation
that people behave worse when times are better, and suggest that
the end of the Cold War and the nation's economic boom have left
Americans freer to explore their deepest psychological feelings,
including the fear of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Some designers single out the wealth of research showing that
Americans remain very much afraid of crime, even though crime has
actually fallen. Federal crime surveys show that violent crime
dropped 22.7 percent between 1993 and 1998. Rates for other crimes
have fallen even more sharply, including a 43.2 percent plunge in
motor vehicle thefts. But Gallup polls since 1989 have consistently
found that a majority of Americans believe that crime is worsening,
although the size of that majority has shrunk over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward playing on fears of crime is most noticeable in
transportation products, Stumpf said. Powerboats are now often low,
lethal-looking craft influenced by the stealth fighter's design.
Bicycles have studded, off-road tires instead of racing tires.
Skateboards have images of fire-breathing dragons instead of racing
stripes. And tall, large sport utility vehicles have replaced
sleek, low sports cars as the favorite choice of image-conscious
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Archetype Discoveries Worldwide, which is based in Boca Raton,
Fla., does psychological consumer researcher for many large
clients, including Seagram, Procter &AMP; Gamble, DaimlerChrysler, Ford
and General Motors. Dr. Clotaire Rapaille, the company's founder
and chairman, contends that the United States is in some ways
becoming a medieval society, in which people live and work in the
modern equivalent of castles _ gated communities, apartment
buildings with doormen and office buildings with guards _ and try
to shield themselves while traveling between them. They do this by
riding in sport utility vehicles, which look armored, and by trying
to appear as intimidating as possible to potential attackers.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent study for Ford, for example, Rapaille concluded that
``bigger is better'' by itself was not enough for sport utility
vehicles. The reason the immense Ford Excursion, which is the
world's largest SUV, was not selling well, Rapaille said, was that
it didn't look menacing enough. ``It's like a big, fat elephant
that's a little dumb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rapaille has also been involved in the design and advertising of
Chrysler's PT Cruiser, an extraordinarily popular new model that
combines a minivan with a 1930s gangster-movie roadster. Customers
perceive it as ``Al Capone's car,'' Dr. Rapaille said approvingly.
``The message this car gives is: `Don't mess with me. I might have
a machine gun inside.'''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of research, which has revealed the consumer's desire
for aggressive products, has also contributed to tension between
auto marketing executives and safety engineers. The safety
engineers worry that tall sport utility vehicles are more likely to
roll over, more likely to override the bumpers and doorsills of
lower-riding cars and more likely to blind other drivers with
high-mounted headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Rapaille, incidentally, only half exemplifies the results of his
research. While he lives in a gated community outside New York,
nary a bulked-up SUV is to be found in his garage. He owns instead
two Rolls-Royces and a Porsche, partly because he worries more
about the danger of rolling over in a tall vehicle than he does
about auto theft.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may consciously or unconsciously fear crime when they
go for a drive, Rapaille said, but ``this is definitely not the
reality, it is the perception.''

JERUSALEM: THE HOLIEST CITY, THE TOUGHEST CONFLICT, THE HIGHEST
STAKES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When the late afternoon sun turns the crenellated
limestone walls of the Old City to warm glowing gold, it is easy to
understand the intense emotional hold of this tiny place.
</P>
<P>
   Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman sultan, built these walls
in 1538 _ rebuilt them, really, from the stones left behind by
Romans, Jews, Muslims, Byzantines, Crusaders, the Arab armies of
Saladin and the Mamelukes. They are walls that enclose sites holy
to the three great monotheistic religions.
</P>
<P>
   That well-known fact places Jerusalem at the very heart of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, an issue so difficult, so sensitive,
that until now peace negotiators simply put it off. The city, and
the idea of it as a capital, is a central icon to both sides. Jews,
after centuries of dispersion and persecution, still end their
Seder each Passover: ``Next year in Jerusalem.'' And in virtually
every Muslim home in every Palestinian refugee camp there hangs a
picture of the Dome of the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   But now the negotiating teams at Camp David are trying to come
to grips with Jerusalem, and they are finding it an extraordinarily
difficult task _ to imagine the unimaginable, a truly united (or
fairly divided) Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   It may be tempting to think that the easiest basis for a
settlement would be to admit that the two sides share a heritage
and guarantee all groups access to the holy sites. But in 50 years
of conflict _ and more than 20 years of peacemaking _ achieving
that kind of formula in Jerusalem has only become harder. That is
because new layers of grievance, resentment and reason for distrust
have been added on both sides. And in many Israeli and Palestinian
minds, these only reinforce the idea that their one best guarantee
of access and security is sole political control of all or part of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   For Jews, the holy place is the Western (or Wailing) Wall, the
remains of the Second Temple built on Mount Moriah after the return
from exile in Babylon. For Muslims, it is the plateau on the Temple
Mount above the wall, known as the Haram al-Sharif, or noble
sanctuary, from which the prophet Muhammad made a visit to heaven
on his winged horse. The sanctuary contains the Dome of the Rock
shrine and Al Aksa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam. It is
exactly the same place, and both Jews and Muslims share the belief
that the rock itself is where Abraham prepared his son for
sacrifice. For Christians, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, a
short distance away, is where Jesus was crucified, buried and
resurrected to redeem mankind's sins.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem and its holy sites were deemed so unique that, under
the doomed 1947 United Nations partition plan for turning the
British Palestine mandate into Arab and Jewish zones, the city was
to become an international district. It was an idea acceptable then
to David Ben-Gurion and his overwhelmingly secular Zionist
associates, who had more regard for security considerations than
for controlling religious shrines.
</P>
<P>
   But the Arab armies attacked instead, and Israel as born in a
bitter war. Israeli troops fought their way desperately up the
twisting road through the hills to relieve Jews besieged with
little food or water in the new city that had grown up outside the
Ottoman walls. The rusted hulks of their makeshift armored cars
still line the road as monuments. But the Jordanian King Abdullah's
Arab Legion, trained and led by British officers, held the heights
above Jerusalem, captured the Old City and incorporated it into
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   From 1948 to 1967, Jerusalem was a divided city _ half
Jordanian, half Israeli _ with limited passage allowed through the
Mandelbaum Gate, mostly for international officials and Christian
clergy. Most important for the future, the Old City was sealed off
to Jews and many of their religious sites were defiled. Then, in
the 1967 war, Israel took all of Jerusalem and the West Bank, its
triumphant army chaplain, Shlomo Goren (later to become a chief
rabbi of Israel) blowing his ram's horn at the Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 30 years, Israelis created their own facts on the
ground, building settlements in the West Bank, expanding Jewish
neighborhoods into East Jerusalem and neglecting services to the
Arab areas. Even since the Oslo accords, Israelis have continued to
build Jewish housing in Arab neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has made decisions on how to treat Jerusalem in a
peace settlement extraordinarily difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Khalil Shikaki, a Palestinian academic who has advised the
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, said last week that ``the
Palestinian public will not tolerate less than full sovereignty
over all of East Jerusalem, including the Haram al-Sharif.
Palestinians will not tolerate Israeli border police or Israeli
checkpoints. That is not sovereignty, that is not control.
Palestinians no longer want to ask Israelis for permission to build
their homes, to educate their children, to live their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But, at the same time, he said that if they were persuaded that
the Israeli approach was genuine, ``the Palestinian street would
certainly be flexible.''

 &UR; BC-R-MIDEAST-JERUSALEM-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; JERUSALEM: be flexible.'' &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Amirav knows this city well. As a young paratrooper who
had already been wounded in the 1967 war, he climbed out of a
hospital window to rejoin his unit when he heard it was trying to
retake the Old City. He entered politics with the hard-right Likud
youth movement, served on the City Council and worked under the
famous Mayor Teddy Kollek on roads, planning and other municipal
matters. His political views moved toward the left years ago, and
he is now one of a handful of Israelis who have been trying to find
solutions for Jerusalem, meeting frequently with the local
Palestinian leader Faisal Husseini, whose forebear died commanding
the Arab force trying to block the road to Jerusalem in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem is a two-fold problem,'' Amirav said. ``The
emotional and psychological problem and the very practical
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Old City, he noted, is a mere one square kilometer in a city
that now measures 120 square kilometers. (In 1967, West Jerusalem,
the modern Jewish part of the city, was 37 square kilometers, and
Jordanian East Jerusalem was 7.) And, he said: ``Jerusalem is not a
united city. It is a divided city, one of the most divided in the
world. More divided than Belfast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the euphoria of 1967, we annexed 28 Arab villages that
later on became Arab neighborhoods,'' he said. ``Our aim was to
enlarge the Jewish population, but we did all the most stupid
possible things.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible solution, said Dr. Amirav, who teaches conflict
resolution at Hebrew University, is redrawing the boundaries of the
city to ``enlarge the pie'' and devising ways to share power. As
for the sensitive religious sites, he says Israelis need to be
reminded that since 1967 the Temple Mount has been under the
control of the Waqf, the Islamic charity directed by the mufti of
Jerusalem, a decision made by the Israeli military hero and former
defense minister, Moshe Dayan.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel may well be thinking along
similar lines. Last week, he called Reuvan Merhav, a former Foreign
Ministry official and member of the Jerusalem Institute for Israel
Studies, to join him at Camp David. The research institute had
prepared a report, bristling with complicated maps, showing various
options for enlarging Jerusalem by adding several large Jewish
settlements, including Ma'aleh Adumin in the West Bank, to the
municipality while at the same time giving a kind of ``functional
sovereignty'' to Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal on the table is literally building a bridge between
the village of Abu Dis, where there is already an imposing new
building believed destined to be the Palestinian Parliament, and
the Haram al-Sharif. Thus, Muslims, including Arafat, would be able
to go directly to their holy sites without having to pass through
Israeli territory or encounter Israeli police.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Dis, still a dusty little place, already partly inside
municipal borders, is on the Mount of Olives, directly overlooking
the Dome of the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as the leaders met at Camp David, Israelis clogged
the phone lines to call-in shows with their own suggestions for how
to resolve Jerusalem's status. Much of the talk was pragmatic. And
yet, the fact of deep distrust and political resistance remains.
Arafat has declared that ``the Arab leader has not been born who is
willing to forfeit the rights of Muslims in Jerusalem,'' and has
reportedly told President Clinton he fears assassination if he is
seen giving up the goal of Jerusalem as a Palestinian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, whose own mentor, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, was
gunned down for his peace efforts by an ultra religious Israeli,
saw his uneasy coalition government implode even as he departed for
Camp David. He was told last week of a newspaper poll back home
that reported that 70 percent of all Israelis believe that Israel
must not concede any part of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians in
any peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Natan Sharansky, who took his Russian immigrant party out of
Barak's coalition, has declared that ``Jerusalem is the very soul
which unites and fortifies the nation in its entirety.'' And two
former chief rabbis took out a newspaper ad to proclaim, ``Whoever,
God forbid, will lift his hand against the land of Israel and
Jerusalem and the Temple Mount will be written in shame and
disgrace for all generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The way to solve the problem, suggested Professor Rami Friedman,
the director of the Jerusalem Institute, who worked on the options
study, is perhaps not to solve it; that is, not to be too specific,
for each side has too much to lose. For the holy sites, he
suggested, perhaps it is best to muddle along. ``It sounds crazy
conceptually,'' he added, ``but it's very practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much history, so much religion, so much
nationalism embedded in that one square kilometer,'' he said,
``that any solution will create more conflict than you had
already.''

   MIDEAST-JERUSALEM-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ Jerusalem is at the heart
of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, an issue so complex that peace
negotiators simply put it off until now. Common sense seems to
dictate that the easiest basis for a settlement would be to share
the heritage and guarantee all groups access to the holy sites. But
for decades, achieving that kind of formula has only become harder,
as new layers of grievance, resentment and reason for distrust have
been added on both sides, only reinforcing in many Israeli and

   ECON-EDUCATION-REVIEW (Undated) _ For all the curative powers of
a booming economy, the overflowing prosperity of the last four
years has failed to change the second-class incomes of the
one-third of Americans over age 24 who have not gone beyond high
school. Through good times and bad, that proportion has barely
fluctuated for more than 30 years, despite all the recent
encouragement to go on to college. In the computerized modern
economy, business and government count on college to raise a
person's income and close the gap between the haves _ the college
graduates _ and the have nots. But nearly 60 million adults have
failed to make the leap into higher education. By Louis Uchitelle.

   ANTICRIME-DESIGN-REVIEW (Detroit) _ Some holsters for a cellular
phone look just like those for pistols. New houses often have their
porches not in the front yard but in the back, shielded and hidden.
Sport utility vehicles are often designed to intimidate would-be
criminals as well as other motorists. America seems to be winning
the war against crime, but don't tell that to product designers.
Companies are tapping into customers' deepest fears of crime with
products subtly or ostentatiously designed to protect and reassure
the owner and, sometimes, intimidate potential attackers. By Keith
Bradsher.

<P>
   EMAIL-SURVEILLANCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ New computer technology
enables law-enforcement authorities to troll through millions of
e-mails, honing in on the correspondences of suspects. But unlike
traditional telephone wiretaps, the technology also can capture
communications of others not suspected of a crime, raising concerns
that it could be employed to monitor people and groups far beyond
the suspected mobsters and drug kingpins who have been the
traditional targets of telephone wiretaps. By Stephen Labaton.

two weeks ago when a mountain, loosened by monsoon rains, collapsed

degradation because, by their standards, the living was good. They
were part of the changing face of poverty _ a vast population shift
occurring throughout much of the world from the joblessness and
hunger of the countryside to the comparative wealth of the cities.
By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-GIRLS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The most relentless struggle over
the social restrictions of the Islamic Revolution has concerned
what women wear. Last week it was announced that prepubescent
schoolgirls would be allowed to wear colors to school. One concern
has been that porosis has increased among women, even young women,
because sunlight, which helps the body form Vitamin D, does not
penetrate their dark clothing. And dermatologists have complained
that the rubbing of the chador head covering against the skin
contributes to acne and rashes. By Elaine Sciolino.

   MANILA, Philippines _ Roberto Aquino, 14, says he finds ``false
gold'' in garbage. A scavenger on Manila's garbage mountain when he
is not in school, he specializes in copper wire. On a good day he
can earn half as much as his fifth-grade teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people died here two weeks ago when the
seven-story-high mountain, loosened by monsoon rains, collapsed on
their shantytown. Like their neighbors, they lived here amid the
filth and flies and degradation because the living was good. Mostly
upwardly mobile migrants from the barren countryside, they were
feeding their families and putting their children through school.
Like Roberto, they had struck gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you have a family of four,'' said Matthew Westfall, an
urban development specialist with the Asian Development Bank, which
is based here. ``The kids go to school part time and pick trash
part time. You could get up to 15,000 or 16,000 pesos a month,
possibly.'' That sum, about $400, ``puts you above the poverty
line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The people of the dumpsite, which they call Promised Land, are
not an aberration. They are part of the changing face of poverty _
a vast population shift taking place in much of the world, from the
joblessness and hunger of the countryside to the comparative wealth
of the cities. But for most of these migrants, that comparative
wealth is found in places like the Manila dumpsite, part of a
growing sea of poverty that laps at the edges of small, high-rise
islands of urban affluence.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, where cities of 10 million people or more are spreading
as fast as anywhere in the world, this urban landscape is replacing
the fields and trees of the villages for an increasing proportion
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years ago, Westfall said, only one in five Asians
lived in cities. Today the ratio is one in three. Twenty years from
now, more than half the population will be urban. In 1990, he said,
the region's cities needed a total of $38 billion a year to provide
urban services like water, sanitation and transport. In 20 years
that figure is expected to rise to an impossible $292 billion.
</P>
<P>
   These huge ``megacities,'' groaning with their burden of the
disenfranchised poor, will dominate the 21st century, it is said,
the way the nation-state dominated the 20th century and empires
ruled in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Urbanization, of course, is not just an Asian phenomenon. Nor is
the misery of the poor. Garbage mountains rise in Latin America and
Africa as well. But it is in Asia, perhaps, with its enormous
population pressures, that the issue is drawn most strikingly.
</P>
<P>
   Manila today, for example, has 13 percent of the Philippines' 74
million people but generates 30 to 40 percent of the nation's
wealth. Bangkok has 10 percent of Thailand's population but
generates 40 percent of its wealth. ``People in rural areas have no
alternative but to migrate,'' said Anil Deolalikar, a professor of
economics at the University of Washington in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But garbage dumps aside, said Naved Hamid, a senior policy
planner with the Asian Development Bank, these poor see little of
the cities' wealth.
</P>
<P>
   There is no one pattern for urban poverty and therefore no
single cure. In China, the pattern is predominantly one of a vast
floating population of migrant workers who follow jobs from city to
city. In Manila, where many urban services have broken down, it
also includes people like civil servants and teachers, whose pay
puts them above the poverty line but who often have no alternative
to living in the ugliest of slums.
</P>
<P>
   The urban underclass for the most part lives apart from the
social and economic structure of its city, invisible to most
residents and without the political weight to demand their share of
services. So they create their own separate _ though dependent _
economies. Some 80,000 squatters cluster around Manila's garbage
mountain, for example. They include perhaps 3,000 scavengers and
another 9,000 or so people whose livelihoods depend directly on
what urban experts call ``the recycling waste chain.''
</P>
<P>
   As planners seek new ways to address the growing disaster of
urban poverty, the world's millions of slum dwellers find their own
ways to survive. The art of scavenging, it appears, is one of the
great tributes to human inventiveness. There are children who dive
for golf balls in the water hazards of golf courses and there are
daring teen-agers who scurry for brass shell casings on military
firing ranges.
</P>
<P>
   In Laos, people use old bombshells to construct their houses. In
America, the urban poor dig for aluminum cans (and cold slices of
pizza) in garbage bins.
</P>
<P>
   In Nigeria this month _ in a tragedy that is a companion to the
garbage landslide in Manila _ hundreds of scavengers died in an
explosion and fire while trying to earn their living by puncturing
a pipeline and siphoning off gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   People like this not only make a living; they make a home for
themselves. The shanties at Manila's dump are hung with flower pots
and posters of soccer teams. There are tiny barbershops and ice
cream stands. There are births and weddings and school graduations.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people in the family of Jennifer Gino Evangelista died in
the landslide, including her parents. Twenty-one survived. None of
them want to move away.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, said Evangelista, 27, her father brought the
family here from the countryside after taking them from place to
place in search of a living. ``Every year we would move,'' she
said. ``We never had a permanent address. We were tourists in our
own country.''
</P>
<P>
   That homeless life ended here on the fringes of the Promised
Land dump.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where we've stayed the longest _ 12 years,'' she said.
``This is where we've multiplied. This is where we've put down
roots. So this is our home now.''

   Making Margin Calls in a Tightening Race
</P>
<P>
   In the album of Campaign 2000 cliches, get ready to paste in
``Too close to call.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a term that Americans are likely to hear frequently this
year, as strategists and journalists weigh in with state-by-state
analyses of the treacherous electoral map that confronts Gov.
George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The early conventional wisdom? It's too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Swing states in the presidential race like New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri and Washington are
all rated as tossups or moving only marginally toward Bush, who is
strongest in the South and Rocky Mountain states, or toward Gore,
whose support is heaviest on the East and West Coasts. Factor in
the participation of third-party contenders like Pat Buchanan and
Ralph Nader, and it's hard to conclude anything except: It's too
close to call.
</P>
<P>
   The tightness of the race has, if anything, intensified the
guessing game of who the candidates will choose as their running
mates. With the Republican convention set to begin in Philadelphia
in eight days, most of the attention is on Bush's choice, which the
governor said he will make imminently.
</P>
<P>
   A leading contender is Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary
in the Bush administration. Other names mentioned frequently
include the Republican governors of two big industrial states, Tom
Ridge of Pennsylvania and George Pataki of New York, as well as
Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma and
former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there is the name with star power, Sen.
John McCain of Arizona, who was reported to be softening in his
opposition to accepting the vice presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Gore was making his case for the presidency in
Bush's own back yard, traveling to Texas to criticize his rival's
reign as governor, which got some Texans' dander up. ``Texas isn't
nearly as backward and third world as the Gore campaign would make
us out,'' said Michael Levy, the publisher of Texas Monthly
magazine. Proud of its homegrown candidate, Texas is probably not
too close to call.

   The Elian of the Animal Kingdom
</P>
<P>
   On one side stands a teary-eyed Russian couple whose Brooklyn
community has vowed to go to any length to help them keep their
adopted pet monkey. On the other side is an adamant state
government backed by a host of monkey experts and the power of the
endangered-species law.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle, oblivious to all the fuss, stands Cookie
Flikshtein, a rare diana monkey who is living the good life, eating
Rocky Road ice cream and wearing frilly red miniskirts, while her
fate is being decided.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks after the conclusion of the Elian Gonzalez custody
battle comes an even stranger scuffle over little Cookie, age 6.
Her adoptive parents, Roman and Inna Flikshtein, have argued
unsuccessfully in court that there is no better place for Cookie
than their monkey-friendly home. The state attorney general's
office, meanwhile, maintains that Cookie is a member of an
endangered species and belongs in a special animal rescue program
at the Detroit Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   There are no immediate plans to wrest Cookie from the Flikshtein
home, where she has lived for five years in such familial bliss
that 13-year-old Michelle Flikshtein refers to the monkey as her
sister. But the Flikshtein's neighbors, many of whom are recent
immigrants from Russia, have closed ranks, promising to protect
young Cookie until the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to sit here and not let people come near,'' said
Lubov Gruber, who lives down the block. ``We will protest this for

   Congress Approves Tax Cut to Help Married Couples
</P>
<P>
   Congress finished work on a Republican bill to give an
election-year tax break to married couples. But President Clinton,
saying the measure was too costly, promised to veto it. The bill
would provide $292 billion in tax cuts over the next decade, and
was intended in part to address the marriage penalty, the quirk in
the tax code that forces many two-income couples to pay a higher
tax bill than they would if they had remained single. Democrats
said they also want to address the penalty, but do it in a less
expensive way that directs more benefits to low- and middle-income
people.

   Better Colon Cancer Test Urged
</P>
<P>
   The test used to screen healthy adults for colon cancer should
be changed, researchers say: Instead of the currently recommended
sigmoidoscopy, which examines the lower two feet of the colon,
patients should undergo colonoscopy, which probes its entire 4- to
5-foot length.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter test fails to detect abnormal growths high in the
colon, scientists warned in the New England Journal of Medicine.
But colonoscopy costs $1,500, and most insurers will not cover it
as a screening test.
</P>
<P>
   And the public has shown little enthusiasm for either test,
which require the insertion of long tubes equipped with cameras
into the rectum.

   Internet Gambling Bill Fails
</P>
<P>
   In a blow to casino owners, the House failed to approve a bill
to curb the exploding $1.2 billion industry of Internet gambling.
Most lawmakers favored banning online casino-style games, sports
wagers and lottery sales. But despite wide backing _ from Christian
evangelists to liquor store owners _ they fell short of the votes
needed to limit debate.
</P>
<P>
   Cybergamblers, meanwhile, relied on an equally odd mix of
Republican governors, online casino operators and administration
officials to keep the largely unregulated industry on a roll.

   Loan to Fight African AIDS
</P>
<P>
   The United States plans to lend up to $1 billion annually to
sub-Saharan African nations where AIDS and HIV afflict 25 million
people. The American loans, which will carry commercial interest
rates, can be used only to buy American-produced drugs, equipment
or medical services. Officials expect Japan and Europe to make
similar amounts available to support their medical exports.
</P>
<P>
   James A. Harmon, the Export-Import Bank president, said the bank
intends to do well for America by doing good for Africa. The effort
was generally praised by charity groups and African nations, but
some Clinton administration officials worried that the loans
undermined efforts to arrange debt relief for the same countries.

   Missile Offer by North Korea
</P>
<P>
   America needs a missile defense, some say, because of countries
like North Korea. One solution, according to Russian President
Vladimir Putin, who is rallying opposition to the missile plan, is
to remove North Korea from the equation. So he traveled to
Pyongyang, coming away with a North Korean offer to drop its
missile program _ if other nations provide it with rockets to
launch satellites. But that's a big if. As a former Pentagon
official put it, it's still unclear just ``what is going on in
North Korea.''

   Plan to Breach Dams Delayed

   A plan that could have led to the breaching of four dams on the
Snake River in the Pacific Northwest has been postponed. The plan
was aimed at easing the way for endangered species of salmon to
return to spawning grounds. But the White House chose instead to
embrace an alternative course. Trying to balance voters' support
for the salmon with regional officials' opposition to any breach,
it will propose smaller steps to help the species while deferring
until at least 2005 any razing of the dams.

   2 Charged in Olympic Scandal

   Two chief organizers of Salt Lake City's bid to win the 2002
Winter Olympics, Thomas K. Welch and David Johnson, were indicted
on 15 counts of conspiracy to commit bribery, fraud and
racketeering relating to the vote-buying scandal that erupted in
1998. The indictment alleged that the men spent more than $1
million to bribe delegates of the International Olympic Committee.
The men denied any wrongdoing.

   Earlier in the week, Dr. Wade Exum, the former chief of drug
testing for the U.S. Olympic Committee, sued the committee,

former President Hafez Assad. Assad, a 34-year-old eye doctor,

``magic wand'' to reform the ailing state-run economy, would not
budge from his father's rejection of any compromise with Israel and
invited Syrians to express themselves _ but only with ``positive

   Report on Murder of Gay GI

   After a 21-year-old gay Army private was bludgeoned to death
with a baseball bat by a fellow soldier as he slept in his barracks
last July, the Army opened an investigation into the atmosphere at
Fort Campbell, the Kentucky base where the murder occurred. A new
report has exonerated all officers of blame in the murder of Pfc.
Barry Winchell and has concluded that no climate of homophobia
exists at the base.
</P>
<P>
   Winchell's mother, who has sued the Army for the wrongful death
of her son, called the report a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who is gay, said the report is one
more step in a virtually unbroken pattern of Pentagon contempt for
the rights of gay and lesbian service people.

   A Slippery Particle Is Found
</P>
<P>
   An elusive particle that had been on physicists' Most Wanted
list for 25 years has finally been detected, scientists announced
at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. Called the tau
neutrino, it is the last of a notoriously slippery family of
particles to be seen. Those particles, all neutrinos of various
kinds, pass through other matter almost without a trace. But they
are crucial elements of the theory that particle physicists believe
explains the structure of all matter.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is just one more particle predicted by the theory that
has not been seen. Physicists plan to begin chasing that particle,
the Higgs boson, next spring.

   HOLLYWOOD _ The story goes like this: Several people are walking
down the middle of the street in the middle of the night. Suddenly,
a truck comes along and flattens them. How can you tell which one
is the movie studio executive? He's the guy who jumps up and says,
``Here's why that just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect hindsight is a common Hollywood trait. So is the ability
to explain, as though to a simpleton, exactly why such-and-such a
movie was a box-office bomb or why some superstar's latest movie
failed to open at the levels anticipated. The constantly shifting
ground upon which the Current Prevailing Wisdom rests must be
updated each weekend _ especially when something comes along that
contradicts the prevailing wisdom going into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up the issue of PG-13 _ at the top of the Current
Prevailing Wisdom list at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, Hollywood studios are insisting that filmmakers
guarantee they will deliver a movie that will get at most a PG-13
rating from the Motion Picture Association of America _ and not an
R, which requires any moviegoer under 18 to be accompanied
(theoretically) by a parent or guardian. This is stressed in cases
of big summer releases, when it is important to get as many people
into the theaters as possible and grease _ not restrictions _ is
needed at the turnstiles. ``The question is, where does the largest
audience lie?'' said Dan Fellman, president of distribution for
Warner Brothers. ``At the end of the day, it's within the PG-13.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense on paper. Certainly if more people are allowed
into a movie theater, then the pool of ticket buyers is larger and
a movie should, by rights, have a better shot at making a bigger
pile of money. But is this Current Prevailing Wisdom really
correct?
</P>
<P>
   Follow the bouncing ball:
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend just before the Fourth of July, two major movies
were expected to compete to be No. 1 at the box office: ``The
Perfect Storm'' from Warner Brothers (rated PG-13) and ``The
Patriot'' from Columbia Pictures (rated R). In the run-up to the
weekend, ``The Patriot'' was widely seen as the likelier winner.
Both films had top-notch directors, but ``Patriot'' had a more
bankable star in Mel Gibson. Prerelease polling indicated that
audiences were more eager to see the period epic. Instead,
``Perfect Storm'' ended up making almost twice as much as
``Patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monday-morning quarterbacking settled on three explanations.
``The Patriot'' ran too long for summer audiences (160 minutes).
Audiences don't really like Colonial-era stories. ``Patriot'' was
rated R.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it was said, PG-13 trumps R in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the next weekend. The only major opening was ``Scary
Movie,'' a decidedly R-rated spoof of horror films. Predicted to be
a decent-sized hit, it was a phenomenon, earning more than $40
million, the largest opening ever for an R-rated film. Wham!
Anybody get the number of that truck?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this was the movie that was the exception to the rule,''
said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, which
monitors box-office performance. ``They don't come along every day,
but there are some movies where the rating doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so PG-13 is better than R _ except sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, ``X-Men'' opened. Again, the polling predicted a
sizable hit. Instead, it opened huge, earning more than $54
million. Its rating: PG-13.
</P>
<P>
   To get some historical context into this debate, Exhibitor
Relations crunched the box-office numbers for the last three
summers, the four months in which the studios do 40 percent of
their annual business.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the films that finished in first place in each of the
18 weekends from early May to Labor Day in 1999, a record year at
the movie box office, 11 weekends saw a PG-13 movie in first place,
three weekends saw a PG, one weekend saw a G and only two weekends
saw an R. In 1998, it was a closer call; eight weekends had a PG-13
movie in first place, eight weekends had an R and two had a PG.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 11 weeks of this summer, PG-13 films were in first
place on five weekends, R films on five weekends and a PG film on
one weekend.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps the difference between PG-13 and R isn't so great
after all? Not so fast, Dergarabedian said. One must also look at
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitor Relations looked at all 265 films released last
summer. The largest number of them, 157, were rated R. Less than
half, 67, were rated PG-13. The average R film made $20 million
while the average PG-13 made $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stands to reason,'' Dergarabedian said. ``That's what R
means, restricted. You're restricting the audience. But I'd hate
for this somehow to cause a chilling effect on the artistic
process.''

<P>
   &UR; HOME TOWN &LR; , by Tracy Kidder. (Washington Square/Pocket Books,
$14.95.) Through personal profiles and historical and demographic
digressions, the author takes the pulse of Northampton, Mass., a
city of 30,000 highly diverse people. Most of the natives leave
when they reach adulthood, and are replaced by newcomers. Kidder's
``smart and gently ironic writing is always good company,'' Ben
Yagoda wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LOUSE &LR; , by David Grand. (Harvest/Harcourt, $13.) This satirical
tale of a monstrous tycoon modeled on the aging Howard Hughes and
the loyal valet who tends to his boss's increasingly eccentric
demands mirrors the plight of workers in an era of job insecurity
and corporate brainwashing. The result is ``a delightfully eerie
and angry first novel,'' David Sacks wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TRUE ADVENTURES OF THE ROLLING STONES &LR; , by Stanley Booth.
(A Cappella, $16.95.) This backstage account of the band's 1969
tour and the author's own seduction by the group's dark allure is
also a personal vision of how the 1960s, from Vietnam to Altamont,
shaped an era. ``It is the only book about the Stones that I would
recommend both to the general reader and to the most devoted fan,''
Robert Palmer wrote in 1984. ``Both will find an epiphany on almost
every page.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; FAITHFULL: An Autobiography &LR; , by Marianne Faithfull with
David Dalton (Cooper Square, $16.95), the singer, '60s survivor and
serial Rolling Stone paramour recounts her many love affairs with
men, women and controlled substances. Her narrative is filled with
``spicy stories about Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Bob Dylan,''
David Kelly wrote in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HUMMINGBIRD HOUSE &LR; , by Patricia Henley. (MacMurray &AMP; Beck,
$13.) This first novel is about a burned-out American midwife
working in Central America who seems to find her true cause in
fighting the Guatemalan government's persecution of the country's
indigenous Mayan people. ``Henley does a fine job of demonstrating
the cost of compassion,'' Jeannie Pyun wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SOPRANOS &LR; , by Alan Warner. (Harvest/Harcourt, $14.) This
tender novel follows a pack of choirgirls from rural Scotland as
they embark on an odyssey of carousing while in the big city for a
singing contest. ``It's refreshing to read a novel loaded down with
teen-age drinking, smoking, swearing and the urge for sex ... and
be spared the moralizing that usually goes along with these
activities,'' Charles Taylor wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TALES OF FISHING VIRGIN SEAS &LR; , by Zane Grey. (Derrydale,
$19.95.) The acclaimed writer of westerns was also an insatiable
angler and a passionate naturalist, as this illustrated account of
his sailing trips throughout the Pacific reveals. ``Anyone who
loves tales of adventure into far seas, unusual experiences,
accounts of exotic and almost intoxicating beauty, to say nothing
of those enthusiastic fishermen for whose perusal the book is
especially intended, will find it a fascinating volume,'' The New
York Times Book Review said in 1926.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MOLLIE PEER: Or, The Underground Adventure of the Moosepath
League &LR; , by Van Reid. (Penguin, $12.95.) This sequel to ``Cordelia
Underwood: Or, The Marvelous Beginnings of the Moosepath League''
describes the continuing exploits of a Dickensian collection of
journalists, journeymen, smugglers, baseball players, barkeeps,
crooks and street urchins at loose in late 19th-century Maine. The
result is ``a thoroughly easygoing and entertaining'' novel, Betsy
Groban wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ADDIE: A Memoir &LR; , by Mary Lee Settle. (Berkley, $13.) By
casting her autobiography as a memoir about her grandmother, whose
out-of-wedlock pregnancy scandalized turn-of-the-century West
Virginia, the novelist explores the way one understands truth by
indirection. ``Settle has preserved for us a moment in the South's
history palpable as the trumpet vines and rocking chairs of a
long-departed front-porch afternoon,'' Angeline Goreau wrote in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE DRINK &LR; , by Kate Christensen. (Anchor, $12.) Claudia
Steiner could be Bridget Jones' darker twin: struggling to pay the
rent on her studio apartment by toiling as a ghostwriter to an
insane New York socialite, she can't keep from crawling through
some of the city's meaner streets. Last year the reviewer Vanessa
Grigoriadis called this a ``breezy and confident first novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A SHORT HISTORY OF RUDENESS: Manners, Morals, and Misbehavior
in Modern America &LR; , by Mark Caldwell. (Picador USA, $13.) A
literary critic surveys social behavior, past and present, and
finds that while manners change over time, they are basically no
worse today than they used to be. Last year the reviewer Naomi
Bliven called this a ``modest, readable, intelligent and
companionable'' book.

NEVER SAY DIE. JUST EXECUTE. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By KARI HASKELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you want to escape into the dark, violent world of a graphic
novel? Do you want to act out its ghastly denouement with its last,
grim death laugh? Try flipping a tiny switch and carrying out a
miniature execution.
</P>
<P>
   Death Row Marv, the rock-jawed anti-hero of the graphic comic,
``Sin City,'' by Frank Miller (Dark Horse Comics, 1994), is the
latest toy from McFarlane Toys, which is owned by Todd McFarlane,
the creator of Spawn, another comic-book anti-hero.
</P>
<P>
   Marv, who apparently needs no last name, is railroaded to the
electric chair, condemned to die for what he regards as a
justifiable revenge killing. The battery-operated toy, which is
sold in specialty shops and music stores for about $20 and marketed
for ages 13 and up, is not for the faint of heart: ``Watch Marv
convulse as the switch is thrown,'' say the words on the box,
``then hear him say, `That the best you can do?''' His eyes ``glow
red as he fries.''
</P>
<P>
   The toy's typical buyer is the 15- to 45-year-old male.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first production was completely sold out in pre-order
sales, before we even shipped,'' said Beau Smith, director of
marketing at McFarlane Toys, who did not provide production
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon, as I saw Marv _ oh, man! _ I had to have one,'' said
Eric Wahland, 34, a customer service representative and salesperson
at Spider's Web, a comic store in Seattle that is the largest
outlet for McFarlane Toys. ``We keep them up front, on top of the
counter, 10 to 15 feet from the register. Already 500 of 700 deluxe
sets ordered have been sold in just four weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Marv is half convict, half hero. He is the guy who never gets
the girl because his face is a cross between Freddy Kreuger and
Bluto; his body is a muscular mass that is as wide as it is long.
To some, he is the loser they desperately want to see win. OK, he's
an anti-hero with no charisma, good looks or any redeeming social
value.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Sin City,'' before his death sentence is carried out, Marv
has the opportunity to kill the cannibalistic sociopath who
murdered the woman he loved, a prostitute named Goldie. That gave
him a sense of vindication.
</P>
<P>
   Batteries not included.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Time was when a professional athlete who wanted a second career
would become a sports commentator, an actor or a restaurateur. Not
anymore. Today, the path off the playing field is leading
increasingly into the recording studio. Shaquille O'Neal of the Los
Angeles Lakers, his teammate Kobe Bryant and Ricky Watters of the
Seattle Seahawks have all recently made rap albums.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most extreme example of this crossover is the former
sumo wrestler Konishiki, whose debut rap/reggae/R &AMP; B compact disk,
``Konishiki KMS'' _ short for ``Konishiki Master Sumo'' _ has just
been released by 125th Street Records. Born as Salevaa Atisanoe in
Hawaii to Samoan parents, Konishiki (pronounced co-NEESH-kee and
meaning Delicate Embroidery) retired from the ring in 1998 after a
16-year career in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his new CD, he says, ``There are aspects of sumo
like the concept of `makenai-desu' _ an attitude of, `I will not
lose' _ which I've used in the ring.'' Indeed, the influence of
sumo, which in its modern form dates to the 17th century, permeates
the album in, well, unusual ways.

Konishiki's album, betrays no false modesty: (END ITALICS HERE)

   Or pullin' your head off in a guillotine.

among seasoned sumo wrestlers, but Konishiki begs to differ in
``Settin' 'em Up'': (END ITALICS HERE)

<P>
   You battle me, you're gonna need a nurse

<P>
   Fo' a broken back, a ruptured spleen, right arm fractured clean;

Doug Kenrick's answer in ``The Book of Sumo'' (Weatherhill, 1969):

   The lower-ranked rikishi [wrestlers) have so many chores and

<P>
   Wit' the top down, let the beat pound,

<P>
   Wave hello to my fans, step out and just clown.

<P>
   Fun and games is an everyday thing,

<P>
   Party 'til dawn, or kick back and just hang.

<P>
   Do anything, girl, just to see you smile.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long time and the days have passed;

<P>
   I've been around the world since I seen you last.
</P>
<P>
   It takes two to make a thing go right,
</P>
<P>
   So if you're feeling what I'm feeling, then tonight's the night.
</P>
<P>
   So we can make plans to make things better,

<P>
   You're my girl for life, so I'm down for whatever.

UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GIFTS, COUPONS AND CASH 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
(Eds: Boldface word in 8th graf should be set in italics.) 
 By JEFF STRYKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If money changes everything, why not use it on people?
</P>
<P>
   It is the cash the women want, says Barbara Harris of Anaheim,
Calif., founder of Children Require a Caring Kommunity, known by
its acronym Crack, which since 1997 has paid drug users $200 to be
sterilized or to use contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Not only cash but discount coupons, gifts and vouchers have
become incentives in programs to encourage healthy behavior,
whether the issue involves reproduction, drug treatment or even
organ donation. Yet some experts question whether such methods
actually work in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   At least 246 women have taken up the offer, according to Crack's
Web site: www.cracksterilization.com. Harris hopes a new $50
referral bonus will bring in additional clients.
</P>
<P>
   Crack's promotional slogan _ ``Don't Let a Pregnancy Interfere
With Your Drug Habit'' _ bluntly conveys why cash can be such a
powerful motivator for drug addicts, many of whom become pregnant
repeatedly and whose babies are underweight and at risk for birth
defects. Although Harris does not track how the women spend the
money, she said, ``Sure, some use it to buy more drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years before Crack began its program, a dollar-a-day
program was established in Colorado to persuade young women to
delay pregnancy. The cash is part of a program that includes weekly
support-group meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But criticism has dogged international population-planning
efforts. Widespread condemnation followed revelations in 1998 that
Peruvian women were being sterilized in exchange for dresses,
T-shirts and food in cases where informed consent was doubtful and
post-operative care inadequate. In March, members of Congress
questioned whether aid to Peru was violating prohibitions against
the use of federal funds for forced family planning abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Incentives have also encouraged women to  &UR; have &LR;  children. In
Scotland, the Catholic Church undertook an initiative in 1997 to
pay women not to terminate their pregnancies, in one case paying
the family of a 12-year-old girl. Elsewhere, moral objections over
abortion are not the issue; low birthrates are. In Japan, private
companies are offering cash bonuses to employees who have more than
one child.
</P>
<P>
   Whether cash is an undue inducement depends on the
circumstances. ``Cash is a very effective incentive that we use all
the time,'' said Bonnie Steinbock, chairwoman of the philosophy
department at the State University of New York at Albany, who has
studied incentives in reproductive decision-making. ``It isn't
necessarily coercive.''
</P>
<P>
   Offers of cash to do good are nothing new. And paying donors for
plasma, for example, has caused officials at blood banks to worry
about needy participants lying about their health histories.
</P>
<P>
   But do incentives involving reproductive decisions really work?
Sometimes, say Dr. Cheri Pies and Dr. Sarah Samuels, researchers
with the Incentives Project, a two-year program of the School of
Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley. They
found only 11 rigorous studies of such inducements, which varied
from cash and small gifts to coupons for infant formula combined
with education, support and counseling. The cash incentives could
not be linked to the success or failure of the programs in the
studies, said Pies and Samuels, who advocate using money for
achievable short-term outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Cash has also been dangled to keep teen-agers off drugs. In
Florida, Arkansas and Pennsylvania programs, participants get
discounts at local shops and exemptions from curfew rules when they
pass a voluntary urine test and agree to future random tests.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schlichter, a financial adviser and member of the
Chamber of Commerce in Chambersburg, Pa., lobbied to bring the
Arkansas anti-drug program Truce, the acronym for Teens Resisting
Unhealthy Choices Everyday, to his rural community. About 20
percent of the students in grades 8 through 12 have been
voluntarily tested. ``It was the first program we heard about that
involved a carrot and not a stick,'' Schlichter said.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal law prohibits commerce in human organs and
tissues (with an exemption for replenishable material like blood,
plasma, sperm or eggs), Pennsylvania health officials attracted
attention last year with a proposal that circumvented the 1984
statute. They designed an experimental program in which families of
organ donors would receive a $300 reimbursement for funeral
expenses. Fearful of violating the law, they recently scaled back
and now propose paying some hotel and travel costs for donor
families directly to the lodging and transportation providers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that the introduction of cash incentives could
result in fewer people donating their organs. Money has the
potential for dirtying the process, said Bob Spieldenner, a
spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing. ``Paying might
very well drive out altruism,'' Spieldenner said.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the debate about money versus altruism might be
gullibility as far as organ donation is concerned. The Department
of Health and Human Services recently began to investigate certain
practices in harvesting tissues, including skin, tendons, bones and
foreskins. Many people may be unaware that their freely given
donations may end up fattening lips or enlarging penises in what
has now become the vast, lucrative enterprise of cosmetic surgery.
Federal rules limit reimbursement for tissue to reasonable
administrative and processing costs, although some interpret those
rules expansively.
</P>
<P>
   Although the examples of cold, hard cash enlisted to encourage
health and good works is growing, one particular program has failed
to catch on. The Frederick Christian Fellowship in Frederick, Md.,
gave $10 bills to first-time visitors in 1994, which succeeded in
almost doubling attendance. Few churches, though, have followed
suit.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the curative powers of a booming economy, the
overflowing prosperity of the last four years has failed to raise
the second-class incomes of the one-third of American adults who
have not gone beyond high school.
</P>
<P>
   Just as near-universal high school education was one of the
great achievements of 20th-century America, politicians and
business leaders have long sought to lure more students to college,
reasoning that the college-educated would earn more in a ``new
economy'' that now more than ever rewards a bachelor's degree.
College, they believed, could help close the gap between the
economic haves and have nots. Yet the proportion of Americans who
have only a high school diploma has barely budged for 30 years,
through good times and bad.
</P>
<P>
   Where many saw college as the answer, nearly everyone also
counted on the booming economy as a way to narrow the income gap.
Prosperity created a tight labor market that drove up wages, which
have indeed risen faster than inflation for everyone. But as
college graduates' earnings rose even more quickly, the wage gap
widened, not shrank.
</P>
<P>
   These stubborn education and income gaps are barely mentioned on
the campaign trail. Politicians and policy-makers speak mainly of
sending more people to college, without recognizing that a steady
third of adults 25 and older have only finished high school _ and
that percentage does not seem likely to come down soon. For a host
of reasons _ age, lack of tuition money, inadequate secondary
schooling, reluctance to study, discouragement from family and
friends _ college is not a viable option for a significant portion
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The data suggest that neither a robust economy nor policies that
try to push people through college can significantly narrow the
income gap.
</P>
<P>
   Harry J. Holzer, a labor economist and a visiting fellow at the
Urban Institute, would improve the lot of the lower-paid through
greater ``institutional support'' _ more government subsidies for
health care, for example, better unemployment insurance, a broader
earned income tax credit and larger subsidies for child care and
housing.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration endorses some of these steps, while
Gov. George W. Bush emphasizes tax cuts that would leave low-income
workers with more take-home pay. But college has become the favored
approach, the one that business most applauds. Nearly $13 billion
in federal funding has gone this year into college scholarships and
tax credits for college tuition. Bush favors similar subsidies and
so does Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who do not go past high school, and that will
always be the case,'' said Martin Bailey, chairman of President
Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. ``Over time, however, the
goal is to reduce that proportion, because in this new economy, a
college education is increasingly important.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of the nation's 131.6 million jobs are classified by the
Labor Department as not requiring a college education. Yet for many
employers, high school diplomas are simply not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a bachelor's degree just to apply for the best
jobs,'' said Stephen Rose, a senior economist at the Educational
Testing Service. ``That is as it should be for doctors, lawyers,
scientists, engineers, computer specialists. But look at
middle-level managers. In 1960, only 40 percent had a bachelor's
degree and today it is 80 percent.'' Many such jobs don't
necessarily require a B.A., he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But in the high-technology economy, employers say they
value a college degree as evidence that a job applicant has learned
to think and to master new ways of working, and is also
sufficiently disciplined to work hard. The high school diploma no
longer sends that message to employers.
</P>
<P>
   Education has always raised incomes. For more than a century,
the college educated have been at the top of the earnings pyramid,
the masters of each new, complicated technology. High school
prepared hundreds of millions of ordinary workers for the modern
workplace and helped to lift their incomes, shrinking the gap
between their pay and that of the college educated. But since 1980,
that gap has widened again. The economic boom did narrow the
earnings gap a bit in the mid-1990s, as employers competed to hire
low-wage workers. But starting in 1997, the wages of college
graduates pulled ahead, according to the Economic Policy
Institute's latest figures.
</P>
<P>
   Higher-level jobs for the college educated are among the fastest
growing, the Labor Department reports _ those for computer
analysts, engineers, upper level executives and secondary-school
teachers. But lower-paying jobs that require only high school
training are also among the fastest growing _ jobs for retail sales
people, cashiers, truck drivers, office clerks and home health care
aides.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this demand, the wages of people with only a high school
diploma _ rather solid in the days of unionized blue collar factory
work _ have fallen steadily behind for 20 years, making college
seem the only route to the $20.58 an hour that college graduates
earned, on average, last year, according to the Economic Policy
Institute. By comparison, the high school educated averaged only
$11.83; adjusted for inflation, the earnings gap has risen nearly
70 percent since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The gap has widened partly because union strength has declined,
and with it many of the higher-paying jobs once available to high
school graduates. And the minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, is
not as high today as it was in the late 1960s. ``The deterioration
of unions and the minimum wage probably explains up to one-third of
the increase in the earnings gap in the past 20 years,'' Holzer
said.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R-ECON-EDUCATION-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: Holzer said. &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These financial pressures have indeed pushed more Americans into
college. College graduates now represent nearly 25 percent of all
adults, up from 17 percent in 1980. The proportion of workers with
only a high school diploma has correspondingly fallen to 34 percent
from 39 percent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if one-third of the population continues to balk at moving
past high school, then one solution is to raise the quality of that
education. More than 40 states are now requiring students to pass
achievement exams at various stages of their schooling. In the
attempt to raise standards, governments and school districts have
stepped up spending to train teachers, reduce class size, improve
courses, provide vocational training or apprenticeships, expand
Head Start and link schools to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is a downside, however, to raising standards and then
failing students who don't meet them. A system could emerge that is
less forgiving than American public schools have traditionally
been, less willing to give poor students a second or third or
fourth chance, says Paul Attewell, a sociologist at the College of
the City University of New York. ``It has not happened yet, but in
such a system you are likely to produce a large number of poor kids
and minority kids who drop out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, he added, may be a case in point: Hundreds of
young people failed qualifying exams but didn't show up for
compulsory schooling this summer. Richard Murnane, an economist at
Harvard's Graduate School of Education, acknowledges the risk.
``That is a problem,'' he said, ``but the alternative of graduating
students without stronger skills will penalize them for a
lifetime.''

LEARNING TO LIVE WITH BIG BROTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1928, the Supreme Court took up the case of Roy
``Big Boy'' Olmstead, a bootlegger whose phones had been tapped by
federal agents without a warrant. The court ruled that evidence
obtained in that way was legal, prompting a remarkable dissent by
Judge Louis D. Brandeis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The progress of science in furnishing the government with the
means of espionage is not likely to stop with wiretapping,''
Justice Brandeis wrote in a dissent that the court adopted as the
law nearly 40 years later. ``Ways may some day be developed by
which the government, without removing papers from secret drawers,
can reproduce them in court, and by which it will be enabled to
expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the ubiquity of e-mail and the ingenuity of the FBI,
that day has arrived. Over the last couple of weeks it has been
widely reported that the FBI is now using a computer program called
Carnivore, which, once installed on the network of an Internet
service provider, can troll through millions of e-mail messages and
hone in on the electronic correspondence of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the FBI has reported using the program fewer than 25
times since it was developed 18 months ago, but that number is
expected to grow quickly, since the the bureau expects it to become
an indispensable law enforcement tool, particularly in
international espionage and terrorism cases.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, say critics, but Carnivore is also capable of
simultaneously monitoring the communications of people not
suspected of a crime. That has caused civil liberties groups and
privacy advocates to worry that the technology might be used to
monitor unpopular groups or political enemies, and not just
suspected criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as lawmakers on Capitol Hill began voicing their
concerns, the White House moved to calm the growing storm. John
Podesta, President Clinton's chief of staff, outlined legislative
proposals that would set legal requirements for surveillance in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that some kind of legislation is needed to make
sense of the existing patchwork of laws and court cases on
electronic surveillance. At present, for example, e-mail sent via
cable modem is more strictly protected that any other communication
form _ even telephone conversations _ while law enforcement
requests for lists of telephone calls to or from a particular line
must be granted without question by a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The White House proposed replacing these illogical distinctions
with a uniform, rational set of standards. Civil liberties and
privacy groups support this idea in principle, but are highly
critical of the administration for refusing to explain how broadly
it intends to use Carnivore or to describe what safeguards are in
place for preventing its abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say that computer systems like
Carnivore are necessary because e-mail is becoming more frequently
used for communication among criminals. And the officials note that
these cybermonitors can actually be set to record communications
much more selectively than a phone tap.
</P>
<P>
   Carnivore could, for instance, be programmed to pick up the
e-mail from only one sender and a particular computer, while
excluding such e-mail as messages to or from, say, the sender's
lawyer or wife. Phone taps, on the other hand, pick up everything.
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing on Friday, top FBI officials also announced
plans to submit Carnivore to analysis by independent academics, and
noted that the system kept a log of what it was asked to pick up,
which could be used by a court to spot any violations.
</P>
<P>
   In making their case, supporters of cybersurveillance say that
the only way to track e-mail is by combing through all of the
messages on a particular network, because e-mail consists of a
series of digital packets that are broken apart at the sending end
and transmitted along multiple electronic paths before being
reconstituted by the recipient's computer.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, privacy groups and some Internet service providers,
or ISPs, say there remains a less intrusive alternative. The
providers, like AOL or the Microsoft Network, could be ordered by a
court to turn over specific material, rather than give the FBI
unlimited access to a network. That is precisely how telephone
companies are treated; they cooperate with warrants for wiretaps
and lists of telephone numbers called from a particular phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is who should be in control,'' said James X.
Dempsey, staff attorney for the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a civil liberties group in Washington. ``It upsets the
balance among competing interests and privacy for law enforcement
to, in essence, kick the companies out of the way, hook up a black
box, and say, don't touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said that it was time for a reappraisal of all the
standards used by the government to eavesdrop, particularly as the
world moves into an era of digital communications that can be more
readily monitored by computers and more easily masked by
encryption.
</P>
<P>
   As even household appliances begin to be wired into the Internet
and many of our most personal thoughts and associations are now
shared with the computer, the issue has taken on a new imperative
and is being debated on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   The British government (whose house-to-house searches in the
English colonies led to the Fourth Amendment prohibition against
unreasonable searches) is near to adopting a law, the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Bill, or RIP, that would require Internet
service companies to finance the permanent installation of a
Carnivore-like system for government use.
</P>
<P>
   A similar system is already in place in Russia, while in the
Netherlands a debate is raging over whether the government should
have the authority to tap into e-mail at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This debate really cries out for a return to first
principles,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic
Privacy Information Center, a research organization that studies
privacy issues and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most important of such principles, he said, is that
the government should always use the least intrusive investigative
techniques before taking the invasive step of trying to intercept
telephone calls or e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the solution?'' he asked. ``A lot of oversight, a lot
of accountability, and a great deal of concern about the potential
surveillance capabilities of the electronic police state.''

THE LATEST FASHION: FEAR-OF-CRIME DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Walk into a department store these days and you can
buy a holster for a cellular phone that looks just like a holster
for a snub-nosed pistol. Visit a consumer electronics store and
you'll find that the computers are no longer white and
cheery-looking but black, sleek and faintly menacing. Stop at an
auto dealership and there will be an array of tall sport utility
vehicles designed to intimidate other motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Designers of a wide variety of consumer products say that the
American public is increasingly entranced by styling that suggests
a high level of aggression. They point to the popularity of black,
red and white as colors, the prevalence of crisp, even sharp, edges
for many products, and a declining emphasis on personal comfort in
everything from furniture to clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like `sex sells' _ in this case, violence
sells,'' said William Stumpf, a Minneapolis-based designer best
known as the inventor of the Aeron chair. ``There's a meanness
aesthetic being developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce R. Hannah, a professor of industrial design at the Pratt
Institute in New York, said his young design students were
particularly captivated by ideas that emphasized rawness and even
pain over comfort. One student, for example, was interested in
spiky jewelry that would be painful to wear and light switches with
sharp edges. And Hannah sees the same extremism at work in young
people's fashion. ``There are these big, black, chunky, almost
storm-trooper shoes and crisp trousers; there isn't the rumpled
look of the '60s and '70s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some older designers complain that there is little on the market
that they want to buy. Clyde Foles, the 56-year-old chairman of the
industrial design department at the Center for Creative Studies, a
design institute in Detroit, said he had been unable to find a
radio for his summer cottage because the clean, rectangular,
Bauhaus-style designs he was looking for had given way to alarming
combinations of curves and sharp edges. The prevalent design these
days, ``looks like Darth Vader's helmet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Where this aggression is coming from is a mystery. Designers and
market researchers most commonly cite video games, with their
emphasis on violence and exotic yet menacing shapes for androids,
space aliens and other threats. Others point to Jung's observation
that people behave worse when times are better, and suggest that
the end of the Cold War and the nation's economic boom have left
Americans freer to explore their deepest psychological feelings,
including the fear of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Some designers single out the wealth of research showing that
Americans remain very much afraid of crime, even though crime has
actually fallen. Federal crime surveys show that violent crime
dropped 22.7 percent between 1993 and 1998. Rates for other crimes
have fallen even more sharply, including a 43.2 percent plunge in
motor vehicle thefts. But Gallup polls since 1989 have consistently
found that a majority of Americans believe that crime is worsening,
although the size of that majority has shrunk over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward playing on fears of crime is most noticeable in
transportation products, Stumpf said. Powerboats are now often low,
lethal-looking craft influenced by the stealth fighter's design.
Bicycles have studded, off-road tires instead of racing tires.
Skateboards have images of fire-breathing dragons instead of racing
stripes. And tall, large sport utility vehicles have replaced
sleek, low sports cars as the favorite choice of image-conscious
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Archetype Discoveries Worldwide, which is based in Boca Raton,
Fla., does psychological consumer researcher for many large
clients, including Seagram, Procter &AMP; Gamble, DaimlerChrysler, Ford
and General Motors. Dr. Clotaire Rapaille, the company's founder
and chairman, contends that the United States is in some ways
becoming a medieval society, in which people live and work in the
modern equivalent of castles _ gated communities, apartment
buildings with doormen and office buildings with guards _ and try
to shield themselves while traveling between them. They do this by
riding in sport utility vehicles, which look armored, and by trying
to appear as intimidating as possible to potential attackers.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent study for Ford, for example, Rapaille concluded that
``bigger is better'' by itself was not enough for sport utility
vehicles. The reason the immense Ford Excursion, which is the
world's largest SUV, was not selling well, Rapaille said, was that
it didn't look menacing enough. ``It's like a big, fat elephant
that's a little dumb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rapaille has also been involved in the design and advertising of
Chrysler's PT Cruiser, an extraordinarily popular new model that
combines a minivan with a 1930s gangster-movie roadster. Customers
perceive it as ``Al Capone's car,'' Dr. Rapaille said approvingly.
``The message this car gives is: `Don't mess with me. I might have
a machine gun inside.'''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of research, which has revealed the consumer's desire
for aggressive products, has also contributed to tension between
auto marketing executives and safety engineers. The safety
engineers worry that tall sport utility vehicles are more likely to
roll over, more likely to override the bumpers and doorsills of
lower-riding cars and more likely to blind other drivers with
high-mounted headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Rapaille, incidentally, only half exemplifies the results of his
research. While he lives in a gated community outside New York,
nary a bulked-up SUV is to be found in his garage. He owns instead
two Rolls-Royces and a Porsche, partly because he worries more
about the danger of rolling over in a tall vehicle than he does
about auto theft.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may consciously or unconsciously fear crime when they
go for a drive, Rapaille said, but ``this is definitely not the
reality, it is the perception.''

JERUSALEM: THE HOLIEST CITY, THE TOUGHEST CONFLICT, THE HIGHEST
STAKES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When the late afternoon sun turns the crenellated
limestone walls of the Old City to warm glowing gold, it is easy to
understand the intense emotional hold of this tiny place.
</P>
<P>
   Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman sultan, built these walls
in 1538 _ rebuilt them, really, from the stones left behind by
Romans, Jews, Muslims, Byzantines, Crusaders, the Arab armies of
Saladin and the Mamelukes. They are walls that enclose sites holy
to the three great monotheistic religions.
</P>
<P>
   That well-known fact places Jerusalem at the very heart of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, an issue so difficult, so sensitive,
that until now peace negotiators simply put it off. The city, and
the idea of it as a capital, is a central icon to both sides. Jews,
after centuries of dispersion and persecution, still end their
Seder each Passover: ``Next year in Jerusalem.'' And in virtually
every Muslim home in every Palestinian refugee camp there hangs a
picture of the Dome of the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   But now the negotiating teams at Camp David are trying to come
to grips with Jerusalem, and they are finding it an extraordinarily
difficult task _ to imagine the unimaginable, a truly united (or
fairly divided) Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   It may be tempting to think that the easiest basis for a
settlement would be to admit that the two sides share a heritage
and guarantee all groups access to the holy sites. But in 50 years
of conflict _ and more than 20 years of peacemaking _ achieving
that kind of formula in Jerusalem has only become harder. That is
because new layers of grievance, resentment and reason for distrust
have been added on both sides. And in many Israeli and Palestinian
minds, these only reinforce the idea that their one best guarantee
of access and security is sole political control of all or part of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   For Jews, the holy place is the Western (or Wailing) Wall, the
remains of the Second Temple built on Mount Moriah after the return
from exile in Babylon. For Muslims, it is the plateau on the Temple
Mount above the wall, known as the Haram al-Sharif, or noble
sanctuary, from which the prophet Muhammad made a visit to heaven
on his winged horse. The sanctuary contains the Dome of the Rock
shrine and Al Aksa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam. It is
exactly the same place, and both Jews and Muslims share the belief
that the rock itself is where Abraham prepared his son for
sacrifice. For Christians, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, a
short distance away, is where Jesus was crucified, buried and
resurrected to redeem mankind's sins.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem and its holy sites were deemed so unique that, under
the doomed 1947 United Nations partition plan for turning the
British Palestine mandate into Arab and Jewish zones, the city was
to become an international district. It was an idea acceptable then
to David Ben-Gurion and his overwhelmingly secular Zionist
associates, who had more regard for security considerations than
for controlling religious shrines.
</P>
<P>
   But the Arab armies attacked instead, and Israel as born in a
bitter war. Israeli troops fought their way desperately up the
twisting road through the hills to relieve Jews besieged with
little food or water in the new city that had grown up outside the
Ottoman walls. The rusted hulks of their makeshift armored cars
still line the road as monuments. But the Jordanian King Abdullah's
Arab Legion, trained and led by British officers, held the heights
above Jerusalem, captured the Old City and incorporated it into
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   From 1948 to 1967, Jerusalem was a divided city _ half
Jordanian, half Israeli _ with limited passage allowed through the
Mandelbaum Gate, mostly for international officials and Christian
clergy. Most important for the future, the Old City was sealed off
to Jews and many of their religious sites were defiled. Then, in
the 1967 war, Israel took all of Jerusalem and the West Bank, its
triumphant army chaplain, Shlomo Goren (later to become a chief
rabbi of Israel) blowing his ram's horn at the Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 30 years, Israelis created their own facts on the
ground, building settlements in the West Bank, expanding Jewish
neighborhoods into East Jerusalem and neglecting services to the
Arab areas. Even since the Oslo accords, Israelis have continued to
build Jewish housing in Arab neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has made decisions on how to treat Jerusalem in a
peace settlement extraordinarily difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Khalil Shikaki, a Palestinian academic who has advised the
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, said last week that ``the
Palestinian public will not tolerate less than full sovereignty
over all of East Jerusalem, including the Haram al-Sharif.
Palestinians will not tolerate Israeli border police or Israeli
checkpoints. That is not sovereignty, that is not control.
Palestinians no longer want to ask Israelis for permission to build
their homes, to educate their children, to live their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But, at the same time, he said that if they were persuaded that
the Israeli approach was genuine, ``the Palestinian street would
certainly be flexible.''

 &UR; JERUSALEM: be flexible.'' &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Moshe Amirav knows this city well. As a young paratrooper who
had already been wounded in the 1967 war, he climbed out of a
hospital window to rejoin his unit when he heard it was trying to
retake the Old City. He entered politics with the hard-right Likud
youth movement, served on the City Council and worked under the
famous Mayor Teddy Kollek on roads, planning and other municipal
matters. His political views moved toward the left years ago, and
he is now one of a handful of Israelis who have been trying to find
solutions for Jerusalem, meeting frequently with the local
Palestinian leader Faisal Husseini, whose forebear died commanding
the Arab force trying to block the road to Jerusalem in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem is a two-fold problem,'' Amirav said. ``The
emotional and psychological problem and the very practical
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Old City, he noted, is a mere one square kilometer in a city
that now measures 120 square kilometers. (In 1967, West Jerusalem,
the modern Jewish part of the city, was 37 square kilometers, and
Jordanian East Jerusalem was 7.) And, he said: ``Jerusalem is not a
united city. It is a divided city, one of the most divided in the
world. More divided than Belfast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the euphoria of 1967, we annexed 28 Arab villages that
later on became Arab neighborhoods,'' he said. ``Our aim was to
enlarge the Jewish population, but we did all the most stupid
possible things.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible solution, said Dr. Amirav, who teaches conflict
resolution at Hebrew University, is redrawing the boundaries of the
city to ``enlarge the pie'' and devising ways to share power. As
for the sensitive religious sites, he says Israelis need to be
reminded that since 1967 the Temple Mount has been under the
control of the Waqf, the Islamic charity directed by the mufti of
Jerusalem, a decision made by the Israeli military hero and former
defense minister, Moshe Dayan.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel may well be thinking along
similar lines. Last week, he called Reuvan Merhav, a former Foreign
Ministry official and member of the Jerusalem Institute for Israel
Studies, to join him at Camp David. The research institute had
prepared a report, bristling with complicated maps, showing various
options for enlarging Jerusalem by adding several large Jewish
settlements, including Ma'aleh Adumin in the West Bank, to the
municipality while at the same time giving a kind of ``functional
sovereignty'' to Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal on the table is literally building a bridge between
the village of Abu Dis, where there is already an imposing new
building believed destined to be the Palestinian Parliament, and
the Haram al-Sharif. Thus, Muslims, including Arafat, would be able
to go directly to their holy sites without having to pass through
Israeli territory or encounter Israeli police.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Dis, still a dusty little place, already partly inside
municipal borders, is on the Mount of Olives, directly overlooking
the Dome of the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as the leaders met at Camp David, Israelis clogged
the phone lines to call-in shows with their own suggestions for how
to resolve Jerusalem's status. Much of the talk was pragmatic. And
yet, the fact of deep distrust and political resistance remains.
Arafat has declared that ``the Arab leader has not been born who is
willing to forfeit the rights of Muslims in Jerusalem,'' and has
reportedly told President Clinton he fears assassination if he is
seen giving up the goal of Jerusalem as a Palestinian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, whose own mentor, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, was
gunned down for his peace efforts by an ultra religious Israeli,
saw his uneasy coalition government implode even as he departed for
Camp David. He was told last week of a newspaper poll back home
that reported that 70 percent of all Israelis believe that Israel
must not concede any part of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians in
any peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Natan Sharansky, who took his Russian immigrant party out of
Barak's coalition, has declared that ``Jerusalem is the very soul
which unites and fortifies the nation in its entirety.'' And two
former chief rabbis took out a newspaper ad to proclaim, ``Whoever,
God forbid, will lift his hand against the land of Israel and
Jerusalem and the Temple Mount will be written in shame and
disgrace for all generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The way to solve the problem, suggested Professor Rami Friedman,
the director of the Jerusalem Institute, who worked on the options
study, is perhaps not to solve it; that is, not to be too specific,
for each side has too much to lose. For the holy sites, he
suggested, perhaps it is best to muddle along. ``It sounds crazy
conceptually,'' he added, ``but it's very practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much history, so much religion, so much
nationalism embedded in that one square kilometer,'' he said,
``that any solution will create more conflict than you had
already.''

   Making Margin Calls in a Tightening Race
</P>
<P>
   In the album of Campaign 2000 cliches, get ready to paste in
``Too close to call.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a term that Americans are likely to hear frequently this
year, as strategists and journalists weigh in with state-by-state
analyses of the treacherous electoral map that confronts Gov.
George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The early conventional wisdom? It's too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Swing states in the presidential race like New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri and Washington are
all rated as tossups or moving only marginally toward Bush, who is
strongest in the South and Rocky Mountain states, or toward Gore,
whose support is heaviest on the East and West Coasts. Factor in
the participation of third-party contenders like Pat Buchanan and
Ralph Nader, and it's hard to conclude anything except: It's too
close to call.
</P>
<P>
   The tightness of the race has, if anything, intensified the
guessing game of who the candidates will choose as their running
mates. With the Republican convention set to begin in Philadelphia
in eight days, most of the attention is on Bush's choice, which the
governor said he will make imminently.
</P>
<P>
   A leading contender is Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary
in the Bush administration. Other names mentioned frequently
include the Republican governors of two big industrial states, Tom
Ridge of Pennsylvania and George Pataki of New York, as well as
Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma and
former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there is the name with star power, Sen.
John McCain of Arizona, who was reported to be softening in his
opposition to accepting the vice presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Gore was making his case for the presidency in
Bush's own back yard, traveling to Texas to criticize his rival's
reign as governor, which got some Texans' dander up. ``Texas isn't
nearly as backward and third world as the Gore campaign would make
us out,'' said Michael Levy, the publisher of Texas Monthly
magazine. Proud of its homegrown candidate, Texas is probably not
too close to call.

   The Elian of the Animal Kingdom
</P>
<P>
   On one side stands a teary-eyed Russian couple whose Brooklyn
community has vowed to go to any length to help them keep their
adopted pet monkey. On the other side is an adamant state
government backed by a host of monkey experts and the power of the
endangered-species law.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle, oblivious to all the fuss, stands Cookie
Flikshtein, a rare diana monkey who is living the good life, eating
Rocky Road ice cream and wearing frilly red miniskirts, while her
fate is being decided.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks after the conclusion of the Elian Gonzalez custody
battle comes an even stranger scuffle over little Cookie, age 6.
Her adoptive parents, Roman and Inna Flikshtein, have argued
unsuccessfully in court that there is no better place for Cookie
than their monkey-friendly home. The state attorney general's
office, meanwhile, maintains that Cookie is a member of an
endangered species and belongs in a special animal rescue program
at the Detroit Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   There are no immediate plans to wrest Cookie from the Flikshtein
home, where she has lived for five years in such familial bliss
that 13-year-old Michelle Flikshtein refers to the monkey as her
sister. But the Flikshtein's neighbors, many of whom are recent
immigrants from Russia, have closed ranks, promising to protect
young Cookie until the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to sit here and not let people come near,'' said
Lubov Gruber, who lives down the block. ``We will protest this for
as long as it takes.''

   Congress Approves Tax Cut to Help Married Couples
</P>
<P>
   Congress finished work on a Republican bill to give an
election-year tax break to married couples. But President Clinton,
saying the measure was too costly, promised to veto it. The bill
would provide $292 billion in tax cuts over the next decade, and
was intended in part to address the marriage penalty, the quirk in
the tax code that forces many two-income couples to pay a higher
tax bill than they would if they had remained single. Democrats
said they also want to address the penalty, but do it in a less
expensive way that directs more benefits to low- and middle-income
people.

   Better Colon Cancer Test Urged
</P>
<P>
   The test used to screen healthy adults for colon cancer should
be changed, researchers say: Instead of the currently recommended
sigmoidoscopy, which examines the lower two feet of the colon,
patients should undergo colonoscopy, which probes its entire 4- to
5-foot length.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter test fails to detect abnormal growths high in the
colon, scientists warned in the New England Journal of Medicine.
But colonoscopy costs $1,500, and most insurers will not cover it
as a screening test.
</P>
<P>
   And the public has shown little enthusiasm for either test,
which require the insertion of long tubes equipped with cameras
into the rectum.

   Internet Gambling Bill Fails
</P>
<P>
   In a blow to casino owners, the House failed to approve a bill
to curb the exploding $1.2 billion industry of Internet gambling.
Most lawmakers favored banning online casino-style games, sports
wagers and lottery sales. But despite wide backing _ from Christian
evangelists to liquor store owners _ they fell short of the votes
needed to limit debate.
</P>
<P>
   Cybergamblers, meanwhile, relied on an equally odd mix of
Republican governors, online casino operators and administration
officials to keep the largely unregulated industry on a roll.

   Loan to Fight African AIDS
</P>
<P>
   The United States plans to lend up to $1 billion annually to
sub-Saharan African nations where AIDS and HIV afflict 25 million
people. The American loans, which will carry commercial interest
rates, can be used only to buy American-produced drugs, equipment
or medical services. Officials expect Japan and Europe to make
similar amounts available to support their medical exports.
</P>
<P>
   James A. Harmon, the Export-Import Bank president, said the bank
intends to do well for America by doing good for Africa. The effort
was generally praised by charity groups and African nations, but
some Clinton administration officials worried that the loans
undermined efforts to arrange debt relief for the same countries.

   Missile Offer by North Korea
</P>
<P>
   America needs a missile defense, some say, because of countries
like North Korea. One solution, according to Russian President
Vladimir Putin, who is rallying opposition to the missile plan, is
to remove North Korea from the equation. So he traveled to
Pyongyang, coming away with a North Korean offer to drop its
missile program _ if other nations provide it with rockets to
launch satellites. But that's a big if. As a former Pentagon
official put it, it's still unclear just ``what is going on in
North Korea.''

   Plan to Breach Dams Delayed
</P>
<P>
   A plan that could have led to the breaching of four dams on the
Snake River in the Pacific Northwest has been postponed. The plan
was aimed at easing the way for endangered species of salmon to
return to spawning grounds. But the White House chose instead to
embrace an alternative course. Trying to balance voters' support
for the salmon with regional officials' opposition to any breach,
it will propose smaller steps to help the species while deferring
until at least 2005 any razing of the dams.

   2 Charged in Olympic Scandal

   Two chief organizers of Salt Lake City's bid to win the 2002
Winter Olympics, Thomas K. Welch and David Johnson, were indicted
on 15 counts of conspiracy to commit bribery, fraud and
racketeering relating to the vote-buying scandal that erupted in
1998. The indictment alleged that the men spent more than $1
million to bribe delegates of the International Olympic Committee.
The men denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Dr. Wade Exum, the former chief of drug
testing for the U.S. Olympic Committee, sued the committee,
claiming that 50 percent of American athletes who tested positive
for performance-enhancing drugs in recent years were not punished.

the power he has wielded since the death in June of his father,
former President Hafez Assad. Assad, a 34-year-old eye doctor,
quickly tamped down hopes for dramatic change. He said he had no
``magic wand'' to reform the ailing state-run economy, would not
budge from his father's rejection of any compromise with Israel and
invited Syrians to express themselves _ but only with ``positive
criticism.''

   Report on Murder of Gay GI
</P>
<P>
   After a 21-year-old gay Army private was bludgeoned to death
with a baseball bat by a fellow soldier as he slept in his barracks
last July, the Army opened an investigation into the atmosphere at
Fort Campbell, the Kentucky base where the murder occurred. A new
report has exonerated all officers of blame in the murder of Pfc.
Barry Winchell and has concluded that no climate of homophobia
exists at the base.
</P>
<P>
   Winchell's mother, who has sued the Army for the wrongful death
of her son, called the report a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who is gay, said the report is one
more step in a virtually unbroken pattern of Pentagon contempt for
the rights of gay and lesbian service people.

   A Slippery Particle Is Found
</P>
<P>
   An elusive particle that had been on physicists' Most Wanted
list for 25 years has finally been detected, scientists announced
at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. Called the tau
neutrino, it is the last of a notoriously slippery family of
particles to be seen. Those particles, all neutrinos of various
kinds, pass through other matter almost without a trace. But they
are crucial elements of the theory that particle physicists believe
explains the structure of all matter.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is just one more particle predicted by the theory that
has not been seen. Physicists plan to begin chasing that particle,
the Higgs boson, next spring.

   THE BIG DECISIONS? THEY'RE OFTEN FALLING TO WOMEN

   MEDICAL-DECISIONS-LIFEBEAT _ Women today are increasingly
familiar with the challenge, and the agony, of medical
decision-making. Over the past two decades, a revolution in
patients' rights and an explosion of information have enabled
women, and men, to educate themselves as never before. That is both
a blessing and a burden for women, who make choices not only for
themselves, studies show, but also for their husbands, children and
parents. Often, it's an overwhelming task. Some doctors have become
so enamored of a patient's right to choose that they are abdicating
their responsibilities as healers. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.

where the risk is 2.2 times greater in those with the highest

<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year, our neighborhood puts on a yard sale. All the
families share the cost of advertising, so there's not much to
lose. My husband, Don, and I decided to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a lot of work!'' Don cautioned. It turned out he
was right since he had the chore of hauling stuff up from our
basement. Yet, he couldn't have predicted the agony we'd suffer
sorting through it all. We divided the task of opening those boxes
and bins, but we didn't share the ordeal of determining what should
be sold. Don thought that ``trash and treasures'' referred to my
possessions and his, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's that bowl from Mildred.'' I frowned as I looked at this
gift from a deceased friend. How could I place a value on it?
</P>
<P>
   It was our first sale. It went for 50 cents, minus any sentiment
about our friend. We couldn't put a price on those memories.
</P>
<P>
   I had two favorite items and said, ``They'll fly out of here.''
Both were bought from expensive gift shops. My handmade doll and
the ornate Christmas ornament did not sell. How could 200 people
look at this stuff and not recognize my exquisite taste?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like they hate your hair,'' Don said. ``Don't take it
personally.'' He was right, but I wondered how he felt when his
valued self-help book, ``Miss Piggy's Guide to Life,'' didn't sell.
</P>
<P>
   The parade of shoppers lasted for two days. We took most offers,
especially those from children. An enterprising copper-haired
cherub made a bee-line for a 25 cent stuffed pig with shamrocks on
it. The novice shopper huddled with her parents and then walked
toward us with an offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you take a nickel?'' I bit my lip and didn't say, ``Oh
honey, you can just take that toy.'' Maybe those high-finance
negotiations are one of life's lessons because she handed me the
nickel and proudly skipped down our driveway.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the only incident which amused me. Watching someone
guess the function of a gadget or trinket made game-show questions
seem simple. Picking up napkin-ring holders, a customer said, '' I
can use these as earrings for my kid's Halloween costume.'' (I
guess napkin rings aren't as common as they used to be.)
</P>
<P>
   Don had a good marketing technique. He put a table of 25 cent
items strategically at the farthest corner of our driveway. He
borrowed the idea from those remote milk-and-bread displays in
grocery stores. People had to walk past all the other treasures to
find the bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Our biggest sale came from a feisty lady who griped that she had
just fought with her husband. To escape, she went for a drive and
saw the sign at the corner of our street advertising the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take this, and I'll take that!'' She'd point and grin. I
wondered if her husband was as pleased when he unloaded her trunk.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I noticed is that bargain hunters are polite. ``Thank
you'' and ``I love this,'' gave the hope of renewed life to my
gently used stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a bag'' or ``I can give you the instruction booklet for
that,'' always brought a smile. However, there was one thing we
overlooked. Providing refreshments would have been a most
appreciated touch.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing we had missed lunch, I brought out sandwiches for Don
and me. It was bad timing, though. A customer who had decided on an
item dug in her purse for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for the lamp'' she said, looking at our food ``and how
much for your lunch?''
</P>

   Susan Horowitz faced the classic patient's dilemma. Three
different doctors had given her three different recommendations
about whether to undergo chemotherapy for her breast cancer. ``I
found the idea of chemo really frightening,'' she recalled.
Chemotherapy, she knew, would throw her into menopause _ and she
was only 45 years old.
</P>
<P>
   It took six weeks for her to decide to do it. ``It was
agonizing,'' Horowitz, now 49 and living in Los Angeles, said,
referring to the decision. But she was determined not to turn it
over to a doctor. ``It was a huge challenge, an intellectual
challenge, to get all the information and to do the research,'' she
said. ``And I actually took up that challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Women today are increasingly familiar with the challenge, and
the agony, of medical decision-making. Over the past two decades, a
revolution in patients' rights and an explosion of information in
books, newspapers, magazines and cyberspace have enabled women, and
men, to educate themselves as never before. Doctors' attitudes have
changed, too; once derided for their paternalism, many now expect
patients to research their own diseases and make decisions on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   That is both a blessing and a burden for women, who have
traditionally been the gatekeepers of family health. Women make
choices not only for themselves, studies show, but also for their
husbands, children and parents.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Society for Women's Health Research, a
nonprofit group in Washington, women, who account for 52 percent of
the population, make three-quarters of the health-care decisions in
the United States and spend nearly two out of three health-care
dollars. About 59 percent of doctors' visits are made by women, the
Society says, and 59 percent of prescription drugs are purchased by
women.
</P>
<P>
   Women also face some of medicine's thorniest questions. The
plethora of alternative therapies is complicating the medical
landscape for women as well as men. And these changes are occurring
within the framework of reduced reimbursements for doctors under
managed care, which means that medical professionals are busier
than ever, and have less time to talk through complex problems with
their patients. The result, experts say, is a case of information
overload among patients, particularly women, in the information
age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an overwhelming task for women, and consumers in
general, to be able to sort through the information they find and
make decisions,'' said Amy Alliana, the program director of the
National Women's Health Network. ``Patients are in the position of
having to do a lot of work on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every patient is as eager as Horowitz to be fully in charge.
Katherine Russell Rich, whose book, ``The Red Devil: To Hell with
Cancer and Back,'' recounts her experience with breast cancer,
remembers the terror she felt when her oncologist explained the
treatment options: ``He was trying to draw pictures of the breast.
All I remember is it looked like he was drawing targets. Finally, I
said, `But what should I do?''' And I remember this horrifying
moment when he said, `I can't tell you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Until fairly recently, those words _ ``I can't tell you'' _
rarely crossed a doctor's lips. ``Patients always used to say,
`Well, what would you do if it were your brother, or what would you
do if it were you?''' said George J. Annas, the chairman of the
health law department at the Boston University School of Public
Health. ``Many doctors are comfortable now saying, `It's not me,
it's you, and you're the one who has to decide.'''
</P>
<P>
   To Annas, that is a welcome change. ``I think people have some
responsibility for their own decisions,'' he said. ``Patients
should accept this as part of the price of the wonders of modern
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see patient autonomy running amok. Carl F. Schneider, a
professor of law and internal medicine at the University of
Michigan who has recently written a book on medical
decision-making, said that doctors have become so enamored of a
patient's right to choose that they are abdicating their
responsibilities as healers. He has a term for what happened to
Rich _ ``mandatory autonomy,'' a practice that he said stems in
part from fear of lawsuits. Doctors, after all, can be sued over
whatever decision they make. But if the patient makes the decision,
who is to blame?
</P>
<P>
   Yet Schneider says that as patients get older, and sicker, they
are less likely to want to make their own medical decisions. The
same patient may want more, or less, autonomy at any given time.
And he turned up this surprising tidbit: Sometimes the
best-educated patients are the least likely to want to make their
own medical decisions. These patients, he said, often tell him:
``Look, I'm an expert in my field; I know how difficult it is to
talk about technical problems to laypeople, and how much expert
thinking is passive thinking, not fully articulated. So what I try
to do is pick the very best doctor I can, and then do what he or
she says.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The current era of patient empowerment has its roots in the
debate over whether dying people had the right to refuse
life-prolonging therapies. The 1976 court case of Karen Quinlan,
the New Jersey woman whose parents fought to withdraw her life
support, established broad public support for this right, and with
it the notion that sick people, not doctors, should be in charge of
their medical decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until the '80s, said Dr. Albert Mulley, chief of
general medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, that doctors
signed on to the idea. The turning point, Mulley thinks, was a
series of studies that he and Dr. Jack Wennberg of Dartmouth
College, conducted on ``practice variations.'' The pair
demonstrated vast differences in medical practice based on where a
patient lived. Men in Washington state, for instance, were five to
six times as likely to undergo surgery for prostate cancer as men
in Connecticut. Two percent of breast cancer patients in Ogden,
Utah, got breast-conserving surgery, compared with 35 percent in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that geography dictated treatment ``shook the
foundational belief that medicine was determined by good science,''
Mulley said. The medical establishment responded by pushing for
treatment guidelines. But guidelines are based on statistics and
probabilities, and experts now know that a patient's own values are
as important as the numbers, if not more so.
</P>
<P>
   Mulley uses the example of prostate cancer: is a man with the
disease willing to undergo surgery at the risk that it will cause
sexual dysfunction and incontinence? Anyone who thinks the choice
is an easy one need only study New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
televised news conference announcing that he was no longer a
candidate for the Senate. Here was a man who had made decisions all
his life declaring that after weeks of studying his treatment
options, he was still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Today the ideal is ``shared decision making,'' a concept
promoted by a nonprofit organization, the Foundation for Informed
Medical Decision Making, which Mulley and Wennberg founded in 1989.
The idea is that doctors and patients can hash out their options
together. But that takes time, and as anyone who has ever been in a
doctor's office knows, time is typically in very short supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they give me short shrift and don't answer my questions,
then I leave the doctor,'' said Nena O'Neill, a New York City
writer who was successfully treated 11 years ago for a rare cancer
of the nose. This was in the days before the Internet; O'Neill said
she flew to four different hospitals and hired a medical researcher
to study her treatment choices.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has that opportunity, of course; 44.3 million
Americans lack health insurance, and for them, questions about
medical decision-making and patient autonomy are academic. But
O'Neill, who is 76 and still seeing doctors for painful
after-effects from her cancer treatment, has sage advice for
patients of all stripes: bring a short list of written questions to
the doctor and be persistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to say, `Look, I have a few questions,''' she
said. '' `I'm not going to take a half an hour. I'm only going to
take five minutes. But it's important that you listen to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the most sensitive doctor, and the one with all the
time in the world to listen, may not have all the answers. The
biomedical revolution of the past two decades has yielded a flood
of life-prolonging treatments, but the boom in medical research has
also created confusion within the profession. The more scientists
learn about a disease, it seems, the less certain they are about
the right treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad fact of life is that as you get down into the
nitty-gritty, we simply don't know enough,'' said Dr. David J.
Rothman, the director of the Center for the Study of Society and
Medicine at Columbia University. ``In a world where medical
technology is getting all the more powered and often accompanied by
risks, nobody can decide for you.''
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, was the calculation that Susan Horowitz made
when she received her breast cancer diagnosis. ``My first thought
when I found out I had breast cancer was, `This is something I
can't run away from; I have to deal with it,''' she said. ``And I
did. I really felt like I was in charge.''

 By JEANNE WOLF 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the terrifying new thriller ``What Lies Beneath,'' Michelle
Pfeiffer plays a woman who discovers that her marriage to Harrison
Ford isn't as perfect as it seems. As for her own marriage to TV
producer David E. Kelley (``Ally McBeal,'' ``The Practice''),
Pfeiffer, 42, uses the word ``lucky'' to describe their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The couple met just after she had decided to adopt a daughter,
Claudia Rose, on her own. They got married the day Claudia was
christened; less than a year later, their son, John, was born.
</P>
<P>
   A former Orange County, Calif., beauty queen, Pfeiffer proved
that she had the talent to match her great looks when she starred
opposite Al Pacino in ``Scarface.'' She earned her first Oscar nod
for a tour de force performance in the period costume drama
``Dangerous Liaisons,'' then stole the hearts of millions of males
as the sultry torch singer in ``The Fabulous Baker Boys,'' which
won her a second Academy Award nomination. ``Love Field,'' a
haunting interracial love story, which was the first film from her
own production company, brought her a third nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Like all women trying to balance the demands of motherhood and
career, Pfeiffer swears she's always out of time and out of breath
but all the sacrifices are worth it to have the family she's always
dreamed of. Despite her reported price tag of $10 million to 15
million per movie, she is much more preoccupied with her family
than with her celebrity. In fact, she apologetically but abruptly
ends our lunch at a popular seaside cafe near Los Angeles when she
realizes it's time to pick up her two children from school.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: You've been married for seven years _ a near record in
Hollywood. How do you manage to keep your marriage successful?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE PFEIFFER: I don't like the expression ``work at it,''
but we do tend our marriage. I think you have to spend time away
from the kids and stay up late and talk or go to the movies or do
the crossword puzzle together. We still have date nights, and I
look forward to them all week.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: Isn't it hard, though, to even remember to put aside
that time, especially when you have two young kids?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: I've seen couples who don't have things like a date
night and they start using their kids to avoid each other. It is
hard to slow down and find time for each other, but you need to.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: You were married once before, to ``Thirtysomething''
actor Peter Horton. You had to learn from that experience.
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: I do think that the first thing that makes a marriage
successful is choosing the right somebody. If you're not a good
match, you can fake it for a while, but then it slowly falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: Did you fear choosing the wrong person, especially
since you'd been burned a couple of times?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: I got lucky. I think that in relationships, when you
say ``Oh, I never saw it coming,'' the truth is there are red flags
all along the way. We just choose to ignore them. The power of
denial may be the strongest thing next to the power of love.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: You were even willing to start a family by yourself, by
adopting a child while you were still single. Was that a turning
point for you?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: Well, it was brewing for a long time _ things don't
just happen overnight. I can see how I was leading up to it over
the years. At a certain point, I knew I needed to have a family and
I'd always wanted to adopt. But I had been waiting to get married
to do the whole family thing. Then, suddenly, it was just like a
lightbulb going off: ``I don't have to wait for that.'' I wasn't
going to marry the wrong person just to be married and have a
family.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: You were in the process of adopting Claudia when you
met David. How did that affect your relationship with him?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: I think that her presence is actually one of the
things that bonded David and me. You get to an age where you have
personal baggage that can get in the way and mess things up in a
relationship. I think that Claudia gave us this other focus because
she came into our lives during our relationship. It took the
intensity off the two of us. If Claudia hadn't been around, I might
have messed up my relationship with David, which, of course,
thankfully also brought me my son.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: So loving her together let you open yourself to loving
him.
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: I think that when you have your first child, you
become so vulnerable in a way that you never were before that you
let many of your guards drop. Having my daughter really changed my
life, just completely, forever.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: And you got to test your man as Daddy material before
you were married.
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: And David got to test me out as Mommy material.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: You have joked about being the ``designated driver'' in
your marriage. Does that mean you're the one in charge?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: No, David is equally in charge. I'm the designated
driver in the sort of day-to-day drudgery kind of things _ the
doctors the kids go to, taking care of the house, that kind of
thing. But in terms of shaping our relationship, David is equally
involved in that. In fact, he is definitely the more romantic of
the two of us.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: So what romantic things does he do?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: I don't think he would want me to share them with you.
I might get in trouble. I will say that we spoil each other. I
can't even believe we've been married for so long because I still
feel like a newlywed. We spend a lot of time together as a family.
We don't have huge social lives and we live pretty simply. We took
the kids to the zoo over the weekend _ we do normal things like
that.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: What has surprised you about motherhood?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: I think there's kind of a universal fear among women
about your first child_ you begin to panic about being a good
mother because you feel like you don't know anything. I was
pleasantly surprised that it came very naturally to me. I'm used to
having really high expectations and then things falling short of
those expectations. So I was surprised that being a mother exceeded
my expectations.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: Of course there's the bliss of being a mother, but what
are the stresses that go along with it?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: I think the worst thing is the sleep deprivation. It's
just awful. And when I think about having another child, that's the
one thing I worry about. I remember being so tired, especially with
my son because he was not a good sleeper. I'm just now getting
caught up on my sleep.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: What about juggling your career with the demands of
being a mother?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: The truth of the matter is that my kids would want me
home all the time. On the other hand, I think I'm a better parent
because I do what I love to do.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: Have you always known that you had a gift as an
actress?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: I don't really feel that gifted. I've always been a
hard worker and I have a lot of energy and I like to be prepared.
I've never been the type of person who just shows up and fumbles
through my lines. I love immersing myself in details about who the
character is. I feel like that's not necessarily a gift _ that's
diligence.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: What was driving you at the beginning of your career,
when you were just one more actress in Hollywood trying to land a
part?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: I'd say I was naive. I think my naivete might have
appeared to be bravery, but in truth, I didn't know what I was
getting into. I would just dive in feet first and basically sink or
swim. The thing that I've always been good at in different stages
of my life is being able to recognize where the opportunity was and
move forward incrementally. Ultimately, my goal was to have control
over my life and have freedom of choice.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: Do you know where that determination in you comes from?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: My father and his mother. My grandmother raised five
children during the Depression by herself. When she was 50, she
threw her sewing machine in the back of a pickup truck and drove
from North Dakota to California. She was a real survivor and that's
my stock. I come from that.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: How do you feel about watching your own performances
onscreen?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: I'm my own worst critic, and I'm beyond pleasing. It's
hard for me to see my work, ever. Once a movie is completely
finished, I never see it again. Why punish myself?
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: You've done love scenes with just about every major
male star _ Mel Gibson, Bruce Willis, Robert Redford, Al Pacino,
George Clooney. Is it hard to ignite that feeling on the screen?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: The more you are genuinely fond of each other, the
easier it is. Fortunately I've worked with very few people whom I
haven't cared for. Still, it is actually a little embarrassing to
do those scenes. Probably out of nerves, I tend to giggle.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: What surprised you about working with Harrison Ford?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: He's very committed to his work and full of ideas and
very funny. I didn't know that about him. I didn't know he would
make me laugh so much.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: Robert Zemeckis, the director of ``What Lies Beneath,''
told me that you can be funny, too, but that you weren't laughing
before the scenes you had to do underwater.
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: I've never been a water lover. I've always been a bit
claustrophobic and afraid of things being over my head and I've
never been able to hold my breath for long periods of time. I kept
saying to Bob in rehearsal, ``I panic in water.'' And he would say,
``We'll take care of that. Don't worry, it will be safe.'' But
after I mentioned it a few times, he finally said, ``Now I'm
getting afraid that you're going to panic and we're not going to be
able to shoot the scenes. How about we give you scuba diving
lessons?''
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK. Did that terrify you?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: At first it did. I had to practice going underwater,
and I would panic. Finally I got to the point where I was okay
breathing in a mask _ I actually began to enjoy that. Then they
would say ``Action!'' and take my mask and breathing tube away. You
open your eyes and you can't really see, so that's a whole other
panic. But we did it and they didn't make me feel like a complete
jackass just because I was afraid of the water.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: Are your kids afraid of it, too?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: John doesn't love the water that much but my daughter
is a fish. She is really the swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: Do you see big differences in the way each of them is
developing?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: Yes. My son and daughter were different from the
beginning. He likes trucks and she likes kitty cats, and he was
eating bugs and she wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   REDBOOK: Have you told Claudia that she's adopted?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE: We don't keep any secrets from her. We always talk
about it openly so that the word ``adoption'' is not taboo. She
also has a lot of friends who are adopted, and she goes to a very
diverse school. She realizes that families are made up in different
kinds of ways and started in different kinds of ways. I think she
represents what's good in the world and what's hopeful about the
world.

 GRUDGES ARE BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH

<TEXT>
<P>
   As I listened to my friend ``Sylvia'' rage furiously at me over
the telephone, I felt a mix of anger, hurt and, above all,
bewilderment: why on earth had she waited three months before
letting me know that she'd been upset by something I'd said?
Unfortunately, no answer emerged over the following weeks. No
matter how we approached the issue, we couldn't seem to agree on
just what had taken place _ or what was meant by it.
</P>
<P>
   As our relationship sputtered along, the only certainty was that
I had joined Sylvia (at least temporarily) in a grudge-fest.
Ultimately we rebuilt our friendship, but I felt shaken enough to
want to take a look at grudges _ their ins and outs, causes and
cures. My delvings were eye-opening: I feel sure that Sylvia and I
would have tried harder to settle our differences had we known how
they were threatening our health.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does carrying around unresolved anger sap your spirits;
it also undermines your physical well-being. ``The effect of
internalizing anger is massive. It impacts your whole immune
system,'' says marriage and family therapist Dr. Jane Greer, author
of ``Gridlock: Finding the Courage to Move on in Love, Work and
Life.'' (Doubleday; $23.95; to order, call Books Now at
800-962-6651). ``It makes you much more susceptible to any
stress-induced condition.''
</P>
<P>
   These ailments include migraines, backache, arthritis and
irritable bowel syndrome _ but the worst threat, by far, is heart
disease. ``Physiologically, a chronically angry state can lead to
increased risk of heart attack,'' says Dr. Barton Sparagon, medical
director of the San Fran- cisco-based Meyer Friedman Institute,
whose groundbreaking research first identified the irritable,
aggressive Type A personality and the unhappy effects of type A
behavior on cardiac health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irritation causes the body to secrete stress hormones,
especially cortisol and norepinephrine, in excess.'' If these hover
at chronically high levels, they greatly increase your risk of
atherosclerosis _ the biggest cause of coronary artery disease.
They also spur the body's fight-or-flight response, says Sparagon.
``The heart rate and blood pressure go up, the blood gets thicker,
and its clotting time gets faster. All of this contributes to the
risk of heart attack or stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter whether you're young or old, male or female. A
large trial published in the ``Journal of the American Medical
Association'' found that among men and women under 60, the risk of
vascular disease was 2.2 times greater in those with the highest
levels of the stress chemical homocysteine; the risk was also
``notably higher'' in people with high blood pressure. As if this
weren't enough, excess cortisol in the blood also depresses the
immune system, making the person who packs a grudge ripe game for
any passing cold or flu bug.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the emotional fallout. ``You feel a sense of
emptiness when a relationship is severed without any resolution,''
Jane Greer points out.
</P>
<P>
   She recommends taking steps to break the impasse, even it's the
other person who's feeling offended. ``If a friend or colleague
suddenly is not returning your calls or talking to you, confront it
directly by making a phone call and saying,'I get the impression
you're upset with me, and I'm really interested in hearing what
you're feeling.' That can make a huge difference in whether people
get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if, as with Sylvia and me, the tried-and-true approach
_ talking things over, airing your grievances in a nonaccusatory
way, hearing out your friend, offering or accepting an apology _
doesn't work? You may need to consider the possibility of
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone who's tried it knows, forgiveness is no quick-and-easy
procedure. Dr. Robert Enright, a professor of educational
psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and president of
the International Forgiveness Institute
(www.forgivenessinstitute.org), divides the process into four
phases: uncovering (during which you become aware of how the
original injury and your reaction to it have affected your
psychological health); decision (you realize your old strategies
are ineffective and make a commitment to work at forgiveness); work
(reframing, through empathy and compassion, your view of the
offending person); and outcome/deepening (finding a new sense of
meaning through your suffering and forgiveness).
</P>
<P>
   These phases often overlap, says Enright, and the process is
exquisitely individual; but with time and dedication, forgiveness
can be achieved. Enright's upcoming book, ``Forgiveness Is a
Choice'' (APA Books), due out this November, ``details how to
forgive, with lots of practical exercises. We've used this model
with considerable success, even with people with deep trauma, like
incest survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frederic Luskin, director of the Stanford Forgiveness
Project (www.learningtoforgive.com) at Stanford University,
approaches forgiveness somewhat differently. He first got
interested in the subject 10 years ago as a student at Stanford.
``A friend of mine abandoned me and I didn't have a clue what to do
about it. I decided to do my Ph.D. thesis on forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   In crafting the approach he now teaches, Luskin drew both on
time-tested psychotherapeutic techniques and on the Buddhist ideal
of ``loving kindness.'' He says, ``I wanted to cast that concept in
psychological terms so that people could see the value of
open-heartedness as a strategy in life.''
</P>
<P>
   If you do decide to forgive someone, the evidence is very clear
that you'll be doing your health a favor too, says Enright. ``In
one recent study, we took college students and their middle-aged
parents _ all of whom had suffered a deep family hurt _ and
measured their health via two physical-health indexes: one lists
self-reported ailments; the other, physician-diagnosed illnesses.
We also measured their hostility levels, using a standard hostility
index. Among both students and parents, the least forgiving
individuals had more physical problems across the board _ both
self-reported and physician-diagnosed. We then looked at which was
a better predictor of heart disease: lack of forgiveness or
hostility,'' he continues. ``Lack of forgiveness scored far
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   The emotional benefits extend far beyond a sense of relief, says
Frederic Luskin. ``It's not just a weeding out of negative
emotions; it facilitates positive emotion. In one study, we took
people who were normal, not excessively angry, and taught them the
forgiveness method; they got better than normal _ they felt more
spiritually open, more hopeful. That's what fascinates me about
forgiveness; it's so much more than just anger control.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of the blessings forgiveness brings, both Enright and
Luskin caution that it's important to be careful how you try to
forgive. ``For instance, take the abused wife who hears the word
'forgiveness' and thinks she must blindly reconcile with her
abusive spouse. But to forgive and to reconcile are two different
things,'' Enright says. ``Forgiveness comes from an inner decision
on your part; reconciliation involves two parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, people think,'If I forgive someone, I give up my right
to a fair solution, to justice.' That's untrue. You can forgive and
then go about seeking justice. Forgiveness comes from a position of
moral strength, not weakness. It's not excusing or condoning; it's
saying,'What the person did was wrong, but I will act out of a
sense of mercy and an inner wish to forgive.'''
</P>
<P>
   Having finally struggled back onto friendly ground with Sylvia,
I have no intention of re-entering the murky waters of
recrimination anytime soon; but if I ever do, I'll chart my way
back to shore more quickly this time, grateful of my newfound
ability to heal my grudges _ and my health.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   SEVEN STEPS TO FORGIVENESS
</P>
<P>
   _ Participants in the Stanford Forgiveness Project's workshops
are taught the following steps:
</P>
<P>
   _ Figure out how you felt during the traumatic moment. ``Think
carefully about it until you know exactly what happened that wasn't
OK for you,'' Frederic Luskin says. ``To clarify this for yourself,
you should discuss it with one or two people (though not
necessarily the person who's wounded you).''
</P>
<P>
   _ Acknowledge that forgiveness is for you. ``It's not to get
back with someone or at him. It doesn't mean you'll ever speak to
him again or guarantee you'll get justice. It's for your own
healing.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Begin the process today. ``If a person, thing or event has
hurt you, and you've let that override the other good things in
your life, you need to remind yourself of them. At the moment
you're feeling upset, practice deep breathing _ two or three deep
breaths, inhaling and exhaling slowly _ then let your mind stay on
something beautiful or lovely. If you do this, you can't stay
upset. And over time, it changes how you experience your life.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Change your expectations. ``It sounds a bit harsh, but really,
nobody owes you anything; the good things you get are a gift.
Instead of expecting things to go your way, be appreciative when
they do.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Find your positive intention. ``Learn what it was that you
wished for but didn't get from the person, whether it was love,
friendship, validation or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Find a new way to achieve your positive intention. ``Seek out
another arena in which your wish can be gratified.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Go back and tell your story again. ``Tell it in a way that
reflects your positive intention _ so that it becomes a story of
how you were disappointed or hurt but managed to move on.''
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: U.S. Star Wars plan is insane by any definition
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and
over and expecting different results.'' This wisdom _ variously
ascribed to Einstein, Unknown, Anonymous and other great thinkers
of our time _ would seem to fit the persistent Star Wars delusion.
</P>
<P>
   The scaled-down version that the Pentagon and a slew of
contractors and their political hangers-on are pushing recently
failed its third test, the one ballyhooed as the most telling.
That's three out of three, and for this one the Pentagon gave
itself months of careful run-up and even delayed the deal another
two hours at the last minute just to fiddle a little more, luxuries
unknown in combat.
</P>
<P>
   Any enemy lobbing nukes at us is unlikely to ready an attack,
then stand down until our Star Warriors signal they are ready to
intercept the incoming.
</P>
<P>
   Most flops this famous and costly are abandoned. Just try to buy
a Tucker automobile.
</P>
<P>
   This is a relatively modest technology compared to Prsident
Reagn's original all-encompassing fantasy. Its repeated failure
would hardly seem a firm basis for spending incalculable billions
more on a limited anti-missile shield of dubious efficacy even if
it more or less works, for abandoning nearly 30 years of successful
nuclear deterrent policy and for risking the creation of a renewed
nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   But wait!
</P>
<P>
   Military and industry experts are forming up to chant, get this,
that the tests don't matter after all. What did you expect of a
new, fussy system? Success? The fact that the technology hasn't
worked so far is no proof that it won't eventually work, they say.
</P>
<P>
   This is true, and the fact the Sharon Stone hasn't called me for
a date doesn't mean they she won't ever, but I'm not making
reservations on the Costa del Sol just in case.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is brooding his way toward a decision about
whether to build a famcy radar system in the Aleutians, essential
if some 100 interceptors are to be deployed by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   This would have two great defensive purposes. It would defend Al
Gore from GOP charges that he is part of an administration that is
soft on Star Wars and it just might defend the crucial 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty from the rash impulse of President
George W. Bush, should it come to that, to scrap it outright.
</P>
<P>
   But even Clinton's more restrained option would undermine the
ABM treaty, elbowing Russia, China and other potentially nuclear
nations that mean us no good toward revving up missile production,
multiple warheading, decoy development and other tricks for
flummoxing the new U.S. defense.
</P>
<P>
   We have a technology here that we haven't proved. The nation
most cited as justifying its deployment even so, North Korea, has
said it would give up its long-range missile program in exchange
for technology help from others' programs. And we have a president
tempted to press on mainly for domestic political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   What do you suppose Einstein, Unknown and Anonymous would call
that?

 UNDATED: depressed patients.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In reviving the issue, Glenmullen and Healy, like earlier
critics, focus on Lilly's role in lawsuits and research. They
reprise, for instance, accusations that the FDA's inquiry was
tainted by some scientists' drug company ties. And they criticize
the larger studies of Prozac and suicide, citing problems in
methodology, and pointing out that they were carried out by
scientists financed by Lilly or working for the company. They also
recycle excerpts from internal Lilly memos, retrieved by lawyers
for plaintiffs in earlier lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Healy recently published a study in which 20 normal volunteers,
who told researchers they had no history of depression or other
psychiatric problems, were alternately given Zoloft, an SSRI, and
reboxetene, another antidepressant that has not been approved for
use in the United States. Two of the volunteers, Healy reported,
became acutely suicidal while taking Zoloft.
</P>
<P>
   Healy said that compared with the normal suicide rate in Great
Britain, the healthy volunteers on Zoloft showed a 2,000-fold
increase in suicide risk. He believes the same is true for other
SSRI's. ``My estimates are that Prozac alone has led to 25,000
people committing suicide'' who would not have otherwise, Healy
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Zoloft study, published in a British journal, Primary
Care Psychiatry, is controversial. Critics said its methodology was
flawed _ for example, they said, the study included no placebo
control, the subjects were employees of the hospital where Healy
practiced, and no medical records or other independent sources were
evaluated to confirm the subjects' reports about their psychiatric
histories.
</P>
<P>
   To conclude that Zoloft made the subjects suicidal, said
Wirshing of UCLA, ``is ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Celeste Torello, a spokeswoman for Pfizer Inc., which
manufactures Zoloft, Prozac's closest competitor, said the drug's
``safety and efficacy has been proven time and again, in more than
180 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients
worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some researchers whose early reports on the suicide
issue were cited in ``Prozac Backlash'' said they did not agree
with the way the issue was characterized in the book.
</P>
<P>
   One is Dr. Anthony Rothschild, a professor of psychiatry at the
University of Massachusetts in Worcester and the author of a 1991
report of three patients who developed akathisia and became more
suicidal on Prozac. ``Akathisia can occur,'' Rothschild said, ``and
in some people, who have a previous propensity to feel suicidal and
are still suffering from depression, this can sometimes push them
over the edge. But is it common? No. Can it be easily recognized
and treated? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Teicher, author of the original suicide report, said he
viewed the risk for suicide as something ``that clinicians need to
be aware of but it's generally not a huge problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Teicher, who along with others holds the patent on R-fluoxetene,
a refined version of Prozac that Lilly has licensed and is testing
in clinical trials as a potential successor to the drug, speculated
that patients who became suicidal on Prozac and other drugs in the
early 1990's might have done so as a result of the higher doses
prescribed by physicians. Lilly's exclusive patent on Prozac
expires in December 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Glenmullen has written to the FDA requesting that stronger
warnings about akathisia and suicides be added to labels for
antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal agency, a spokesman said, is satisfied that
current warning labels, which mention both akathisia and suicidal
thoughts as having been reported since the drugs reached the
market, are sufficient. The agency said it had no plans to begin
another official investigation into the issue, although it would
review any new data that emerged, as it does routinely on topics of
public concern.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the message for anyone contemplating taking Prozac,
Zoloft, Paxil, Luvox or other antidepressants, scientists said, may
be simply that drugs have side effects, and the decision to take
medication always involves the weighing of benefit against risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should really be on any type of medication for long
periods of time unless they have to,'' said Azmitia, of NYU. ``But
some people really can't function unless they are on these drugs.''

<P>
   Colleges received more than $1 billion this year in
congressional earmarks for so-called pork-barrel projects, ranging
from studies of cranberries and forests to research on the best
ways to debone salmon, a survey has found.
</P>
<P>
   Such gifts to academe exceeded $1 billion for the first time,
according to the study, released this week by the Chronicle of
Higher Education, a weekly newspaper. The grants amounted to 31
percent more than last year.
</P>
<P>
   These funds are mostly research and construction grants that are
not reviewed by peers or awarded by competition, but rather
inserted into congressional budget bills at the urging of
politicians or college officials.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts institutions took in $49 million, up from $30
million last year. Among the earmarks were a $3 million Harvard
study of public housing and $3.4 million to Tufts University and
other campuses for shrimp research.
</P>
<P>
   Federal spending observers said the continued earmarking was
attributable to politicians' glee over the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these projects go to schools that simply can't manage
them,'' said James D. Savage, a government professor at the
University of Virginia and author of the book, ``Funding Science in
America.'' ``There's no accountability, and we don't know how the
money is being spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts ranked ninth this year, with $26 million in grants
for state schools and $23 million shared by campuses in
Massachusetts and elsewhere. Massachusetts also ranked 9th last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Many colleges, including Harvard, deny that they try to get such
grants. Others say earmarks help develop their research capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Casey, Harvard's senior director of federal and state
relations, said he could not explain why the university had been
listed with three grants totaling $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest, according to the Chronicle, was for Harvard and a
federal research center to conduct a $10 million study on disease
treatments that are least invasive for patients. Casey said the
money might be going to a teaching hospital affiliated with
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   California, with about $83 million in academic grants, led the
nation. The top recipient was Loma Linda University, a private
campus in California with a well-connected congressman,
Representative Jerry Lewis. Loma Linda received $36 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other colleges that received the 25 biggest grants,
Dartmouth College ranked eighth with $15 million to establish the
Institute for Security Technology Studies, which researches
cyberterrorism and has developed encryption technology.
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth's provost, Susan Prager, said the school had worked
with Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire to land the money. She
said that many institutions receive earmarks, and that
peer-reviewed sources would have been more difficult with the
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other New England states, New Hampshire ranked 11th with
about $23 million in campus-specific earmarks; Connecticut was 25th
with $8.5 million; Vermont was 40th with $4.3 million; Rhode Island
was 43rd with $3 million; and Maine was 47th with $520,000.

FIGURING FOX: MEXICAN HEADED AWAY FROM ELITISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In the three weeks since his historic election as
president, Vicente Fox Quesada has pledged to eliminate widespread
government corruption, increase global trade, reduce the nation's
chronic poverty, and end a six-year-old stalemate with rebellious
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But what the country's most eligible man hasn't done yet is
declare who will be his first lady. There are lots of contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's 20-year-old daughter, Ana Cristina, has said she would
gladly take on the duties of official hostess while finishing her
law studies. But there are rumors swirling in Mexico City _ which
his daughter has tried to quash _ that Fox might marry his press
secretary and confidante, Martha Sahagun. There have even been
stories linking Fox with Lucia Mendez, a popular singer and soap
opera actress.
</P>
<P>
   And there's another candidate: his former wife. In recent weeks,
Liliana de la Concha has been quoted in interviews as saying she
would like to get back together with Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The who-will-be-first-lady chatter is just part of what will
make Mexico's new first family one of the most untraditional in
modern history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not one of your typical families from power, and they
don't belong to the elite,'' said Luis Miguel Rionda, a political
scientist at the University of Guanajuato, Fox's home state. ``This
could change the very nature of how we define ruling families.''
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old president-elect divorced seven years ago, and _
in a first for a Mexican leader _ was elected despite running as a
bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   Also new for a Mexican president is that all four of Fox's
children are adopted. And Fox, a member of the conservative
National Action Party, is an openly practicing Catholic, something
Mexicans haven't often seen since the country's 19th-century
reformist constitution that largely excluded government ties to the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's stunning victory on July 2 ended 71 years of uninterrupted
power by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, also known as the
PRI. For decades, the governing party has been identified more with
Mexico's elite families, which produced most of the country's top
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But the new first family, which will take over the Los Pinos
presidential residence when Fox is inaugurated on Dec. 1, will be a
dramatic break from the tightly wound network of PRI families, less
oligarchical and more reflective of real Mexican families,
observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox and his family are different from the structures that have
typically produced political leadership, like the military,
lawyers, or technocrats,'' said Jose Antonio Crespo, a political
analyst who has written on presidential affairs in Mexico. ``Fox
comes from a small business and rancher background that more people
can identify with.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most visible early signs of the new first family may
be Ana Cristina, who remained at her father's side throughout the
campaign and now sees herself as someone who could influence
everything from youth and women's issues in the incoming government
to the decor at Los Pinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have themes of conversation with anyone, whether a
street kid, an indigenous person, a married woman, a young person,
king, or president,'' she told the Reuters news agency last week.
</P>
<P>
   When word spread soon after Fox's election that he might marry
Sahagun, his 47-year-old divorced aide, who hasn't publicly denied
the reports, Ana Cristina quickly dispelled those suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately right now it's impossible to tell who is after
Vicente the human being or who wants him because he is Vicente Fox
the president,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Adoption advocates in Mexico are also hoping that the Fox first
family will help shed a more accurate and positive light on the
relationship between adopted children and their parents in a
country where almost one-third of all adoptions last year were by
foreign couples. Some adoption experts say an antiadoption stigma
still shrouds the country; some schools still refuse to admit
adopted children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the new president will be more sensitive to
adoption issues,'' said Aurora Torres, director of Nueva Vida, a
Mexico City association of adoptive parents. ``And we'll be
counting on him to help improve the image and to help streamline
our adoption processes.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Beatriz Avila is glad to see a prominent political
family that more closely resembles her own. Avila, a 27-year-old
bank teller in the Mexico City neighborhood of Coyoacan, and her
husband have considered adopting a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel better about my own situation to see that
we're not that different from our country's top family,'' said
Avila, who voted for Fox. ``I use to feel like my family was so
different from the old elite families of the PRI, but now I can
better identify with Fox and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is concern among some residents and analysts about how
Fox's personal life might influence his public policies, it is
mostly around his devout Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   Fox attended Mass last Sunday with his family in his hometown
and received Communion as cameras flashed. Afterward, he called for
a ``spiritual revolution'' in Mexico, ``where everybody has the
opportunity to be happy, live better, and in less pain.'' It was
the first time most Mexicans could remember seeing a
president-to-be making such a public religious display.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue which will generate controversy,'' Crespo said.
``There may be more flexibility toward the church under a Fox
government, but he'll be cautious and tolerant of other ideas and
faiths, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most pressing personal issue these days continues to be
his love life and whether the president-elect might have a romantic
honeymoon to go along with the political one he's enjoying now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he gets married soon, especially if it's with someone
he feels comfortable with,'' said Rionda, the political scientist
in Fox's home state, adding that he'd like to see Fox marry his
aide. ``There's nothing better than a man in love who's in
government. I think it makes him a better leader.''

 &HT;    TV's Downplaying of Conventions Raises Questions about Their
Role
 &HT;    By Martin Gottlieb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The political parties are upset that ABC, NBC and CBS don't
</P>
<P>
   plan to cover the national political conventions much. Ohio
Republican Party Chairman Robert Bennett, for example, whose party
is not known for antipathy to the make-a-buck ethic, wants the
networks to ``forgo their cash-cow entertainment shows to engage in
a little force-feeding of Democracy 101.''
</P>
<P>
   He charges that the networks foster low voter turnout when they
limit themselves to an hour a night of prime-time coverage of each
convention.
</P>
<P>
   The networks respond that the little news the conventions provid
these days can be covered in an hour. They might add that political
</P>
<P>
   junkies can find more much convention stuff on cable and PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why this debate has some meaning: Since television
started
</P>
<P>
   covering conventions, conventions have been pivotal in
presidential
</P>
<P>
   elections. Who is ahead in the polls before the conventions does
not
</P>
<P>
   matter. Michael Dukakis was ahead in 1988. George Bush was ahead
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Who is ahead after the conventions matters enormously. Never
since 1948 has the lead in a presidential election clearly
</P>
<P>
   switched hands after the conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the lead does shrink dramatically after the
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   This is most likely to happen when one party has had a very
divisive
</P>
<P>
   convention and comes out of it looking unready to govern. The
Democrats in 1968 and the Republicans in 1976 (when President
Gerald Ford narrowly defeated California Gov. Ronald Reagan for the
nomination) came out of their conventions way behind, but ended up
losing only narrowly.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when the conventions are mellow _ as they presumably
</P>
<P>
   will be in 2000 _ great post-convention movement in the polls is
less
</P>
<P>
   likely.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because by the time the conventions are over, both parties
have had the opportunity to make their best pitches, make them
repetitively, and make them to the biggest possible audiences.
That, typically, is the process that resolves election. After that,
the American people don't hear much they haven't heard before. If
they don't change their minds, we shouldn't be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that what happens at conventions determines
who
</P>
<P>
   wins. Circumstances in the country (and the success of the
incumbent party in dealing with the problems of the country)
determine who wins. It's just that by the time the conventions are
over, the public has focused as much as it ever will upon those
circumstances. This focusing happens partly because both
presidential candidates look pretty impressive as individuals at
the conventions. So people stop thinking about personality so much.
</P>
<P>
   What about the future? Will the conventions stop being so
important if the networks downplay the conventions?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. After all, 2000 will not be the first year the
networks
</P>
<P>
   have cut back on convention coverage. The gavel-to-gavel
principle died long ago, and still we have seen no campaigns in
which the conventions didn't pretty much resolve things.
</P>
<P>
   The conventions still get enormous coverage. Besides whatever
prime-time coverage they get, they are featured in the regular news
shows.
</P>
<P>
   They dominate newspapers (which may still matter a little bit).
</P>
<P>
   The acceptance speech of a presidential nominee is an event of
</P>
<P>
   interest even to people who normally have little interest in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who don't hang on every word hear an awful lot about
it.
</P>
<P>
   If television in general were to stop paying any attention to
the
</P>
<P>
   conventions at all, that might reduce the importance of
conventions in speeding the public toward a final judgment on the
candidates. But that probably would require a series of decisions
by more than ABC, CBS and NBC about more than prime time. It
doesn't seem to be in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, whether ``Who Wants to be A Millionaire?'' gets
pre-empted (fat chance) probably doesn't matter much.
</P>

Daily News. His book, ``Campaigns Don't Count: How the Media Get
American Politics All Wrong'' is available, free, online at

WEB SITES HELP OPTION HOLDERS LEARN HOW TO USE THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With employees at everything from Internet start-ups to
blue-chip firms wanting stock options these days _ or at least on
the days the market's going up _ it was only a matter of time
before Web sites emerged to target this audience.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Brookline-based company launched
myStockOptions.com, a comprehensive site promising to help the up
to 10 million Americans with stock options figure out complicated
tax questions and maximize their options.
</P>
<P>
   In the few weeks since it became available publicly, the site
has gotten more than a million hits, said Bruce Brumberg, chief
executive of the company and owner of a legal and financial
publishing company. And private tests of the site by option holders
at more than 40 companies, including Staples, eToys, and Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, have also been successful, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response has been tremendous,'' said Brumberg, an
attorney, who cofounded the site with Jesse Brill and Peter Van
Ness. ``We have deep original content, online tools, online
record-keeping, and community features . . . and it's free.''
</P>
<P>
   The site joins other Internet destinations reaching out to
``optionaires'' _ people who are rich, or hoping to get rich, off
their stock options. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   www.StockOptionsCentral.com, www.optionwealth.com,
www.Stock-Options.com, and www.MyOptionValue.com.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the proliferation of sites is a response to the
democratization of stock options.
</P>
<P>
   No longer are the options just for highly compensated
executives, and no longer are they just available at Internet
start-ups. Secretaries and other rank-and-file employees are being
offered them, and large publicly traded companies that make
something as old-economy as dental floss are granting them.
</P>
<P>
   As of this year, according to the National Center for Employee
Ownership, there are 3,000 plans nationwide that grant stock
options to 50 percent or more of full-time employees, with a total
of 7 million to 10 million participants. The plan assets amount to
at least several hundred billion dollars, according to the
California-based nonprofit organization, which outlines the data on
its Web site, www.nceo.org.
</P>
<P>
   Stock option plans differ legally from employee stock purchase
plans (or ESPPs) and employee stock ownership plans (or ESOPs), and
involve an employer granting stock to employees with a certain
vesting schedule and exercise price. Figuring out whether to
exercise an option and what the tax consequences are can be
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a review of some of the sites that want to help you
maximize your options:
</P>
<P>
   --www.myStockOptions.com: This features the most inviting home
page of the sites reviewed, with plenty on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Want to know what it means when your stock options are
``underwater''? You'll find the answer in the glossary of terms. Is
it better to get nonqualified stock options or incentive stock
options? The answer is in the ``frequently asked questions,'' or
FAQs. And if there's a question that isn't answered on the site,
you can e-mail an expert.
</P>
<P>
   There are sections on the nuts-and-bolts of options, taxation,
and vesting, as well as on the very human emotions of greed and
envy and the implications of divorce for option holders.
</P>
<P>
   And there are plenty of online tools here to help you calculate
how much in taxes you'd pay if you exercised now; how many shares
to exercise if you need a certain amount of cash; and whether you
should sell, hold or look at other investments.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the features are available for anyone visiting the
site, some require registering for free membership. There are no
ads on the site. Brumberg said the company is exploring such
possible revenue sources as licensing of the technology and private
labeling of the site with financial service firms.
</P>
<P>
   --www.MyOptionValue.com: Promising to help you ``know your
options,'' this site aims to help employees who are getting stock
options for the first time learn how to get the most value without
having to hire lawyers and accountants.
</P>
<P>
   A regular annual subscription of $29.95 to this site lets you
estimate the value of your options based on exercise date,
expiration date, whether they're vested or unvested. It also lets
you create what-if scenarios, and figure out what a prospective
employer's options might be worth to you if you were to switch
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   During a limited introductory period, the site is providing the
first three months of membership for free, then charging $29.95 for
the next 12 months. Visitors to this site can also tap into a
demonstration without cost.
</P>
<P>
   The site, a registered investment adviser, also provides links
to articles, books, and other resources about options.
</P>
<P>
   --www.StockOptionsCentral.com: A free site that promises to
``keep it simple, accurate, and thorough, while answering your
thoughts, dreams, and `what-ifs' about your company stock
options,'' this lets you track value and tax consequences.
</P>
<P>
   There's some original content and links to a few outside
articles and books about stock options, but the site says it
purposely doesn't have ``complicated razzle-dazzle.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though the site is free, it does want to sell you
something.
</P>
<P>
   According to the site's ``media kit'' for advertisers, people
who use the site and exercise their options ``must find a home for
the proceeds. If you're a mutual fund company, an e-broker, a
brokerage house, a bank, or any other financial institution, you
will want to be in front of these folks the entire time they are
running their what-ifs and contemplating changing the location of
their money.''
</P>
<P>
   --www.Stock-Options.com: A free service of New Jersey-based
financial and investment firm Krieger, Ruderman &AMP; Co., this site
provides a stock options calculator and a way to keep track of your
stock splits, vesting schedule and other records. Just press the
``show me the money'' key to save the data and see calculated
totals for your options.
</P>
<P>
   A guest registration lets you take a tour of what the site
offers before you decide whether to take the time to enter your
options data here. The site also provides a discussion forum and
links to outside articles about options.
</P>
<P>
   But again, the site wants to sell you something. ``Who will
exercise and sell the stock for you? Online forms are provided for
opening an account with KR Securities, LLC,'' according to the
site.
</P>
<P>
   --www.optionwealth.com: This site promises to provide real-time
values for people's stock options, so employees don't waste time
trying to figure out their wealth at work, and employers don't see
company productivity decline as a result.
</P>
<P>
   But the site's real-time tracker, options value forecaster, and
strategy section haven't come online yet. They were to have gone
live in June, according a check of the site on July 14. As of this
Monday, however, the site was updated to say the launch will happen
on Sept. 7, 6:30 p.m., in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not easy figuring out whether the site will be free or
not when it's fully operational. In a paragraph found in a part of
the site featuring press clippings about the company and its chief
executive, Rick Schultz, the revenue model is described this way:
``The core business of OptionWealth is the sale of subscription
account services to employers for use by their optioned employees.
Corporate customers will have secure, private access to
www.optionwealth.com. Private portfolio accounts with password
protection will be established for each optioned employee with the
client company.''
</P>
<P>
   --www.fairmark.com: This online tax guide for investors just
came out with a new book, ``Consider Your Options: Get the Most
From Your Equity Compensation,'' which you can buy here.

A SLOWER FAST LANE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, is the economy slowing down, or what? And should we care?
</P>
<P>
   Just about every day some economic seer makes a pronouncement
about the numbers inching up, or inching down, or sitting there
doing nothing. It's as if the entire business world were hanging on
this thing, Hamlet-like, pondering what is to be, or not, on the
slowness front.
</P>
<P>
   The average American isn't sure what side to root for. Slower is
good, says Alan Greenspan, as long as it's not too slow, because
that keeps inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   But if slower is good, how come it always sounds bad? ``Job
growth sluggish,'' say the headlines, or ``Retail sales
disappointing.'' A responsible citizen sees that kind of negativity
and wants to get out there and take one for the team _ buy a
washing machine or something, maybe come up with a couple of new
job titles, or start a department to keep the economy standing
tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sluggish'' or ``disappointing'' is not where we want to be
after things have been so hot, hip, and fast for so long, which
really sounds good and as though we all got A's on the econ exam,
even though too much heat is supposed to be bad.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to get revved up about leaving a party, which may or
may not be over. What if the kitchen has simply run out of hot hors
d'oeuvres, and the caterers have ordered more? How is a person
supposed to figure out what's going on, not to mention what to
wear, in a constant buzz of contradiction?
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the economy is still growing,'' Ken
Goldstein, economist for the Conference Board, told the financial
press this month after announcing that his organization's index of
leading economic indicators dipped 0.1 percent in May. ``It's not
as fast as it was, but it's still growing. Yes it's losing steam,
but it had to lose steam.''
</P>
<P>
   So, there's a slowdown but we won't feel a thing, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start looking at the individual components, there's a
sort of musical chairs aspect to it,'' Goldstein told The Wall
Street Journal. ``What the report doesn't show is weakness in a
particular area that's starting to fester and grow and ooze out
into other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   So, there's a slowdown, and it's going to get ugly?
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying strength in the economy is good,'' Cary Leahey,
US economist at Deutsche Securities, told the Journal. ``It's not
great, but it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   How good is ``good''? And if it's competing with ``great,''
could it feel more like bad?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the interesting possibilities we have to face is that
slowing down could still be too fast,'' William Dunkelberg, chief
economist for the National Federation of Independent Business, told
The Boston Globe, commenting on June's piddling job growth.
</P>
<P>
   If a slowdown can pass for speed, does it count?
</P>
<P>
   And what of the Federal Reserve's ``beige book''? That's the one
that takes the economic pulse of 12 regions in the country. In
June, the data showed that things were cooling off a bit _ except
in Minneapolis, where things were still sizzling.
</P>
<P>
   Makes a person want to get on a plane and join the party animals
in Minnesota _ bring the whole wild bunch back East again, shouting
``ToGA! ToGA!''
</P>
<P>
   But would that be redundant if the party is still going strong
here, even though it seems as though people are heading for their
cars?
</P>
<P>
   Only the Fed knows for sure _ unless it doesn't. We follow the
endless ``Will he or won't he?'' speculation about Greenspan
raising interest rates, waiting for him to ``send a signal'' as
they say on the Street _ and the Street is Wall, not Main. Speaking
to the Senate Banking Committee last week, , he said, basically,
``Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   We watch the people who watch the Fed, and the exercise is
reminiscent of the way we used to wait for the geopolitical
crystal-gazers to interpret what was going on inside the Kremlin
during the Cold War. Did the premier have a cold? How bad was his
congestion? Who was standing where at Lenin's tomb during the
full-dress parades? More importantly, who was not standing there?
</P>
<P>
   Is the economy slowing down? Yes and no, unless it's just on
vacation, which is OK, since a lot of us could use one, especially
if we're in the economic analysis business. Take a break, people _
you're overheating!

NOTHING WRONG WITH PREFERRED, IF YOU DO YOUR HOMEWORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 37 and work 40 hours a week. I recently bought 100
shares of a Chase Manhattan Preferred stock paying 10.96 percent. I
would like to know the risks of preferred stock and why I should
not build a portfolio of well-known corporations' preferreds for
income.
</P>
<P>
   W.H., Portland, Ore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The risks aren't terribly high, but even though you have held
this security only for about six weeks, some of them are probably
already apparent.
</P>
<P>
   First, preferred stocks tend to follow the bond market more than
the stock market _ rising in value when interest rates fall (or
when investors anticipate they will) and falling in value as a
climate of lower interest rates comes on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   You bought your shares at a total cost of $2,609.50 The current
market value is $2,393.75, and of course you would pay a broker's
commission if you sold them. The shares have a stated yield of
10.96 percent, but the price you paid gives you an actual yield of
10.5 percent. The downside can be viewed more dramatically. The
shares traded at a high of more than $33 in the early '90s; a
person who paid $33 a share is getting a yield of only 8.3 percent
_ with a substantial capital loss, to boot.
</P>
<P>
   The second disadvantage _ something you should have checked out
before you purchased the shares _ is they can be ``called.'' That
means Chase Manhattan may redeem them for $25 a share anytime after
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   To answer your broader question, there's nothing wrong with
building a portfolio of preferred stocks. Yields are higher than
with bonds, largely because preferreds have a lower standing than
bonds: Bondholders must be paid before owners of preferred can be
paid, and preferred dividends must be paid before a common stock
dividend can be paid. Most preferreds these days, including yours,
are called cumulative preferreds, which means that if the dividend
on a preferred issue is skipped, the arrears must be repaid before
any common stock dividend can be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with solid institutions such as you contemplate
investing in, those factors are not likely to give you much pause.
More important is to view the interest-rate climate carefully, and
to make sure that if you pay a premium to the call value of your
shares, the call date is pretty far in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Before building a portfolio, you also should differentiate
between convertible preferreds and other preferred issues.
Convertible preferred stock can be exchanged for common stock at a
predetermined exchange rate, at the owner's option. Thus, when the
value of the common stock reaches a level at which it seems that
conversion is soon likely to be profitable _ either because of the
stock price of the common or because the common stock obtained
through conversion has a higher yield than the preferred offers _
those preferred shares will tend to follow the stock market (and
particularly the shares of the issuer's common stock) rather than
the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there's nothing at all wrong with preferreds, but you
need to do the homework to know the precise terms that relate to
them. And remember that when an issue can profitably be called by
the issuer, it invariably will be. Your issue of Chase Manhattan
10.96 percent preferred is one of its most expensive securities
(from Chase's point of view), and my guess is that this will not be
a long-term holding for you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are buying a house for $160,000, with
anticipated occupancy Nov. 1. We plan to start a family soon. The
financing options include taking a mortgage for $130,000 with
interest payments only due during the first five years, and then
with higher payments that would amortize the loan balance over the
remaining 25 years. An alternative is a $100,000 traditional
30-year mortgage, which would entail a bigger down payment and
liquidation of more of our savings. We are able to afford monthly
payments of $1,050 for all costs, including taxes and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   P.A., Worcester, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It seems that the last sentence would more or less dictate
that you go with the traditional mortgage. Suppose the interest
rate on both means of financing is the same _ 8.13 percent, the
national average for a 30-year mortgage at the beginning of last
week. The cost of the $130,000 interest-only mortgage would be $880
a month. Add in taxes and insurance, and the chances are strong you
would exceed $1,050 a month, the maximum you have budgeted.
Moreover, after five years, your payment would rise to $1,014 a
month. With a deal like that to look forward to, five years can
elapse very fast. Moreover, with your plan of starting a family
fairly soon, it seems likely the hike in housing costs might come
at a time when you can ill afford it.
</P>
<P>
   At 8.13 percent, though, a traditional 30-year mortgage would
entail a payment of $742 a month, probably leaving you with enough
for taxes and insurance to stay within your budget. You would have
to sell more of your securities, but your overall family budget
would be more comfortable. And finally, short-term prospects for a
value-oriented stock portfolio aren't all that bright, so you may
not be giving up all that much upside potential if you sold now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We have decided to invest $50,000 as soon as possible for our
son's education. Will that be enough of an initial investment,
given the time we have until he enters college, and are our funds
and allocations appropriate?
</P>
<P>
   D.G., Sutton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You should be in great shape. Since you didn't specify when
the additional $22,500 of investments will be made, I simply ran a
projection over 17 years, presuming that you began with $50,000. If
you achieve 10 percent average annual portfolio growth, you would
amass $271,743. (The longer you delay the additional $22,500
investment, the smaller the accumulation will be.)
</P>
<P>
   A more conservative scenario: If you achieve 10 percent
portfolio returns for 12 years, then adjust the portfolio with more
conservative allocations _ reducing returns to 8 percent for five
years _ you would have $246,071.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it should be plenty.
</P>
<P>
   The editors of the 2000 edition of ``Paying for College Without
Going Broke'' are projecting 5 percent annual inflation in college
costs. Their figures run only to 2014, but I continued the
projection, coming up with a cost for a private four-year college
education in 2017 of $51,244 _ escalating to $59,321 by 2021.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year total would be $220,867. If your son were to go to
a public school, you are saving much too much. The cost for a
public institution would be $19,637 in 2017 and escalate to $22,733
by 2021; the four-year total would be $84,639.
</P>
<P>
   As for your investments, I'd suggest a little more
diversification. Funds concentrated in one market sector represent
duplication, not diversification. All your funds are solid, but
focus on large-cap stocks, although Pimco Innovation specializes in
technology issues. Munder Index 500 is a blend of growth and value
stocks; your other three funds all operate in the large-cap growth
arena. My suggestion: Limit the Index fund investment to $5,000,
putting a similar amount each in mid-cap, small-cap, and
international funds. I know large-cap growth funds have been the
stars of the last few years, but the worm eventually will turn, and
17 years is a long time. A more broadly diversified portfolio
should serve you better in the long run.

TELECOM COMPANIES TAKING OLD-FASHIONED APPROACH TO SALES 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best way to sell today's most advanced telecommunications
services turns out to be the most old-fashioned way: face to face
and door to door.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Broadband and RCN Corp. are both discovering that
one-on-one meetings with customers are the most effective way to
sell packages of high-speed Internet access, cable TV, and local
and long-distance phone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best way to do it,'' said Daniel E. Somers, chief
executive of AT&AMP;T Broadband, the nation's largest cable TV company.
</P>
<P>
   While AT&AMP;T's one-on-one sales approach is just one aspect of a
marketing plan that includes direct mail, telemarketing, and other
promotions, RCN is relying almost exclusively on its team of sales
representatives who make house calls. In fact, it's almost
impossible for a would-be RCN customer to sign up for a service or
even find out what a service costs without meeting with a sales
representative.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Movsessian of Lexington said a friend had convinced him to
give RCN a try, but when he called the company to place an order
for cable TV and high-speed Internet access he was told he would
have to meet with a sales representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of skeptical,'' Movsessian said. ``I don't have a
lot of time and I wasn't hot about having a salesman come to my
house. But it actually turned out fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The RCN sales rep showed up on time and spent a half hour going
over all the options. Movsessian ended up buying a package that
included not only cable TV and high-speed Internet access, but also
local phone service. He estimates RCN is saving him about $50 to
$60 a month over his previous providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the usual type of service you get nowadays,''
Movsessian said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Adams, RCN's president, said one-on-one meetings result
in a sale more than 70 percent of the time. And since RCN's sales
representatives are pushing packages that bundle a variety of
services together, customers usually end up buying more than one
service. Adams said the average customer buys 3.4 services,
dramatically reducing the cost per sales call.
</P>
<P>
   RCN sales reps typically work from 11 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. They
dress casually, usually a red RCN golf shirt and a pair of shorts.
They carry an RCN briefcase, a cell phone, and a device that works
as a pager and can receive e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The typical sales rep focuses on 100 potential customers every
two weeks. The customers first get a mailing from RCN talking about
the company's offerings, which is followed up by a letter from the
sales rep seeking to arrange a meeting. Customers who don't make
appointments are called on individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction right now is very positive,'' said John McGeough,
RCN's senior director of sales, who often pounds the pavement
himself. ``Customers enjoy it and they feel it's a little more
personal.''
</P>
<P>
   RCN started offering bundled packages nine months ago in
Waltham. The bundles go by metal names (bronze, silver, gold, and
platinum) and offer significant savings over buying a la carte. The
$139-a-month deluxe platinum package, for example, would cost $233
a month on an a la carte basis.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is headed in the same direction, but its bundles don't have
catchy names yet and they don't always offer you as much for your
money.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's TV-telephony package, for example, costs $66 for nearly
100 digital video channels, 45 music channels, and one phone line
with 15 special calling features. The phone line lets you make
unlimited calls in your hometown and all contiguous towns.
</P>
<P>
   RCN's silver bundle charges $4 more for nearly as many analog
video channels and seven premium movie channels for which AT&AMP;T
charges extra. The silver package also has 31 music channels and a
phone line with two special calling features. The line lets you
make unlimited calls in all four Eastern Massachusetts area codes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being an effective sales technique, RCN's
one-on-one approach also puts a face on a company that most
consumers aren't familiar with. RCN is trying to simultaneously
build a new fiber-optic network and sell service to customers as
parts of that network are completed.
</P>
<P>
   The company has had customer-service problems in the past, but
it seems to be bringing those under control. Adams said RCN has
hired an outside polling firm to develop a customer-satisfaction
index. He said employee compensation will be tied to the rise and
fall of that index.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Adamik, chief operating officer of the Yankee Group in
Boston, said he's been impressed with RCN on both a personal and
professional level. A Lexington, Mass. resident, Adamik signed up
last week for RCN's platinum package. He said RCN's sales approach
seems to be working, since most of his neighbors signed up as well.
</P>
<P>
   Adamik also likes the way the company has rapidly increased
staffing across all areas of its business, including customer
service. ``It's looking like a good news story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Stella of Framingham, Mass., who signed up for RCN's
silver package, is also pleased. ``I was surprised they wanted to
come to my house, but I kind of liked it,'' she said. ``It's a
little easier to ask questions and all the information is right in
front of you in black and white.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean she was happy with everything. She was
promised a $20 rebate for signing up that week and another $20 for
every customer she referred. When the rebates didn't show up on her
bill, she called RCN customer service. Representatives there, who
operate out of Pennsylvania, said they hadn't heard about the
rebate but eventually credited her the money because other
customers had complained.
</P>
<P>
   She said she called the customer service rep who came to her
house looking for help on the rebate problem, but she never heard
back from him. ``After the sale, it's like forget it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Citibank protection _ or gouging?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Citibank is offering its 40 million customers a service that
protects them when they temporarily lose their income, but one
customer who received the solicitation sarcastically says
protection is not the word he would use to describe it.
</P>
<P>
   The service, called credit protector, basically lets the
customer put their Citibank credit card account on hold if they
lose their job through no fault of their own, are hospitalized,
take unpaid family leave, or can't work because of a disabling
illness or injury.

   Under those circumstances, customers can freeze their account.
They can't add any more charges, but they don't have to make any
payments, no interest or late payments accrue, and their credit
rating is unaffected. The freeze can last up to two years, or three
months in the case of unpaid family leave.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch letter said credit protector costs 69 cents per $100
of average daily balance each month the customer has a balance,
which doesn't sound like much. But the consumer who contacted me,
who asked that his name not be used, said it's actually quite a bit
when you think about it.
</P>
<P>
   His card comes with a 19.4 percent interest rate. He calculated
the 69-cent cost bumps that rate up to 27.68 percent. ``The
customer is getting screwed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Mindler, a spokeswoman for Citibank, said the bank doesn't
see it that way. ``It's an optional feature that we believe brings
high value to cardmembers, especially when they need help the
most,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mindler noted the maximum monthly fee for credit protector is
capped at $24.50, which works out to a $3,500 balance.

`THIS MAN MUST NOT DIE.' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ On the plate glass window of a building on Rue La
Fayette, a 3-by-4-foot poster shows the dreadlocked face of Mumia
Abu Jamal, a former Black Panther and radical journalist now on
Pennsylvania's death row, convicted of killing a policeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice pour Mumia Abu Jamal'' the poster pleads, describing
him as a journalist and declaring that international opinion is
squarely against his execution.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal's face is plastered on walls across Europe, from Dublin to
Rome. It is probable that more Europeans than Americans know about
his case.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, executions have become so common that most
are not even mentioned in newspapers. But in Europe, the fate of
prisoners on America's death rows is followed closely.
</P>
<P>
   The execution in Texas last month of convicted murderer Gary
Graham, on the uncorroborated word of a single witness whose
account was challenged by others, was just the latest to capture
widespread attention and cause deep anger across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans see themselves in the vanguard of trying to persuade
countries to ban the death penalty. Many ordinary people can tell
you that only China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the Congo execute more
people than the United States, which in 1999 executed 98 people.
</P>
<P>
   Most Europeans are Roman Catholic, and their church is at the
forefront of calls to end the death penalty. But religious
conviction is hardly at the root of the vehement, visceral
opposition of many ordinary people. Having survived two world wars
in one century, many Europeans see the death penalty as barbaric,
the earmark of a brutal, less enlightened society _ and one more
example of how Europe is morally superior to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Executing people, they believe, is an unfortunate reflection of
America's two-tiered society where the gap between rich and poor is
the greatest in the world, and where the poor and minorities
receive the death penalty far more often than those who are rich or
white.
</P>
<P>
   But others who are not at all motivated by anti-Americanism say
they want to use their influence to persuade their American friends
that the death penalty is an insult to America's position as the
world's only remaining superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a boat that doubles as a cafe on the Seine, Marc
LePlante, 40, an engineer, said America needs to consider its
position if it wants to continue to act as world leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hypocrisy for the United States to tell (Yugoslav
President Slobodan) Milosevic that he is a murderer but allow the
state to act as an executioner,'' said LePlante. ``It is just not
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans' embrace of the death penalty allows some Europeans to
deflect attention from their own moral shortcomings. When the
far-right Freedom Party became part of the coalition government in
Austria, the 14 other members of the European Union slapped
diplomatic sanctions on Austria to show their disgust at the
party's anti-immigrant rhetoric. But when the party leader Joerg
Haider sat down for an interview with The Boston Globe in February,
he turned aside questions about past statements praising Nazis by
saying, ``I am not a monster. Unlike your president, I have not
executed anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider's remark was not just the riposte of an embattled
politician. The decision by Bill Clinton, then the governor of
Arkansas, to interrupt his 1992 presidential campaign to preside
over the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, a black man convicted of
killing a police officer, is regularly cited by Europeans. Before
his capture, Rector had shot himself in the head, leaving him
mentally incapacitated; as he was being led to his execution, he
asked his jailers to leave the pie from his last meal to the side
so he could have it later.
</P>
<P>
   That Clinton would allow the execution of a brain-damaged man,
and do so for what Europeans believe was simply to prove that
Democrats weren't soft on crime, is seen by many Europeans as
disgraceful.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has put its money where its mouth is. One
condition of entry to the 15-nation union is that applicants must
outlaw capital punishment. Turkey, which desperately wants to gain
membership, would like nothing better than to execute the Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. But its application to join the EU
would be put aside, if not thrown out forever, were he to be
executed.
</P>
<P>
   More far-reaching is the EU's proposed bill of rights, one
section of which would bar EU members from extraditing suspects to
countries that have capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats say they are frequently confronted by
Europeans and asked to justify capital punishment. Felix Rohatyn
and John Kornblum, the US ambassadors to France and Germany
respectively, are constantly asked to explain the situation. The
standard diplomatic response is that it is what a majority of the
American people want in a majority of the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Many Europeans acknowledge that their indignation seems to be
have little impact. German officials were furious when their
attempts to halt the executions of two German-born brothers
convicted of the 1982 murder of an Arizona bank manager were
ignored. Despite appeals for clemency by German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, Karl LaGrand was executed by lethal injection in
February, and Walter LaGrand went to the gas chamber in March.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans did more than get mad. They sued the United States
in the World Court, saying the executions violated international
laws and treaties. Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin called
the executions barbaric, and said, ``We want to prevent this from
happening again.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1,300-page dossier submitted to the World Court, Germany
argues that the executions violated the 1963 Vienna Convention,
which requires US authorities to tell German-born suspects of their
right to assistance from German consulates in the United States.
Germany contends Arizona prosecutors knew the LaGrands were German
but did not notify German consular officials until 10 years after
their arrest.
</P>
<P>
   While opposition to the death penalty runs right across Europe,
the French, Germans, and Italians are the loudest in their
condemnation. In Rome, whenever a death sentence anywhere is stayed
or commuted, the Colosseum is bathed in golden light.
</P>
<P>
   Frederique Andreani, a writer for Le Point, a French magazine,
said many French are staunch republicans and are reluctant to tell
Americans what to do. ``They realize that the US is a democracy,
and that the majority of Americans want it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the French government rejects that argument and has led the
chorus to ban capital punishment. In 1981, when President Francois
Mitterrand abolished the death penalty, more than half of his
countrymen still wanted capital punishment. Since then, polls show
that support for the death penalty has fallen. Its supporters are
now in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, parliamentarians are no less opposed, but many seem
more resigned to the fact that European outrage means little or
nothing. Roger Godsiff, the member of Parliament who represents
Birmingham, suggests there is a fundamental misunderstanding of the
separation of federal and state power in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Britons, and indeed most Europeans, who oppose capital
punishment will tell you that President Clinton should end this
barbaric practice,'' said Godsiff, a member of the ruling Labor
Party. ``President Clinton can't do anything about it. It's up to
the individual states. But bringing political pressure on
individual states is much more difficult than lobbying a friendly
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Bell, who abandoned his career as a BBC war correspondent
to become an independent parliamentarian, said he regularly gets
letters from constituents demanding that he do something to get the
Americans to end capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them there's nothing we can do,'' said Bell. ``It's a
question of American sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   French politicians are not so retiring. Jack Lang, education
minister and a candidate for mayor of Paris, took his opposition to
the belly of the beast in February, visiting Odell Barnes on death
row in Texas. Barnes, 31, had been convicted of raping, beating,
and shooting a woman. After the meeting, Lang announced that he was
convinced that Barnes was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Lang's impassioned appeal on Barnes's behalf was front-page news
in Paris, France, but not Paris, Texas. When Barnes was executed
two weeks later, he again was front-page news in France, but barely
mentioned in the American press.
</P>
<P>
   Many Europeans believe their pressure will eventually yield
results. They point to the decision in January by Governor George
Ryan of Illinois, a staunch supporter of capital punishment, to
impose an indefinite moratorium on executions after questions were
raised in several cases.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, as Germans contemplated and celebrated the 10th
anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Stefan Mueller, a
student who has protested against the death penalty, sat at a bar
in the newly rebuilt Potsdamer Platz, which 60 years ago was
headquarters for the Nazis, the most prolific murderers of the last
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you told me 10 years ago that the Berlin Wall would be
down, I wouldn't believe you,'' Mueller said. ``I feel the same way
about the death penalty. The world changes. The world moves on.''

HARVARD STUDY DOWNPLAYS RISK OF CELL PHONE USE BY DRIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With more than 70 million Americans now regularly using cell
phones, concerns are mounting about the public danger of distracted
motorists talking on their phones while they drive.
</P>
<P>
   But while some communities are banning the practice, a new
Harvard University study cautions that the risks of using a cell
phone while driving have not been clearly shown _ and that the
benefits for public safety and personal productivity should be
considered, too.
</P>
<P>
   While some people using phones may drive erratically and in rare
cases crash into other cars or pedestrians, cell phones also are a
boon for reporting accidents and drunken drivers and for making
better use of one's time, the study authors said.
</P>
<P>
   From a cost-benefit standpoint, researchers at the Harvard
Center for Risk Analysis say, banning the use of cell phones would
be far less productive than lowering the speed limit to 55 miles
per hour or requiring more effective air bags and seat belts in
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks of using a cell phone while driving are real, but
they're smaller than many other risks you face in everyday life,
and the benefits are very real and may be larger than have been
previously realized,'' said Karen Lissy, the study's lead author
and director of the center's Program on Motor Vehicles and Public
Health.
</P>
<P>
   The study was funded under a $300,000 grant from AT&AMP;T Wireless,
one of the nation's biggest cell phone providers. But it was
reviewed for objectivity by 12 specialists, including some leading
opponents of cell phone usage while driving, the study's authors
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration urged that drivers avoid talking on cell phones _ or
using other new electronic devices like on-board computers _ while
behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Driver distraction in all its forms is a real threat to the
safety of American roads,'' agency deputy chief Rosalyn Millman
said at a Washington hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond today's epidemic of motorists using one hand to drive
while talking on wireless phones, Millman said, ``The plethora of
gadgets and gizmos that are being designed into vehicles may be the
much bigger threat of tomorrow. Will we learn about those risks and
deal with them expeditiously? Or will we wait for rising numbers of
deaths and injuries?''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of US communities, including Brooklyn, Ohio, Marlboro
Township, N.J., and three Pennsylvania towns, have enacted local
ordinances banning the use of hand-held phones while driving. At
least 19 states are considering laws banning the practice. France,
Japan and Sweden have laws regulating cell phone use while driving.
</P>
<P>
   Only two states, Minnesota and Oklahoma, compile data on cell
phones as a contributing factor to accidents. Using multiple
sources, the Harvard study estimates the risk of an American dying
while driving and using a cell phone is about 6.4 in 1 million per
year. That compares to a 30 in 1 million chance per year of a
driver dying from driving drunk for a half-hour every month.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, the risk that a motorist will be killed by a
driver using a cell phone is 1.5 in 1 million annually, about
1/12th the risk of being killed in a crash with a large truck or
with a sober driver not using a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   But a 1997 New England Journal of Medicine study of 699 drivers
in accidents found that using a phone increased by fourfold the
risk of having a crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard report also calculates the benefits to society of
banning cell phone usage while driving according to a standard
public health formula called cost per quality-adjusted life-year
saved. It attributes a higher value to a healthy year of life
compared to a year spent sick or maimed.
</P>
<P>
   Taking an American Enterprise Institute-Brookings Institution
estimate that the economic benefits of using a cell phone while
driving amount to $25 billion annually in the United States, the
study projects it would cost $700,000 per quality-adjusted year of
life saved from a ban on cell phone use while driving.
</P>
<P>
   That cost is anywhere from 9 to 30 times as expensive as
imposing a 55 miles per hour national speed limit, or requiring
added air bags, seat belts and side-door beams in vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless industry officials contend the answer is better public
education and advertising including an industry campaign urging
people to ``make safety your most important call.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association, said Americans made 118,000 emergency calls
to hospitals and police last year, suggesting a large benefit from
summoning quicker help for accident victims.

`BIG BROTHER' PLAYER FACES CRITICS AFTER LEAK OF TIE TO BIGOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, CALIF. _ The rewards of ``reality TV,'' an
unpredictable and unscripted genre embraced by viewers, have become
apparent this summer to the networks.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, though, they have been forced to confront the risk of
negative publicity stemming from that very unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   CBS executives and the producers of ``Big Brother'' were thrust
on the defensive by revelations that a contestant on the reality
program, William Collins, of Philadelphia, had close ties to a
militant leader who has espoused anti-Semitic views. Critics have
also accused the network of exploiting the personal pain of another
``Big Brother'' contestant, Karen Fowler, of Columbus, Ind., who
has openly discussed her unhappy marriage in front of a national TV
audience that includes her four children.
</P>
<P>
   Such issues have renewed doubts, first raised earlier this year
by the debacle surrounding Fox's ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?,'' about whether the networks can adequately
police the reality genre to which they have grown addicted. ``We
are all playing with fire,'' Fox chairman Sandy Grushow said last
week. ``And someone is going to get burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, a 27-year-old youth counselor, was a top aide to Khalid
Abdul Muhammad until he left the latter's organization, the New
Black Panther Party, several months ago. Muhammad has called Jews
``bloodsuckers,'' and last week said ``the white woman is the
devil.'' A CBS background check failed to turn up Collins's
affiliation with Muhammad, and he did not disclose it to producers.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance Sunday before TV critics, Collins, who was
accompanied by ``Big Brother'' executive producer Paul Romer,
claimed that law enforcement officials leaked the story of his ties
to Muhammad because they wanted to undermine ``one who stands up
against police brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he subscribes to anti-Semitic or anti-white views,
Collins replied: ``I consider all people who are evil and
unrighteous and against God my enemy. . . . If white people or Jews
fall in that category, they would know that.'' He added that he
makes ``individual judgments based on your deeds and your
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Romer and Leslie Moonves, president and chief executive
officer of CBS Television, said they were unaware of Collins's past
affiliation with Muhammad until it was reported in the (N.Y.) Daily
News. Moonves said CBS may hire a different firm to do background
checks for the next installment of ``Big Brother.'' As for the
controversial show, Moonves insisted the network has no regrets
about taking a chance with ``experimental'' programming. ``We have
nothing to apologize for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The program features 10 strangers living together in a house
while being monitored by dozens of cameras and microphones. Last
week, Collins became the first contestant to be ejected from the
``Big Brother'' house by a vote of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   He chided the show's producers Sunday for editing decisions that
showed only his ``confrontational, argumentative side.'' However,
he said he believes he was able to kindle a discussion of race
while on the show, helping his housemates (and TV viewers)
``understand the black man, black people, and the reality from
another perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of Fowler's nationally publicized marital
problems, Moonves said he feels ``bad that the family is going
through a certain amount of anguish,'' but he insisted that CBS is
not responsible for that anguish.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, qualms about the excesses of reality programming
seem to be growing _ even among some of its participants. Sonja
Christopher, a contestant on CBS's ``Survivor,'' in which one
contestant is voted off a remote island every week, said: ``I hope
that this program doesn't teach the young people of America that
the way to win is to be duplicitous. That's a concern of mine.''

 &HT;    Have a good what?
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I'm trying to pinpoint a pivotal moment in
the decline of the service economy. It's when clerks, waiters, and
counter help started telling you to ``have a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   It's almost as though they know something you don't and are
being coy. They won't commit to wishing you an entire good day.
``Have a good ... well, one.''
</P>
<P>
   Why this ambiguity? Do they suspect you are likely only to have
a good 10 minutes, aren't at liberty to warn you and don't want to
admit to an exact period of time?
</P>
<P>
   What's this ``one'' bit?
</P>
<P>
   As a reporter, I get uncomfortable when people around me start
getting pointedly vague and fling around the most indefinite of
indefinite pronouns. So maybe this is just my own occupational
sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe everybody else likes the phrase. Maybe most folks are
having a good one and are pleased when someone behind the counter
notices. But I doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's hard not to notice that customers started being
invited to have a good one at about the time waiters became
``servers,'' introduced themselves by Christian name _ which was
always something like Ashlie with an IE or Bif with one F _ and
started calling you by first name. Coincidence or what?
</P>
<P>
   Or did it start as a protest against having to say, ``have a
nice day,'' an invitation that lost its invitingness by the close
of the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   The answer remains a mystery inside an enigma.
</P>
<P>
   People who are very close can handle this level of ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard couples speak cheerily in a steady stream of
indefinite pronouns unintelligible to anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you get me the thingy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing in the place?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no. The thing by the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the stuff in the place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the big stuff in back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it. What about the other thingy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples such as this are using something that sounds a little
like language but they actually are communicating entirely though
mental telepathy.
</P>
<P>
   Someday will we evolve beyond this and just beam thoughts at
each other as the mutant X-Men do. For now, however, it's behavior
entirely too cuddly for an outsider to need to witness.
</P>
<P>
   I would suggest telling them to have a good one and excusing
oneself.
</P>
<P>
   `` 'Good one?' What did he mean by that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dunno, I thought he said, 'cold one.' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny, just like that person out at that place we went to.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's what bothers me about being told to have ``a good
one.'' You should only be that vague with someone to whom you are
reasonably close. Otherwise _ to meet ambiguity with ambiguity _
who would get where you're coming from?
</P>
<P>
   Cheerful servers who ask you for your first name, inquire as to
what you do and introduce themselves by name, always tell you to
have a good one. As though you have somehow bonded and would know
exactly what they mean. It is part of the whole over-familiar act.
</P>
<P>
   I resent this particularly when I am not having a good one. By
which, I mean a half-decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   But lest you think I'm just being grouchy and oversensitive to
the widespread use of this vague valedictory, know that it has
gained an acronym in Internet messages _ HAGO. Yes, people use it
enough to recognize it by its initials alone. It has me LOL,
laughing out loud, but not in a pleasant way that you'd wish to
listen to.
</P>
<P>
   Any phrase that has an understood Internet acronym is beyond
complaining about. HAGO is here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope it does not have a lengthy one.

 &HT;    Exercising the body while warping the mind
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Physical exertion has never been high on my
list of priorities. Inertia is my favored motion. I never stand
when I could be sitting, and lying down is even better. That's why,
when late last summer some unknown force urged me to put down the
book, roll my rope-plaid backside out of the Pawley's Island
hammock and get it to a gym, no one was more surprised than I was.
</P>
<P>
   I still can't believe it, but it's a fact _ four or five days a
week I hit the treadmill for a quick three-miler, and then go out
and embarrass myself for half-an-hour on the weight machines. My
form may not be the greatest, but the exercise is getting the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   Quite by accident the other day, I discovered that my kneecaps
are back where I remembered them being before gravity did me a
dirty trick. Even my fanny muscles have tightened up to where I
almost bounce when I sit. The trainers promise that before the
first snow flies, I will have rediscovered my waistline.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is the television set in the cardio-vascular
workout room _ it's always on and it's always trash _ and since
everyone else seems to be getting into the action, I can't very
well stomp over and turn it off. Could be that was my inspiration
to break the 15-minute mile and get the heck out of there.
</P>
<P>
   This week we've been watching the Jerry Springer Show. You've
seen that one, right? The one where Mama comes out and starts
hollering at everyone, calling folks nasty names because her
boyfriend has run off with his parole officer and baby daughter has
been picked up for soliciting at the local truck stop.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Springer, I've noticed, always looks real surprised when the
free-for-all begins, even though he's got a couple of guys the size
of my old Bronco, with biceps bigger than their cumulative IQs, to
step in and break it up before anybody starts yelling LAWSUIT!.
</P>
<P>
   A few months back, I discovered books on tape. That helps, but
there are times when even Anne Rivers Siddons and her tales of the
uncomfortably new-old south can't keep me from momentarily focusing
on that lively little screen just above my treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened this morning. George Stephanopoulos is
talking to me through my earphones about tarnished ideals and the
Clinton White House. Next thing I know, two barely pubescent twerps
on the telly are bashing one another over an already shopworn young
thing badly in need of a shampoo and someone to suggest she stop
buying her clothes at Harriet's for Hookers.
</P>
<P>
   The guy on the stationary bike next to me is breathing through
his mouth, less from exertion, I suspect, than stupidity. And the
blonde angel on the stair step machine is taking it all in, nodding
agreement every time the moron in the Fu Manchu beard pounds
another lump on the head of the kid with his belly button hanging
out.
</P>
<P>
   I can't help wondering how long these two have been watching
trash television. The mouth-breather answers my unasked question.
``Hey,'' he says to the young lady on my right, the one climbing
the Empire State Building and then some, ``my mom used to tape this
for me when I was in school so I could watch it when I got home.''
</P>
<P>
   That nearly threw me off my treadmill. I turned and stared.
Couldn't help it. The climber hollered back saying, ``Like, WOW!
You got a cool mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, sure.
</P>
<P>
   But it makes me wonder _ who are the real dummies here? Not
Springer. He's making big bucks on this gig _ a lot more than he
took home as mayor of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The morons he's exploiting? They don't seem to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, after swiping a glance at the mesmerized kids on
either side of me, I'm thinking the biggest dummies of all are the
folks who watch this trash. But I suppress the urge to suggest to
either one of them that just maybe they're exercising all the wrong
stuff.

 &HT;    Fun with monsters and fiends
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Draconus: Cult of the Wyrm ($45; www.cravegames.com; for the
Dreamcast) offers Action/Adventure in the truest sense. Play as a
sardonic knight in shining armor or a swashbuckling sorceress in
hot pants through a fantasy world full of cheeky monsters and
typically foul fiends. A third-person/chase camera game, there are
a few minor glitches with perspective and frame rate, but nothing
to detract from gameplay, which is a splendid mix of exploration
and sword play with a few nifty magic spells thrown down for good
measure. Role-playing elements augment the two characters' skills
and abilities as the story unfolds without swamping the game with
tedious inventory management. Simply an easy-to-play, beautifully
rendered and wonderfully animated adventure with lots of action.
</P>
<P>
   Playing classic video games from the early 1980s on a pumped-up
Sega Dreamcast is like putting out a kitchen fire with one of the
Great Lakes. But that doesn't necessarily make it a bad thing.
Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Volume 1 ($30; www.midway.com; for
the Dreamcast) offers six classics _ Joust, Defender, Defender II,
Robotron, Bubbles and Sinistar _ in the latest regurgitation of
Atari-era games for newer console systems. The game package has a
few handy features, like the ability to center and resize the game
screen and configure your controller for each game. The
translations are arcade-perfect using the original game code,
including sound effects and graphics. However, the initial thrill
of hearing the alien-blasting sounds of Defender or the pat-pat of
your bird's feet on the ground in Joust is short-lived. Because of
this, the $30 price tag seems a bit much _ after about 30 minutes,
you'll probably be ready to play something a little more apropo--
of your game system.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   It's been three years since gamers first wore out their
mouse-clicking fingers with Diablo. Now that the much-hyped Diablo
II ($60; www .blizzard.com; for Windows and Macs) is here, the
question is, was it worth the wait? Yes. The game improves on the
original Diablo, making it deeper, more playable and just as
addictive to novices as to hardened Diablo veterans. With a
much-improved storyline and fantastic cinematics, the game could
have just been a rote follow through, but the gameplay itself (even
with its low-resolution graphics) is still intuitive and amazingly
fun. While the initial launch of the game has been marred by some
multiplayer server problems, the lengthy, three-disc single-player
version is more than enough to satisfy fans until those glitches
are resolved. Get it. Play it.
</P>
<P>
   As a follow-up to the pinnacle motocross mud-mucking video
games, Microsoft's Motocross Madness ($45; www.microsoft.com; for
Windows) not only retains all of the righteous excitement of its
predecessor, it surpasses it in every way with much enhanced
graphics, depth of play, variety, optional complexity and
spectacular animated acceleration. Fully interactive environments
with trees that hurt and dump trucks that'll mow you over add
true-to-life predicaments to otherwise insanely aggressive virtual
dirt bike racing. A tremendous single-player game in its own right,
Motocross is fully realized as an online multiplayer racer where
the world's best are ranked and registered and the world's worst
simply cackle, scream with delight and perhaps pine for a place in
the upper echelon. This is the epitome of fun.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   If you've got yourself a newborn-to-36-month-old light sleeper,
you might be interested in Fisher-Price's Slumbertime Soother with
Remote Control ($35; www.fisher-price.com). Basically a colorful,
softly twinkling electronic music box, free-standing or strapped
onto crib rails, the Slumbertime offers lullaby melodies or
``peaceful'' nature sounds to waft your wee one off to dreamland.
The unit will turn itself off after a preset two or 10 minutes, but
if that's not be enough, or should the peaceful sleeper awaken,
there's a handy dandy remote control that will activate the box
from a discreet distance. The remote requires line-of-sight
targeting, so while you don't have to walk right into the nursery
to turn the Soother on, you do have to open the door . . . just
make sure the hinges are well oiled.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   An unconventional piece of peripheral hardware that's got
``novelty'' and ``niche market'' written all over it, InterAct's
Pool Shark ($30; www. interact-acc.com) offers the real deal when
it comes to imitation billiards. Essentially an inverted and
mutilated mouse that coddles a lightweight imitation cue stick (you
can also use a real cue), the Pool Shark offers a better way to
play a PC game of pool than with the conventional mouse. A
plug-and-go USB device bundled with THQ's ``Ultimate 8-Ball,'' the
Pool Shark could be considered a must-have for aficionados save for
the fact that billiards fanatics are more likely to hang out in
pool halls, not hunker around a PC monitor. Then again, the Pool
Shark is a catchy little ``party'' device even if you're really
into the idea of essentially real strokes in a virtual game of
pool, the Pool Shark might be a winner.

 &HT;    Java aids Web input
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Often on the Internet you see ``loading Java.'' What is that and
why, once loaded, does it not remain and not have to be loaded
again?
</P>
<P>
   _ Harold Jones, Elberton, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Sun Microsystems invented Java, a computer language that
makes it easier and safer to deliver programs over the Internet.
Java allows the same software to work on many types of computers,
gadgets and electronic toys. It doesn't matter if you are using a
Mac or PC; Java runs anywhere. It lets computers communicate better
than ever and allows a Web site to do complex things.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Major Web browsers incorporate Java. To keep the browser
running efficiently, Java is loaded only when a Web site requires
it.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Say a Web site makes credit card transactions available,
for example; it might need Java to create that kind of interaction
with you. So the browser would load Java for that session. Once you
left the browser, it would disappear until the next time it was
needed.

   Sue: Java's a cool program that lets all kinds of interaction
happen between you and your computer via the Internet, such as
audio, video, games and interactive educational programs. Without
Java, some Web sites wouldn't be nearly as much fun.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You can disable Java in your browser preferences if you
want, but then you'd miss out on all the cool stuff it does.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Mac Netscape users should go to File/Preferences. Click
Advanced and turn Enable Java off. Mac Internet Explorer users go
to Edit/Preferences. Open Web Browser and click Java and turn
Enable Java off. PC Netscape users should go to Edit/Preferences
and open Advanced. Click to turn Enable Java off. And PC Explorer
users go to Tools/Internet Options. Select Internet. Click Custom

   Dear Readers:
</P>
<P>
   When we get feedback on a column we'll do our best to relay more
information to you. Some folks wrote in some shortcuts for creating
an umlaut, which we wrote about in a recent column. Here are some:
</P>
<P>
   Sue: For the PC, hold down the ALT key and select an umlaut with
your number keypad. For example, A &QC; 129, U &QC; 132, O &QC; 148. You'll have
to remember which number goes with which umlaut, though.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Mac users should hit Option U. Then type the letter you
need. You'll have to hit Option U before each character.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Using Microsoft Word on a PC? Use Control, Shift, Colon and
the umlaut key. On a Mac or PC using Word, go to the Insert menu,
scroll to Symbol and select ``normal text'' from the font menu.
Select the umlaut. If necessary, you can create a shortcut key.

 &HT;    Macintosh program gives worldwide radio
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Few sights are as rare as the review of a Macintosh
program in this space.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, that's what we're going to do today.
</P>
<P>
   I am not fond of the Macintosh _ and I'll thank you to refrain
from bombarding me with e-mail in protest _ but it falls to my lot
to use one at work.
</P>
<P>
   A publicist from Aladdin, which generally produces its little
programs first for the Mac and later, if they prove popular, for
the PC, interested me in something called the Aladdin Tuner.
</P>
<P>
   This is a really neat little application that presents the user
with a world map from which he can select a country, or, in the
case of the United States, a state, and get a list of plugged-in
radio stations and, in some cases, television stations there.
</P>
<P>
   You can go to the stations' home pages from the list, or just
click to begin receiving their broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   All of this, of course, requires RealPlayer, but most of you, I
imagine, have already got a version of that.
</P>
<P>
   Be forewarned that some of the stations seem to require a pretty
recent version of RealPlayer, which can be downloaded at
www.realplayer.com/.
</P>
<P>
   The list of stations is broken down into formats _ jazz, heavy
metal, even, where available, that most unusual of formats,
classical. There is a search function that, for instance, allows
the user to find all the available gospel stations in Georgia or
all the talk stations in China.
</P>
<P>
   On my Power Macintosh G3, television comes through in a window
too small to be useful except in the most extreme emergencies.
Radio, for the most part, comes through pretty cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   If there's an available station that's not on the list, you can
ask Aladdin to add it, and the company promises updates once a
month.
</P>
<P>
   You can set up a menu of your own favorite stations. Aladdin
Tuner will also play CD and MP3 music.
</P>
<P>
   You can download a free version of the tuner that will work for
30 days before you have to register it or let it die. The price of
registering is $30.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, and downloading, go to the company's Web
site at www.aladdinsys.com.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it's available now only for Macintosh computers
running System 8 or better. One hopes it will be forthcoming for
the PC in due time.

   Taking the classic ``Panic Button'' concept and giving it
multi-functionality, Dakota Alert's Dial Alert ($170;
www.dakotaalert.com) will automatically dial up to nine
pre-programmed phone or pager numbers and send individual
pre-recorded voice messages to each. Designed to augment other
security devices such as their Wireless Door Contacts ($50 each),
Wireless PIR Sensor (a motion detector, $60) or the Wireless Panic
Button ($60 each), these affordable security devices are ideally
suited to the small business office, retail store or warehouse.
It's one thing to trigger a blaring alarm but quite another to have
a telephone contact-person safely detached from the alarming
situation and able to respond calmly and objectively. The Dial
Alert is AC-powered but also has a battery backup so a power
failure or disruption will not affect operation.

 &HT;    Packing, moving your computer is a do-it-yourself project
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I calculate that I've purchased 18 washing machines,
12 lawn mowers, eight refrigerators and countless leaf blowers in
my long life.
</P>
<P>
   I've moved from apartment to house, house to house, city to
city, so many times that it might have been cheaper to rent a
storage building somewhere around Carbondale, Ill., and store those
appliances rather than sell them for a nickel on the dollar so many
times.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one good thing about all that moving. I have
learned many valuable lessons, including the fact that it is better
to hire others to do the moving. That's true for futons that need
to be carried down winding stairs, for washing machines possessed
by devils that desire to crush my toe, and for my antique china
cabinet that cracks and breaks a little more each time I move it.
</P>
<P>
   However, when it comes to moving computers _ especially if it's
a long-distance move _ you're better off doing the work yourself.
Let's talk about how to do that. If experience is any guide at all,
I promise you expert advice.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation for moving your computer starts on the day you bring
it home brand new. The temptation is to rip open the boxes _ like a
10-year-old at Christmastime _ and get that sucker out and running.
But the best of all packing materials for your computer is the
packing that it comes in new. So do your best to save every last
bit of Styrofoam and cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who aren't psychic (believe me, I know how a
move can sneak up on a person unexpectedly) and who didn't save all
the packing material, you can always try to drop by a computer
retail store. Sometimes stores may have some boxes that came with
some of their floor models. Failing that, you'll want a box of
about the same dimensions as the original packing box.
</P>
<P>
   Then you'll need to stop by an arts-and-crafts store to buy some
Styrofoam. You'll need enough to use it for padding on all sides of
the box. You'll need at least an inch of Styrofoam (2 inches is
better) on all sides of the box. But don't put the computer in the
box yet. There's still some stuff to do.
</P>
<P>
   First, especially if you're not exactly a computer whiz, it's a
good idea to label all the connections. That way, you'll know where
to plug in your modem, keyboard, mouse, etc. Many new computers
have made this task simple by doing the labeling for you. But if
that isn't the case with your machine, use transparent tape to
attach labels to the machine and to the cables.
</P>
<P>
   Next you'll want to make some final preparations with the
machine itself. To protect your floppy disk drive, cut a small
piece of cardboard (the kind that dry cleaners use for folded dress
shirts is perfect) into the shape of a floppy disk and insert it
into the drive. That'll keep the head for that drive from banging
around while the computer is in transit. (The really well-prepared
among you may have kept the original cardboard packing material
used by the computer manufacturer. Congratulations, but take a
moment to ponder your compulsiveness.)
</P>
<P>
   Now you're ready to pack up the computer. But there's something
important to keep in mind, especially this time of the year. Really
high temperatures can damage a computer. And extreme jolts _ the
kind that a computer might experience in a moving van or a rental
truck _ are also bad for the machine. So strongly consider moving
the computer in the back seat of the family car. If you do need to
move the computer in the truck, steal a trick from professional
movers and double box the machine. Box it as I've described, then
locate a box that is big enough to offer about 3 inches of
clearance on all sides when the packed box is inserted. Then pad
each side of the box with balled-up newspaper or bubble packing
material. Besides protecting the box from jolts, you'll also
provide some insulation from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   That should take care of moving your computer. Now all you need
is some help unpacking everything else.

 &HT;    To buy the best new gadget, do some research on Web
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So it's finally time to buy a new cordless phone. Or
now's the time to replace the family VCR with a newer model that
doesn't spit out tapes or record your favorite programs with those
wacky lines across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   No problem _ you just head off to the nearest electronics store
and pick up a new one that fits into your budget, possibly a newer
version of the one you've used and loved all these many years,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, my friend. You could not possibly be more wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Since you last forked over the plastic for a new cordless phone,
do you you have any idea, even the remotest inkling, of the
unbelievable advances in phone technology? The same goes for VCRs,
toasters and even television sets. There's a bewildering array of
products out there, offering a myriad of options, features and of
course, prices.
</P>
<P>
   What should you do? A little Web surfing, of course, to bone up
on cellular phones, VCRs, DVD players, blenders or anything else
you are considering purchasing for your home.
</P>
<P>
   A good starting place is a nifty (and free) Web site called
MySimon (www.mysimon.com).
</P>
<P>
   MySimon isn't an online store. It doesn't sell anything. While
it does have deals with online merchants to help you shop for
products, what you will be using MySimon for is to find out which
product you want to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The way it works is simple: You click on a product category,
like VCR, and are taken to a product page. The site just went
through a redesign, so it's got more information than it used to,
but you want to scroll down to the ``Interactive Buyer's Guide.''
</P>
<P>
   Here you'll be walked through a series of steps to help you pick
the perfect product for your budget and your particular needs. The
process takes about 10 minutes maximum, and it's all based on user
input. You decide how much you want to spend, what features you
believe are most important and what trade-offs in terms of features
or price you are willing to make to get the best deal and the best
product for your needs.
</P>
<P>
   If you are like a lot of people and it's been awhile since you
went shopping for electronics, the range of options for the newest
home audio systems, cameras and even telephones is mind-boggling.
But as you go through MySimon, you can get explanations of what all
these newfangled gizmos will do. You can decide if they are right
for you.
</P>
<P>
   Do you really need a dual Super-VHS player? Does your cordless
phone really need to have digital technology built into it?
</P>
<P>
   MySimon has pop-up boxes that will explain any unfamiliar terms,
so by the time it comes up with recommendations, you will have a
good idea what is available and even desirable in your price range.
</P>
<P>
   All MySimon asks in return is some generic information including
nothing more personal than your age and ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   So now that you know there are three kinds of VCRs with three
different types of recording capabilities or that you can get a
cordless phone with more range and more gizmos on it than you ever
thought possible, it's time to see what the experts and people who
actually own the recommended products think.
</P>
<P>
   Continue evaluating products at Productopia
(www.productopia.com). It has the same organizational structure as
MySimon, in which you click on a category and a specific product.
Productopia will give you its best product picks in three criteria:
quality, style and value. Productopia doesn't just show you its
cool picks, it tells you why one DVD player was selected over
another and what other models from a particular manufacturer might
also fit your needs and your budget.
</P>
<P>
   You can also search the customer reviews section to find out
what people who have actually bought that new blender think of
their purchase. You can also follow links to the manufacturer's
home page or search the Web for more information and reviews.
</P>
<P>
   By now you should be armed with enough info about the products
you're interested in to make a truly intelligent purchase of
quality merchandise. However, before you spend a dime, there's just
one more stop on your information mission, Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's right _ Amazon.com. No, you're not going off to buy
anything there, unless of course you want to and the price is
right. The reason you are going to Amazon is for the product
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Most online shoppers and Amazon addicts already know that the
Amazon.com Web site has at least three or four detailed reviews on
everything from the new Harry Potter book to the latest in MP3
players.
</P>
<P>
   Surf the site until you find the item you are thinking of
buying. Some Amazon users write fairly detailed reviews that will
really give you the inside scoop. They'll tell you that a certain
model of Panasonic VCR is pretty noisy and some cordless phones,
while outfitted with the newest features, make the process of
placing a simple call or storing a number next to impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The entire online comparison shopping process shouldn't take
more than an hour or two if you visit every site and really delve
into the process. The result of all this free online research is
that you will become a smarter consumer ready to make an
intelligent purch

 &HT;    Fun with monsters and fiends
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Draconus: Cult of the Wyrm ($45; www.cravegames.com; for the
Dreamcast) offers Action/Adventure in the truest sense. Play as a
sardonic knight in shining armor or a swashbuckling sorceress in
hot pants through a fantasy world full of cheeky monsters and
typically foul fiends. A third-person/chase camera game, there are
a few minor glitches with perspective and frame rate, but nothing
to detract from gameplay, which is a splendid mix of exploration
and sword play with a few nifty magic spells thrown down for good
measure. Role-playing elements augment the two characters' skills
and abilities as the story unfolds without swamping the game with
tedious inventory management. Simply an easy-to-play, beautifully
rendered and wonderfully animated adventure with lots of action.
</P>
<P>
   Playing classic video games from the early 1980s on a pumped-up
Sega Dreamcast is like putting out a kitchen fire with one of the
Great Lakes. But that doesn't necessarily make it a bad thing.
Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Volume 1 ($30; www.midway.com; for
the Dreamcast) offers six classics _ Joust, Defender, Defender II,
Robotron, Bubbles and Sinistar _ in the latest regurgitation of
Atari-era games for newer console systems. The game package has a
few handy features, like the ability to center and resize the game
screen and configure your controller for each game. The
translations are arcade-perfect using the original game code,
including sound effects and graphics. However, the initial thrill
of hearing the alien-blasting sounds of Defender or the pat-pat of
your bird's feet on the ground in Joust is short-lived. Because of
this, the $30 price tag seems a bit much _ after about 30 minutes,
you'll probably be ready to play something a little more apropo--
of your game system.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   It's been three years since gamers first wore out their
mouse-clicking fingers with Diablo. Now that the much-hyped Diablo
II ($60; www .blizzard.com; for Windows and Macs) is here, the
question is, was it worth the wait? Yes. The game improves on the
original Diablo, making it deeper, more playable and just as
addictive to novices as to hardened Diablo veterans. With a
much-improved storyline and fantastic cinematics, the game could
have just been a rote follow through, but the gameplay itself (even
with its low-resolution graphics) is still intuitive and amazingly
fun. While the initial launch of the game has been marred by some
multiplayer server problems, the lengthy, three-disc single-player
version is more than enough to satisfy fans until those glitches
are resolved. Get it. Play it.
</P>
<P>
   As a follow-up to the pinnacle motocross mud-mucking video
games, Microsoft's Motocross Madness ($45; www.microsoft.com; for
Windows) not only retains all of the righteous excitement of its
predecessor, it surpasses it in every way with much enhanced
graphics, depth of play, variety, optional complexity and
spectacular animated acceleration. Fully interactive environments
with trees that hurt and dump trucks that'll mow you over add
true-to-life predicaments to otherwise insanely aggressive virtual
dirt bike racing. A tremendous single-player game in its own right,
Motocross is fully realized as an online multiplayer racer where
the world's best are ranked and registered and the world's worst
simply cackle, scream with delight and perhaps pine for a place in
the upper echelon. This is the epitome of fun.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   If you've got yourself a newborn-to-36-month-old light sleeper,
you might be interested in Fisher-Price's Slumbertime Soother with
Remote Control ($35; www.fisher-price.com). Basically a colorful,
softly twinkling electronic music box, free-standing or strapped
onto crib rails, the Slumbertime offers lullaby melodies or
``peaceful'' nature sounds to waft your wee one off to dreamland.
The unit will turn itself off after a preset two or 10 minutes, but
if that's not be enough, or should the peaceful sleeper awaken,
there's a handy dandy remote control that will activate the box
from a discreet distance. The remote requires line-of-sight
targeting, so while you don't have to walk right into the nursery
to turn the Soother on, you do have to open the door . . . just
make sure the hinges are well oiled.

   An unconventional piece of peripheral hardware that's got
``novelty'' and ``niche market'' written all over it, InterAct's
Pool Shark ($30; www. interact-acc.com) offers the real deal when
it comes to imitation billiards. Essentially an inverted and
mutilated mouse that coddles a lightweight imitation cue stick (you
can also use a real cue), the Pool Shark offers a better way to
play a PC game of pool than with the conventional mouse. A
plug-and-go USB device bundled with THQ's ``Ultimate 8-Ball,'' the
Pool Shark could be considered a must-have for aficionados save for
the fact that billiards fanatics are more likely to hang out in
pool halls, not hunker around a PC monitor. Then again, the Pool
Shark is a catchy little ``party'' device even if you're really
into the idea of essentially real strokes in a virtual game of
pool, the Pool Shark might be a winner.

   Taking the classic ``Panic Button'' concept and giving it
multi-functionality, Dakota Alert's Dial Alert ($170;
www.dakotaalert.com) will automatically dial up to nine
pre-programmed phone or pager numbers and send individual
pre-recorded voice messages to each. Designed to augment other
security devices such as their Wireless Door Contacts ($50 each),
Wireless PIR Sensor (a motion detector, $60) or the Wireless Panic
Button ($60 each), these affordable security devices are ideally
suited to the small business office, retail store or warehouse.
It's one thing to trigger a blaring alarm but quite another to have
a telephone contact-person safely detached from the alarming
situation and able to respond calmly and objectively. The Dial
Alert is AC-powered but also has a battery backup so a power
failure or disruption will not affect operation.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Vatican meddles in roiling waters
 &HT;    For release Wednesday, July 26, 2000
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if the Middle East negotiations weren't tangled enough, the
Vatican has decided to insert itself into this most difficult of
situations. Last weekend, Pope John Paul II suggested that
Jerusalem, the heretofore unfixable sticking point of any
negotiations, be internationally controlled.
</P>
<P>
   No Israeli control, no Palestinian control. Someone else in
control.
</P>
<P>
   It has a familiar ring to it, a quite familiar ring. This is
what was first decided by the United Nations in November 1947 when
Palestine was partitioned into separate Jewish and Arab states with
Jerusalem as an international enclave.
</P>
<P>
   How Jerusalem was to be administered never was quite clear. I
suppose it could have been done by a United Nations force but
history has shown us that United Nations' forces have not been the
bedrock of peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter because Jerusalem never got to enjoy any
international control. As soon as Israel declared its independence
in 1948, based on the U.N. partition, the Arabs attacked and
captured Old Jerusalem, including all the sites holy to Christians,
Jews and Moslems.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 19 years, the Old City was ruled by Jordan, much of
the time by the now revered, late King Hussein. One need not go
into discussing all the atrocities committed against the Jewish
sites under Jordanian control, or the denial by Jordan of Jewish
access to their holy sites all those years. It's been well
documented but now is seen as a bygone stigma inasmuch as Hussein,
having lost the city in 1967, later dropped his animosity to a
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Vatican to stick its nose into the situation in 2000
rankles me. Where, during the 19 years of Jordanian occupation, was
the cry from the Vatican to internationalize the city? To allow
Jews to worship there? To demand the Jordanians stop vandalizing
Jewish grave stones?
</P>
<P>
   The reigns of three popes, Pius II, John XXIII and Paul VI,
covered the period of Jordanian occupation, an occupation that not
only denied Jews their religious sites but also defied the original
United Nations' decision to internationalize the city.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with well-intending people seeking ways to heal a historic
impasse (and others hoping to sabotage it), the Vatican joins in
and says that neither the Jews or Moslems should control it, that
an international force should. This actually is not a new Vatican
position. Relations between Israel and the Vatican have been
strained in recent years as a result of the Vatican's persistent
insistence that Israel's occupation of the city was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Harsh words from a 1948-1967 bystander.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, the Vatican admits it does not know a formula to
maintain an international Jerusalem. I don't know that anyone does,
or ever could _ maybe the folks at Disney would have the best
chance. We are dealing with the highest of emotions, a bubbling
lava buildup that shows no signs of cooling off.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an internationalized city would be ideal, flanked by
cooperative Israeli and Palestinian states. But, as we learned in
1948, and learn every day in Northern Ireland, India, Pakistan,
Fiji and dozens of other flashpoints, you can't make people love
each other if they don't want to love each other.
</P>
<P>
   And the Israelis and Palestinians, no matter what their
leadership maintains, have a deep dislike for each other.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what is decided at the top, the carrying out of any
agreements will have to be performed by people below _ and they
don't want to. From those heady days at the close of the 1967 war,
when the Israelis took and annexed Jerusalem, it was said that the
city was not a negotiable item in any dealings with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they are negotiating it, or trying to -- and without success
because no formula will be well-met by the more radical folks back
home. Now, along comes the Vatican to tell the Israelis, whose
cause they ignored for 19 uncaring years, that they should turn the
city over to, to...what? To whom?
</P>
<P>
   Impasse will remain the operative word.

 &HT;    Java aids Web input
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Often on the Internet you see ``loading Java.'' What is that and
why, once loaded, does it not remain and not have to be loaded
again?
</P>
<P>
   _ Harold Jones, Elberton, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Sun Microsystems invented Java, a computer language that
makes it easier and safer to deliver programs over the Internet.
Java allows the same software to work on many types of computers,
gadgets and electronic toys. It doesn't matter if you are using a
Mac or PC; Java runs anywhere. It lets computers communicate better
than ever and allows a Web site to do complex things.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Major Web browsers incorporate Java. To keep the browser
running efficiently, Java is loaded only when a Web site requires
it.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Say a Web site makes credit card transactions available,
for example; it might need Java to create that kind of interaction
with you. So the browser would load Java for that session. Once you
left the browser, it would disappear until the next time it was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Java's a cool program that lets all kinds of interaction
happen between you and your computer via the Internet, such as
audio, video, games and interactive educational programs. Without
Java, some Web sites wouldn't be nearly as much fun.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You can disable Java in your browser preferences if you
want, but then you'd miss out on all the cool stuff it does.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Mac Netscape users should go to File/Preferences. Click
Advanced and turn Enable Java off. Mac Internet Explorer users go
to Edit/Preferences. Open Web Browser and click Java and turn
Enable Java off. PC Netscape users should go to Edit/Preferences
and open Advanced. Click to turn Enable Java off. And PC Explorer
users go to Tools/Internet Options. Select Internet. Click Custom
Level. Scroll down to Java Permissions and select Disable Java.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Readers:
</P>
<P>
   When we get feedback on a column we'll do our best to relay more
information to you. Some folks wrote in some shortcuts for creating
an umlaut, which we wrote about in a recent column. Here are some:
</P>
<P>
   Sue: For the PC, hold down the ALT key and select an umlaut with
your number keypad. For example, A &QC; 129, U &QC; 132, O &QC; 148. You'll have
to remember which number goes with which umlaut, though.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Mac users should hit Option U. Then type the letter you
need. You'll have to hit Option U before each character.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Using Microsoft Word on a PC? Use Control, Shift, Colon and
the umlaut key. On a Mac or PC using Word, go to the Insert menu,
scroll to Symbol and select ``normal text'' from the font menu.
Select the umlaut. If necessary, you can create a shortcut key.
</P>
<P>

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Macintosh program gives worldwide radio
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Few sights are as rare as the review of a Macintosh
program in this space.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, that's what we're going to do today.
</P>
<P>
   I am not fond of the Macintosh _ and I'll thank you to refrain
from bombarding me with e-mail in protest _ but it falls to my lot
to use one at work.
</P>
<P>
   A publicist from Aladdin, which generally produces its little
programs first for the Mac and later, if they prove popular, for
the PC, interested me in something called the Aladdin Tuner.
</P>
<P>
   This is a really neat little application that presents the user
with a world map from which he can select a country, or, in the
case of the United States, a state, and get a list of plugged-in
radio stations and, in some cases, television stations there.
</P>
<P>
   You can go to the stations' home pages from the list, or just
click to begin receiving their broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   All of this, of course, requires RealPlayer, but most of you, I
imagine, have already got a version of that.
</P>
<P>
   Be forewarned that some of the stations seem to require a pretty
recent version of RealPlayer, which can be downloaded at
www.realplayer.com/.
</P>
<P>
   The list of stations is broken down into formats _ jazz, heavy
metal, even, where available, that most unusual of formats,
classical. There is a search function that, for instance, allows
the user to find all the available gospel stations in Georgia or
all the talk stations in China.
</P>
<P>
   On my Power Macintosh G3, television comes through in a window
too small to be useful except in the most extreme emergencies.
Radio, for the most part, comes through pretty cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   If there's an available station that's not on the list, you can
ask Aladdin to add it, and the company promises updates once a
month.
</P>
<P>
   You can set up a menu of your own favorite stations. Aladdin
Tuner will also play CD and MP3 music.
</P>
<P>
   You can download a free version of the tuner that will work for
30 days before you have to register it or let it die. The price of
registering is $30.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, and downloading, go to the company's Web
site at www.aladdinsys.com.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it's available now only for Macintosh computers
running System 8 or better. One hopes it will be forthcoming for
the PC in due time.

 &HT;    Packing, moving your computer is a do-it-yourself project
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I calculate that I've purchased 18 washing machines,
12 lawn mowers, eight refrigerators and countless leaf blowers in
my long life.
</P>
<P>
   I've moved from apartment to house, house to house, city to
city, so many times that it might have been cheaper to rent a
storage building somewhere around Carbondale, Ill., and store those
appliances rather than sell them for a nickel on the dollar so many
times.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one good thing about all that moving. I have
learned many valuable lessons, including the fact that it is better
to hire others to do the moving. That's true for futons that need
to be carried down winding stairs, for washing machines possessed
by devils that desire to crush my toe, and for my antique china
cabinet that cracks and breaks a little more each time I move it.
</P>
<P>
   However, when it comes to moving computers _ especially if it's
a long-distance move _ you're better off doing the work yourself.
Let's talk about how to do that. If experience is any guide at all,
I promise you expert advice.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation for moving your computer starts on the day you bring
it home brand new. The temptation is to rip open the boxes _ like a
10-year-old at Christmastime _ and get that sucker out and running.
But the best of all packing materials for your computer is the
packing that it comes in new. So do your best to save every last
bit of Styrofoam and cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who aren't psychic (believe me, I know how a
move can sneak up on a person unexpectedly) and who didn't save all
the packing material, you can always try to drop by a computer
retail store. Sometimes stores may have some boxes that came with
some of their floor models. Failing that, you'll want a box of
about the same dimensions as the original packing box.
</P>
<P>
   Then you'll need to stop by an arts-and-crafts store to buy some
Styrofoam. You'll need enough to use it for padding on all sides of
the box. You'll need at least an inch of Styrofoam (2 inches is
better) on all sides of the box. But don't put the computer in the
box yet. There's still some stuff to do.
</P>
<P>
   First, especially if you're not exactly a computer whiz, it's a
good idea to label all the connections. That way, you'll know where
to plug in your modem, keyboard, mouse, etc. Many new computers
have made this task simple by doing the labeling for you. But if
that isn't the case with your machine, use transparent tape to
attach labels to the machine and to the cables.
</P>
<P>
   Next you'll want to make some final preparations with the
machine itself. To protect your floppy disk drive, cut a small
piece of cardboard (the kind that dry cleaners use for folded dress
shirts is perfect) into the shape of a floppy disk and insert it
into the drive. That'll keep the head for that drive from banging
around while the computer is in transit. (The really well-prepared
among you may have kept the original cardboard packing material
used by the computer manufacturer. Congratulations, but take a
moment to ponder your compulsiveness.)
</P>
<P>
   Now you're ready to pack up the computer. But there's something
important to keep in mind, especially this time of the year. Really
high temperatures can damage a computer. And extreme jolts _ the
kind that a computer might experience in a moving van or a rental
truck _ are also bad for the machine. So strongly consider moving
the computer in the back seat of the family car. If you do need to
move the computer in the truck, steal a trick from professional
movers and double box the machine. Box it as I've described, then
locate a box that is big enough to offer about 3 inches of
clearance on all sides when the packed box is inserted. Then pad
each side of the box with balled-up newspaper or bubble packing
material. Besides protecting the box from jolts, you'll also
provide some insulation from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   That should take care of moving your computer. Now all you need
is some help unpacking everything else.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have been searching for a 1975 quarter for our daughter.
We are at our wits' end since this search has been going on for
over a year. Why is the 1975 quarter so scarce?
</P>
<P>
   _ Doris E.
</P>
<P>
   A: Because there are no 1975 quarters. In 1975 and 1976 the U.S.
Mint produced the Bicentennial Quarter. There is no difference
between the coins minted in those two years _ all have the same
dual dating (1776-1976). About 2.3 billion quarters were minted in
1975 and 1976. The customary annual production is 1 billion to 2
billion quarters. So even the bicentennials are relatively scarce.
The bicentennial quarter's reverse has a colonial drummer and a
victory torch circled by 13 stars representing the states in the
Union when the Declaration of Independence was signed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently I had ceramic tile installed. The installer set up
his equipment on my sidewalk. Later, I discovered an evergreen
shrub and rose bush were covered with tile dust that I cannot wash
off with a hose. Even heavy rain has not removed the dust. Is there
a solution that I can spray to remove this dust?
</P>
<P>
   _ N. Kalish
</P>
<P>
   A: Austin's own green thumb, Hank Howard of Howard Nursery, said
this dust, like cement dust, has adhered to the leaves. His
recommendation? Spray a bath of vinegar and water ( 1/4 cup vinegar
to 1 gallon water) on a few leaves. Let sit for five minutes. Rinse
thoroughly. Test a few leaves on each plant before spraying, since
some sensitive leaves may be burned by the mixture, warns Howard.
If the leaves do not respond well to the vinegar bath, wait for new
foliage to sprout and remove dusted leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently, I went to a popular Bulgarian hangout (restaurant
and bar) in downtown Sofia _''Eddy's Tex Mex Diner'' (4 Vitosha
Blvd., Sofia, Bulgaria). To my surprise, a large Confederate flag
was behind the band on the wall and was a focal point to everyone
there. Obviously, they don't know the difference between the
Confederate flag and the Texas flag! Would it be possible to get
someone from Texas tourism or state government to send them an
official Texas flag? Alternatively, where can one get a Texas flag?
</P>
<P>
   _ David R. Kincaid
</P>
<P>
   A: Of course, Eddy was obviously well-intentioned. A flag of the
Confederacy was one of the six flown over Texas. (The others?
France, Spain, Mexico, Republic of Texas and United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Through the magic of this column (and some aghast Texans
interested in tourism and Tex-Mex food abroad), a Texas flag flown
over the Capitol on July Fourth is winging its way to Eddy's in

<P>
   _ W.A. Castille
</P>
<P>
   A: To save money. Those practical colonials knew what they were
doing. Wood was plentiful (read ``cheap'') and bridges built of
stone did not respond well to the cold winters (stone pavers could
be damaged by the ice). The addition of a roof and sides protected
the wood from the elements, so covered bridges lasted longer. Of
course, more romantic reasons have been proffered. Youngsters could
hide from elders and kiss. Settlers could seek protection from
marauders; travelers, from the harsh winters. Oxen hauling loads
were easily spooked, and the sides of the bridge protected them.

<P>
   _ M. Hooks
</P>
<P>
   A: Call Jake's Marketplace at (888) ITS-JAKE to purchase
two-headed or two-tailed coins. Prices begin at about $3 for the
penny; the popular half-dollar, about $9. These are genuine coins
that have been machined into double-sided coins. Fun, but I still
prefer ``Heads I win, tails you lose'' with a standard minted coin.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a house with white mini blinds on every window. They
need cleaning bad! What is the easiest way to get the dust, dirt
and smoke off them? Hopefully without taking each one down.
</P>
<P>
   _ K.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: White metal blinds? (These methods are not recommended for
bamboo or fabric mini blinds.) Since you are beyond vacuuming, put
on an old pair of socks, and use your favorite cleaner (always test
on an unobtrusive spot to make sure your cleaner will not scratch
or remove the finish). Wipe thoroughly on both sides. Wipe again
with clean socks. Sounds like they need a good soaking (I know you
don't want to, but maybe if you do a room a day, it will not be so
dreary). Protect the tub with a towel and soak the blinds in a
sudsy solution (mild soap and warm water, or even laundry
detergent). Rinse thoroughly, dry (do not hang wet blinds made with
natural fiber strings, lest the strings stretch). Some prefer to
remove blinds and hose them off outside _ in the yard or at an
automatic car wash. Once they are clean, regular vacuuming will
keep them looking good.

 &HT;    Consumer Q &AMP; A

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have been searching for a 1975 quarter for our daughter.
We are at our wits' end since this search has been going on for
over a year. Why is the 1975 quarter so scarce?
</P>
<P>
   _ Doris E.
</P>
<P>
   A: Because there are no 1975 quarters. In 1975 and 1976 the U.S.
Mint produced the Bicentennial Quarter. There is no difference
between the coins minted in those two years _ all have the same
dual dating (1776-1976). About 2.3 billion quarters were minted in
1975 and 1976. The customary annual production is 1 billion to 2
billion quarters. So even the bicentennials are relatively scarce.
The bicentennial quarter's reverse has a colonial drummer and a
victory torch circled by 13 stars representing the states in the
Union when the Declaration of Independence was signed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently I had ceramic tile installed. The installer set up
his equipment on my sidewalk. Later, I discovered an evergreen
shrub and rose bush were covered with tile dust that I cannot wash
off with a hose. Even heavy rain has not removed the dust. Is there
a solution that I can spray to remove this dust?
</P>
<P>
   _ N. Kalish
</P>
<P>
   A: Austin's own green thumb, Hank Howard of Howard Nursery, said
this dust, like cement dust, has adhered to the leaves. His
recommendation? Spray a bath of vinegar and water ( 1/4 cup vinegar
to 1 gallon water) on a few leaves. Let sit for five minutes. Rinse
thoroughly. Test a few leaves on each plant before spraying, since
some sensitive leaves may be burned by the mixture, warns Howard.
If the leaves do not respond well to the vinegar bath, wait for new
foliage to sprout and remove dusted leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently, I went to a popular Bulgarian hangout (restaurant
and bar) in downtown Sofia _''Eddy's Tex Mex Diner'' (4 Vitosha
Blvd., Sofia, Bulgaria). To my surprise, a large Confederate flag
was behind the band on the wall and was a focal point to everyone
there. Obviously, they don't know the difference between the
Confederate flag and the Texas flag! Would it be possible to get
someone from Texas tourism or state government to send them an
official Texas flag? Alternatively, where can one get a Texas flag?
</P>
<P>
   _ David R. Kincaid
</P>
<P>
   A: Of course, Eddy was obviously well-intentioned. A flag of the
Confederacy was one of the six flown over Texas. (The others?
France, Spain, Mexico, Republic of Texas and United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Through the magic of this column (and some aghast Texans
interested in tourism and Tex-Mex food abroad), a Texas flag flown
over the Capitol on July Fourth is winging its way to Eddy's in
Bulgaria. The flag is accompanied by a certificate of authenticity
and a note that it is compliments of the Texas House of
Representatives. Flags can be purchased from state representatives
or the sergeant at arms at the Capitol. P.S. How were the
enchiladas?
</P>
<P>
   Q: A question about many of the very old bridges in the New

</P>

stone did not respond well to the cold winters (stone pavers could
be damaged by the ice). The addition of a roof and sides protected

 &HT;    To buy the best new gadget, do some research on Web
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So it's finally time to buy a new cordless phone. Or
now's the time to replace the family VCR with a newer model that
doesn't spit out tapes or record your favorite programs with those
wacky lines across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   No problem _ you just head off to the nearest electronics store
and pick up a new one that fits into your budget, possibly a newer
version of the one you've used and loved all these many years,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, my friend. You could not possibly be more wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Since you last forked over the plastic for a new cordless phone,
do you you have any idea, even the remotest inkling, of the
unbelievable advances in phone technology? The same goes for VCRs,
toasters and even television sets. There's a bewildering array of
products out there, offering a myriad of options, features and of
course, prices.
</P>
<P>
   What should you do? A little Web surfing, of course, to bone up
on cellular phones, VCRs, DVD players, blenders or anything else
you are considering purchasing for your home.
</P>
<P>
   A good starting place is a nifty (and free) Web site called
MySimon (www.mysimon.com).
</P>
<P>
   MySimon isn't an online store. It doesn't sell anything. While
it does have deals with online merchants to help you shop for
products, what you will be using MySimon for is to find out which
product you want to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The way it works is simple: You click on a product category,
like VCR, and are taken to a product page. The site just went
through a redesign, so it's got more information than it used to,
but you want to scroll down to the ``Interactive Buyer's Guide.''
</P>
<P>
   Here you'll be walked through a series of steps to help you pick
the perfect product for your budget and your particular needs. The
process takes about 10 minutes maximum, and it's all based on user
input. You decide how much you want to spend, what features you
believe are most important and what trade-offs in terms of features
or price you are willing to make to get the best deal and the best
product for your needs.
</P>
<P>
   If you are like a lot of people and it's been awhile since you
went shopping for electronics, the range of options for the newest
home audio systems, cameras and even telephones is mind-boggling.
But as you go through MySimon, you can get explanations of what all
these newfangled gizmos will do. You can decide if they are right
for you.
</P>
<P>
   Do you really need a dual Super-VHS player? Does your cordless
phone really need to have digital technology built into it?
</P>
<P>
   MySimon has pop-up boxes that will explain any unfamiliar terms,
so by the time it comes up with recommendations, you will have a
good idea what is available and even desirable in your price range.
</P>
<P>
   All MySimon asks in return is some generic information including
nothing more personal than your age and ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   So now that you know there are three kinds of VCRs with three
different types of recording capabilities or that you can get a
cordless phone with more range and more gizmos on it than you ever
thought possible, it's time to see what the experts and people who
actually own the recommended products think.
</P>
<P>
   Continue evaluating products at Productopia
(www.productopia.com). It has the same organizational structure as
MySimon, in which you click on a category and a specific product.
Productopia will give you its best product picks in three criteria:
quality, style and value. Productopia doesn't just show you its
cool picks, it tells you why one DVD player was selected over
another and what other models from a particular manufacturer might
also fit your needs and your budget.
</P>
<P>
   You can also search the customer reviews section to find out
what people who have actually bought that new blender think of
their purchase. You can also follow links to the manufacturer's
home page or search the Web for more information and reviews.
</P>
<P>
   By now you should be armed with enough info about the products
you're interested in to make a truly intelligent purchase of
quality merchandise. However, before you spend a dime, there's just
one more stop on your information mission, Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's right _ Amazon.com. No, you're not going off to buy
anything there, unless of course you want to and the price is
right. The reason you are going to Amazon is for the product
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Most online shoppers and Amazon addicts already know that the
Amazon.com Web site has at least three or four detailed reviews on
everything from the new Harry Potter book to the latest in MP3
players.
</P>
<P>
   Surf the site until you find the item you are thinking of
buying. Some Amazon users write fairly detailed reviews that will
really give you the inside scoop. They'll tell you that a certain
model of Panasonic VCR is pretty noisy and some cordless phones,
while outfitted with the newest features, make the process of
placing a simple call or storing a number next to impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The entire online comparison shopping process shouldn't take
more than an hour or two if you visit every site and really delve
into the process. The result of all this free online research is
that you will become a smarter consumer ready to make an
intelligent purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Or you may decide that the old VCR is good enough for now.
Either way, a little knowledge goes a long way.

 &HT;    Many Georgians have new Hispanic neighbors _ let's learn more
about them
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're old enough to read this, then it's safe to
say that a lot more Hispanics live in Georgia today than when you
were born. In fact, the number of Hispanics in the state has
doubled in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   So who is ``Hispanic''?
</P>
<P>
   That term refers to people who were born in Latin America or
whose parents or grandparents were born there. Most speak Spanish.
Latin America is made up of more than 20 countries south of the
United States _ countries such as Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Cuba
and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of Hispanics began moving to Georgia in the early 1990s.
Estimates of Georgia's Hispanic population differ greatly,
depending on whom you ask. The U.S. Census Bureau says it's about
220,000. The Center for Applied Research in Anthropology says it's
about 480,000. Georgia has about 7.8 million residents total.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanics come to Georgia to work. Many help build new
houses and businesses in metro Atlanta. Others open stores and
restaurants. In other parts of Georgia, Hispanics work in carpet
factories and chicken plants.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the grown-ups brought families with them. The number of
Hispanic boys and girls in Georgia schools has increased to nearly
46,000 last year from 34,000 three years ago. (Even so, only three
of every 100 students in Georgia schools are Hispanic.)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Hispanic children have a tough time adjusting to life
in Georgia. Some are learning English in addition to studying other
subjects. Some immigrants in American schools for the first time
must figure out what to do in the cafeteria _ how much food to
take, where to get it, how much it costs _ and how to ask
permission to go to the restroom.
</P>
<P>
   You might be confused, too, if your parents moved you to a
foreign country and enrolled you in a school with its own rules for
catching the bus, going to recess and eating lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Most Hispanics in Georgia are from Mexico. Some came here
straight from that country. Others moved here from states with
large Hispanic populations such as California, Texas or Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Their arrival is changing Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   You can see the changes when you turn on the television or go to
the grocery store. A lot of houses in metro Atlanta have
televisions that receive one or two cable channels that air
cartoons, sports and other shows in Spanish. And lots of grocery
stores have started to sell foods and drinks that are popular in
Latin America, such as corn tortillas and fruit-flavored sodas. You
also may notice more signs in Spanish all around Atlanta.

 &HT;    Sen. Coverdell dies
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgians mourned the death of their senior U.S.
senator last week. Services were held Saturday in Atlanta for Paul
Coverdell (right), 61. The Republican senator died Tuesday at
Piedmont Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had operated on his brain the day before to relieve
swelling caused by a stroke. A stroke happens when the blood flow
to some part of the brain is greatly reduced or when there is
bleeding in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was one of the top Republican leaders in the U.S.
Senate. Senators in both political parties said he was a tireless
worker. He also worked closely with Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
presidential campaign. He would have played a key role in next
week's Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was active in politics for about 30 years. He was
first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992. The senator is survived
by his wife, Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   A special election will be held in November to fill Coverdell's
seat. Gov. Roy Barnes can pick someone to fill that seat until the
election is held.
</P>
<P>
   PEACE TALKS CONTINUE
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat stayed on at Camp David in Maryland after peace talks nearly
broke down last week. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
has been meeting with each leader to try to move the talks forward.
They remain divided on issues such as creating a completely
independent Palestinian state and who will control certain
neighborhoods in the Israeli capital, Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Barak indicated that he might be willing to give
up some control of the Arab sections of East Jerusalem.
Palestinians have wanted those neighborhoods returned since Israel
took them over in the 1967 Israeli-Arab war. But this potential
compromise has its problems. Palestinians in East Jerusalem fear
that they could lose their jobs, Israeli medical benefits and
access to various areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
   FASTER THAN SPEEDING LIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Albert Einstein may have gotten something wrong. The famous
scientist's ``theory of relativity'' says that nothing can travel
faster than light in a vacuum, or empty space. That is really,
really fast _ about 186,000 miles per second. But scientists in New
Jersey have found a way to break the light speed barrier, at least
in a laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   They used a glass chamber filled with a chemical vapor, instead
of a vacuum. They sent a pulse of laser light through it. The light
left the chamber before it finished entering it. The scientists say
the beginning of the pulse has all the information it needs to
produce the light on the other end. So the entire laser pulse
doesn't have to enter the chamber for it to appear on the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   But don't start thinking that you could travel through time
because of this discovery. The ability to exceed the speed of light
is limited to things that have no mass, such as light waves. Right
now, it's just a really cool experiment, though scientists hope
they can find a use for it, such as making computers work faster.

 &HT;    Receiving offensive e-mail no joking matter to many
 &HT;    By Anne Meyers

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On a recent trip we stayed with friends. My girlfriend
was showing me her computer, and an e-mail joke appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The joke contained references to drunkenness, adultery and
public indecency. It was not a very funny joke and seemed even more
tasteless considering the source was a 15-year-old relative.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail prompted a conversation about the unwanted e-mails
that she receives from friends. She described one e-mail with
cartoon images of President Clinton involved in unpresidential
activities and another e-mail with naked men in baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   The bad jokes put her in an awkward position. Should she ask the
senders to refrain from sending jokes, or should she just delete
them without insulting anyone?
</P>
<P>
   I believe she should request to be taken off her friend's and
family's joke mailing lists. Why should anyone feel obligated to
accept unwanted and offensive e-mails? This computer, like many
family computers, is shared among the two adults in the home and a
grade-schooler. Her daughter does not need the added education
provided in these e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Bad jokes traveling through cyberspace end up in businesses as
well as homes. Many people complain about receiving these offensive
e-mails at their work addresses.
</P>
<P>
   These jokes are more alarming to some computer users than spam
because they know the senders. They should also be easier to
eliminate than mass mailings.
</P>
<P>
   There should be required cyber-education to tame the reckless in
cyberspace. One key lesson would be to treat your e-mails as if
they were your conversation. Would you walk into a luncheon with
friends and pass around cartoons of naked men? Would you put them
in envelopes and send them through the U.S. Postal Service? Why
would you e-mail them? Would you tell dirty jokes at the
playground? Why would you send them to those same people from your
home computer?
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect other drivers to observe the rules of the road, and
the same is true as we travel through cyberspace,'' according to
LearntheNet (www.learnthenet.com) on its netiquette page.
</P>
<P>
   Netiquette, or etiquette for the Internet, should begin with
basic courtesies. E-mail users should not waste time and space
sending unwanted messages. Senders should refrain from mailing
dirty jokes to every e-mail address they know.
</P>
<P>
   The inappropriate use of e-mail is growing, and someone ought to
tell computer users to follow a decent code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   There are many Web sites with advice on Internet etiquette,
including www.albion.com/netiquette/introduction.html.
</P>
<P>
   I have asked to be removed from these lists and have maintained
relationships with the jokesters. Tell your friends how much you
enjoy their actual conversation. Then ask them to take you off the
jokes, prayers or other nonsense lists if you do not wish to be
included. Good friends will find a better way to communicate with
you.

mailing lists or read them at Web sites. The Jokester's joke list

happens they'll wish they were dead.

<TEXT>
the Alps in a teetering bus, cheering on packs of professional
cyclists jockeying for position at 50 miles an hour, Gail
Sonnenberg has one thing in mind: increasing sales at the United
States Postal Service.
<P>
   As senior vice president of sales for the quasi-independent
agency, Sonnenberg began overseeing its sponsorship of the United
States cycling team in 1997. That was just as Lance Armstrong
emerged from his bout with cancer to join the squad _ whose
uniforms are emblazoned with the Postal Service logo.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sonnenberg, based in Arlington, Va., treks to races in this
country and abroad, drumming up new business _ especially from the
team's many other corporate backers. ``Like any other sponsorship,
it's about building our brand,'' she said last week over the blare
of loudspeakers announcing that the team still had the lead in the
Tour de France, which ends Sunday. ``This is not something we do
because it feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Postal Service landed the title sponsorship for the
team in 1996, it hoped to grab international business away from
competitors who operate overseas, where cycling is adored. But the
team's success _ last year, it was the first American squad to win
the Tour de France _ has also been a point of pride at the post
office, a place historically short on morale.
</P>
<P>
   The tour gives Sonnenberg access to executives of sponsors like
Nike and Bike.com _ companies whose online sales can be shipped
through the post office _ as well as Visa, which does much of its
marketing by mail. In 1999, relationships with sponsors brought the
post office $10 million, she said, more than offsetting the cost of
being the team's title sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   After the victory last year, the Postal Service slapped its logo
on biking paraphernalia and started selling it over the Internet.
But that extra revenue may pale in comparison with the exposure
that its best-known cyclist, Armstrong, brings to an otherwise
banal brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like traveling with the Beatles,'' Sonnenberg said,
referring to the crowds that encircle Armstrong at races. ``This
was an awfully lucky venture for us.''

 &HT;    
 By KAREN WRIGHT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    There's a lonesome outpost in the Alaskan interior where
scientists work in wool slippers and all-nighters are standard
procedure, where sunlight is scorned and darkness cherished for the
promises it holds.
 &HT;    That outpost is the science center at the Poker Flat Research
Range, a rocket-launching facility in the hills 30 miles northeast
of Fairbanks. Poker Flat is one of the world's premier centers for
studies of the aurora borealis, the electromagnetic light show that
graces the subarctic firmament almost every night of the year.
 &HT;    Perched on top of a low rise with a uniform view of sky, snow
and spruce, the center sometimes teems with researchers. Tonight,
though, it's the regulars from the Geophysical Institute of the
University of Alaska at Fairbanks. They'll while away the wee hours
swapping stories, watching movies, trading computer tips and
waiting for a phantom stream of light.
 &HT;    At peak aurora season, fanatics such as Hans Nielsen, a
fiftysomething Dane, keep vigil in this place every night for weeks
on end.
 &HT;    ``When I get on this schedule, I can't remember one night from
the next,'' he confesses. ``It all becomes a blur.''
 &HT;    Not that he's complaining. Like most of his colleagues, Nielsen
has a special fondness for the northern lights.
 &HT;    In the 1950s, scientists began to understand that the aurora
borealis and its southern conjugate, the aurora australis, are
generated by the interaction of charged particles streaming from
the sun and the magnetic field that surrounds Earth.
 &HT;    The geomagnetic field deflects most of the deadly particle
stream, but in doing so it gets swept out into a comet-shaped
envelope, called the magnetosphere, in which some of the particles
are trapped. Electromagnetic forces energize the trapped particles
and draw them down into Earth's atmosphere at the polar regions,
where they collide with atoms and molecules of gas, producing
light.
 &HT;    No one knows what processes spawn the many guises of the
northern lights _ the rays and arcs, the folds and filaments, the
patches and spirals, the diffuse, pulsating veils. It's still not
clear what factors collude to produce auroral substorms, the
bright, dynamic global displays that create some of the aurora's
most spectacular visual effects.
 &HT;    Most important, experts still can't predict exactly when the
lights will appear. Despite decades of sophisticated studies and
hordes of high-tech gadgetry, auroral prediction remains a practice
that is part plasma physics, part atmospheric science and part
voodoo.
 &HT;    And that shortcoming has become a bit of a problem. Although the
vagaries of the northern lights may not at first glance seem a
matter of critical import, the aurora is a key indicator of
solar-terrestrial interactions, better known as space weather. And
space weather can pack walloping storms that threaten earthlings
and some of their favorite artifacts.
 &HT;    Space weather is conjured by the solar wind, the plasma stream
of charged particles and magnetism that flows continuously from the
sun. When disturbances such as flares erupt on the sun's surface,
the solar wind goes to gale force, prompting pandemonium in the
magnetosphere, particle showers in the upper atmosphere and surges
of current with effects that reach all the way down to the ground.
 &HT;    That sort of high-energy chaos makes for great auroras, but it
can also play havoc with the radio communications, radar systems,
power transmission lines, telephone cables and satellites on which
humanity grows more dependent every day.
 &HT;    An onslaught of charged particles in space can disable
satellites by damaging solar-cell panels and altering digital
signals. Currents induced by the solar wind's fluctuating magnetic
fields can provoke heating and expansion of Earth's upper
atmosphere, dragging down low-flying satellites.
 &HT;    One of the most stunning auroral substorms in recent history has
been blamed for a nine-hour-long power outage that darkened all of
Quebec.
 &HT;    Auroral displays can also disrupt the propagation of radio waves
by changing the electrical properties of the upper atmosphere.
Currents of electricity in auroras 60 miles overhead are believed
to have caused corrosion in oil pipelines, such as the
Trans-Alaska.
 &HT;    With hundreds of telecommunications satellites in orbit and a
way of life sustained by electrical power and oil, the developed
world is more vulnerable than ever before to the hiccups of our
neighboring star.
 &HT;    Small wonder, then, that space-weather prediction has become a
top priority on the nation's research agenda. And with the sun so
close to another solar maximum _ the peak of its 11-year cycle of
activity _ fans of the aurora and of high technology alike are
anticipating some fireworks.
 &HT;    On the second floor of the science center, banks of monitors,
keyboards and computer screens provide links to satellites and
ground sensors near and far.
 &HT;    One screen displays the feed from the Advanced Composition
Explorer, a satellite parked 930,000 miles sunward that detects
perturbations in the solar wind an hour before it gets to our
magnetosphere.
 &HT;    On another screen, graphs generated by the Earth-orbiting GOES
satellite chart the energy stored in the magnetosphere as a result
of interactions with the solar wind. Readings from ground-based
magnetometers relay information about electromagnetic currents in
the upper atmosphere. Should the aurora make an appearance, another
ground-based device called a photometer will record the brightness
of different colors of light in one slice of sky.
 &HT;    And on the science-center rooftop, under a Plexiglas dome, sits
a low-light-level video camera with a fish-eye lens that takes in
the entire sky. Images from this all-sky camera are transmitted
live to every room in the science center, where they show up on
monitors as a black-and-white disk, with black being sky and white
being stars, clouds or aurora.
 &HT;    As Nielsen and his colleague Dirk Lummerzheim arrive at Poker
Flat during a clear Tuesday twilight recently, the first thing they
look for is the all-sky monitor in the kitchen. The monitor shows a
narrow white band at the bottom of the disk _ which, confusingly,
corresponds to the northern horizon.
 &HT;    ``When it's really good, the whole thing gets white,'' says
Lummerzheim, nodding in the direction of the monitor.
 &HT;    Also keeping an eye on the kitchen all-sky is Bob Eather, a
former atmospheric physicist turned filmmaker who lives in
Brookline, Mass. He's hoping to score some footage for an IMAX
movie on the solar maximum.
 &HT;    Poker Flat lies under the auroral zone, a doughnut-shaped
expanse of sky around Earth's geomagnetic pole near Thule,
Greenland. The zone occurs where Earth's magnetic field lines
converge upon the atmosphere as they loop around the planet from
the southern geomagnetic pole to the northern one (there's a
southern auroral zone too).
 &HT;    The field lines act as channels for charged particles, mostly
electrons with some protons mixed in, moving from the magnetosphere
into the ionosphere, the near-vacuumlike layer of charged particles
that reflects radio waves and is one of the outermost blankets of
atmospheric gases. Because the same electromagnetic processes drive
the flow of particles to the northern and southern poles, auroras
tend to happen simultaneously in both hemispheres.
 &HT;    But auroras are not created equal. Magnetic field lines can get
warped, Lummerzheim explains, by interactions with the solar wind.
That's why the aurora borealis hugs the northern horizon when it's
quiescent; when it becomes more active, the aurora expands to lower
latitudes, sometimes spreading as far south as Mexico. As it moves
over greater areas, it becomes brighter, more restless and more
colorful.
 &HT;    At Poker Flat, the situation has been ``building'' for hours,
with little to show for it. Yet all the portents and omens persist.
So the equipment stays on standby, while Nielsen works out a
software glitch and Lummerzheim catches up on some reading.
 &HT;    Then suddenly, just before midnight, the aurora takes off.
Without preamble the all-sky lights up, and the experts, after
checking their instruments, hasten to the observation room like
eager schoolchildren.
 &HT;    The sparkling firmament writhes with seven gray-green bands that
snake from east to west and stack up north to south. On the ground,
Eather forges out into the cold to man his IMAX camera.
 &HT;    The aurora drops hints of red along its lower edges, then gently
pulses as its bands begin to diffuse. It doesn't last more than a
few minutes, and Lummerzheim maintains that it rates only a five on
a scale from one to 10.
 &HT;    But the display is enough to energize its not-so-tireless
devotees for the next few hours. At this time of year, even the
unadorned darkness seems precious, for in April Alaskan skies begin
to blaze with round-the-clock sunlight, and auroral physicists are
out of business.
 &HT;    Ultimately, and inexplicably, tonight's aurora will disappoint,
retreating to the north and glowing dimly there despite the hopeful
vigilance of the Poker Flat crew. And so finally, at 3:30 a.m.,
there's a general agreement to pack it in.
 &HT;    ``Well, tomorrow is another night,'' Nielsen says.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The intern had already signed off on the chart when I got to the
room. He stood proudly over his work: seven stitches.
 &HT;    ``How'd she do that?'' I asked him.
 &HT;    The 16-year-old patient answered: ``I cut it on the edge of a
garbage can. I was putting the trash out.''
 &HT;    ``No, you didn't,'' I said.
 &HT;    The intern looked up, startled. The girl turned her face away.
 &HT;    ``Look at that cut,'' I said, folding my arms in front of me.
 &HT;    The bewildered intern peered at it again. An inch and a half
long, the cut traced a short course along the underside of the
girl's right forearm. Another, well-healed scar nearby, almost
twice as long, ended just before her palm crease. The girl turned
her hand over to hide the cut and revealed her fingernails, green
with polish, bitten down to the quick.
 &HT;    ``What am I worried about?'' I quizzed the intern.
 &HT;    ``Infection?'' he asked.
 &HT;    ``She needs to be seen by a specialist,'' I said. ``Tell me
which specialist.''
 &HT;    He doubtfully guessed: ``Orthopedics?''
 &HT;    I turned to the girl. ``Honey, who's your psychiatrist?''
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong.''
 &HT;    Now it was my turn to be at a loss. Dr. Pong had died recently.
He had been a wonderful psychiatrist, but three weeks earlier, he
had checked himself into a motel on the south side of town and then
taken a massive overdose of pain relievers. They found him two days
later. It was a tragedy. What were we to tell his patients? His
death even shook the hardened emergency-room staff.
 &HT;    ``OK,'' I said, ``the specialist we need to call is a
psychiatrist. Now, what's the other important question to ask?''
 &HT;    The intern shook his head.
 &HT;    ``Are you right- or left-handed?'' I asked the girl. She
shrugged. ``You're right-handed, aren't you?'' She shrugged again.
 &HT;    I turned back to the intern. ``Why is that important?'' I
reached down and slowly pulled the sleeve up on the girl's left
forearm. The intern stared, his mouth ajar.
 &HT;    Her arm was a maze of scars. Lines crisscrossed every way.
Short, thick scars and great long gashes lined with suture marks
ran her forearm's entire length.
 &HT;    ``You did that?'' whispered the intern.
 &HT;    The girl looked away, embarrassed and proud. Now it was the
intern's turn to ask the pertinent questions. ``Why?''
 &HT;    ``I dunno,'' said the girl.
 &HT;    We needed to call for her chart, but I knew what it would
contain. She would have been diagnosed as borderline, as in
borderline personality disorder. Self-inflicted injuries are a
common feature of this psychiatric syndrome.
 &HT;    Borderlines live in a no-man's-land where features of cognitive
disorders _ disorders of thinking, such as schizophrenia _ overlap
with features of mood disorders, such as depression.
 &HT;    Many health-care workers who deal with borderlines feel their
disorder combines the worst features of cognitive and affective
disorders. The patients are extremely problematic to treat _
unpredictable, manipulative and exasperating. Treatment usually
combines both therapy and a medication such as Prozac or Zoloft.
 &HT;    Not all patients who cut themselves are borderlines. Some
otherwise well-functioning people use the pain of a cut and the
sight of blood as a way to cope with an emotional problem. Somehow
it seems to provide a temporary relief from the inner turmoil they
feel.
 &HT;    And many borderline patients ``dissociate,'' removing
themselves, body and soul, from the world. They are very difficult
to treat. After all, how do you talk with someone about something
he did when he wasn't there?
 &HT;    I squatted down so that I could look at my patient from a
nonthreatening position.
 &HT;    ``Tell us what happened today,'' I said, as gently as I could.
She shrugged. ``Problems lately?'' She shook her head. ``What's
going on at home?'' I asked her. Her shoulders started to shake.
She looked away, trying not to cry. ``Who's at home with you?''
``My brother and my mother.'' ``How are they doing?'' She shrugged.
``They're OK.'' No spark there. ``You go to high school?'' She
looked at me. ``It's summer vacation,'' she said. I tried again.
``You have a boyfriend?'' She looked away, somehow managing to look
both tearful and bored.
 &HT;    The intern had asked ``why?'' I thought about what I usually
tell residents about borderlines. I thought about self-mutilation,
dissociation, cutting. I had to ask myself: In all honesty, how
could that be a comfort?
 &HT;    Then a thought occurred to me. It was so obvious I felt like an
idiot.
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong,'' I said. She stopped looking bored and started to
cry in earnest. ``He left me,'' she said. There was that same
question: Why?
 &HT;    Dr. Pong was married to an anesthesiologist, a lovely woman;
they had three kids. He had a good practice, and his patients
adored him. What dark place had he sheltered within, invisible to
us? How could all of us who lived right beside him, talked to him a
half dozen times a day, admitted patients to him _ how could we all
be so oblivious?
 &HT;    He had been on call that weekend. We had tried to reach him all
day Saturday and then again on Sunday. We ended up calling another
staff psychiatrist to admit the patients. Monday afternoon, while
she was working in surgery, his wife got the news. Eventually it
filtered down to us in everyday life's matter-of-fact indifference
to tragedy. Dr. Pong, we were told, would not be taking calls this
week. We were to call another psychiatrist.
 &HT;    I thought of his children, his patients, this patient. Once upon
a time, this girl probably couldn't see an inch beyond her own pain
and suffering. Dr. Pong had given her, perhaps, a tenuous
connection to other people, to the rest of the world, and with that
he brought all the joys of such connections _ and all the pain.
 &HT;    I stood up, trying to find comforting words. I thought again of
the explanations I always give the residents about cutting and its
paradoxical relief of tension. Then the causes: sexual abuse, poor
parenting. But can we ever explain anything? Do we really have
reasons or just rationales?
 &HT;    To be honest with myself, I would have to confess that no matter
how much I might try, I could never really pick out the path that
leads a patient from childhood to this place. If I were honest, I
would have to confess that other than knowing a few buzzwords, I
was as clueless as the intern.
 &HT;    He was standing to the side, shaking his head at his own
stupidity. I knew that feeling. I had been there many times myself.
 &HT;    I left the patient to the intern. He gathered himself up and
stepped closer to her bedside. He was the kind of person who felt
terrible when he made mistakes that might hurt a patient. It was a
feeling that would make him a first-class physician someday.
 &HT;    The two of us crossed paths on the way to the door.
 &HT;    ``By the way,'' I whispered to him. ``Great job on the
sutures.''

 &HT;    
 By KAREN WRIGHT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    There's a lonesome outpost in the Alaskan interior where
scientists work in wool slippers and all-nighters are standard
procedure, where sunlight is scorned and darkness cherished for the
promises it holds.
 &HT;    That outpost is the science center at the Poker Flat Research
Range, a rocket-launching facility in the hills 30 miles northeast
of Fairbanks. Poker Flat is one of the world's premier centers for
studies of the aurora borealis, the electromagnetic light show that
graces the subarctic firmament almost every night of the year.
 &HT;    Perched on top of a low rise with a uniform view of sky, snow
and spruce, the center sometimes teems with researchers. Tonight,
though, it's the regulars from the Geophysical Institute of the
University of Alaska at Fairbanks. They'll while away the wee hours
swapping stories, watching movies, trading computer tips and
waiting for a phantom stream of light.
 &HT;    At peak aurora season, fanatics such as Hans Nielsen, a
fiftysomething Dane, keep vigil in this place every night for weeks
on end.
 &HT;    ``When I get on this schedule, I can't remember one night from
the next,'' he confesses. ``It all becomes a blur.''
 &HT;    Not that he's complaining. Like most of his colleagues, Nielsen
has a special fondness for the northern lights.
 &HT;    In the 1950s, scientists began to understand that the aurora
borealis and its southern conjugate, the aurora australis, are
generated by the interaction of charged particles streaming from
the sun and the magnetic field that surrounds Earth.
 &HT;    The geomagnetic field deflects most of the deadly particle
stream, but in doing so it gets swept out into a comet-shaped
envelope, called the magnetosphere, in which some of the particles
are trapped. Electromagnetic forces energize the trapped particles
and draw them down into Earth's atmosphere at the polar regions,
where they collide with atoms and molecules of gas, producing
light.
 &HT;    No one knows what processes spawn the many guises of the
northern lights _ the rays and arcs, the folds and filaments, the
patches and spirals, the diffuse, pulsating veils. It's still not
clear what factors collude to produce auroral substorms, the
bright, dynamic global displays that create some of the aurora's
most spectacular visual effects.
 &HT;    Most important, experts still can't predict exactly when the
lights will appear. Despite decades of sophisticated studies and
hordes of high-tech gadgetry, auroral prediction remains a practice
that is part plasma physics, part atmospheric science and part
voodoo.
 &HT;    And that shortcoming has become a bit of a problem. Although the
vagaries of the northern lights may not at first glance seem a
matter of critical import, the aurora is a key indicator of
solar-terrestrial interactions, better known as space weather. And
space weather can pack walloping storms that threaten earthlings
and some of their favorite artifacts.
 &HT;    Space weather is conjured by the solar wind, the plasma stream
of charged particles and magnetism that flows continuously from the
sun. When disturbances such as flares erupt on the sun's surface,
the solar wind goes to gale force, prompting pandemonium in the
magnetosphere, particle showers in the upper atmosphere and surges
of current with effects that reach all the way down to the ground.
 &HT;    That sort of high-energy chaos makes for great auroras, but it
can also play havoc with the radio communications, radar systems,
power transmission lines, telephone cables and satellites on which
humanity grows more dependent every day.
 &HT;    An onslaught of charged particles in space can disable
satellites by damaging solar-cell panels and altering digital
signals. Currents induced by the solar wind's fluctuating magnetic
fields can provoke heating and expansion of Earth's upper
atmosphere, dragging down low-flying satellites.
 &HT;    One of the most stunning auroral substorms in recent history has
been blamed for a nine-hour-long power outage that darkened all of
Quebec.
 &HT;    Auroral displays can also disrupt the propagation of radio waves
by changing the electrical properties of the upper atmosphere.
Currents of electricity in auroras 60 miles overhead are believed
to have caused corrosion in oil pipelines, such as the
Trans-Alaska.
 &HT;    With hundreds of telecommunications satellites in orbit and a
way of life sustained by electrical power and oil, the developed
world is more vulnerable than ever before to the hiccups of our
neighboring star.
 &HT;    Small wonder, then, that space-weather prediction has become a
top priority on the nation's research agenda. And with the sun so
close to another solar maximum _ the peak of its 11-year cycle of
activity _ fans of the aurora and of high technology alike are
anticipating some fireworks.
 &HT;    On the second floor of the science center, banks of monitors,
keyboards and computer screens provide links to satellites and
ground sensors near and far.
 &HT;    One screen displays the feed from the Advanced Composition
Explorer, a satellite parked 930,000 miles sunward that detects
perturbations in the solar wind an hour before it gets to our
magnetosphere.
 &HT;    On another screen, graphs generated by the Earth-orbiting GOES
satellite chart the energy stored in the magnetosphere as a result
of interactions with the solar wind. Readings from ground-based
magnetometers relay information about electromagnetic currents in
the upper atmosphere. Should the aurora make an appearance, another
ground-based device called a photometer will record the brightness
of different colors of light in one slice of sky.
 &HT;    And on the science-center rooftop, under a Plexiglas dome, sits
a low-light-level video camera with a fish-eye lens that takes in
the entire sky. Images from this all-sky camera are transmitted
live to every room in the science center, where they show up on
monitors as a black-and-white disk, with black being sky and white
being stars, clouds or aurora.
 &HT;    As Nielsen and his colleague Dirk Lummerzheim arrive at Poker
Flat during a clear Tuesday twilight recently, the first thing they
look for is the all-sky monitor in the kitchen. The monitor shows a
narrow white band at the bottom of the disk _ which, confusingly,
corresponds to the northern horizon.
 &HT;    ``When it's really good, the whole thing gets white,'' says
Lummerzheim, nodding in the direction of the monitor.
 &HT;    Also keeping an eye on the kitchen all-sky is Bob Eather, a
former atmospheric physicist turned filmmaker who lives in
Brookline, Mass. He's hoping to score some footage for an IMAX
movie on the solar maximum.
 &HT;    Poker Flat lies under the auroral zone, a doughnut-shaped
expanse of sky around Earth's geomagnetic pole near Thule,
Greenland. The zone occurs where Earth's magnetic field lines
converge upon the atmosphere as they loop around the planet from
the southern geomagnetic pole to the northern one (there's a
southern auroral zone too).
 &HT;    The field lines act as channels for charged particles, mostly
electrons with some protons mixed in, moving from the magnetosphere
into the ionosphere, the near-vacuumlike layer of charged particles
that reflects radio waves and is one of the outermost blankets of
atmospheric gases. Because the same electromagnetic processes drive
the flow of particles to the northern and southern poles, auroras
tend to happen simultaneously in both hemispheres.
 &HT;    But auroras are not created equal. Magnetic field lines can get
warped, Lummerzheim explains, by interactions with the solar wind.
That's why the aurora borealis hugs the northern horizon when it's
quiescent; when it becomes more active, the aurora expands to lower
latitudes, sometimes spreading as far south as Mexico. As it moves
over greater areas, it becomes brighter, more restless and more
colorful.
 &HT;    At Poker Flat, the situation has been ``building'' for hours,
with little to show for it. Yet all the portents and omens persist.
So the equipment stays on standby, while Nielsen works out a
software glitch and Lummerzheim catches up on some reading.
 &HT;    Then suddenly, just before midnight, the aurora takes off.
Without preamble the all-sky lights up, and the experts, after
checking their instruments, hasten to the observation room like
eager schoolchildren.
 &HT;    The sparkling firmament writhes with seven gray-green bands that
snake from east to west and stack up north to south. On the ground,
Eather forges out into the cold to man his IMAX camera.
 &HT;    The aurora drops hints of red along its lower edges, then gently
pulses as its bands begin to diffuse. It doesn't last more than a
few minutes, and Lummerzheim maintains that it rates only a five on
a scale from one to 10.
 &HT;    But the display is enough to energize its not-so-tireless
devotees for the next few hours. At this time of year, even the
unadorned darkness seems precious, for in April Alaskan skies begin
to blaze with round-the-clock sunlight, and auroral physicists are
out of business.
 &HT;    Ultimately, and inexplicably, tonight's aurora will disappoint,
retreating to the north and glowing dimly there despite the hopeful
vigilance of the Poker Flat crew. And so finally, at 3:30 a.m.,
there's a general agreement to pack it in.
 &HT;    ``Well, tomorrow is another night,'' Nielsen says.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The intern had already signed off on the chart when I got to the
room. He stood proudly over his work: seven stitches.
 &HT;    ``How'd she do that?'' I asked him.
 &HT;    The 16-year-old patient answered: ``I cut it on the edge of a
garbage can. I was putting the trash out.''
 &HT;    ``No, you didn't,'' I said.
 &HT;    The intern looked up, startled. The girl turned her face away.
 &HT;    ``Look at that cut,'' I said, folding my arms in front of me.
 &HT;    The bewildered intern peered at it again. An inch and a half
long, the cut traced a short course along the underside of the
girl's right forearm. Another, well-healed scar nearby, almost
twice as long, ended just before her palm crease. The girl turned
her hand over to hide the cut and revealed her fingernails, green
with polish, bitten down to the quick.
 &HT;    ``What am I worried about?'' I quizzed the intern.

 By KAREN WRIGHT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    There's a lonesome outpost in the Alaskan interior where
scientists work in wool slippers and all-nighters are standard
procedure, where sunlight is scorned and darkness cherished for the
promises it holds.
 &HT;    That outpost is the science center at the Poker Flat Research
Range, a rocket-launching facility in the hills 30 miles northeast
of Fairbanks. Poker Flat is one of the world's premier centers for
studies of the aurora borealis, the electromagnetic light show that
graces the subarctic firmament almost every night of the year.
 &HT;    Perched on top of a low rise with a uniform view of sky, snow
and spruce, the center sometimes teems with researchers. Tonight,
though, it's the regulars from the Geophysical Institute of the
University of Alaska at Fairbanks. They'll while away the wee hours
swapping stories, watching movies, trading computer tips and
waiting for a phantom stream of light.
 &HT;    At peak aurora season, fanatics such as Hans Nielsen, a
fiftysomething Dane, keep vigil in this place every night for weeks
on end.
 &HT;    ``When I get on this schedule, I can't remember one night from
the next,'' he confesses. ``It all becomes a blur.''
 &HT;    Not that he's complaining. Like most of his colleagues, Nielsen
has a special fondness for the northern lights.
 &HT;    In the 1950s, scientists began to understand that the aurora
borealis and its southern conjugate, the aurora australis, are
generated by the interaction of charged particles streaming from
the sun and the magnetic field that surrounds Earth.
 &HT;    The geomagnetic field deflects most of the deadly particle
stream, but in doing so it gets swept out into a comet-shaped
envelope, called the magnetosphere, in which some of the particles
are trapped. Electromagnetic forces energize the trapped particles
and draw them down into Earth's atmosphere at the polar regions,
where they collide with atoms and molecules of gas, producing
light.
 &HT;    No one knows what processes spawn the many guises of the
northern lights _ the rays and arcs, the folds and filaments, the
patches and spirals, the diffuse, pulsating veils. It's still not
clear what factors collude to produce auroral substorms, the
bright, dynamic global displays that create some of the aurora's
most spectacular visual effects.
 &HT;    Most important, experts still can't predict exactly when the
lights will appear. Despite decades of sophisticated studies and
hordes of high-tech gadgetry, auroral prediction remains a practice
that is part plasma physics, part atmospheric science and part
voodoo.
 &HT;    And that shortcoming has become a bit of a problem. Although the
vagaries of the northern lights may not at first glance seem a
matter of critical import, the aurora is a key indicator of
solar-terrestrial interactions, better known as space weather. And
space weather can pack walloping storms that threaten earthlings
and some of their favorite artifacts.
 &HT;    Space weather is conjured by the solar wind, the plasma stream
of charged particles and magnetism that flows continuously from the
sun. When disturbances such as flares erupt on the sun's surface,
the solar wind goes to gale force, prompting pandemonium in the
magnetosphere, particle showers in the upper atmosphere and surges
of current with effects that reach all the way down to the ground.
 &HT;    That sort of high-energy chaos makes for great auroras, but it
can also play havoc with the radio communications, radar systems,
power transmission lines, telephone cables and satellites on which
humanity grows more dependent every day.
 &HT;    An onslaught of charged particles in space can disable
satellites by damaging solar-cell panels and altering digital
signals. Currents induced by the solar wind's fluctuating magnetic
fields can provoke heating and expansion of Earth's upper
atmosphere, dragging down low-flying satellites.
 &HT;    One of the most stunning auroral substorms in recent history has
been blamed for a nine-hour-long power outage that darkened all of
Quebec.
 &HT;    Auroral displays can also disrupt the propagation of radio waves
by changing the electrical properties of the upper atmosphere.
Currents of electricity in auroras 60 miles overhead are believed
to have caused corrosion in oil pipelines, such as the
Trans-Alaska.
 &HT;    With hundreds of telecommunications satellites in orbit and a
way of life sustained by electrical power and oil, the developed
world is more vulnerable than ever before to the hiccups of our
neighboring star.
 &HT;    Small wonder, then, that space-weather prediction has become a
top priority on the nation's research agenda. And with the sun so
close to another solar maximum _ the peak of its 11-year cycle of
activity _ fans of the aurora and of high technology alike are
anticipating some fireworks.
 &HT;    On the second floor of the science center, banks of monitors,
keyboards and computer screens provide links to satellites and
ground sensors near and far.
 &HT;    One screen displays the feed from the Advanced Composition
Explorer, a satellite parked 930,000 miles sunward that detects
perturbations in the solar wind an hour before it gets to our
magnetosphere.
 &HT;    On another screen, graphs generated by the Earth-orbiting GOES
satellite chart the energy stored in the magnetosphere as a result
of interactions with the solar wind. Readings from ground-based
magnetometers relay information about electromagnetic currents in
the upper atmosphere. Should the aurora make an appearance, another
ground-based device called a photometer will record the brightness
of different colors of light in one slice of sky.
 &HT;    And on the science-center rooftop, under a Plexiglas dome, sits
a low-light-level video camera with a fish-eye lens that takes in
the entire sky. Images from this all-sky camera are transmitted
live to every room in the science center, where they show up on
monitors as a black-and-white disk, with black being sky and white
being stars, clouds or aurora.
 &HT;    As Nielsen and his colleague Dirk Lummerzheim arrive at Poker
Flat during a clear Tuesday twilight recently, the first thing they
look for is the all-sky monitor in the kitchen. The monitor shows a
narrow white band at the bottom of the disk _ which, confusingly,
corresponds to the northern horizon.
 &HT;    ``When it's really good, the whole thing gets white,'' says
Lummerzheim, nodding in the direction of the monitor.
 &HT;    Also keeping an eye on the kitchen all-sky is Bob Eather, a
former atmospheric physicist turned filmmaker who lives in
Brookline, Mass. He's hoping to score some footage for an IMAX
movie on the solar maximum.
 &HT;    Poker Flat lies under the auroral zone, a doughnut-shaped
expanse of sky around Earth's geomagnetic pole near Thule,
Greenland. The zone occurs where Earth's magnetic field lines
converge upon the atmosphere as they loop around the planet from
the southern geomagnetic pole to the northern one (there's a
southern auroral zone too).
 &HT;    The field lines act as channels for charged particles, mostly
electrons with some protons mixed in, moving from the magnetosphere
into the ionosphere, the near-vacuumlike layer of charged particles
that reflects radio waves and is one of the outermost blankets of
atmospheric gases. Because the same electromagnetic processes drive
the flow of particles to the northern and southern poles, auroras
tend to happen simultaneously in both hemispheres.
 &HT;    But auroras are not created equal. Magnetic field lines can get
warped, Lummerzheim explains, by interactions with the solar wind.
That's why the aurora borealis hugs the northern horizon when it's
quiescent; when it becomes more active, the aurora expands to lower
latitudes, sometimes spreading as far south as Mexico. As it moves
over greater areas, it becomes brighter, more restless and more
colorful.
 &HT;    At Poker Flat, the situation has been ``building'' for hours,
with little to show for it. Yet all the portents and omens persist.
So the equipment stays on standby, while Nielsen works out a
software glitch and Lummerzheim catches up on some reading.
 &HT;    Then suddenly, just before midnight, the aurora takes off.
Without preamble the all-sky lights up, and the experts, after
checking their instruments, hasten to the observation room like
eager schoolchildren.
 &HT;    The sparkling firmament writhes with seven gray-green bands that
snake from east to west and stack up north to south. On the ground,
Eather forges out into the cold to man his IMAX camera.
 &HT;    The aurora drops hints of red along its lower edges, then gently
pulses as its bands begin to diffuse. It doesn't last more than a
few minutes, and Lummerzheim maintains that it rates only a five on
a scale from one to 10.
 &HT;    But the display is enough to energize its not-so-tireless
devotees for the next few hours. At this time of year, even the
unadorned darkness seems precious, for in April Alaskan skies begin
to blaze with round-the-clock sunlight, and auroral physicists are
out of business.
 &HT;    Ultimately, and inexplicably, tonight's aurora will disappoint,
retreating to the north and glowing dimly there despite the hopeful
vigilance of the Poker Flat crew. And so finally, at 3:30 a.m.,
there's a general agreement to pack it in.
 &HT;    ``Well, tomorrow is another night,'' Nielsen says.

 By PAMELA GRIM 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The intern had already signed off on the chart when I got to the
room. He stood proudly over his work: seven stitches.
 &HT;    ``How'd she do that?'' I asked him.
 &HT;    The 16-year-old patient answered: ``I cut it on the edge of a
garbage can. I was putting the trash out.''
 &HT;    ``No, you didn't,'' I said.
 &HT;    The intern looked up, startled. The girl turned her face away.
 &HT;    ``Look at that cut,'' I said, folding my arms in front of me.
 &HT;    The bewildered intern peered at it again. An inch and a half
long, the cut traced a short course along the underside of the
girl's right forearm. Another, well-healed scar nearby, almost
twice as long, ended just before her palm crease. The girl turned
her hand over to hide the cut and revealed her fingernails, green
with polish, bitten down to the quick.
 &HT;    ``What am I worried about?'' I quizzed the intern.
 &HT;    ``Infection?'' he asked.
 &HT;    ``She needs to be seen by a specialist,'' I said. ``Tell me
which specialist.''
 &HT;    He doubtfully guessed: ``Orthopedics?''
 &HT;    I turned to the girl. ``Honey, who's your psychiatrist?''
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong.''
 &HT;    Now it was my turn to be at a loss. Dr. Pong had died recently.
He had been a wonderful psychiatrist, but three weeks earlier, he
had checked himself into a motel on the south side of town and then
taken a massive overdose of pain relievers. They found him two days
later. It was a tragedy. What were we to tell his patients? His
death even shook the hardened emergency-room staff.
 &HT;    ``OK,'' I said, ``the specialist we need to call is a
psychiatrist. Now, what's the other important question to ask?''
 &HT;    The intern shook his head.
 &HT;    ``Are you right- or left-handed?'' I asked the girl. She
shrugged. ``You're right-handed, aren't you?'' She shrugged again.
 &HT;    I turned back to the intern. ``Why is that important?'' I
reached down and slowly pulled the sleeve up on the girl's left
forearm. The intern stared, his mouth ajar.
 &HT;    Her arm was a maze of scars. Lines crisscrossed every way.
Short, thick scars and great long gashes lined with suture marks
ran her forearm's entire length.
 &HT;    ``You did that?'' whispered the intern.
 &HT;    The girl looked away, embarrassed and proud. Now it was the
intern's turn to ask the pertinent questions. ``Why?''
 &HT;    ``I dunno,'' said the girl.
 &HT;    We needed to call for her chart, but I knew what it would
contain. She would have been diagnosed as borderline, as in
borderline personality disorder. Self-inflicted injuries are a
common feature of this psychiatric syndrome.
 &HT;    Borderlines live in a no-man's-land where features of cognitive
disorders _ disorders of thinking, such as schizophrenia _ overlap
with features of mood disorders, such as depression.
 &HT;    Many health-care workers who deal with borderlines feel their
disorder combines the worst features of cognitive and affective
disorders. The patients are extremely problematic to treat _
unpredictable, manipulative and exasperating. Treatment usually
combines both therapy and a medication such as Prozac or Zoloft.
 &HT;    Not all patients who cut themselves are borderlines. Some
otherwise well-functioning people use the pain of a cut and the
sight of blood as a way to cope with an emotional problem. Somehow
it seems to provide a temporary relief from the inner turmoil they
feel.
 &HT;    And many borderline patients ``dissociate,'' removing
themselves, body and soul, from the world. They are very difficult
to treat. After all, how do you talk with someone about something
he did when he wasn't there?
 &HT;    I squatted down so that I could look at my patient from a
nonthreatening position.
 &HT;    ``Tell us what happened today,'' I said, as gently as I could.
She shrugged. ``Problems lately?'' She shook her head. ``What's
going on at home?'' I asked her. Her shoulders started to shake.
She looked away, trying not to cry. ``Who's at home with you?''
``My brother and my mother.'' ``How are they doing?'' She shrugged.
``They're OK.'' No spark there. ``You go to high school?'' She
looked at me. ``It's summer vacation,'' she said. I tried again.
``You have a boyfriend?'' She looked away, somehow managing to look
both tearful and bored.
 &HT;    The intern had asked ``why?'' I thought about what I usually
tell residents about borderlines. I thought about self-mutilation,
dissociation, cutting. I had to ask myself: In all honesty, how
could that be a comfort?
 &HT;    Then a thought occurred to me. It was so obvious I felt like an
idiot.
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong,'' I said. She stopped looking bored and started to
cry in earnest. ``He left me,'' she said. There was that same
question: Why?
 &HT;    Dr. Pong was married to an anesthesiologist, a lovely woman;
they had three kids. He had a good practice, and his patients
adored him. What dark place had he sheltered within, invisible to
us? How could all of us who lived right beside him, talked to him a
half dozen times a day, admitted patients to him _ how could we all
be so oblivious?
 &HT;    He had been on call that weekend. We had tried to reach him all
day Saturday and then again on Sunday. We ended up calling another
staff psychiatrist to admit the patients. Monday afternoon, while
she was working in surgery, his wife got the news. Eventually it
filtered down to us in everyday life's matter-of-fact indifference
to tragedy. Dr. Pong, we were told, would not be taking calls this
week. We were to call another psychiatrist.
 &HT;    I thought of his children, his patients, this patient. Once upon
a time, this girl probably couldn't see an inch beyond her own pain
and suffering. Dr. Pong had given her, perhaps, a tenuous
connection to other people, to the rest of the world, and with that
he brought all the joys of such connections _ and all the pain.
 &HT;    I stood up, trying to find comforting words. I thought again of
the explanations I always give the residents about cutting and its
paradoxical relief of tension. Then the causes: sexual abuse, poor
parenting. But can we ever explain anything? Do we really have
reasons or just rationales?
 &HT;    To be honest with myself, I would have to confess that no matter
how much I might try, I could never really pick out the path that
leads a patient from childhood to this place. If I were honest, I
would have to confess that other than knowing a few buzzwords, I
was as clueless as the intern.
 &HT;    He was standing to the side, shaking his head at his own
stupidity. I knew that feeling. I had been there many times myself.
 &HT;    I left the patient to the intern. He gathered himself up and
stepped closer to her bedside. He was the kind of person who felt
terrible when he made mistakes that might hurt a patient. It was a
feeling that would make him a first-class physician someday.
 &HT;    The two of us crossed paths on the way to the door.
 &HT;    ``By the way,'' I whispered to him. ``Great job on the
sutures.''
 &HT;

worked on two recent missions of Doctors of the World. Later this
month, Warner Books will publish ``Just Here Trying to Save a Few
Lives,'' her collection of stories about emergency-room medicine.)

over greater areas, it becomes brighter, more restless and more
colorful.
 &HT;    At Poker Flat, the situation has been ``building'' for hours,
with little to show for it. Yet all the portents and omens persist.
So the equipment stays on standby, while Nielsen works out a
software glitch and Lummerzheim catches up on some reading.
 &HT;    Then suddenly, just before midnight, the aurora takes off.
Without preamble the all-sky lights up, and the experts, after
checking their instruments, hasten to the observation room like
eager schoolchildren.
 &HT;    The sparkling firmament writhes with seven gray-green bands that
snake from east to west and stack up north to south. On the ground,
Eather forges out into the cold to man his IMAX camera.
 &HT;    The aurora drops hints of red along its lower edges, then gently
pulses as its bands begin to diffuse. It doesn't last more than a
few minutes, and Lummerzheim maintains that it rates only a five on
a scale from one to 10.
 &HT;    But the display is enough to energize its not-so-tireless
devotees for the next few hours. At this time of year, even the
unadorned darkness seems precious, for in April Alaskan skies begin
to blaze with round-the-clock sunlight, and auroral physicists are
out of business.
 &HT;    Ultimately, and inexplicably, tonight's aurora will disappoint,
retreating to the north and glowing dimly there despite the hopeful
vigilance of the Poker Flat crew. And so finally, at 3:30 a.m.,
there's a general agreement to pack it in.
 &HT;    ``Well, tomorrow is another night,'' Nielsen says.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The intern had already signed off on the chart when I got to the
room. He stood proudly over his work: seven stitches.
 &HT;    ``How'd she do that?'' I asked him.
 &HT;    The 16-year-old patient answered: ``I cut it on the edge of a
garbage can. I was putting the trash out.''
 &HT;    ``No, you didn't,'' I said.
 &HT;    The intern looked up, startled. The girl turned her face away.
 &HT;    ``Look at that cut,'' I said, folding my arms in front of me.
 &HT;    The bewildered intern peered at it again. An inch and a half
long, the cut traced a short course along the underside of the
girl's right forearm. Another, well-healed scar nearby, almost
twice as long, ended just before her palm crease. The girl turned
her hand over to hide the cut and revealed her fingernails, green
with polish, bitten down to the quick.
 &HT;    ``What am I worried about?'' I quizzed the intern.
 &HT;    ``Infection?'' he asked.
 &HT;    ``She needs to be seen by a specialist,'' I said. ``Tell me
which specialist.''
 &HT;    He doubtfully guessed: ``Orthopedics?''
 &HT;    I turned to the girl. ``Honey, who's your psychiatrist?''
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong.''
 &HT;    Now it was my turn to be at a loss. Dr. Pong had died recently.
He had been a wonderful psychiatrist, but three weeks earlier, he
had checked himself into a motel on the south side of town and then
taken a massive overdose of pain relievers. They found him two days
later. It was a tragedy. What were we to tell his patients? His
death even shook the hardened emergency-room staff.
 &HT;    ``OK,'' I said, ``the specialist we need to call is a
psychiatrist. Now, what's the other important question to ask?''
 &HT;    The intern shook his head.
 &HT;    ``Are you right- or left-handed?'' I asked the girl. She
shrugged. ``You're right-handed, aren't you?'' She shrugged again.
 &HT;    I turned back to the intern. ``Why is that important?'' I
reached down and slowly pulled the sleeve up on the girl's left
forearm. The intern stared, his mouth ajar.
 &HT;    Her arm was a maze of scars. Lines crisscrossed every way.
Short, thick scars and great long gashes lined with suture marks
ran her forearm's entire length.
 &HT;    ``You did that?'' whispered the intern.
 &HT;    The girl looked away, embarrassed and proud. Now it was the
intern's turn to ask the pertinent questions. ``Why?''
 &HT;    ``I dunno,'' said the girl.
 &HT;    We needed to call for her chart, but I knew what it would
contain. She would have been diagnosed as borderline, as in
borderline personality disorder. Self-inflicted injuries are a
common feature of this psychiatric syndrome.
 &HT;    Borderlines live in a no-man's-land where features of cognitive
disorders _ disorders of thinking, such as schizophrenia _ overlap
with features of mood disorders, such as depression.
 &HT;    Many health-care workers who deal with borderlines feel their
disorder combines the worst features of cognitive and affective
disorders. The patients are extremely problematic to treat _
unpredictable, manipulative and exasperating. Treatment usually
combines both therapy and a medication such as Prozac or Zoloft.
 &HT;    Not all patients who cut themselves are borderlines. Some
otherwise well-functioning people use the pain of a cut and the
sight of blood as a way to cope with an emotional problem. Somehow
it seems to provide a temporary relief from the inner turmoil they
feel.
 &HT;    And many borderline patients ``dissociate,'' removing
themselves, body and soul, from the world. They are very difficult
to treat. After all, how do you talk with someone about something
he did when he wasn't there?
 &HT;    I squatted down so that I could look at my patient from a
nonthreatening position.
 &HT;    ``Tell us what happened today,'' I said, as gently as I could.
She shrugged. ``Problems lately?'' She shook her head. ``What's
going on at home?'' I asked her. Her shoulders started to shake.
She looked away, trying not to cry. ``Who's at home with you?''
``My brother and my mother.'' ``How are they doing?'' She shrugged.
``They're OK.'' No spark there. ``You go to high school?'' She
looked at me. ``It's summer vacation,'' she said. I tried again.
``You have a boyfriend?'' She looked away, somehow managing to look
both tearful and bored.
 &HT;    The intern had asked ``why?'' I thought about what I usually
tell residents about borderlines. I thought about self-mutilation,
dissociation, cutting. I had to ask myself: In all honesty, how
could that be a comfort?
 &HT;    Then a thought occurred to me. It was so obvious I felt like an
idiot.
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong,'' I said. She stopped looking bored and started to
cry in earnest. ``He left me,'' she said. There was that same
question: Why?
 &HT;    Dr. Pong was married to an anesthesiologist, a lovely woman;
they had three kids. He had a good practice, and his patients
adored him. What dark place had he sheltered within, invisible to
us? How could all of us who lived right beside him, talked to him a
half dozen times a day, admitted patients to him _ how could we all
be so oblivious?
 &HT;    He had been on call that weekend. We had tried to reach him all
day Saturday and then again on Sunday. We ended up calling another
staff psychiatrist to admit the patients. Monday afternoon, while
she was working in surgery, his wife got the news. Eventually it
filtered down to us in everyday life's matter-of-fact indifference
to tragedy. Dr. Pong, we were told, would not be taking calls this
week. We were to call another psychiatrist.
 &HT;    I thought of his children, his patients, this patient. Once upon
a time, this girl probably couldn't see an inch beyond her own pain
and suffering. Dr. Pong had given her, perhaps, a tenuous
connection to other people, to the rest of the world, and with that
he brought all the joys of such connections _ and all the pain.
 &HT;    I stood up, trying to find comforting words. I thought again of
the explanations I always give the residents about cutting and its
paradoxical relief of tension. Then the causes: sexual abuse, poor
parenting. But can we ever explain anything? Do we really have
reasons or just rationales?
 &HT;    To be honest with myself, I would have to confess that no matter
how much I might try, I could never really pick out the path that
leads a patient from childhood to this place. If I were honest, I
would have to confess that other than knowing a few buzzwords, I
was as clueless as the intern.
 &HT;    He was standing to the side, shaking his head at his own
stupidity. I knew that feeling. I had been there many times myself.
 &HT;    I left the patient to the intern. He gathered himself up and
stepped closer to her bedside. He was the kind of person who felt
terrible when he made mistakes that might hurt a patient. It was a
feeling that would make him a first-class physician someday.
 &HT;    The two of us crossed paths on the way to the door.
 &HT;    ``By the way,'' I whispered to him. ``Great job on the
sutures.''

 &HT;    
 By KAREN WRIGHT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    There's a lonesome outpost in the Alaskan interior where
scientists work in wool slippers and all-nighters are standard
procedure, where sunlight is scorned and darkness cherished for the
promises it holds.
 &HT;    That outpost is the science center at the Poker Flat Research
Range, a rocket-launching facility in the hills 30 miles northeast
of Fairbanks. Poker Flat is one of the world's premier centers for
studies of the aurora borealis, the electromagnetic light show that
graces the subarctic firmament almost every night of the year.
 &HT;    Perched on top of a low rise with a uniform view of sky, snow
and spruce, the center sometimes teems with researchers. Tonight,
though, it's the regulars from the Geophysical Institute of the
University of Alaska at Fairbanks. They'll while away the wee hours
swapping stories, watching movies, trading computer tips and
waiting for a phantom stream of light.
 &HT;    At peak aurora season, fanatics such as Hans Nielsen, a
fiftysomething Dane, keep vigil in this place every night for weeks
on end.
 &HT;    ``When I get on this schedule, I can't remember one night from
the next,'' he confesses. ``It all becomes a blur.''
 &HT;    Not that he's complaining. Like most of his colleagues, Nielsen
has a special fondness for the northern lights.
 &HT;    In the 1950s, scientists began to understand that the aurora
borealis and its southern conjugate, the aurora australis, are
generated by the interaction of charged particles streaming from
the sun and the magnetic field that surrounds Earth.
 &HT;    The geomagnetic field deflects most of the deadly particle
stream, but in doing so it gets swept out into a comet-shaped
envelope, called the magnetosphere, in which some of the particles
are trapped. Electromagnetic forces energize the trapped particles
and draw them down into Earth's atmosphere at the polar regions,
where they collide with atoms and molecules of gas, producing
light.
 &HT;    No one knows what processes spawn the many guises of the
northern lights _ the rays and arcs, the folds and filaments, the
patches and spirals, the diffuse, pulsating veils. It's still not
clear what factors collude to produce auroral substorms, the
bright, dynamic global displays that create some of the aurora's
most spectacular visual effects.
 &HT;    Most important, experts still can't predict exactly when the
lights will appear. Despite decades of sophisticated studies and
hordes of high-tech gadgetry, auroral prediction remains a practice
that is part plasma physics, part atmospheric science and part
voodoo.
 &HT;    And that shortcoming has become a bit of a problem. Although the
vagaries of the northern lights may not at first glance seem a
matter of critical import, the aurora is a key indicator of
solar-terrestrial interactions, better known as space weather. And
space weather can pack walloping storms that threaten earthlings
and some of their favorite artifacts.
 &HT;    Space weather is conjured by the solar wind, the plasma stream
of charged particles and magnetism that flows continuously from the
sun. When disturbances such as flares erupt on the sun's surface,
the solar wind goes to gale force, prompting pandemonium in the
magnetosphere, particle showers in the upper atmosphere and surges
of current with effects that reach all the way down to the ground.
 &HT;    That sort of high-energy chaos makes for great auroras, but it
can also play havoc with the radio communications, radar systems,
power transmission lines, telephone cables and satellites on which
humanity grows more dependent every day.
 &HT;    An onslaught of charged particles in space can disable
satellites by damaging solar-cell panels and altering digital
signals. Currents induced by the solar wind's fluctuating magnetic
fields can provoke heating and expansion of Earth's upper
atmosphere, dragging down low-flying satellites.
 &HT;    One of the most stunning auroral substorms in recent history has
been blamed for a nine-hour-long power outage that darkened all of
Quebec.
 &HT;    Auroral displays can also disrupt the propagation of radio waves
by changing the electrical properties of the upper atmosphere.
Currents of electricity in auroras 60 miles overhead are believed
to have caused corrosion in oil pipelines, such as the
Trans-Alaska.
 &HT;    With hundreds of telecommunications satellites in orbit and a
way of life sustained by electrical power and oil, the developed
world is more vulnerable than ever before to the hiccups of our
neighboring star.
 &HT;    Small wonder, then, that space-weather prediction has become a
top priority on the nation's research agenda. And with the sun so
close to another solar maximum _ the peak of its 11-year cycle of
activity _ fans of the aurora and of high technology alike are
anticipating some fireworks.
 &HT;    On the second floor of the science center, banks of monitors,
keyboards and computer screens provide links to satellites and
ground sensors near and far.
 &HT;    One screen displays the feed from the Advanced Composition
Explorer, a satellite parked 930,000 miles sunward that detects
perturbations in the solar wind an hour before it gets to our
magnetosphere.
 &HT;    On another screen, graphs generated by the Earth-orbiting GOES
satellite chart the energy stored in the magnetosphere as a result
of interactions with the solar wind. Readings from ground-based
magnetometers relay information about electromagnetic currents in
the upper atmosphere. Should the aurora make an appearance, another
ground-based device called a photometer will record the brightness
of different colors of light in one slice of sky.
 &HT;    And on the science-center rooftop, under a Plexiglas dome, sits
a low-light-level video camera with a fish-eye lens that takes in
the entire sky. Images from this all-sky camera are transmitted
live to every room in the science center, where they show up on
monitors as a black-and-white disk, with black being sky and white
being stars, clouds or aurora.
 &HT;    As Nielsen and his colleague Dirk Lummerzheim arrive at Poker
Flat during a clear Tuesday twilight recently, the first thing they
look for is the all-sky monitor in the kitchen. The monitor shows a
narrow white band at the bottom of the disk _ which, confusingly,
corresponds to the northern horizon.
 &HT;    ``When it's really good, the whole thing gets white,'' says
Lummerzheim, nodding in the direction of the monitor.
 &HT;    Also keeping an eye on the kitchen all-sky is Bob Eather, a
former atmospheric physicist turned filmmaker who lives in
Brookline, Mass. He's hoping to score some footage for an IMAX
movie on the solar maximum.
 &HT;    Poker Flat lies under the auroral zone, a doughnut-shaped
expanse of sky around Earth's geomagnetic pole near Thule,
Greenland. The zone occurs where Earth's magnetic field lines
converge upon the atmosphere as they loop around the planet from
the southern geomagnetic pole to the northern one (there's a
southern auroral zone too).
 &HT;    The field lines act as channels for charged particles, mostly
electrons with some protons mixed in, moving from the magnetosphere
into the ionosphere, the near-vacuumlike layer of charged particles
that reflects radio waves and is one of the outermost blankets of
atmospheric gases. Because the same electromagnetic processes drive
the flow of particles to the northern and southern poles, auroras
tend to happen simultaneously in both hemispheres.
 &HT;    But auroras are not created equal. Magnetic field lines can get
warped, Lummerzheim explains, by interactions with the solar wind.
That's why the aurora borealis hugs the northern horizon when it's
quiescent; when it becomes more active, the aurora expands to lower
latitudes, sometimes spreading as far south as Mexico. As it moves
over greater areas, it becomes brighter, more restless and more
colorful.
 &HT;    At Poker Flat, the situation has been ``building'' for hours,
with little to show for it. Yet all the portents and omens persist.
So the equipment stays on standby, while Nielsen works out a
software glitch and Lummerzheim catches up on some reading.
 &HT;    Then suddenly, just before midnight, the aurora takes off.
Without preamble the all-sky lights up, and the experts, after
checking their instruments, hasten to the observation room like
eager schoolchildren.
 &HT;    The sparkling firmament writhes with seven gray-green bands that
snake from east to west and stack up north to south. On the ground,
Eather forges out into the cold to man his IMAX camera.
 &HT;    The aurora drops hints of red along its lower edges, then gently
pulses as its bands begin to diffuse. It doesn't last more than a
few minutes, and Lummerzheim maintains that it rates only a five on
a scale from one to 10.
 &HT;    But the display is enough to energize its not-so-tireless
devotees for the next few hours. At this time of year, even the
unadorned darkness seems precious, for in April Alaskan skies begin

 &HT;    ``Tell us what happened today,'' I said, as gently as I could.
She shrugged. ``Problems lately?'' She shook her head. ``What's
going on at home?'' I asked her. Her shoulders started to shake.
She looked away, trying not to cry. ``Who's at home with you?''
``My brother and my mother.'' ``How are they doing?'' She shrugged.
``They're OK.'' No spark there. ``You go to high school?'' She
looked at me. ``It's summer vacation,'' she said. I tried again.
``You have a boyfriend?'' She looked away, somehow managing to look
both tearful and bored.
 &HT;    The intern had asked ``why?'' I thought about what I usually
tell residents about borderlines. I thought about self-mutilation,
dissociation, cutting. I had to ask myself: In all honesty, how
could that be a comfort?
 &HT;    Then a thought occurred to me. It was so obvious I felt like an
idiot.
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong,'' I said. She stopped looking bored and started to
cry in earnest. ``He left me,'' she said. There was that same
question: Why?
 &HT;    Dr. Pong was married to an anesthesiologist, a lovely woman;
they had three kids. He had a good practice, and his patients
adored him. What dark place had he sheltered within, invisible to
us? How could all of us who lived right beside him, talked to him a
half dozen times a day, admitted patients to him _ how could we all
be so oblivious?
 &HT;    He had been on call that weekend. We had tried to reach him all
day Saturday and then again on Sunday. We ended up calling another
staff psychiatrist to admit the patients. Monday afternoon, while
she was working in surgery, his wife got the news. Eventually it
filtered down to us in everyday life's matter-of-fact indifference
to tragedy. Dr. Pong, we were told, would not be taking calls this
week. We were to call another psychiatrist.
 &HT;    I thought of his children, his patients, this patient. Once upon
a time, this girl probably couldn't see an inch beyond her own pain
and suffering. Dr. Pong had given her, perhaps, a tenuous
connection to other people, to the rest of the world, and with that
he brought all the joys of such connections _ and all the pain.
 &HT;    I stood up, trying to find comforting words. I thought again of
the explanations I always give the residents about cutting and its
paradoxical relief of tension. Then the causes: sexual abuse, poor
parenting. But can we ever explain anything? Do we really have
reasons or just rationales?
 &HT;    To be honest with myself, I would have to confess that no matter
how much I might try, I could never really pick out the path that
leads a patient from childhood to this place. If I were honest, I
would have to confess that other than knowing a few buzzwords, I
was as clueless as the intern.
 &HT;    He was standing to the side, shaking his head at his own
stupidity. I knew that feeling. I had been there many times myself.
 &HT;    I left the patient to the intern. He gathered himself up and
stepped closer to her bedside. He was the kind of person who felt
terrible when he made mistakes that might hurt a patient. It was a
feeling that would make him a first-class physician someday.
 &HT;    The two of us crossed paths on the way to the door.
 &HT;    ``By the way,'' I whispered to him. ``Great job on the
sutures.''

 &HT;    
 By KAREN WRIGHT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    There's a lonesome outpost in the Alaskan interior where
scientists work in wool slippers and all-nighters are standard
procedure, where sunlight is scorned and darkness cherished for the
promises it holds.
 &HT;    That outpost is the science center at the Poker Flat Research
Range, a rocket-launching facility in the hills 30 miles northeast
of Fairbanks. Poker Flat is one of the world's premier centers for
studies of the aurora borealis, the electromagnetic light show that
graces the subarctic firmament almost every night of the year.
 &HT;    Perched on top of a low rise with a uniform view of sky, snow
and spruce, the center sometimes teems with researchers. Tonight,
though, it's the regulars from the Geophysical Institute of the
University of Alaska at Fairbanks. They'll while away the wee hours
swapping stories, watching movies, trading computer tips and
waiting for a phantom stream of light.
 &HT;    At peak aurora season, fanatics such as Hans Nielsen, a
fiftysomething Dane, keep vigil in this place every night for weeks
on end.
 &HT;    ``When I get on this schedule, I can't remember one night from
the next,'' he confesses. ``It all becomes a blur.''
 &HT;    Not that he's complaining. Like most of his colleagues, Nielsen
has a special fondness for the northern lights.
 &HT;    In the 1950s, scientists began to understand that the aurora
borealis and its southern conjugate, the aurora australis, are
generated by the interaction of charged particles streaming from
the sun and the magnetic field that surrounds Earth.
 &HT;    The geomagnetic field deflects most of the deadly particle
stream, but in doing so it gets swept out into a comet-shaped
envelope, called the magnetosphere, in which some of the particles
are trapped. Electromagnetic forces energize the trapped particles
and draw them down into Earth's atmosphere at the polar regions,
where they collide with atoms and molecules of gas, producing
light.
 &HT;    No one knows what processes spawn the many guises of the
northern lights _ the rays and arcs, the folds and filaments, the
patches and spirals, the diffuse, pulsating veils. It's still not
clear what factors collude to produce auroral substorms, the
bright, dynamic global displays that create some of the aurora's
most spectacular visual effects.
 &HT;    Most important, experts still can't predict exactly when the
lights will appear. Despite decades of sophisticated studies and
hordes of high-tech gadgetry, auroral prediction remains a practice
that is part plasma physics, part atmospheric science and part
voodoo.
 &HT;    And that shortcoming has become a bit of a problem. Although the
vagaries of the northern lights may not at first glance seem a
matter of critical import, the aurora is a key indicator of
solar-terrestrial interactions, better known as space weather. And
space weather can pack walloping storms that threaten earthlings
and some of their favorite artifacts.
 &HT;    Space weather is conjured by the solar wind, the plasma stream
of charged particles and magnetism that flows continuously from the
sun. When disturbances such as flares erupt on the sun's surface,
the solar wind goes to gale force, prompting pandemonium in the
magnetosphere, particle showers in the upper atmosphere and surges
of current with effects that reach all the way down to the ground.
 &HT;    That sort of high-energy chaos makes for great auroras, but it
can also play havoc with the radio communications, radar systems,
power transmission lines, telephone cables and satellites on which
humanity grows more dependent every day.
 &HT;    An onslaught of charged particles in space can disable
satellites by damaging solar-cell panels and altering digital
signals. Currents induced by the solar wind's fluctuating magnetic
fields can provoke heating and expansion of Earth's upper
atmosphere, dragging down low-flying satellites.
 &HT;    One of the most stunning auroral substorms in recent history has
been blamed for a nine-hour-long power outage that darkened all of
Quebec.
 &HT;    Auroral displays can also disrupt the propagation of radio waves
by changing the electrical properties of the upper atmosphere.
Currents of electricity in auroras 60 miles overhead are believed
to have caused corrosion in oil pipelines, such as the
Trans-Alaska.
 &HT;    With hundreds of telecommunications satellites in orbit and a
way of life sustained by electrical power and oil, the developed
world is more vulnerable than ever before to the hiccups of our
neighboring star.
 &HT;    Small wonder, then, that space-weather prediction has become a
top priority on the nation's research agenda. And with the sun so
close to another solar maximum _ the peak of its 11-year cycle of
activity _ fans of the aurora and of high technology alike are
anticipating some fireworks.
 &HT;    On the second floor of the science center, banks of monitors,
keyboards and computer screens provide links to satellites and
ground sensors near and far.
 &HT;    One screen displays the feed from the Advanced Composition
Explorer, a satellite parked 930,000 miles sunward that detects
perturbations in the solar wind an hour before it gets to our
magnetosphere.
 &HT;    On another screen, graphs generated by the Earth-orbiting GOES
satellite chart the energy stored in the magnetosphere as a result
of interactions with the solar wind. Readings from ground-based
magnetometers relay information about electromagnetic currents in
the upper atmosphere. Should the aurora make an appearance, another
ground-based device called a photometer will record the brightness
of different colors of light in one slice of sky.
 &HT;    And on the science-center rooftop, under a Plexiglas dome, sits
a low-light-level video camera with a fish-eye lens that takes in
the entire sky. Images from this all-sky camera are transmitted
live to every room in the science center, where they show up on
monitors as a black-and-white disk, with black being sky and white
being stars, clouds or aurora.
 &HT;    As Nielsen and his colleague Dirk Lummerzheim arrive at Poker
Flat during a clear Tuesday twilight recently, the first thing they
look for is the all-sky monitor in the kitchen. The monitor shows a
narrow white band at the bottom of the disk _ which, confusingly,
corresponds to the northern horizon.
 &HT;    ``When it's really good, the whole thing gets white,'' says
Lummerzheim, nodding in the direction of the monitor.
 &HT;    Also keeping an eye on the kitchen all-sky is Bob Eather, a
former atmospheric physicist turned filmmaker who lives in
Brookline, Mass. He's hoping to score some footage for an IMAX
movie on the solar maximum.
 &HT;    Poker Flat lies under the auroral zone, a doughnut-shaped
expanse of sky around Earth's geomagnetic pole near Thule,
Greenland. The zone occurs where Earth's magnetic field lines
converge upon the atmosphere as they loop around the planet from
the southern geomagnetic pole to the northern one (there's a
southern auroral zone too).
 &HT;    The field lines act as channels for charged particles, mostly
electrons with some protons mixed in, moving from the magnetosphere
into the ionosphere, the near-vacuumlike layer of charged particles
that reflects radio waves and is one of the outermost blankets of
atmospheric gases. Because the same electromagnetic processes drive
the flow of particles to the northern and southern poles, auroras
tend to happen simultaneously in both hemispheres.
 &HT;    But auroras are not created equal. Magnetic field lines can get
warped, Lummerzheim explains, by interactions with the solar wind.
That's why the aurora borealis hugs the northern horizon when it's
quiescent; when it becomes more active, the aurora expands to lower
latitudes, sometimes spreading as far south as Mexico. As it moves
over greater areas, it becomes brighter, more restless and more
colorful.
 &HT;    At Poker Flat, the situation has been ``building'' for hours,
with little to show for it. Yet all the portents and omens persist.
So the equipment stays on standby, while Nielsen works out a
software glitch and Lummerzheim catches up on some reading.
 &HT;    Then suddenly, just before midnight, the aurora takes off.
Without preamble the all-sky lights up, and the experts, after
checking their instruments, hasten to the observation room like
eager schoolchildren.
 &HT;    The sparkling firmament writhes with seven gray-green bands that
snake from east to west and stack up north to south. On the ground,
Eather forges out into the cold to man his IMAX camera.
 &HT;    The aurora drops hints of red along its lower edges, then gently
pulses as its bands begin to diffuse. It doesn't last more than a
few minutes, and Lummerzheim maintains that it rates only a five on
a scale from one to 10.
 &HT;    But the display is enough to energize its not-so-tireless
devotees for the next few hours. At this time of year, even the
unadorned darkness seems precious, for in April Alaskan skies begin
to blaze with round-the-clock sunlight, and auroral physicists are
out of business.
 &HT;    Ultimately, and inexplicably, tonight's aurora will disappoint,
retreating to the north and glowing dimly there despite the hopeful
vigilance of the Poker Flat crew. And so finally, at 3:30 a.m.,
there's a general agreement to pack it in.
 &HT;    ``Well, tomorrow is another night,'' Nielsen says.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The intern had already signed off on the chart when I got to the
room. He stood proudly over his work: seven stitches.
 &HT;    ``How'd she do that?'' I asked him.
 &HT;    The 16-year-old patient answered: ``I cut it on the edge of a
garbage can. I was putting the trash out.''
 &HT;    ``No, you didn't,'' I said.
 &HT;    The intern looked up, startled. The girl turned her face away.
 &HT;    ``Look at that cut,'' I said, folding my arms in front of me.
 &HT;    The bewildered intern peered at it again. An inch and a half
long, the cut traced a short course along the underside of the
girl's right forearm. Another, well-healed scar nearby, almost
twice as long, ended just before her palm crease. The girl turned
her hand over to hide the cut and revealed her fingernails, green
with polish, bitten down to the quick.
 &HT;    ``What am I worried about?'' I quizzed the intern.
 &HT;    ``Infection?'' he asked.
 &HT;    ``She needs to be seen by a specialist,'' I said. ``Tell me
which specialist.''
 &HT;    He doubtfully guessed: ``Orthopedics?''
 &HT;    I turned to the girl. ``Honey, who's your psychiatrist?''
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong.''
 &HT;    Now it was my turn to be at a loss. Dr. Pong had died recently.
He had been a wonderful psychiatrist, but three weeks earlier, he
had checked himself into a motel on the south side of town and then
taken a massive overdose of pain relievers. They found him two days
later. It was a tragedy. What were we to tell his patients? His
death even shook the hardened emergency-room staff.
 &HT;    ``OK,'' I said, ``the specialist we need to call is a
psychiatrist. Now, what's the other important question to ask?''
 &HT;    The intern shook his head.
 &HT;    ``Are you right- or left-handed?'' I asked the girl. She
shrugged. ``You're right-handed, aren't you?'' She shrugged again.
 &HT;    I turned back to the intern. ``Why is that important?'' I
reached down and slowly pulled the sleeve up on the girl's left
forearm. The intern stared, his mouth ajar.
 &HT;    Her arm was a maze of scars. Lines crisscrossed every way.
Short, thick scars and great long gashes lined with suture marks
ran her forearm's entire length.
 &HT;    ``You did that?'' whispered the intern.
 &HT;    The girl looked away, embarrassed and proud. Now it was the
intern's turn to ask the pertinent questions. ``Why?''
 &HT;    ``I dunno,'' said the girl.
 &HT;    We needed to call for her chart, but I knew what it would
contain. She would have been diagnosed as borderline, as in
borderline personality disorder. Self-inflicted injuries are a
common feature of this psychiatric syndrome.
 &HT;    Borderlines live in a no-man's-land where features of cognitive
disorders _ disorders of thinking, such as schizophrenia _ overlap
with features of mood disorders, such as depression.
 &HT;    Many health-care workers who deal with borderlines feel their
disorder combines the worst features of cognitive and affective
disorders. The patients are extremely problematic to treat _
unpredictable, manipulative and exasperating. Treatment usually
combines both therapy and a medication such as Prozac or Zoloft.
 &HT;    Not all patients who cut themselves are borderlines. Some
otherwise well-functioning people use the pain of a cut and the
sight of blood as a way to cope with an emotional problem. Somehow
it seems to provide a temporary relief from the inner turmoil they
feel.
 &HT;    And many borderline patients ``dissociate,'' removing
themselves, body and soul, from the world. They are very difficult
to treat. After all, how do you talk with someone about something
he did when he wasn't there?
 &HT;    I squatted down so that I could look at my patient from a
nonthreatening position.
 &HT;    ``Tell us what happened today,'' I said, as gently as I could.
She shrugged. ``Problems lately?'' She shook her head. ``What's
going on at home?'' I asked her. Her shoulders started to shake.
She looked away, trying not to cry. ``Who's at home with you?''
``My brother and my mother.'' ``How are they doing?'' She shrugged.
``They're OK.'' No spark there. ``You go to high school?'' She
looked at me. ``It's summer vacation,'' she said. I tried again.
``You have a boyfriend?'' She looked away, somehow managing to look
both tearful and bored.
 &HT;    The intern had asked ``why?'' I thought about what I usually

dissociation, cutting. I had to ask myself: In all honesty, how

half dozen times a day, admitted patients to him _ how could we all
be so oblivious?
 &HT;    He had been on call that weekend. We had tried to reach him all

JOSEPH ENRIGHT, 89; CAPTAIN OF FAMOUS WWII SUBMARINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT S. GREENBERGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Enright, a World War II Navy captain who commanded the
submarine that torpedoed the largest warship ever sunk, died
Thursday in Fairfax, Va. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Enright, who spent his post-Navy career in New England, was
born in North Dakota. He graduated from the US Naval Academy in
1933 and entered the submarine service several years later. In
September 1944, he took command of the USS Archer-Fish.
</P>
<P>
   When the Archer-Fish departed Saipan on Nov. 11, its primary
mission was to rescue downed B-29 pilots. But on the evening of
Nov. 28, the submarine's radar picked up what some crew members
believed at first to be an island. In fact, it was the Shinano, a
Japanese aircraft carrier that weighed at least 60,000 tons and at
the time was the largest ever built.
</P>
<P>
   Once the crew identified the blip on the screen as a ship, the
Archer-Fish gave chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were racing as fast as we could, going over the rated
capacity of both of our engines, trying to keep up,'' recalled Carl
Wilken, who was in charge of one of the engine rooms that night.
``It zigged away from us. When it zigged back, we shot it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Archer-Fish fired six torpedoes, crew members recall. All
six hit their target. A ball of fire climbed up the side of the
Japanese ship and crew members heard a series of explosions as the
ship broke apart and sank.
</P>
<P>
   The Archer-Fish escaped from the encounter unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Mr. Enright's spectacular success, Wilken said, the
captain ``wasn't as aggressive as some of the skippers who are now
on the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked after his boat and his crew, and I think he was
proud of that,'' Wilken said. ``He told the wives of the members of
the crew that their husbands were in good hands and that he'd bring
them back, and he did.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    
 &HT;    BARILOCHE, Argentina _ Legend has it that when U.S. President
Bill Clinton last visited Argentina in 1997, it wasn't economic
issues that topped his agenda. Rather, it was golf at the Llao Llao
Hotel, the country's most exclusive resort and spa.
 &HT;    ``His aides had planned for him to play a few holes in the
afternoon, but when he took a look at the golf course, he canceled
some meetings and a horse ride with Hillary so that he could play a
full 18,'' recalls Guillermo Lavallen, the hotel's general manager.
``I guess he was very satisfied because friends and acquaintances
of his still arrive who only want to play on the course that he
told them so much about.''
 &HT;    Of course, there are more than just 18 reasons to visit the Llao
Llao (pronounced ``jow jow''). About two hours by plane from Buenos
Aires and 20 miles outside of Bariloche, Patagonia's most developed
tourist center, the hotel sits at the hilly junction where the
barren Patagonian desert meets the towering Andean mountains.
 &HT;    The mammoth lodge sits upon a natural slope overlooking the
entrance to Nahuel Huapi National Park, Argentina's oldest and most
treasured. Surrounded by snow-capped peaks, crystal blue lakes and
dense forests of all colors, the hotel holds some of the most
superb alpine views that Patagonia offers. Indeed, the pleasant
scenery and once strong European influence over the area's
architecture and culture has won the Bariloche area the reputation
as Argentina's Switzerland.
 &HT;    The hotel itself is the ideal base from which to explore the
areas pristine wilderness. Among the highlights is a boat trip to
Isla Victoria, a large island settled by an early immigrant family
and that now hosts a nature reserve and park ranger school. Looking
at the robust trunks that overrun the island, one would never
suspect that these seemingly ageless sequoia trees were brought
over as seedlings from California as part of a government-run
experimental nursery in the 1920s.
 &HT;    For those staying at the hotel, there is a first-class spa, an
indoor swimming pool facing the mountains and two restaurants that
feature regional delicacies such as Patagonian lamb and fresh river
trout. There's also, of course, those undulating fairways and
magical surroundings that should keep most golfers _ Tiger Woods
was one recently _ busy during the day.
 &HT;    Adding to the hotel's mystique, however, is its tragic history,
which twice resulted in its collapse, first physically then
financially.
 &HT;    Within a year of the government's 1938 inauguration of the
hotel, it was almost destroyed by a fire. In 1940, it was reopened
with its original exterior woodwork replaced by a safer, stucco
finishing. Over the next three-and-a-half decades, the hotel's
rustic salons, with their wide-open hunting lodge fireplaces and
cypress wood paneling, were host to Argentina's aristocracy and
diplomats.
 &HT;    But in 1976, the hotel was closed again because the government,
in the midst of a military junta, could no longer afford to
maintain its world-class standards given the financial strains of
the era.
 &HT;    After a 15-year hiatus in which the hotel was exposed to
vandalism, robbery and overall neglect, the Llao Llao resumed
operations in 1993 under the guidance of CEI Citicorp Holdings, a
U.S. investment group that was awarded the hotel in payment for its
government junk bonds. Unfamiliar with the hotel business, CEI sold
the hotel in 1997 for US$13 million to IRSA, a Buenos Aires real
estate concern that counts Hungarian-American financier George
Soros as one of its principal investors.
 &HT;    Since then, IRSA has poured millions of dollars to modernize the
hotel's facilities, improve service and add luxury. To accomplish
that goal, IRSA contracted out the hotel's management to the Sutton
Group, long-time managers and part owners of Buenos Aires ritziest
hotel, the Alvear Palace.
 &HT;    Like the Alvear Palace, the Llao Llao is a historic monument
and, as such, its managers have had to respect its original design
as much as possible. One consequence of this is that rooms and
bathrooms tend to be smaller than one might expect from a luxury
hotel. But such minor inconveniences are more than compensated for
by a sharp attention to detail. For example, objects such as
original china, and furniture held for years in storage from the
hotel's `belle epoque,' are constantly being refurbished and rolled
out as decorative elements in the hotel's many suites.
 &HT;    But even such well-intentioned efforts haven't been enough to
fully restore the Llao Llao's former prominence among those with
the pockets deep enough to visit it. The hotel has yet to turn a
profit and its occupancy rate _ 75 percent during the high summer
season and 55 percent the rest of the year _ is well below industry
standards for a hotel of its caliber.
 &HT;    That's OK, says Daniel Silbermann, head of IRSA's hotel
division. ``The most important thing we've learned since acquiring
Llao Llao is that it can't be evaluated on the same basis as other
hotels,'' he explains. ``Even if this hotel never turns a profit,
its strategic value will always remain important because of its
status as Argentina's most emblematic hotel.''
 &HT;    The fact that the hotel is sometimes featured in the
government's own tourist brochures is evidence of the powerful
marketing benefits ownership has, Silbermann says. Indeed, despite
having received a number of unsolicited offers for the property,
including a much-publicized one from Starwood Hotels, owners of the
Sheraton chain, he claims that IRSA has no plans to sell its
remaining 50 percent stake in the hotel any time soon. In April,
the Sutton Group exercised its right to acquire 50 percent of the
hotel for $7.5 million as stipulated in its original operating
agreement with IRSA.
 &HT;    Instead, IRSA and Sutton hope to prove wrong the pundits who say
the hotel can never be profitable. ``It's a real passion of ours as
hotel operators to make the Llao Llao Hotel turn a profit and I
think we can do it in the next two years,'' says Lavallen, who is
also the caretaker for Sutton's investment in the hotel.
 &HT;    Fueling such optimism is the hotel's shift away from its
traditional dependence on more frugal Argentine tourists as its
main source of revenue. Over the last two years, 63 percent of the
hotel's clients were Argentine while the remaining 37 percent came
from other countries, mainly Brazil and the United States.
According to Lavallen, however, those numbers are expected to
reverse in the coming year as the hotel's popularity in foreign
markets continues to rise.
 &HT;    Facilitating that process is Llao Llao's recently bestowed
status as member of the exclusive Leading Hotels of the World, an
organization that represents 340 of the worlds most luxurious
hotels that meet its own rigorous standards. ``Being a member of
Leading Hotels of the World allows us to tap a whole new audience
of wealthy travelers that will in turn allow us to increase the
hotel's average room rate,'' Lavallen says.
 &HT;    Average room rates have risen steadily from $145 in 1996 to $189
last year, but reached a new peak this past summer of $220 as a
result of the hotel's incorporation into the global travel network,
Silbermann says. Depending on the accommodations, listed rates
during the summer and winter high seasons range between $324 and
$809 and dip to between $233 and $583 in less-visited times of the
year.
 &HT;    Of course, there are better-valued alternatives for those
looking for a Patagonian vacation or just a weekend getaway from
bustling Buenos Aires. But as the hotel's owners and guests are
well aware, few offer the opportunity to straddle nature up close
while eavesdropping on a bit of history. ``If only these walls
could talk, they'd reveal a number of secrets,'' Lavallen says.
With its current renaissance afoot, they hopefully will for years
to come.

and that now hosts a nature reserve and park ranger school. Looking
at the robust trunks that overrun the island, one would never
suspect that these seemingly ageless sequoia trees were brought
over as seedlings from California as part of a government-run
experimental nursery in the 1920s.
 &HT;    For those staying at the hotel, there is a first-class spa, an
indoor swimming pool facing the mountains and two restaurants that
feature regional delicacies such as Patagonian lamb and fresh river
trout. There's also, of course, those undulating fairways and
magical surroundings that should keep most golfers _ Tiger Woods
was one recently _ busy during the day.
 &HT;    Adding to the hotel's mystique, however, is its tragic history,
which twice resulted in its collapse, first physically then
financially.
 &HT;    Within a year of the government's 1938 inauguration of the
hotel, it was almost destroyed by a fire. In 1940, it was reopened
with its original exterior woodwork replaced by a safer, stucco
finishing. Over the next three-and-a-half decades, the hotel's
rustic salons, with their wide-open hunting lodge fireplaces and
cypress wood paneling, were host to Argentina's aristocracy and
diplomats.
 &HT;    But in 1976, the hotel was closed again because the government,
in the midst of a military junta, could no longer afford to
maintain its world-class standards given the financial strains of
the era.
 &HT;    After a 15-year hiatus in which the hotel was exposed to
vandalism, robbery and overall neglect, the Llao Llao resumed
operations in 1993 under the guidance of CEI Citicorp Holdings, a
U.S. investment group that was awarded the hotel in payment for its
government junk bonds. Unfamiliar with the hotel business, CEI sold
the hotel in 1997 for US$13 million to IRSA, a Buenos Aires real
estate concern that counts Hungarian-American financier George
Soros as one of its principal investors.
 &HT;    Since then, IRSA has poured millions of dollars to modernize the
hotel's facilities, improve service and add luxury. To accomplish
that goal, IRSA contracted out the hotel's management to the Sutton
Group, long-time managers and part owners of Buenos Aires ritziest
hotel, the Alvear Palace.
 &HT;    Like the Alvear Palace, the Llao Llao is a historic monument
and, as such, its managers have had to respect its original design
as much as possible. One consequence of this is that rooms and
bathrooms tend to be smaller than one might expect from a luxury
hotel. But such minor inconveniences are more than compensated for
by a sharp attention to detail. For example, objects such as
original china, and furniture held for years in storage from the
hotel's `belle epoque,' are constantly being refurbished and rolled
out as decorative elements in the hotel's many suites.
 &HT;    But even such well-intentioned efforts haven't been enough to
fully restore the Llao Llao's former prominence among those with
the pockets deep enough to visit it. The hotel has yet to turn a
profit and its occupancy rate _ 75 percent during the high summer
season and 55 percent the rest of the year _ is well below industry
standards for a hotel of its caliber.
 &HT;    That's OK, says Daniel Silbermann, head of IRSA's hotel
division. ``The most important thing we've learned since acquiring
Llao Llao is that it can't be evaluated on the same basis as other
hotels,'' he explains. ``Even if this hotel never turns a profit,
its strategic value will always remain important because of its
status as Argentina's most emblematic hotel.''
 &HT;    The fact that the hotel is sometimes featured in the
government's own tourist brochures is evidence of the powerful
marketing benefits ownership has, Silbermann says. Indeed, despite
having received a number of unsolicited offers for the property,
including a much-publicized one from Starwood Hotels, owners of the
Sheraton chain, he claims that IRSA has no plans to sell its
remaining 50 percent stake in the hotel any time soon. In April,
the Sutton Group exercised its right to acquire 50 percent of the
hotel for $7.5 million as stipulated in its original operating
agreement with IRSA.
 &HT;    Instead, IRSA and Sutton hope to prove wrong the pundits who say
the hotel can never be profitable. ``It's a real passion of ours as
hotel operators to make the Llao Llao Hotel turn a profit and I
think we can do it in the next two years,'' says Lavallen, who is
also the caretaker for Sutton's investment in the hotel.
 &HT;    Fueling such optimism is the hotel's shift away from its
traditional dependence on more frugal Argentine tourists as its
main source of revenue. Over the last two years, 63 percent of the
hotel's clients were Argentine while the remaining 37 percent came
from other countries, mainly Brazil and the United States.
According to Lavallen, however, those numbers are expected to
reverse in the coming year as the hotel's popularity in foreign
markets continues to rise.
 &HT;    Facilitating that process is Llao Llao's recently bestowed
status as member of the exclusive Leading Hotels of the World, an
organization that represents 340 of the worlds most luxurious
hotels that meet its own rigorous standards. ``Being a member of
Leading Hotels of the World allows us to tap a whole new audience
of wealthy travelers that will in turn allow us to increase the
hotel's average room rate,'' Lavallen says.
 &HT;    Average room rates have risen steadily from $145 in 1996 to $189
last year, but reached a new peak this past summer of $220 as a
result of the hotel's incorporation into the global travel network,
Silbermann says. Depending on the accommodations, listed rates
during the summer and winter high seasons range between $324 and
$809 and dip to between $233 and $583 in less-visited times of the
year.
 &HT;    Of course, there are better-valued alternatives for those
looking for a Patagonian vacation or just a weekend getaway from
bustling Buenos Aires. But as the hotel's owners and guests are
well aware, few offer the opportunity to straddle nature up close
while eavesdropping on a bit of history. ``If only these walls
could talk, they'd reveal a number of secrets,'' Lavallen says.
With its current renaissance afoot, they hopefully will for years
to come.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    BARILOCHE, Argentina _ Se dice que cuando el presidente
norteamericano Bill Clinton visito Argentina en 1997, los asuntos
economicos no estaban en el primer lugar de su agenda, sino jugar
golf en el Hotel Llao Llao, el centro turistico mas exclusivo del
pais.
 &HT;    ``Sus ayudantes habian planeado que jugara solamente unas
cuantas pistas, pero cuando Clinton vio el campo, cancelo varias
reuniones y un paseo a caballo con Hillary para jugar las 18
pistas,'' recuerda Guillermo Lavallen, gerente general del hotel.
``Supongo que quedo muy satisfecho porque todavia vienen amigos y
conocidos de Clinton que quieren jugar en el campo del que tanto
les ha hablado.''
 &HT;    Desde luego, hay mas de 18 razones para visitar el Llao Llao. El
hotel queda a dos horas en avion de Buenos Aires y a unos 32
kilometros de Bariloche, el centro turistico mas desarrollado de
Patagonia. Esta en un terreno ondulado, donde el paramo patagonico
se une con los empinados Andes.
 &HT;    El enorme hotel se alza en una ladera que domina la entrada al
Parque Nacional Nahuel Huapi, el mas antiguo y atesorado de
Argentina. Rodeado por picos nevados, lagos cristalinos y bosques
frondosos, el hotel ofrece varias de las mejores vistas de toda
Patagonia. El agradable panorama y la influencia europea en la
arquitectura y la cultura de la region le han dado a la zona de
Bariloche la fama de una Suiza argentina.
 &HT;    El hotel es la base ideal para explorar el territorio
circundante, que conserva su estado natural. Hay un paseo en barco
a la isla Victoria, colonizada por una familia de inmigrantes e
ahora tiene una reserva natural y una escuela de guardaparques. En
la isla abundan altos arboles; nadie adivinaria que estas secoyas
que parecen milenarias fueron traidas hace menos de 100 anos de
California, cuando no eran mas que plantas de semillero, para
formar parte de un vivero experimental del gobierno.
 &HT;    Para los que prefieren quedarse en el hotel, el centro cuenta
con un spa de primera clase, una piscina bajo techo con vista a las
montanas y dos restaurantes que sirven platos regionales como
cordero de Patagonia y trucha. Tambien esta el campo de golf con su
magico entorno que mantiene ocupados durante el dia a los
jugadores. Tiger Woods visito recientemente el lugar.
 &HT;    Aumenta el caracter mistico del hotel su tragica historia, en la
que sufrio dos cierres, el primero fisico y el segundo financiero.
 &HT;    El gobierno inauguro el hotel en 1938. Un ano despues, un
incendio lo destruyo casi por completo. En 1940 lo reabrieron, tras
cambiar la madera original del exterior por estuco, material mas
seguro. En las tres decadas y media siguientes, los salones
rusticos del hotel, con sus chimeneas y sus paneles de madera de
cipres, acogieron a diplomaticos y aristocratas argentinos.
 &HT;    Pero en 1976, el Llao Llao cerro de nuevo porque el gobierno
militar tenia dificultades financieras.
 &HT;    Tras un periodo de 15 anos en el que el hotel sufrio actos de
vandalismo, robos y negligencia, las operaciones se reanudaron en
1993 bajo la direccion de CEI Citicorp Holdings, un grupo de
inversion norteamericano al que se adjudico el hotel en pago por
sus bonos basura del gobierno. CEI, que no estaba familiarizado con
el negocio hotelero, vendio la propiedad en 1997 por US$13 millones
a IRSA, una firma inmobiliaria de Buenos Aires que tiene al
financista norteamericano de origen hungaro George Soros entre sus
principales inversionistas.
 &HT;    Desde entonces, IRSA ha inyectado millones de dolares para
modernizar el hotel, mejorar el servicio y agregar detalles de
lujo. Con vistas a lograr ese objetivo, IRSA contrato a la gerencia
del hotel en el Sutton Group, gerentes y propietarios parciales del
hotel mas lujoso de Buenos Aires, el Alvear Palace.
 &HT;    Al igual que el Alvear Palace, el Llao Llao es un monumento
historico y como tal sus gerentes han tenido que respetar el diseno
original en la medida de lo posible. De ahi que las habitaciones y
los banos sean mas pequenas de lo que se espera en un hotel de
lujo. Pero esos inconvenientes menores estan mas que compensados
por una minuciosa atencion a los detalles. Por ejemplo, los objetos
y los muebles almacenados durante anos desde la epoca de oro del
hotel, como la vajilla original de porcelana, se retocan
constantemente y se colocan como elementos decorativos en las
numerosas suites.
 &HT;    Pero esos esfuerzos no han bastado para devolverle al Llao Llao
su antigua fama entre la clase adinerada. El hotel todavia no da
ganancias y su indice de ocupacion _ 75 por ciento en la temporada
alta del invierno sudamericano, y 55 por ciento el resto del ano _
esta por debajo de la norma del sector para un hotel de su calibre.
 &HT;    Daniel Silbermann, director de la division hotelera de IRSA,
dice que no hay problema. ``Lo mas importante que hemos aprendido
desde que adquirimos el Llao Llao es que no se puede evaluar igual
que otros hoteles,'' explica. ``Aun si este hotel nunca da
ganancia, su valor estrategico siempre sera importante debido a que
es el hotel mas emblematico de Argentina.''
 &HT;    El hecho de que el hotel aparezca en ocasiones en los folletos
turisticos del gobierno indica que tener su propiedad es una gran
ventaja para el mercadeo de la imagen, dice Silbermann. A pesar de
que ha recibido varias ofertas no solicitadas por la propiedad,
entre ellas una celebre oferta de Starwood Hotels, duenos de la
cadena Sheraton, Silbermann afirma que IRSA no planea vender su
participacion del 50 por ciento en el hotel, al menos de momento.
En abril, el Sutton Group ejercio su derecho de adquirir el 50 por
ciento del hotel por US$7,5 millones, como estipula el acuerdo
operativo original con IRSA.
 &HT;    IRSA y Sutton esperan probar que los expertos se equivocan
cuando dicen que el hotel nunca sera rentable. ``Como operadores
del hotel, tenemos una verdadera pasion: hacer que el Llao Llao de
ganancias, y creo que lo conseguiremos en los dos anos proximos,''
dice Lavallen, que es tambien el guardian de la inversion de Sutton
en el hotel.
 &HT;    Alienta ese optimismo el alejamiento del hotel de su dependencia
tradicional en turistas argentinos mas parcos como su principal
fuente de ingresos. En los dos ultimos anos, el 63 por ciento de
los clientes del hotel fueron argentinos, mientras que el restante
37 por ciento provino de otros paises, principalmente Brasil y
Estados Unidos. Sin embargo, segun Lavallen, esas cifras deben
revertirse el ano proximo, ya que la popularidad del hotel en los
mercados extranjeros sigue creciendo.
 &HT;    Esa popularidad debe aumentar con la reciente entrada del Llao
Llao en la exclusiva organizacion de viajes Leading Hotels of the
World, que representa a 340 de los hoteles mas lujosos del planeta
que cumplen con sus rigurosas normas. ``Ser miembro de Leading
Hotels of the World nos permite aprovechar un nuevo publico de
viajeros adinerados que a su vez nos permitiran incrementar el
precio promedio de la habitacion,'' dice Lavallen.
 &HT;    El precio promedio de la habitacion ha subido continuamente, de
US$145 en 1996 a US$189 el ano pasado, pero llego a un nuevo record
de US$220 el verano pasado a consecuencia de la incorporacion del
hotel a la red mundial de viajes, explica Silbermann. Dependiendo
del tipo de habitacion, el precio en la temporada alta del verano y
del invierno oscila entre US$324 y US$809 y entre US$223 y US$583
en la temporada baja.
 &HT;    Desde luego, hay alternativas mas economicas para los que
quieren pasar unas vacaciones en la Patagonia, o simplemente un fin
de semana lejos del bullicio de Buenos Aires. Pero como bien saben
los duenos y los huespedes del hotel, pocos lugares ofrecen la
oportunidad de disfrutar de la naturaleza y de ponerse en contacto
con la historia. ``Si estas paredes hablaran,'' dice Lavallen,
``revelarian muchos secretos.''

 &HT;    Al igual que el Alvear Palace, el Llao Llao es un monumento
historico y como tal sus gerentes han tenido que respetar el diseno
original en la medida de lo posible. De ahi que las habitaciones y
los banos sean mas pequenas de lo que se espera en un hotel de
lujo. Pero esos inconvenientes menores estan mas que compensados
por una minuciosa atencion a los detalles. Por ejemplo, los objetos
y los muebles almacenados durante anos desde la epoca de oro del
hotel, como la vajilla original de porcelana, se retocan
constantemente y se colocan como elementos decorativos en las
numerosas suites.
 &HT;    Pero esos esfuerzos no han bastado para devolverle al Llao Llao
su antigua fama entre la clase adinerada. El hotel todavia no da
ganancias y su indice de ocupacion _ 75 por ciento en la temporada
alta del invierno sudamericano, y 55 por ciento el resto del ano _
esta por debajo de la norma del sector para un hotel de su calibre.
 &HT;    Daniel Silbermann, director de la division hotelera de IRSA,
dice que no hay problema. ``Lo mas importante que hemos aprendido
desde que adquirimos el Llao Llao es que no se puede evaluar igual
que otros hoteles,'' explica. ``Aun si este hotel nunca da
ganancia, su valor estrategico siempre sera importante debido a que
es el hotel mas emblematico de Argentina.''
 &HT;    El hecho de que el hotel aparezca en ocasiones en los folletos
turisticos del gobierno indica que tener su propiedad es una gran
ventaja para el mercadeo de la imagen, dice Silbermann. A pesar de
que ha recibido varias ofertas no solicitadas por la propiedad,
entre ellas una celebre oferta de Starwood Hotels, duenos de la
cadena Sheraton, Silbermann afirma que IRSA no planea vender su
participacion del 50 por ciento en el hotel, al menos de momento.
En abril, el Sutton Group ejercio su derecho de adquirir el 50 por
ciento del hotel por US$7,5 millones, como estipula el acuerdo
operativo original con IRSA.
 &HT;    IRSA y Sutton esperan probar que los expertos se equivocan
cuando dicen que el hotel nunca sera rentable. ``Como operadores
del hotel, tenemos una verdadera pasion: hacer que el Llao Llao de
ganancias, y creo que lo conseguiremos en los dos anos proximos,''
dice Lavallen, que es tambien el guardian de la inversion de Sutton
en el hotel.
 &HT;    Alienta ese optimismo el alejamiento del hotel de su dependencia
tradicional en turistas argentinos mas parcos como su principal
fuente de ingresos. En los dos ultimos anos, el 63 por ciento de
los clientes del hotel fueron argentinos, mientras que el restante
37 por ciento provino de otros paises, principalmente Brasil y
Estados Unidos. Sin embargo, segun Lavallen, esas cifras deben
revertirse el ano proximo, ya que la popularidad del hotel en los
mercados extranjeros sigue creciendo.
 &HT;    Esa popularidad debe aumentar con la reciente entrada del Llao
Llao en la exclusiva organizacion de viajes Leading Hotels of the
World, que representa a 340 de los hoteles mas lujosos del planeta
que cumplen con sus rigurosas normas. ``Ser miembro de Leading
Hotels of the World nos permite aprovechar un nuevo publico de
viajeros adinerados que a su vez nos permitiran incrementar el
precio promedio de la habitacion,'' dice Lavallen.
 &HT;    El precio promedio de la habitacion ha subido continuamente, de
US$145 en 1996 a US$189 el ano pasado, pero llego a un nuevo record
de US$220 el verano pasado a consecuencia de la incorporacion del
hotel a la red mundial de viajes, explica Silbermann. Dependiendo
del tipo de habitacion, el precio en la temporada alta del verano y
del invierno oscila entre US$324 y US$809 y entre US$223 y US$583
en la temporada baja.
 &HT;    Desde luego, hay alternativas mas economicas para los que
quieren pasar unas vacaciones en la Patagonia, o simplemente un fin
de semana lejos del bullicio de Buenos Aires. Pero como bien saben
los duenos y los huespedes del hotel, pocos lugares ofrecen la
oportunidad de disfrutar de la naturaleza y de ponerse en contacto
con la historia. ``Si estas paredes hablaran,'' dice Lavallen,
``revelarian muchos secretos.''

 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BARILOCHE, Argentina _ Se dice que cuando el presidente
norteamericano Bill Clinton visito Argentina en 1997, los asuntos
economicos no estaban en el primer lugar de su agenda, sino jugar
golf en el Hotel Llao Llao, el centro turistico mas exclusivo del
pais.
 &HT;    ``Sus ayudantes habian planeado que jugara solamente unas
cuantas pistas, pero cuando Clinton vio el campo, cancelo varias
reuniones y un paseo a caballo con Hillary para jugar las 18
pistas,'' recuerda Guillermo Lavallen, gerente general del hotel.
``Supongo que quedo muy satisfecho porque todavia vienen amigos y
conocidos de Clinton que quieren jugar en el campo del que tanto
les ha hablado.''
 &HT;    Desde luego, hay mas de 18 razones para visitar el Llao Llao. El
hotel queda a dos horas en avion de Buenos Aires y a unos 32
kilometros de Bariloche, el centro turistico mas desarrollado de
Patagonia. Esta en un terreno ondulado, donde el paramo patagonico
se une con los empinados Andes.
 &HT;    El enorme hotel se alza en una ladera que domina la entrada al
Parque Nacional Nahuel Huapi, el mas antiguo y atesorado de
Argentina. Rodeado por picos nevados, lagos cristalinos y bosques
frondosos, el hotel ofrece varias de las mejores vistas de toda
Patagonia. El agradable panorama y la influencia europea en la
arquitectura y la cultura de la region le han dado a la zona de
Bariloche la fama de una Suiza argentina.
 &HT;    El hotel es la base ideal para explorar el territorio
circundante, que conserva su estado natural. Hay un paseo en barco
a la isla Victoria, colonizada por una familia de inmigrantes e
ahora tiene una reserva natural y una escuela de guardaparques. En
la isla abundan altos arboles; nadie adivinaria que estas secoyas
que parecen milenarias fueron traidas hace menos de 100 anos de
California, cuando no eran mas que plantas de semillero, para
formar parte de un vivero experimental del gobierno.
 &HT;    Para los que prefieren quedarse en el hotel, el centro cuenta
con un spa de primera clase, una piscina bajo techo con vista a las
montanas y dos restaurantes que sirven platos regionales como
cordero de Patagonia y trucha. Tambien esta el campo de golf con su
magico entorno que mantiene ocupados durante el dia a los
jugadores. Tiger Woods visito recientemente el lugar.
 &HT;    Aumenta el caracter mistico del hotel su tragica historia, en la
que sufrio dos cierres, el primero fisico y el segundo financiero.
 &HT;    El gobierno inauguro el hotel en 1938. Un ano despues, un
incendio lo destruyo casi por completo. En 1940 lo reabrieron, tras
cambiar la madera original del exterior por estuco, material mas
seguro. En las tres decadas y media siguientes, los salones
rusticos del hotel, con sus chimeneas y sus paneles de madera de
cipres, acogieron a diplomaticos y aristocratas argentinos.
 &HT;    Pero en 1976, el Llao Llao cerro de nuevo porque el gobierno
militar tenia dificultades financieras.
 &HT;    Tras un periodo de 15 anos en el que el hotel sufrio actos de
vandalismo, robos y negligencia, las operaciones se reanudaron en
1993 bajo la direccion de CEI Citicorp Holdings, un grupo de
inversion norteamericano al que se adjudico el hotel en pago por
sus bonos basura del gobierno. CEI, que no estaba familiarizado con
el negocio hotelero, vendio la propiedad en 1997 por US$13 millones
a IRSA, una firma inmobiliaria de Buenos Aires que tiene al
financista norteamericano de origen hungaro George Soros entre sus
principales inversionistas.
 &HT;    Desde entonces, IRSA ha inyectado millones de dolares para
modernizar el hotel, mejorar el servicio y agregar detalles de
lujo. Con vistas a lograr ese objetivo, IRSA contrato a la gerencia
del hotel en el Sutton Group, gerentes y propietarios parciales del
hotel mas lujoso de Buenos Aires, el Alvear Palace.
 &HT;    Al igual que el Alvear Palace, el Llao Llao es un monumento
historico y como tal sus gerentes han tenido que respetar el diseno
original en la medida de lo posible. De ahi que las habitaciones y
los banos sean mas pequenas de lo que se espera en un hotel de

por una minuciosa atencion a los detalles. Por ejemplo, los objetos
y los muebles almacenados durante anos desde la epoca de oro del

<TEXT>
<P>
   The days of farmers sitting around the country store swapping
yarns and seat-of-the-pants predictions for the growing season are
long gone. Oh, the farmers still talk and spin yarns, but mostly
through e-mail and Internet chat sessions. And the conversation
today focuses less on creaky-bone predictions of rain and more on
precision farming, the Global Positioning System, the reliability
of precise soil samples, yield monitors and computer interfacing
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Today's high-tech farmer needs to know as much about computers
and satellites as he or she does about agronomy and phases of the
moon. Modern precision farming allows farmers to work more
efficiently, while obtaining increased yields from their crops.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, precision farming means using information
technologies like GPS and geographic information system software to
gather, store, view and analyze vast amounts of data _ which can
then be converted into usable knowledge to make better farm
management decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Practically, precision farming means that farmers can visualize,
identify and control crop patterns from a central computerized
location. The goal is to improve profitability and reduce risks.
For example, an increasing number of tractors are linked to GPS, so
their position can be tracked from a distant office.
</P>
<P>
   Land management information in office computers then tells
tractors where to go, stop, turn or activate cutting or fertilizing
equipment. Through a tractor-based GPS, a farmhand is told when and
where to turn to begin tilling each row of a field. This can
greatly reduce overlap, which on a large farm saves hours of work.
It all works continuously in the field with a 3-inch accuracy, even
while the tractor is moving. Here is how the parts of today's high
tech farm work and fit together.
</P>
<P>
   LOCAL IRRIGATION
</P>
<P>
   Water may be readily available in the soil but not accessible to
the plant. Time-release water polymer gels that soak up water and
hold it for plant use have evolved into versatile, proven water
management tools. Superabsorbent gels on the market today absorb
from 30 to 800 times their weight in water.
</P>
<P>
   As plants require water, their roots easily withdraw water from
the gel material. More than 90 percent of the moisture held in the
gel is available to the plant. After the growing season, the
products eventually degrade in the soil and disappear. Some gels
remain effective through many swell-shrink cycles and can work for
five years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Soil researchers at Texas A&AMP;M University and the USDA
Agriculture Research Service are developing a computerized
irrigation system that measures and calculates how much water to
apply every half-hour. The automated time domain reflectometry
system, or TDR, uses stainless steel probes placed in the ground at
varying depths, from a few inches down to several feet.
</P>
<P>
   A computer-controlled TDR instrument sends an electronic pulse
through a buried cable to the probes. The longer it takes for the
pulse to travel through the probes, the more soil water. The probes
work in most irrigated agricultural soils and one TDR system can
handle up to 241 probes.
</P>
<P>
   A new sprinkler head may help growers apply precisely the right
amounts of water and farm chemicals to their crops. The head is
designed to avoid over-irrigating, which wastes water and can cause
leaching of fertilizer or other chemicals into underground water
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike pulsating devices that alternately turn the flow on and
off, the variable-rate sprinkler head never completely shuts off
the flow. The amount of flow that's blocked is determined primarily
by the diameter of a pin that moves in and out of the nozzle
without altering the area covered by the spray. The needle is
controlled either by an electrical power source or a hydraulic
actuator activated by a networked computer. In effect, each area
within the sprinkler's reach becomes a garden plot.
</P>
<P>
   The sprinkler head can be incorporated into precision-farming
technologies. When an irrigation system delivers fertilizer or
other chemicals along with water _ a technique known as chemigation
_ application rates can again be customized to take into account
natural variables such as the fertility of different soil types.
</P>
<P>
   YIELD MONITORS
</P>
<P>
   The use of GPS in farming has grown beyond the early practice of
grid soil sampling and variable rate fertilizer applications to a
new, more useful focus on yield monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   In precision farming, growers break fields down into regions, or
cells, analyzing growth characteristics of each cell and improving
crop health and yield by applying precise amounts of seed,
fertilizer and pesticides as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Many associate precision farming with combine yield monitors,
equipped with GPS. Some farmers now use multispectral imaging to
produce gray scale values that are converted to color images
showing poor to good vegetation conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Yield monitors can forecast yield as bushels per acre, total
pounds, acres per hour worked and grain moisture content. This is
all done while the combine is in use, and can be recorded on a
memory card for later analysis. Sensors monitor, calculate and
record, in real time, each field's yield as the combine harvests
the crop. This eliminates having to wait until the entire harvest
is complete before projecting yields and making important decisions
on how much to store or sell.
</P>
<P>
   FIELD SCOUTING
</P>
<P>
   Field scouting uses a portable geographic information system
unit that allows farmers to identify and record the location of
problems or events that will affect production, including soil
differences, insect infestations, fertility deficiencies and weed
problems. Remote sensing, and satellite and infrared images also
can be employed while scouting fields. Satellites that capture
infrared images can look at moisture content and quickly assess the
health of a crop before visible damage appears. Soil testing,
however, still requires farmers to walk across their fields to take
samples.
</P>
<P>
   SMART SPRAYING
</P>
<P>
   Equipment is now available _ and more is being developed _ that
will allow chemicals to be applied to a single field at variable
rates. Sensors monitor tractor speed and adjust the amount of
fertilizer or pesticide sprayed on the soil. Generally, the system
records, in 2-second intervals, the amount of pesticide that was
applied.
</P>
<P>
   A new ``seeing-eye'' sprayer for weeds uses a light-reflectance
sensor to scan the ground for patterns that match weeds. It then
kills them with less herbicide than conventional sprayers use.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-row hooded sprayer uses its sensor to distinguish
differences in the light reflected from bare soil and from weeds
between crop rows. If it ``sees'' a weed, it sprays it. The sprayer
was developed for row crops through a cooperative research and
development agreement with Patchen, of Los Gatos, Calif, and
Agriculture Research Service scientists in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The Silsoe Research Institute in Britain is looking into
improving the accuracy with which solid manure is spread onto land.
This system, based on a side discharge impeller-type tanker
spreader, features an electrohydraulic-operated discharge control
door and a novel driveline torque transducer capable of sensing
discharge rates.
</P>
<P>
   The integrated control system communicates with the tractor and
spreader subsystems to control engine speed, gear selection and
spreader settings. Once a desired application rate has been
selected, the system automatically adjusts the spreader and/or
tractor settings.
</P>
<P>
   Sensors also can monitor the speed of a tractor and adjust the
seed planter to keep spacing consistent. This ensures optimal
spacing, while letting farmhands concentrate on other matters, such
as making sure the seed planter does not clog.
</P>
<P>
   ROBOT FARMHANDS
</P>
<P>
   Automation is even working its way into the barnyard. Research
into flock behavior and modeling led a Silsoe research team to
develop a robot that could enter a field, gather a flock of ducks
and steer them safely to a predetermined destination.
</P>
<P>
   The robot system includes a robot vehicle, computer and camera.
Commands are then sent by radio to the robot, which guides the
ducks to the goal. Using ducks, instead of sheep, allowed the
trials to take place on a smaller and more convenient scale. Duck
flocking behavior is recognized by shepherds as similar to sheep,
and ducks are often used to train sheep dogs. The project also
looked at flock dynamics and how individual animals in a flock
behave.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing pigs is the most basic guide to quality control but
it's time consuming and stressful to both farmers and pigs. Silsoe
has developed the Growth Rate and Conformation Evaluation System,
which uses image analysis techniques to watch pigs grow.
</P>
<P>
   The image analysis system uses a video camera connected to a
computer, mounted over a feeder. The computer measures body area,
ham width and ham area, and determines each pig's shape, weight and
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   During the 20th century mechanical technology made it possible
to feed a rapidly growing American population while keeping the
price of food lower than any other place on Earth. In this century,
making these machines smarter will extend these benefits to the
world.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The early days of online shopping were pretty close to
traditional shopping. Yes, you could (and still can) do it all from
your favorite computer chair, but the process was really no
different than doing it the old-fashioned way. You went to the
store (virtually, in this case), found what you wanted, checked the
price and made the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, to the delight of buyers and sellers, Internet shopping
developed another, more exciting venue: virtual auction sites such
as eBay. Sure, auctions have been around for centuries, but how
many of you have actually participated in one? These auction sites
brought the concept into mainstream, everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are a few other shopping models taking hold on the
Internet, and most of them revolve around the idea of group buying
power. The basic idea is nothing new. For example, how many of you
already have membership cards for those huge stores _ like Sam's
Club or Costco _ where you can buy everything you've ever dreamed
of in bulk? What's different is the manner in which the group
buying concept is being applied to Internet shopping.
</P>
<P>
   One shopping model that's been adopted by at least two companies
is based on the idea that more buyers of an individual product can
drive the price down. Both Mercata (www.mercata.com) and MobShop
(www. mobshop.com), formerly Accompany.com, operate on this
principle. The idea is simple. The more people who buy a specific
product during a specific time period, the lower its price goes.
However, each of these sites handles the matter a little
differently.
</P>
<P>
   On the Mercata site, you're never quite sure _ at least not
until the buying period closes _ how much you're likely to pay for
a product. When you find a product you like, you agree to purchase
it at the then-current price and hope that the price will drop even
lower before the deal closes. The problem I see with this approach
is that you have no idea if or when the price is likely to drop, or
to what level it may drop. It's my hard-earned cash and it's a
funny thing, but I like to know where my money goes before my
wallet is empty. There really should be a minimum price for any
item, and Mercata should be able to tell you the price.
</P>
<P>
   MobShop is more straightforward. The pricing structure for each
item is presented in a four-bar graph. The first bar shows the
MSRP, and each of the three other bars represents a price based on
the number of buyers who participate. For example, I looked at a
Toshiba SD1200 DVD player. The MSRP for this item was $299.95.
However, the starting price for up to 25 buyers was $199.95. The
price for 26 to 50 buyers _ $199.95 _ was the same as for the first
25. For 51 to 101 buyers, the price was $189.95.
</P>
<P>
   For me, MobShop's more open approach to pricing makes sense. (I
should point out that both Mercata and MobShop allow you to specify
a maximum price for your purchase.) If the item doesn't drop to the
price you specify, your order is canceled. The flip side is that
once you place an order, on either site, there is no way to cancel
it yourself. That's because the final price is based on the total
number of buyers, and your cancellation could conceivably drive the
price back up.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind these sites may be compelling, but the true test
is in the final pricing. Do these sites really offer the best
deals?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, my research shows that the answer is a big fat
``No.'' Although the online prices are almost always competitive
with store prices, they are not always the best you can find.
</P>
<P>
   I broke my CD player last year in Maui. I'm getting ready to go
again this year so I did some looking on the MobShop site and found
an Audiovox CE-150R personal CD player. It had an MSRP of $79.95, a
starting price of $75.95 and a minimum price of $64.95. At the
time, the actual price was still at $79.95. However, a quick check
at PriceScan (www. pricescan.com) located the same CD player at The
Big Store (www.thebigstore.com) for $61.70. I didn't need to call
all my friends to get the price that low. That's the standard
price.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, I put in an order for ``The Matrix'' on DVD through
MobShop, but stipulated that the price drop to $16.95. That seemed
like a fair price even without considering that the starting price
was over $18. To see if it was a deal or not, I went over to the
price-shopping site Mysimon (www.mysimon.com). I didn't feel so
good after seeing that www.samgoody.com had ``The Matrix'' for sale
and in stock for $14.99.
</P>
<P>
   There's another problem with these sites. As I mentioned
earlier, consumers are given only so much time to take advantage of
any given offer. This works against you if, for example, you want a
CD player right now. The buying periods typically range from one to
five days. That means if you happen to order an item just as it's
put up for sale, you may have to wait five days before the order is
processed. This seems counter to the instant-gratification promise
of most Internet shopping sites.
</P>
<P>
   Another group-buying concept becoming popular on a number of
sites is one in which the sites serve as merchant aggregators. In
other words, with one of these Web sites as an intermediary,
several merchants offer their goods for sale and compete against
each other for your business. These are similar to auction sites,
except that there's no bidding. Instead, the seller sets his price,
and you either buy the item or not.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the skinny on a few of these sites.
</P>
<P>
   BazaarE (www.bazaare.com) is similar in some ways to Mercata and
MobShop, but very different in others. Here, you can either join an
existing ``shopping group'' or create one of your own. The purpose
of these groups is to identify people who are all interested in
purchasing the same product.
</P>
<P>
   These groups are formed for specific periods of time, and while
they're active, multiple merchants supposedly submit bids to the
group. The interesting thing is that each individual group member
can then decide which bid to accept. In other words, all group
members aren't necessarily forced to buy the item from the same
merchant. Vive capitalism!
</P>
<P>
   NexTag (www.nextag.com) offers a similar, but more direct
approach to online discount shopping. Like BazaarE, it works like
an aggregator for merchants. However, when it comes to purchasing,
you're totally on your own.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: First, you identify a product that you want
to buy. Then, you're presented with a list of participating
merchants who offer that product, along with their prices and other
terms. At this point you have two options. You can either purchase
the item from one of the merchants, or if you're a haggler, you can
tell them all the price is too high and ask for a lower price. The
big advantage here is that there's no waiting _ you make your own
deal and close on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Again comes the question: Is it the best deal? At NexTag, I
found a great digital camera _ a Nikon CoolPix 950 _ for $701.07,
including shipping and handling. At my local BestBuy, the same unit
sells for $899, but there is a $100 rebate coupon available making
the grand total $799. One thing to remember: At BestBuy, you can be
snapping pictures in less than 15 minutes. You'll have to decide
which is best for you.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is changing the way we shop, and I have to applaud
all these sites for at least trying something different. However,
in my opinion, the Internet is supposed to make life easier, not
more complicated. That's an area where these sites tend to fall
short in one way or another.

   SPHINX GETTING A FACELIFT
</P>
<P>
   Austrian scientists have unraveled one of the great mysteries of
the Sphinx: how to save it from further erosion. Several thousand
years in the desert has taken its toll on the 190-foot-long,
66-foot-high natural rock carving. European do-gooders did even
more damage by trying to restore the mysterious statue at Giza,
near Cairo. In fact, human-inflicted damage was so bad that the
United Nations financed an eight-year effort to undo the damage
caused by these ``repairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The task at hand is to preserve the structure. Egyptian
antiquities experts were impressed with an idea from the Austrian
College of Trade and Technology. Researchers there developed a
silicate treatment that will shield the stone from sun and water
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Instructors from Austria have traveled to Egypt to familiarize
restoration workers with their technique.
</P>
<P>
   PICTURES NOW CAN BE SET IN CONCRETE
</P>
<P>
   Why leave your footprints in wet concrete when you can leave
your picture instead? A new variation of silk-screening lets you
cast complex images in stone.
</P>
<P>
   The process works like this. A black-and-white photo of the
image to be transferred is converted into a traditional silkscreen
stencil. This stencil is placed on a freshly poured concrete
aggregate base that has been coated with colored cement. The
stencil is then ``inked'' with a chemical that temporarily prevents
the concrete directly beneath it from drying.
</P>
<P>
   After the slab has hardened, the retardant is washed away.
Washing also removes the top layer of cement, exposing the
different color aggregate. The technique was developed by Pieri, a
French company.
</P>
<P>
   LAND MINE DEACTIVATOR
</P>
<P>
   A device that detects and then disables plastic land mines has
been developed by Ohio State University researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike land mines of the past, today's are made of plastic,
which makes them invisible to metal detectors, says Chi-Chih Chen,
one of the system's developers. To detect them, Chen uses
ground-penetrating radar.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, these systems have to be placed directly on the ground
to work, which is generally a bad idea when working with landmines.
Chen side-stepped the problem with a novel antenna design. In
tests, the system correctly identified two common types of land
mines buried as deep as 2 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has applied for a patent on a companion device that will
shoot a chemical agent into the soil, deactivating the land mines.
One chemical agent would solidify the triggering mechanism,
rendering the mine temporarily safe. Another chemical would
solidify the mine and soil permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Then, you could just shovel the mines out and throw them away.
</P>
<P>
   ROBOT LAB LESSENS ASTRONAUTS' WORK
</P>
<P>
   An orbiting robot laboratory will speed drug development.
</P>
<P>
   Growing protein crystals for X-ray analysis is an essential
first step in creating new drugs. Low gravity in space produces
nearly perfect specimens. The Crystal Preparation Prime Item, or
CPPI, prototype built by Oceaneering Space Systems of Houston, lets
scientists control crystal growth from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The CPPI lab has been shipped to the University of Alabama at
Birmingham where it will be the centerpiece of the X-ray
Crystallography Facility to be installed on the international space
station. Both are now under construction.
</P>
<P>
   NEW WAY TO BUILD WINGS
</P>
<P>
   Shipbuilding begins with laying the keel. Airplane construction
starts with building the spar, an internal wing-support structure.
</P>
<P>
   For its next generation of 737s, the 177-passenger 900 series,
Boeing's Renton, Wash., factory will largely automate spar
construction.
</P>
<P>
   The spar will be encorporated into the first 737-900. The
177-passenger plane is scheduled to be delivered to Alaska Airlines
in April 2001.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By SARAH LYALL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    August may be the best month of all to visit Edinburgh, the most
regal of Scottish cities. Not only are the northern days still
delightfully long, but it is also the month for the Edinburgh
International Festival, a world-renowned feast of music, dance and
theater.
 &HT;    Most of Edinburgh is given over to the festival, as
international companies, including the New York City Ballet, Czech
Philharmonic Orchestra and Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm,
take over theaters and concert halls, leaving the visitor
thoroughly spoiled for choice.
 &HT;    It has been a year since Scotland embarked on a bold democratic
experiment, swearing in its first England-free Parliament in almost
300 years and getting to run its own affairs when it comes to
things such as education and health.
 &HT;    The new legislators have yet to move into their custom-made
building at Holyrood, but construction can be observed in the Old
City, on Edinburgh's south side. When Parliament is in session, the
legislators themselves can be seen building Scotland's new
political order in their temporary headquarters, near the George IV
Bridge.
 &HT;    One caveat: it is normal, while visiting Edinburgh, to become
unduly obsessed with the vicissitudes of Scottish weather. It can
be cold; it can be hot; rain is generally lurking somewhere on the
horizon. The best course is to plan for the worst, but hope for the
best.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    From Aug. 13 to Sept. 2, Edinburgh will feast on the dizzyingly
eclectic smorgasbord that is the Edinburgh International Festival.
For tickets and a full list of events, call the festival office at
(44-131) 473-2000 (www.eif.co.uk) or Globaltickets at (800)
223-6108 in the United States.
 &HT;    Tickets can also be purchased at the Hub, the festival's
handsome new headquarters _ a prime spot for eating and shopping,
too _ on the Royal Mile in the Old City. Here are some highlights:
 &HT;    On Sept. 1, the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra will be performing
Janacek's Sinfonietta and Mahler's ``Das Lied von der Erde,'' a
lyrical meditation on death and nature. Curtain time is 8 p.m. at
Usher Hall on Lothian Road. Tickets from $7.50 to $58.50
(calculated at $1.50 to the pound).
 &HT;    The pianist Christian Zacharias will direct and accompany the
Scottish Chamber Orchestra in a rendering of the complete cycle of
Mozart's piano concertos, over seven nights between Aug. 14 and 27
at Usher Hall. Tickets $7.50 to $46.50.
 &HT;    Another of the festival's delights is seeing a play in a foreign
language. This year's possibilities include a German ``Hamlet'' and
a Spanish play called ``One thousand five hundred meters above the
level of Jack,'' about a deep-sea diver teetering on the edge of
madness. All have English supertitles. On various dates; tickets
from $9 to $33.75.
 &HT;    The Netherlands Dance Theater _ really three companies in one,
with each made up of dancers at different points in their careers _
is presenting a program of bold, sexy dancing over five nights,
from Aug. 29 to Sept. 2. And on Aug. 30 and 31, dancers from NDT1,
the main company, will dance to music played by the Czech
Philharmonic Orchestra, with Sir Charles Mackerras conducting.
Performances are at 7:30 p.m. at various sites; tickets, $7.50 to
$55.50.
 &HT;    There also is the well-known but much less formalized Edinburgh
Fringe Festival, which features stand-up comedy, theater, skits,
dance, music and mime in halls, parks, clubs and on the streets.
Performances run Aug. 6 to 28; (44-131) 226-5138; www.edfringe.com.
Admission to some performances is free; tickets range up to $22.50.
 &HT;    From Aug. 4 to 26, Edinburgh is also celebrating the 50th
anniversary of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, an extravaganza of
pipes and drums and well-turned calves peeking out from beneath
kilts. It takes place at night, beside Edinburgh Castle, which adds
to the pageantry; (44-131) 225-1188, www.edintattoo.co.uk. Shows
are Monday to Friday at 9 p.m., and Saturday at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m.
Tickets: $12.75 to $36.75.
 &HT;    Devoted to Dadaists and Surrealists such as Ernst, Magritte and
Man Ray, the Dean Gallery, 73 Belford Road, is a beautifully
organized new museum in a grand, neo-Classical former orphanage in
north Edinburgh. An exhibition from Saturday through Oct. 1 will
feature Salvador Dali. Open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Sunday 2 to 5 p.m.; (44-131) 624-6200. The regular collection is
free; the Dali exhibition is $6.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    If the day is spectacularly sunny (it happens sometimes),
celebrate at the Royal Botanic Garden, 70 acres of beautiful
gardens and greenhouses that feature a display of herbaceous
borders during August. Tucked amid all the greenery are a cafe and
shop. The Garden, 20A Inverleith Row, (44-131) 552-7171, is open
daily 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. (6 p.m. in September). Free admission.
 &HT;    The former royal yacht Britannia is docked on Ocean Drive in
Leith, and you can pay $11.55 ($8.95 ages 60 and older, $5.60 ages
5 to 17) to stride its four decks in a monarchical manner. Open
10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday to Thursday, and until 7:30 p.m.
Friday and Saturday; (44-131) 555-5566. Reservations are advised.
 &HT;    It cost hundreds of millions of dollars less than the Millennium
Dome in Greenwich, but Dynamic Earth, a new museum not far from the
royal Palace of Holyroodhouse, is far more successful. This
minidome offers nothing less than the story of Earth in all its
diversity.
 &HT;    Visitors can experience icebergs, volcanoes and tropical rain
forests, among other things, in 11 galleries with stunning special
effects. Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in summer, with last entry at
4:45. Information: (44-131) 550-7800; admission is $10.40, $5.90
ages 5 to 15.
 &HT;    The Museum of Scotland, on Chambers Street, presents a whirlwind
tour of Scottish history. Attractions include an authentic
18th-century guillotine. The top floor is a crazy quilt of objects
_ from golf balls and hairdryers to a Saab convertible to the Queen
song ``Bohemian Rhapsody'' _ that ordinary Scots have identified as
essential to their very being. Open daily. Admission (which also
gets you into the Royal Museum next door) is $4.50, $2.25 for
students and those 60 and older. Free for people under 19, and on
Tuesdays after 4:30 p.m.
 WHERE TO STAY

 &HT;    Just 10 minutes by car from the center of town and easily
reachable by bus, the Malmaison stands in modern splendor in Leith,
a lively and much-revived waterfront neighborhood east of central
Edinburgh.
 &HT;    The hotel, one in an admired British chain, is decorated in cool
earth tones, with clean lines and geometric motifs. The 60 rooms
include five suites. Doubles from $165, with tax. One Tower Place,
Leith; (44-131) 468-5000, fax (44-131) 468-5002.

 &HT;    Luxury: The Bonham, 35 Drumsleugh Gardens, Edinburgh's newest
hip hotel, epitomizes the city's seemingly effortless ability to
combine the old and the new. Constructed from three adjoining town
houses, the hotel has a stately Victorian facade that belies a
thoroughly modern interior, with brash contemporary furniture and
modern art. There are 48 rooms; doubles from $247.50, with tax and
breakfast. If the Bonham is full, its owners will gladly recommend
their other two hotels, the Howard and Channings, which are cozy
and Old World; (800) 323-5463 from the United States, fax (44-131)
226-6080.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Tucked away off the Royal Mile, Dubh Prais, 123B High Street,
offers Scottish dishes lovingly prepared with traditional recipes.
Try collops in the pan, steak medallions in a
port-and-pickled-walnut sauce; for dessert, there's atholl brose
parfait, an unusually tasty ice cream made with toasted oatmeal,
honey and Drambuie. A typical dinner for two, plus wine, costs
about $90. Reservations are essential _ there are only nine tables;
(44-131) 557-5732.
 &HT;    The Tower, at the top of the Museum of Scotland on Chambers
Street, is one of Edinburgh's hottest new restaurants. Appetizers
include sauteed mushrooms with spinach, poached egg and toasted
brioche; for the main course, portions of steak and roast beef come
in three sizes: 8, 12, and 16 ounces. Dinner for two, with wine,
generally comes to about $150. A two-course pre-theater dinner for
$18 is available from 4 to 6 p.m.; (44-131) 225-3003.
 &HT;    Most of Scotland's art galleries and museums feature smart cafes
with tasty dishes. One that stands out is Cafe Newton in the Dean
Gallery, 73 Belford Road. It is open the same hours as the gallery
and offers a small selection of light entrees, like smoked salmon
with creme fraiche, and an eggplant, feta, pesto and olive sandwich
on a choice of bread. A sculpture of Isaac Newton looks down from
the center of the room. Sandwiches average $6.35; daily hot
specials range from $6.75 to $8.25; brownies and other treats cost
from $1.20 to $4.35; no alcohol served.
 &HT;    Tucked into a corner of Hunter Square, not far from the bustle
of the Royal Mile, Bann's vegetarian cafe provides healthful food.
At dinner, appetizers include Thai phyllo parcels with stir-fried
vegetables on wilted bok choy, with a sweet sesame-seed oil
dressing; main courses include tarte tatin made of
 &HT;    layers of roasted sweet pepper, zucchini and cheddar cheese, and
an all-vegetable haggis _ no animal innards to speak of. Dinner for
two, with wine, costs about $60. Open daily 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.;
(44-131) 226-1112.
 &HT;    In the last few years, George Street has overtaken the
increasingly tacky Princes Street nearby as the city's choice
shopping and eating street. One of the nicest restaurants here is
the Dome, in a vast, high-ceilinged building that used to be a
mortuary, then a bank.
 &HT;    At the outside Garden Cafe, enjoy pizza and pasta (weather
permitting) for about $24 for two, wine included; in the Grill
Room, expect to pay from $60 to $75 for two, including wine, at
dinner for dishes that include pheasant and apricot terrine with
red currant dressing. They can both be found under one dome at 14
George Street; (44-131) 624-8624.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANN CRITTENDEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The Canadian Rockies are the only place I know where the
postcards don't lie. The snowcapped mountains and raging torrents
of water really are as spectacular as the glossy photographs make
them seem.
 &HT;    And among its charms, the area is blessed with one of the best
systems of hiking trails to be found anywhere. This is not a
secret; one of the first people to explore the region and to
recognize its hiking potential was Edward Whymper, the conqueror of
the Matterhorn.
 &HT;    On a trip last summer, my husband and I met more Germans, Swiss
and other Europeans on the trails than Americans, drawn to the kind
of civilized wilderness characteristic of Europe in the 19th
century.
 &HT;    At times we felt that we were in the era of Goethe and
Wordsworth, or at least of Frederick Church and Asher Durand and
other American landscape painters. Scenes: on a quiet road,
suddenly surrounded by a herd of male elk, their six- and
seven-point racks bobbing gently as they slowly grazed past us; on
a mountain ledge high above an emerald lake, chatting with
collectors of still unidentified Cambrian fossils; in a forest of
spruce and subalpine fir, motionless as a female moose and her calf
warily cross the path ahead; on a highline trail looking across a
valley at an explosive waterfall 1,000 feet high, with not another
soul in sight. But I'm getting ahead of my story.
 &HT;    Our first priority in planning this two-week trip was to find
good day hiking, allowing us to experience the mountains without
carrying 40-pound packs for days or having to endure the crowds and
the bus terminal madness that now surround the grand old hotels in
Banff and Lake Louise.
 &HT;    Of the five national parks that encompass the prime wilderness
of the Canadian Rockies, we discovered that the best one for our
purposes would be Yoho.
 &HT;    Banff, the first national park in Canada, including the crown
jewel of Lake Louise, is known as the hiking capital of the
country, with a huge network of well-maintained trails. But the
park also has more than five million visitors, most of them in July
and August _ too many to get away from without spending all one's
time above the tree line, sleeping on rocks.
 &HT;    Jasper, a few hours north up the magnificent Icefields Parkway,
has celebrated longer trails, but not too many get-away-from-it-all
day hikes.
 &HT;    Yoho, just west of Lake Louise on the western side of the
Continental Divide, has far fewer visitors (an estimated 1.8
million in 1999)and 185 miles of trails that can take you to the
top of the world and down again in time for a dinner and a book in
front of the fire.
 &HT;    Before we arrived in Yoho we spent a few days in Jasper and the
Lake Louise area. We liked the informal funkiness of the little
town of Jasper and our log cabin (and hot tub) in the woods nearby,
but we had to drive an hour or more each day to find good day
hikes.
 &HT;    We skirted the crowds at Lake Louise by staying eight miles away
at Lake Moraine Lodge, luxuriously rustic in the style of Ralph
Lauren. There a couple of world-class day hikes began right on the
grounds, but the lake itself, an emerald gem, was surrounded by day
trippers.
 &HT;    But on our first day in Yoho we had it all: a vigorous hike with
dazzling views; a glimpse into the geological forces that formed
this region; and seven kinds of weather, including drizzle, sun,
cloudiness and a brief hail storm. For outdoor activities in the
Canadian Rockies, the key word is layers _ rainproof layers.
 &HT;    We had joined a group put together by the Yoho-Burgess Shale
Foundation for a hike up to one of the most important fossil sites
in the world, now a Unesco World Heritage Site.
 &HT;    In 1989, Stephen Jay Gould, in his book ``Wonderful Life,''
described the ``weird wonders'' found here: strange,
500-million-year-old sea creatures displaying a greater disparity
than exists in the animal kingdom today.
 &HT;    The hike is no joke _ 12.5 miles round trip and an elevation
gain of about 2,500 feet, up to an altitude of 6,700 feet _ not
high by Colorado or High Sierra standards, but high enough to be
aware of thin air and aging muscles.
 &HT;    It was utterly worth it. The guide, a geologist named Carole
Augereau, gave us the rundown as we trudged up: how half a billion
years ago this area was the north shore of a vast supercontinent
surrounded by shallow warm seas, teeming with the earliest forms of
multicellular animal life.
 &HT;    Eons later, between 175 million and 45 million years ago, two
separate collisions of continental plates (moving at their fastest
at the speed of a growing fingernail) slowly pushed up the ancient
ocean floors, forming the mountain spines running north-south
through Canada and the United States.
 &HT;    Thus it was that in 1886 railway workers found ``stone bugs''
buried in alpine rocks, and from 1909 to 1917 Charles D. Walcott,
then head of the Smithsonian Institution and the foremost Cambrian
paleontologist of his day, found such marvelous marine
invertebrates as Opabinia, with its five eyes, Aysheaia, with its
mouth surrounded by a ring of tentacles, and the strangest of all,
Hallucigenia, an animal so bizarre that for decades no one knew
which of its sides was up.
 &HT;    To our delight, Dr. Des Collins of the Royal Ontario Museum, who
has been excavating the quarry for 25 years, was at the site when
we arrived. He told us that thanks to discoveries in two new
quarries, in China and Greenland, as well as his own finds, there
is now evidence of even more unclassified Cambrian organisms than a
decade ago.
 &HT;    ``The Cambrian world,'' he said, ``is getting stranger-looking
than ever.''
 &HT;    Dr. Collins passed around a few of that week's finds, some of
which, to a lay person's eye, looked like faint scratchings on dark
grey pieces of shale. A few steps away, half a dozen graduate
students and volunteers were busy chipping away on stacks of muddy
rocks with hammers and chisels.
 &HT;    When I peered into the quarry to have a closer look, a handsome
French scientist looked up at me and said, with deep and
unmistakable pride, ``I just found a worm.''
 &HT;    The view from Burgess Ridge was unparalleled. On our left were
the massive limestone cliffs of Burgess Mountain and on our right
was Mount Wapta. In the distance loomed Michael Peak, the President
and the Vice President, all three covered in snow.
 &HT;    Far below lay Emerald Lake, the largest body of water in Yoho
National Park. (The explorer who gave Emerald Lake its perfect name
had to rename a lake already called Emerald. Its new name: Lake
Louise.)
 &HT;    I have found that one of the principal joys of a hike is
contemplating the pleasures that await its end. Daydreams of the
hot shower, the cool drink, the good meal and the soft bed tend to
crowd out more immediate realities, like the flora and fauna of the
last few knee-crushing kilometers downhill.
 &HT;    Toward the end of this particular 10-hour day the fantasies were
vivid, for we were headed for the Emerald Lake Lodge, another
sybaritic outpost. A few hours later, we were unwinding in a hot
tub overlooking the mountain-ringed lake, perusing a tempting menu
and building a fire in our bedroom. Ah, wilderness!
 &HT;    The next day we took a less strenuous stroll around the lake and
up into the basin behind it. We arranged for a naturalist to
accompany us. A cold, snowy winter and nonexistent spring meant
that the flowering alpine meadows we had hoped to see had still not
appeared, even by mid- to late July, but myriad earlier flowers
were scattered around the lakeside, including the ubiquitous white
globe flowers and bunchberry, wild roses, yellow columbines, bright
orange western wood lilies, purple asters, tiny white and green bog
orchids, and equally delicate twinflower (Linnaea borealis), a
Linnaeus favorite.
 &HT;    We also learned the secret of the mountain lakes' brilliant
turquoise color: a substance called rock flour. As the glaciers
that feed these lakes move down the mountains, the rocks embedded
in their base scrape against other rocks, grinding them into a fine
grayish powder that washes into the lakes as the glaciers melt.
This powder reflects the blue-green part of the light spectrum,
giving the water a hue that would be garish if any painter tried to
capture it.
 &HT;    The next day we were eagerly anticipating another major trek,
this time in the Lake O'Hara area, a uniquely beautiful place of
cirque and rock basin lakes, alpine heath and larch stands, framed
by the same two peaks _ Lefroy and Victoria _ that overlook Lake
Louise on the other side of the great divide. So beautiful is Lake
O'Hara that private vehicles are banned from the road leading into
it and a quota system limits the number of daily visitors to 150 to
200.
 &HT;    A day hiker from the town of Field, for example, has to make a
reservation for one of the six available seats on the daily bus
going in. You have to be at the tourist office at dawn on the
morning before you want to go. Unless you are one of the first six
people there, forget it.
 &HT;    Not being savvy, we arrived at 7 a.m. one morning and lost out.
The next day, seriously determined, we arrived at the still-locked
office by 6 o'clock, and there were only two people ahead of us.
Ten minutes later a young man from Quebec arrived, and there went
the last two spaces.
 &HT;    Literally one minute after that, an older man and his son came
up, only to be told, at 6:15, that they were too late. The
gentleman commented that the sight of the sun coming up over the
mountains had been so magnificent that he had stopped on the
highway several times to take pictures; otherwise, he said
ruefully, he might have made it.
 &HT;    ``That was you?'' the man from Quebec exclaimed. ``I was right
behind you.''
 &HT;    We picked one of the most popular hikes, from Lake O'Hara up to
Lake Oesa, then across a ledge around Yukness Mountain, down to the
Opabin Plateau, and back in time for the 6:30 p.m. bus.
 &HT;    Oesa (the Stoney Indian word for ice, so called because the lake
is frozen nearly year round) was, as predicted, gorgeous. But on
Yukness, big patches of snow still covered the trail, including one
long stretch that curved up and around the mountain with a
precipitous drop on one side.
 &HT;    At this point I remembered that I really am terribly afraid of
heights. I inched my way along the slippery track, digging now my
toes, then my heels, into the footsteps of the fools who had
preceded me. When we were finally back on solid, if not flat,
ground, I literally sobbed, relieved to be alive.
 &HT;    We began to saunter down toward the plateau. Just as I was
beginning to get back into the blissful rhythm of trekking, a voice
cried up at us from far below: ``A mother bear with two cubs!''
 &HT;    The most dangerous kind of bear.
 &HT;    We froze. ``Black or grizzly?'' my husband shouted back. We
didn't hear an answer. He scanned the valley below, and sure
enough, way down there, right where we were heading, were a large
tawny bear and two smaller ones, moving faster than race horses on
a diagonal away from the trail. They didn't look like black bears.
 &HT;    I thought of the ordeal behind me and decided I'd rather face a
grizzly than go back the way we'd come. We took a whistle out of
our pack and started tooting as we came down, making noise,
scanning both sides of the trail constantly, and marching briskly
back to Lake O'Hara. When I looked at the hiking guide later, I
realized that we'd seen nothing of one of the prettiest parts of
that hike.
 &HT;    We did get to be interviewed by the park rangers; a grizzly
sighting is big news, particularly in one of the most popular
hiking areas in the Canadian Rockies. It turned out they knew these
bears well _ they were even tagged. But they weren't supposed to be
hanging around trails those of us who are lower on the food chain
like to frequent.
 &HT;    Our final hike was more satisfying. The trail to take in Yoho is
called the Iceline, and true to its name, it was still partly under
snow even at the end of July. We had put it off until our last day,
which turned out to be a Rocky Mountain high, clear and sunny.
 &HT;    The first mile and a half was steadily uphill, sweetened by an
almost constant view of magnificent Takakkaw Falls, which burst out
of a rock cliff like a giant's broken water main. The trail climbed
high on the open avalanche slopes of the President Range and onto
the moraines of several glaciers, past two half-frozen glacier-fed
tarns.
 &HT;    We were dazzled by the utter stillness and vastness of the bleak
alpine landscape, so close to the glaciers and snowy peaks, and so
far above the Yoho Valley that we felt as if we were in the clouds
looking down.
 &HT;    There were no bears on the way down. Just crunching through
tracks in the snow in shorts and T-shirt, swinging hiking poles
like a cross-country skier, sliding down a snow bank to avoid any
more slippery traverses, down into the forest around another
pristine lake, past a raging river and more plunging falls. Yoho,
by the way, is a Cree word loosely translated as ``awesome.''

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY AURELIA C. SCOTT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The moment of truth came at an outdoor table in the Plaza Nueva
in Granada, although neither of us admitted it. Instead, my
husband, Bob, and I continued to sip our glasses of vino tinto and
roll green olives between tongue and teeth, ejecting the pits with
newly acquired expertise.
 &HT;    The evening sun was refracted through dusty air, gilding the
Gypsies and multinational youth in the plaza. Homeward-bound
Granadans threaded through the crowds carrying grocery bags topped
by market-fresh fruit. Tourists whose fanny packs made them look
bustle-bottomed clustered around displays of postcards, fluttering
lace fans and trays of castanets.
 &HT;    As the shadows lengthened, the day's deafening traffic dwindled
to the whine of motor scooters loaded beyond their capacities with
three, even four clinging passengers. We sipped and watched and
rested our feet, wondering how we would stay awake until Spanish
dinner time at 8:30 p.m. _ 8 p.m. in restaurants that cater to
tourists.
 &HT;    And we wondered, although still not giving voice to the thought,
what to do with the rest of our trip. Not that we didn't have
plans. The plans for this first trip to the land of sun and saffron
and tapas had been made in meticulous detail weeks before our
departure.
 &HT;    I had spent a fine meal's worth of money on Frommer's, Fodor's,
Eyewitness and Let's Go guides and other aides, including
Learn-Spanish-in-Your-Car CDs. We had combed newspaper travel
sections and reread articles clipped from food magazines.
 &HT;    I had followed Internet links from one Spanish travel site to
another until I was bleary-eyed and lost. We had begged friends and
relatives of friends for memories of their own trips.
 &HT;    Finally, knowing too much and not enough, we developed a
two-week itinerary. Not all of Spain, of course. Just what called
to us as we shoveled our way out of yet another Maine winter.
 &HT;    Barcelona because 30 years ago Bob had read Orwell's ``Homage to
Catalonia''; Quatretondeta in the mountains above Alicante for the
small-town experience; Agua Amarga to dip our feet in the
Mediterranean in a still-pretty seaside town; Granada for the
Alhambra; Ronda because it is the most accessible of the Moorish
pueblos blancos; Cordoba for its mosque and old city; Cuenca for
its perilously hanging houses and its location in Castilla-La
Mancha; and Barcelona again to rest before the flight home.
 &HT;    I typed it all up _ flight numbers, hotel names, telephone
numbers, dates of arrival, dates of departure. One copy faxed to
our nearest and dearest, another hand-delivered to friends who
would water our houseplants; a copy in Bob's carry-on; the copy in
my carry-on stapled to a sheaf of hotel confirmation letters and
directions.
 &HT;    Too much? Well, I like lists. Besides, we were heading on the
cusp of high season to a country whose language we do not speak. We
think of ourselves as flexible and adventurous. Yet we have reached
the stage at which we no longer wish to trail our suitcases along
foreign streets looking for a hotel with a vacancy.
 &HT;    And to be honest, Bob does not want to traipse along a dark
corridor to reach the bathroom and I need a mattress that does not
sink to the floor.
 &HT;    Munching on an olive as the sun set on the Plaza Nueva, I
reflected that thus far the plans had been executed practically
perfectly. Barcelona's light and space and elegance had made us
giddy with pleasure.
 &HT;    Arm in arm, we joined the perambulating throngs to walk up and
down, and again up and down the Rambla, the grand tree-lined
boulevard to the sea. Standing before Antoni Gaudi's famous
wave-shaped building, whose wrought-iron balconies writhe like
wind-tossed seaweed, Bob said, ``I could live here.'' Not Casa Mila
specifically, but Barcelona. I agreed.
 &HT;    Once out of Barcelona our rented silver Opel whizzed easily
along the roads, nudged only slightly by the turbulence of passing
BMWs.
 &HT;    Climbing into the mountains, we entered the Spain of my
imagination, all olive trees, grapevines and rock. Quatretondeta's
terraced almond, olive and cherry groves seduced us as much as
Barcelona had. We felt embraced by the welcome at Hotel Els Frares
and by its blissfully comfortable beds.
 &HT;    Walking among the olive trees, we inhaled air scented by
waist-high rosemary growing wild on the hillsides. We greeted
black-clad grandmothers as they stood by their scrubbed doorsteps
on pristine village streets too narrow for car traffic.
 &HT;    ``Buenos dias,'' we said, exaggerating the Castilian
pronunciation in our enthusiasm. No wonder they smiled in response.
 &HT;    On toward the south to Agua Amarga, a fishing village on the
southern coast. It was as pretty as advertised _ a tumble of low,
white buildings leading down to a quiet beach and the bluest blue
Mediterranean. The trip down the mountain took longer than planned;
plotting the mileage in Maine, I had forgotten to take the
slow-going curves of mountain roads into account.
 &HT;    We were at the edge of our patience by the time we pulled up to
the front door of our hotel, the MiKasa. But a cosseted night there
(it felt more like a private villa than a 20-room hotel) restored
us.
 &HT;    Yet now, as the first of our three scheduled days in Granada
sighed to a close, we began to feel burdened by our planning. The
structure of those lists constricted rather than comforted. We were
tired, of course, suffering from a midtrip weariness that is
signaled by a longing for one's own washer and dryer. It's the time
when I want nothing more than a cup of tea made by steeping real
Darjeeling leaves in water that has reached a full rolling boil.
 &HT;    Walking slowly toward a barely 8 p.m. dinner, Bob said, ``I wish
we could have more time in Barcelona,'' just as I said, ``I cannot
remember why we are going to Cordoba.'' We stopped and stared at
each other.
 &HT;    Over lamb chops and garlic grilled chicken at the Restaurante
Gallio on the Plaza Bib-Rambla, we dithered.
 &HT;    ``We'd have to cancel all those reservations.'' ``Immediately,
right away, now,'' I agreed, checking my watch as if it were
already too late.
 &HT;    ``The Barcelona hotels are bound to be full.'' ``Where would we
stop along the way?'' ``We can't make it back in one day.'' ``The
rental-car people might penalize us for returning the car early.''
 &HT;    This last brought us up short. Unable to change our plans
because Avis might punish us?
 &HT;    A shiver of excitement made us grin. We would be on the lam,
playing hooky, leaving at intermission, absent without leave. We
toasted each other with what was left in the bottle.
 &HT;    In the end, it was almost easy. Phrasebook in hand, we called in
our cancellations. We were sorry, sorry, sorry, but, ``si, por
favor, quiero cancelar. Muchas gracias.''
 &HT;    That done, we fretted when our Barcelona hotel proved full for
the new nights we wanted. I flapped the sheaf of canceled hotels at
Bob. ``We've done it now.'' I didn't quite wail, but I was fierce,
as if my sudden loss of mooring were his fault rather than our
shared adventure.
 &HT;    Ultimately, we handed the search over to Barcelona's hotel
reservation bureau, which found what we wanted within an hour.
Amazing.
 &HT;    The next day, we toured the Alhambra with rediscovered
enthusiasm. The day after that we tried two new tapas bars and
succeeded in staying awake for an 8:30 dinner.
 &HT;    On the fourth day, silly with excitement, we pointed our silver
Opel north toward four unencumbered, ribbon-tied days in Barcelona.
 &HT;    And the unplanned night on the road? We consulted the map. What
about visiting Elche, which claims to have the largest palm grove
in Europe? In the land of Quixote we had learned to follow our
hearts, not a schedule.

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  I am planning a trip to Tuscany, Italy, this fall and would
like to stay at a very special place. Can you find one for me?
 &HT;     A:  Palazzo Terranova is in Umbria, a 90-minute drive from
Florence. Perched at 1,800 feet overlooking the Tiber Valley, this
eight-room aerie is quite possibly the best and most beautiful
country-house hideaway in all of Italy.
 &HT;    Palazzo Terranova, which was built in the 18th century, has been
restored by Sarah and Johnny Townsend, a dazzling English couple
who have filled the rooms with family heirlooms, rare antiques, the
work of local artisans and laughter.
 &HT;    The Townsends' passion for Umbria and their wish to share their
experiences is apparent from the moment guests check in. Rooms are
spacious and each is named after an opera. There are no minibars
here, no televisions, no gadgetry. Instead, guests find four-poster
beds, great shuttered windows, 18th-century paintings, beamed
ceilings, trompe l'oeil, soft linens and total peace.
 &HT;    The Townsends have created a sweet retreat here _ each salon is
a work of art done in Old Master colors, and the library is crammed
with books affectionately inscribed by grateful guests.
 &HT;    Each day, the Terranova staff prepares delightful breakfasts to
be enjoyed on the fragrant terrace. Dinners celebrate the fresh
bounty of the Umbrian countryside. The wine cellar holds remarkable
Italian and French wines. A pool, three kitchens for culinary
instruction, a vineyard, an orchard and gardens await visitors.
 &HT;    Umbria's ancient treasures _ its churches, villages, trattorias,
wine country and friendly people _ are just minutes away as are
golf, horses, bikes, painting classes and hot-air balloons.
 &HT;    For all this quality, rates start at an astonishingly low $300 a
night, including breakfast. For more information, call
011-39-075-857-0083, e-mail sarah(AT)palazzoterranova.com or visit
www.palazzoterranova.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I are planning to take our school-age children
to North Carolina's Outer Banks this summer. We keep hearing about
an outdoor drama that tells the story of Roanoke. Do you have any
information?
 &HT;     A:  ``The Lost Colony,'' America's longest-running outdoor
drama, was written in 1937 by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright
Paul Green. It was originally intended to run for one season, but
success has propelled it into its 63rd.
 &HT;    ``The Lost Colony'' uses song, dance, drama and special effects
to tell the story of America's first English settlement (1584-1587)
and its eerie and mysterious disappearance. Impressive costumes and
the voices of the prestigious Westminster Choir College add special
touches to the performance.
 &HT;    The drama is staged at the Waterside Theatre, inside historic
Fort Raleigh. Ancient oak trees, laced with Spanish moss, frame the
theatre, and balmy ocean breezes help set the scene.
 &HT;    The production runs Monday through Saturday every summer from
June through August. Tickets range from $8 to $18, and children are
admitted for half-price on Monday nights. For reservations or more
information, call (800) 488-5012.
 &HT;    Another option is to purchase the Roanoke Island Queen's Pass,
(252) 475-1500. The pass, which costs $27 for adults and $14 for
children, includes admission to ``The Lost Colony,'' as well as the
North Carolina Aquarium, the Elizabethan Gardens and the Roanoke
Island Festival Park.
 &HT;    A great place to stay is the Tranquil House Inn on Manteo's
waterfront. Summer rates range from $149 to $189, and reservations
can be made by calling (800) 458-7069. Don't miss dinner at 1587,
located in the inn.
 &HT;     Q:  I am going to be in the Bahamas with a friend later this
year. While she loves nothing more than lying in the sun, I need a
little more stimulation. What else can one do there?
 &HT;     A:  While the Bahamas are typically known for their
sun-drenched beaches, bronzing bodies and exotic beverages, there
are also a number of other activities to keep you busy. For
example, between Sept. 22 to 24, try your luck at the Fall Black
Jack Tournament held at the Princess Casino on Grand Bahama Island.
 &HT;    The North Eleuthera Sailing Regatta will be held Oct. 12 to 15.
Spectators can watch as locally built sloops sail between Harbour
Island and Three-Island Bay, North Eleuthera.
 &HT;    During the second week of November, both visitors and locals can
take part in the 14th Annual Grand Bahama Conchman Triathlon _ a
.5-mile swim, a 20-mile bike ride and a 3.5- mile run.
 &HT;    And if you're still standing after that, why not get a head
start on your Christmas shopping at Nassau/Paradise Island's
Christmas Jollification Festival. Or try out your fishing skills at
the Annual Bahamas Wahoo Championships. Both events will be held in
early November.
 &HT;    For more information on these and other activities in the
Bahamas, visit www.bahamas.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  I have heard rumors about a series of art exhibits
featuring Los Angeles artists at the Bel Age Hotel and was
wondering if you could give me more information.
 &HT;     A:  Throughout the summer, the Wyndham Bel Age Hotel in West
Hollywood is presenting several eclectic art shows under the banner
``Art &AMP; Soul.'' The shows showcase the latest works from three L.A.
artists combined with live acoustic and jazz music.
 &HT;    The works of two artists can still be viewed this summer season
_ Michael Spalt, until Aug. 15, and J.C. Jaress, from Aug. 16 to
Sept. 12.
 &HT;    Each month the Wyndham Bel Age hosts a ``Meet the Artist''
reception in their La Brasserie Restaurant &AMP; Club, which has been
hailed as ``the best jazz room with a view'' by the Los Angeles
Times. These monthly receptions will also feature tantalizing
appetizers, fine wines and champagne.
 &HT;    For more information, please call La Brasserie at (310)
358-7776. For reservations at the Wyndham Bel Age Hotel, call (800)
WYNDHAM.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The days of the great ocean liners may be long gone, but there
are dozens of other ships making trans-Atlantic crossings that
don't reach the headlines. They're on repositioning cruises, and
major cruise lines such as Celebrity Cruises, Holland America Line
and Seabourn Cruise Line offer them every year.
 &HT;    Cruises lines that sell Mediterranean cruises in summer
typically offer Caribbean cruises in winter. To get their ships
from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean, they take them across the
Atlantic in September or October. In spring, come March and April,
they take them back. The ships are literally repositioned twice a
year, hence the name.
 &HT;    From the Mediterranean, these voyages tend to begin in Greece,
Italy or Spain, sometimes stopping in the Canary Islands before
ending up in the Caribbean. But these itineraries change as well.
Some ships may include stops in Morocco or the Cape Verde Islands
and may end in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., or even New York.
 &HT;    Because each cruise typically has a few ports of call at the
beginning and end of each voyage, the length of a trip is usually
10 to 14 days. Within the business, they're known as ``blue water''
cruises, because the ships may spend a week or more on the open
ocean.
 &HT;    ``They attract well-traveled people who've already been to many
ports,'' Anne Scully explains. Scully, a certified travel counselor
and a vice president at McCabe Bremer Travel (1491 Chain Bridge
Road, Mclean, VA 22101; 800-747-84011; www.mccabebremer.com), adds,
``They get the ship at its best and get to play on it for five or
nine days. It's really a crossing, not a cruise. You get to read a
book from beginning to end.''
 &HT;    Scully sells many such cruises and says the major difference is
that ``on a traditional cruise, you're trying to keep up with the
shore excursions and ports. On a repositioning cruise, you keep up
with your own schedule.''
 &HT;    Traditionally, these cruises offer some of the best values in
the business. They're harder to fill because they're longer and
they occur in shoulder season. That means empty cabins that are
routinely discounted.
 &HT;    Scully speculates that ``people are afraid of them because of
open ocean. But these are big ships with stabilizers. Rogue waves
and rough water do occur, but the QE2, for example, regularly sails
trans-Atlantic from April to December.''
 &HT;    Repositioning cruises have traditionally afforded a prime
opportunity to sample luxury ships at middle-of-the-road prices.
Scully maintains that by shopping carefully, the seagoing public
can get a six-star ship for the price of a three- or four-star
vessel.
 &HT;    ``My rule of thumb is to go for the least expensive cabin on the
best ship,'' Sculley says.
 &HT;    Here's a sample of repositioning cruises this fall. Unless
noted, these are list prices, per person, based on double
occupancy, without airfare. A travel agent or cruise-only agent
should be able to find a good discount on these fares.
 &HT;    Celebrity Cruises (1050 Caribbean Way, Miami, FL 33132;
800-437-3111; www.celebrity-cruises.com) has a 12-night sailing on
the 1,950-passenger Millennium that departs Genoa, Italy, on Nov. 3
and then calls at Livorno, Italy; Villefranche, France; Barcelona
and Cadiz, Spain; and finishes in New York City. Prices start at
$3,209.
 &HT;    Holland America Line (300 Elliott Avenue West, Seattle, WA
98119; 800-426-0327; www.hollandamerica.com) offers a nine-night
cruise on the 1,214-passenger Noordam that departs from Lisbon,
Portugal, on Nov. 28 and calls at Ponta Delgada and Horta in the
Azores, Half Moon Cay, Bahamas, and ends in Fort Lauderdale.
Holland America's ``Early Savings Fares'' start at $1,099.
 &HT;    Seabourn Cruise Line (6100 Blue Lagoon Drive, Suite 400, Miami,
FL 33126; 800-929-9391; www.seabourn.com) has a number of ships
that make trans-Atlantic crossings. Among them is the 116-passenger
Seabourn Goddess II, which departs Oct. 30 from Santa Cruz de
Tenerife, Canary Islands, and calls at Porto Grande, Cape Verde
Islands, before ending at Bridgetown, Barbados. Prices start at
$4,840 for the 10-night cruise.

 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When the Osmond Brothers ask all the veterans of war who attend
their showcase in Branson, Mo., to stand up, nearly one-third of
the crowd rises while the rest of the audience gives a thunderous
round of applause.
 &HT;    This show of respect is a common occurrence at the Osmond
production, one of many in Branson that run daily from breakfast to
bedtime to satisfy the more than 7 million visitors who come to
town each year.
 &HT;    Of those visitors, 2.3 million are veterans who, along with
their families, are treated like VIPs in this heartland town in
south-central Missouri. Some 250 military reunions are held there
annually, and there is even a hotline to help people organize
gatherings of all sorts, including military events. (For more
information, call 21st Century Tours at 877-349-3378.)
 &HT;    Branson's 5,000 residents and performers work hard to welcome
veterans with special treats. One that shouldn't be missed is the
six-day Veterans Homecoming, which takes place each November to
celebrate Veteran's Day. This year's celebration will include an 8K
race in which participants will walk or run _ even roll in
wheelchairs _ and special tributes to those who were bestowed the
Congressional Medal of Honor. In addition, several of the area
shows will be free to the public _ or heavily discounted _ to honor
our country's veterans.
 &HT;    For a schedule of events, write to the Branson Veterans Task
Force, P.O. Box 1726, Branson, MO 65615; or call (417) 337-8387.
 &HT;    
 THE BOOK THAT STARTED IT ALL  
 &HT;    The book ``Shepherd of the Hills,'' a tale about the lives,
loves and deceptions of the Ozark mountain people in the early
1900s, sold more than 1 million copies when it was first published
back in 1907. Its overwhelming popularity played a large part in
putting Branson on the map. Suddenly, people from across the
country wanted to see for themselves some of the ``hillbillies''
described on its pages. Eventually, the book was adapted for the
stage, and today that show is still performed nightly from April
through October.
 &HT;    As part of festivities, audience members who pay an additional
board an open-air train that takes them on an historical tour of
the area. Highlights include passing by the home of Old Matt, one
of the show's primary characters, and the 230-foot Inspiration
Tower, a landmark on the pageant grounds. The tour also includes
special events, such as a bluegrass festival.
 &HT;    The production is great fun, and during intermission the actors
welcome spectators to make their way down to the stage, take part
in a square dance and chat with the cast.
 &HT;    A combination adult ticket for the tour and play costs $27;
admission to the play alone is $21. For more information, call
(800) 653-6288 or visit www.old-matt.com. Please note: Those with
mobility problems should discuss their needs when purchasing
tickets.
 &HT;    Another way to see Branson is to buy a ticket for the Branson
Scenic Railway, (800) 287-2462, a 40-mile round-trip tour onboard a
vintage-car train. Knowledgeable guides give riders a taste of the
local history. Except for mid-December to mid-March, the train runs
daily, including a dinner run Saturday nights from May to December.
The train leaves from the Main Street depot in downtown Branson. An
adult ticket costs $19.35 plus tax.
 &HT;    
 CRAFTSMAN COLLEGE  
 &HT;    Any trip to Branson wouldn't be complete without a stop in
Silver Dollar City _ (800) 952-6626 or www.silverdollarcity.com _
an historically recreated town that takes visitors back in time to
the turn of the century in Ozark country. Here, employees dressed
in period costumes man the rides, restaurants and shops, and many
of the booths show how common goods were once created.
 &HT;    Last fall, Dr. Jack Gillispie of Kimberling City, Mo., spent a
day in Silver Dollar City _ a day that would ultimately lead him to
discover a new hobby. Because of his fascination with metalwork, it
wasn't long before the family practitioner found himself hanging
around the blacksmith's shop. By watching the smithy work and
speaking with the ``locals,'' he learned that he could enroll in a
``Craftsman for a Day'' seminar, which would teach him the basic
skills of forging. Other craft seminars offer instruction in the
finer points of dipping candles and weaving baskets, much like the
locals did years ago, before the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.
 &HT;    On his second visit to Silver Dollar this past April, Gillispie
once again visited the blacksmith shop, but this time he was
immediately handed a costume that helped him blend in with the
other villagers. Then, after a lesson in safety procedures, the
doctor was put to work to the delight of the watching crowd.
 &HT;    Being more adept with a stethoscope than a hammer and anvil,
Gillispie started with a small task _ making a little nail. He then
moved on to crafting a metal hook to hang a flower pot from and,
eventually, a rose that was constructed step by step. ``Mine looked
more like a dandelion,'' he confesses, ``but I really got into it.
It was a blast.''
 &HT;    In fact, Gillispie was so inspired by the class that herecently
ordered his own coal forge and anvil for his home, where he plans
to start tinkering with metalwork and reading a few books on the
subject before returning to Silver Dollar City for more lessons.
 &HT;    The day-long programs range in price from $30 to $125, depending
on the craft. For more information, call (800) 695-1353.
 &HT;    
 MORE TRAINING  
 &HT;    In addition to day-long craft seminars, Silver Dollar City also
offers three- to five-day seminars in specific craft skills. For
example, a pottery seminar with Master Craftsman Todd Nelson is
slated for Sept. 8 to 10, and five woodcarving seminars will be
held March 5 to 9. The longer seminars vary in price from $75 to
$275, depending on the instructor.
 &HT;    For more information about Branson _ including road information
_ call (800) 214-3661, or visit www.branson.tripusa.com on the Web.
You can also visit the city's Web site at www.bransonchamber.com.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By SARAH LYALL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    August may be the best month of all to visit Edinburgh, the most
regal of Scottish cities. Not only are the northern days still
delightfully long, but it is also the month for the Edinburgh
International Festival, a world-renowned feast of music, dance and
theater.
 &HT;    Most of Edinburgh is given over to the festival, as
international companies, including the New York City Ballet, Czech
Philharmonic Orchestra and Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm,
take over theaters and concert halls, leaving the visitor
thoroughly spoiled for choice.
 &HT;    It has been a year since Scotland embarked on a bold democratic
experiment, swearing in its first England-free Parliament in almost
300 years and getting to run its own affairs when it comes to
things such as education and health.
 &HT;    The new legislators have yet to move into their custom-made
building at Holyrood, but construction can be observed in the Old
City, on Edinburgh's south side. When Parliament is in session, the
legislators themselves can be seen building Scotland's new
political order in their temporary headquarters, near the George IV
Bridge.
 &HT;    One caveat: it is normal, while visiting Edinburgh, to become
unduly obsessed with the vicissitudes of Scottish weather. It can
be cold; it can be hot; rain is generally lurking somewhere on the
horizon. The best course is to plan for the worst, but hope for the
best.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    From Aug. 13 to Sept. 2, Edinburgh will feast on the dizzyingly
eclectic smorgasbord that is the Edinburgh International Festival.
For tickets and a full list of events, call the festival office at
(44-131) 473-2000 (www.eif.co.uk) or Globaltickets at (800)
223-6108 in the United States.
 &HT;    Tickets can also be purchased at the Hub, the festival's
handsome new headquarters _ a prime spot for eating and shopping,
too _ on the Royal Mile in the Old City. Here are some highlights:
 &HT;    On Sept. 1, the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra will be performing
Janacek's Sinfonietta and Mahler's ``Das Lied von der Erde,'' a
lyrical meditation on death and nature. Curtain time is 8 p.m. at
Usher Hall on Lothian Road. Tickets from $7.50 to $58.50
(calculated at $1.50 to the pound).
 &HT;    The pianist Christian Zacharias will direct and accompany the
Scottish Chamber Orchestra in a rendering of the complete cycle of
Mozart's piano concertos, over seven nights between Aug. 14 and 27
at Usher Hall. Tickets $7.50 to $46.50.
 &HT;    Another of the festival's delights is seeing a play in a foreign
language. This year's possibilities include a German ``Hamlet'' and
a Spanish play called ``One thousand five hundred meters above the
level of Jack,'' about a deep-sea diver teetering on the edge of
madness. All have English supertitles. On various dates; tickets
from $9 to $33.75.
 &HT;    The Netherlands Dance Theater _ really three companies in one,
with each made up of dancers at different points in their careers _
is presenting a program of bold, sexy dancing over five nights,
from Aug. 29 to Sept. 2. And on Aug. 30 and 31, dancers from NDT1,
the main company, will dance to music played by the Czech
Philharmonic Orchestra, with Sir Charles Mackerras conducting.
Performances are at 7:30 p.m. at various sites; tickets, $7.50 to
$55.50.
 &HT;    There also is the well-known but much less formalized Edinburgh
Fringe Festival, which features stand-up comedy, theater, skits,
dance, music and mime in halls, parks, clubs and on the streets.
Performances run Aug. 6 to 28; (44-131) 226-5138; www.edfringe.com.
Admission to some performances is free; tickets range up to $22.50.
 &HT;    From Aug. 4 to 26, Edinburgh is also celebrating the 50th
anniversary of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, an extravaganza of
pipes and drums and well-turned calves peeking out from beneath
kilts. It takes place at night, beside Edinburgh Castle, which adds
to the pageantry; (44-131) 225-1188, www.edintattoo.co.uk. Shows
are Monday to Friday at 9 p.m., and Saturday at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m.
Tickets: $12.75 to $36.75.
 &HT;    Devoted to Dadaists and Surrealists such as Ernst, Magritte and
Man Ray, the Dean Gallery, 73 Belford Road, is a beautifully
organized new museum in a grand, neo-Classical former orphanage in
north Edinburgh. An exhibition from Saturday through Oct. 1 will
feature Salvador Dali. Open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Sunday 2 to 5 p.m.; (44-131) 624-6200. The regular collection is
free; the Dali exhibition is $6.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    If the day is spectacularly sunny (it happens sometimes),
celebrate at the Royal Botanic Garden, 70 acres of beautiful
gardens and greenhouses that feature a display of herbaceous
borders during August. Tucked amid all the greenery are a cafe and
shop. The Garden, 20A Inverleith Row, (44-131) 552-7171, is open
daily 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. (6 p.m. in September). Free admission.
 &HT;    The former royal yacht Britannia is docked on Ocean Drive in
Leith, and you can pay $11.55 ($8.95 ages 60 and older, $5.60 ages
5 to 17) to stride its four decks in a monarchical manner. Open
10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday to Thursday, and until 7:30 p.m.
Friday and Saturday; (44-131) 555-5566. Reservations are advised.
 &HT;    It cost hundreds of millions of dollars less than the Millennium
Dome in Greenwich, but Dynamic Earth, a new museum not far from the
royal Palace of Holyroodhouse, is far more successful. This
minidome offers nothing less than the story of Earth in all its
diversity.
 &HT;    Visitors can experience icebergs, volcanoes and tropical rain
forests, among other things, in 11 galleries with stunning special
effects. Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in summer, with last entry at
4:45. Information: (44-131) 550-7800; admission is $10.40, $5.90
ages 5 to 15.
 &HT;    The Museum of Scotland, on Chambers Street, presents a whirlwind
tour of Scottish history. Attractions include an authentic
18th-century guillotine. The top floor is a crazy quilt of objects
_ from golf balls and hairdryers to a Saab convertible to the Queen
song ``Bohemian Rhapsody'' _ that ordinary Scots have identified as
essential to their very being. Open daily. Admission (which also
gets you into the Royal Museum next door) is $4.50, $2.25 for
students and those 60 and older. Free for people under 19, and on
Tuesdays after 4:30 p.m.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Rooms are scarce during the festival. For 11th-hour help, try
www.edinburgh.org, which has a listing of hotels, or (44-131)
473-3800. For rooms in private homes at festival time, call
(44-131) 225-1101.
 &HT;    Just 10 minutes by car from the center of town and easily
reachable by bus, the Malmaison stands in modern splendor in Leith,
a lively and much-revived waterfront neighborhood east of central
Edinburgh.
 &HT;    The hotel, one in an admired British chain, is decorated in cool
earth tones, with clean lines and geometric motifs. The 60 rooms
include five suites. Doubles from $165, with tax. One Tower Place,
Leith; (44-131) 468-5000, fax (44-131) 468-5002.
 &HT;    The recently refurbished Edinburgh Royal Circus Hotel, 19-21
Royal Circus, in a handsome Georgian building in central Edinburgh,
offers 30 rooms, friendly service, garden views and easy access to
major attractions. Doubles are $144, tax and breakfast included;
(44-131) 220-5000, fax (44-131) 220-2020.
 &HT;    Budget: The Ashlyn Guest House, 42 Inverleith Row near the
Botanic Garden, is one of scores of small family-run hotels that
offer all the comforts of someone else's home at reasonable prices.
Five of the eight bedrooms have private baths. No smoking. Doubles
start at $45 a person, breakfast included. Telephone and fax
(44-131) 552-2954.
 &HT;    The Borthwick Guest House, at 23 Mayfield Gardens on the city's
south side, offers 11 bedrooms, all with private baths. Doubles
from $45 per person, breakfast included; (44-131) 667-8475, fax
(44-131) 667-6763.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Bonham, 35 Drumsleugh Gardens, Edinburgh's newest
hip hotel, epitomizes the city's seemingly effortless ability to
combine the old and the new. Constructed from three adjoining town
houses, the hotel has a stately Victorian facade that belies a
thoroughly modern interior, with brash contemporary furniture and
modern art. There are 48 rooms; doubles from $247.50, with tax and
breakfast. If the Bonham is full, its owners will gladly recommend
their other two hotels, the Howard and Channings, which are cozy
and Old World; (800) 323-5463 from the United States, fax (44-131)
226-6080.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Tucked away off the Royal Mile, Dubh Prais, 123B High Street,
offers Scottish dishes lovingly prepared with traditional recipes.
Try collops in the pan, steak medallions in a
port-and-pickled-walnut sauce; for dessert, there's atholl brose
parfait, an unusually tasty ice cream made with toasted oatmeal,
honey and Drambuie. A typical dinner for two, plus wine, costs
about $90. Reservations are essential _ there are only nine tables;
(44-131) 557-5732.
 &HT;    The Tower, at the top of the Museum of Scotland on Chambers
Street, is one of Edinburgh's hottest new restaurants. Appetizers
include sauteed mushrooms with spinach, poached egg and toasted
brioche; for the main course, portions of steak and roast beef come
in three sizes: 8, 12, and 16 ounces. Dinner for two, with wine,
generally comes to about $150. A two-course pre-theater dinner for
$18 is available from 4 to 6 p.m.; (44-131) 225-3003.
 &HT;    Most of Scotland's art galleries and museums feature smart cafes
with tasty dishes. One that stands out is Cafe Newton in the Dean
Gallery, 73 Belford Road. It is open the same hours as the gallery
and offers a small selection of light entrees, like smoked salmon
with creme fraiche, and an eggplant, feta, pesto and olive sandwich
on a choice of bread. A sculpture of Isaac Newton looks down from
the center of the room. Sandwiches average $6.35; daily hot
specials range from $6.75 to $8.25; brownies and other treats cost
from $1.20 to $4.35; no alcohol served.
 &HT;    Tucked into a corner of Hunter Square, not far from the bustle
of the Royal Mile, Bann's vegetarian cafe provides healthful food.
At dinner, appetizers include Thai phyllo parcels with stir-fried
vegetables on wilted bok choy, with a sweet sesame-seed oil
dressing; main courses include tarte tatin made of
 &HT;    layers of roasted sweet pepper, zucchini and cheddar cheese, and
an all-vegetable haggis _ no animal innards to speak of. Dinner for
two, with wine, costs about $60. Open daily 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.;
(44-131) 226-1112.
 &HT;    In the last few years, George Street has overtaken the
increasingly tacky Princes Street nearby as the city's choice
shopping and eating street. One of the nicest restaurants here is
the Dome, in a vast, high-ceilinged building that used to be a
mortuary, then a bank.
 &HT;    At the outside Garden Cafe, enjoy pizza and pasta (weather
permitting) for about $24 for two, wine included; in the Grill
Room, expect to pay from $60 to $75 for two, including wine, at
dinner for dishes that include pheasant and apricot terrine with
red currant dressing. They can both be found under one dome at 14
George Street; (44-131) 624-8624.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANN CRITTENDEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The Canadian Rockies are the only place I know where the
postcards don't lie. The snowcapped mountains and raging torrents
of water really are as spectacular as the glossy photographs make
them seem.
 &HT;    And among its charms, the area is blessed with one of the best
systems of hiking trails to be found anywhere. This is not a
secret; one of the first people to explore the region and to
recognize its hiking potential was Edward Whymper, the conqueror of
the Matterhorn.
 &HT;    On a trip last summer, my husband and I met more Germans, Swiss
and other Europeans on the trails than Americans, drawn to the kind
of civilized wilderness characteristic of Europe in the 19th
century.
 &HT;    At times we felt that we were in the era of Goethe and
Wordsworth, or at least of Frederick Church and Asher Durand and
other American landscape painters. Scenes: on a quiet road,
suddenly surrounded by a herd of male elk, their six- and
seven-point racks bobbing gently as they slowly grazed past us; on
a mountain ledge high above an emerald lake, chatting with
collectors of still unidentified Cambrian fossils; in a forest of
spruce and subalpine fir, motionless as a female moose and her calf
warily cross the path ahead; on a highline trail looking across a
valley at an explosive waterfall 1,000 feet high, with not another
soul in sight. But I'm getting ahead of my story.
 &HT;    Our first priority in planning this two-week trip was to find
good day hiking, allowing us to experience the mountains without
carrying 40-pound packs for days or having to endure the crowds and
the bus terminal madness that now surround the grand old hotels in
Banff and Lake Louise.
 &HT;    Of the five national parks that encompass the prime wilderness
of the Canadian Rockies, we discovered that the best one for our
purposes would be Yoho.
 &HT;    Banff, the first national park in Canada, including the crown
jewel of Lake Louise, is known as the hiking capital of the
country, with a huge network of well-maintained trails. But the
park also has more than five million visitors, most of them in July
and August _ too many to get away from without spending all one's
time above the tree line, sleeping on rocks.
 &HT;    Jasper, a few hours north up the magnificent Icefields Parkway,
has celebrated longer trails, but not too many get-away-from-it-all
day hikes.
 &HT;    Yoho, just west of Lake Louise on the western side of the
Continental Divide, has far fewer visitors (an estimated 1.8
million in 1999)and 185 miles of trails that can take you to the
top of the world and down again in time for a dinner and a book in
front of the fire.
 &HT;    Before we arrived in Yoho we spent a few days in Jasper and the
Lake Louise area. We liked the informal funkiness of the little
town of Jasper and our log cabin (and hot tub) in the woods nearby,
but we had to drive an hour or more each day to find good day
hikes.
 &HT;    We skirted the crowds at Lake Louise by staying eight miles away
at Lake Moraine Lodge, luxuriously rustic in the style of Ralph
Lauren. There a couple of world-class day hikes began right on the
grounds, but the lake itself, an emerald gem, was surrounded by day
trippers.
 &HT;    But on our first day in Yoho we had it all: a vigorous hike with
dazzling views; a glimpse into the geological forces that formed
this region; and seven kinds of weather, including drizzle, sun,
cloudiness and a brief hail storm. For outdoor activities in the
Canadian Rockies, the key word is layers _ rainproof layers.
 &HT;    We had joined a group put together by the Yoho-Burgess Shale
Foundation for a hike up to one of the most important fossil sites
in the world, now a Unesco World Heritage Site.
 &HT;    In 1989, Stephen Jay Gould, in his book ``Wonderful Life,''
described the ``weird wonders'' found here: strange,
500-million-year-old sea creatures displaying a greater disparity
than exists in the animal kingdom today.
 &HT;    The hike is no joke _ 12.5 miles round trip and an elevation
gain of about 2,500 feet, up to an altitude of 6,700 feet _ not
high by Colorado or High Sierra standards, but high enough to be
aware of thin air and aging muscles.
 &HT;    It was utterly worth it. The guide, a geologist named Carole
Augereau, gave us the rundown as we trudged up: how half a billion
years ago this area was the north shore of a vast supercontinent
surrounded by shallow warm seas, teeming with the earliest forms of
multicellular animal life.
 &HT;    Eons later, between 175 million and 45 million years ago, two
separate collisions of continental plates (moving at their fastest
at the speed of a growing fingernail) slowly pushed up the ancient
ocean floors, forming the mountain spines running north-south
through Canada and the United States.
 &HT;    Thus it was that in 1886 railway workers found ``stone bugs''
buried in alpine rocks, and from 1909 to 1917 Charles D. Walcott,
then head of the Smithsonian Institution and the foremost Cambrian
paleontologist of his day, found such marvelous marine
invertebrates as Opabinia, with its five eyes, Aysheaia, with its
mouth surrounded by a ring of tentacles, and the strangest of all,
Hallucigenia, an animal so bizarre that for decades no one knew
which of its sides was up.
 &HT;    To our delight, Dr. Des Collins of the Royal Ontario Museum, who
has been excavating the quarry for 25 years, was at the site when
we arrived. He told us that thanks to discoveries in two new
quarries, in China and Greenland, as well as his own finds, there
is now evidence of even more unclassified Cambrian organisms than a
decade ago.
 &HT;    ``The Cambrian world,'' he said, ``is getting stranger-looking
than ever.''
 &HT;    Dr. Collins passed around a few of that week's finds, some of
which, to a lay person's eye, looked like faint scratchings on dark
grey pieces of shale. A few steps away, half a dozen graduate
students and volunteers were busy chipping away on stacks of muddy
rocks with hammers and chisels.
 &HT;    When I peered into the quarry to have a closer look, a handsome
French scientist looked up at me and said, with deep and
unmistakable pride, ``I just found a worm.''
 &HT;    The view from Burgess Ridge was unparalleled. On our left were
the massive limestone cliffs of Burgess Mountain and on our right
was Mount Wapta. In the distance loomed Michael Peak, the President
and the Vice President, all three covered in snow.
 &HT;    Far below lay Emerald Lake, the largest body of water in Yoho
National Park. (The explorer who gave Emerald Lake its perfect name
had to rename a lake already called Emerald. Its new name: Lake
Louise.)
 &HT;    I have found that one of the principal joys of a hike is
contemplating the pleasures that await its end. Daydreams of the
hot shower, the cool drink, the good meal and the soft bed tend to
crowd out more immediate realities, like the flora and fauna of the
last few knee-crushing kilometers downhill.
 &HT;    Toward the end of this particular 10-hour day the fantasies were
vivid, for we were headed for the Emerald Lake Lodge, another
sybaritic outpost. A few hours later, we were unwinding in a hot
tub overlooking the mountain-ringed lake, perusing a tempting menu
and building a fire in our bedroom. Ah, wilderness!
 &HT;    The next day we took a less strenuous stroll around the lake and
up into the basin behind it. We arranged for a naturalist to
accompany us. A cold, snowy winter and nonexistent spring meant
that the flowering alpine meadows we had hoped to see had still not
appeared, even by mid- to late July, but myriad earlier flowers
were scattered around the lakeside, including the ubiquitous white
globe flowers and bunchberry, wild roses, yellow columbines, bright
orange western wood lilies, purple asters, tiny white and green bog
orchids, and equally delicate twinflower (Linnaea borealis), a
Linnaeus favorite.
 &HT;    We also learned the secret of the mountain lakes' brilliant
turquoise color: a substance called rock flour. As the glaciers
that feed these lakes move down the mountains, the rocks embedded
in their base scrape against other rocks, grinding them into a fine
grayish powder that washes into the lakes as the glaciers melt.
This powder reflects the blue-green part of the light spectrum,
giving the water a hue that would be garish if any painter tried to
capture it.
 &HT;    The next day we were eagerly anticipating another major trek,
this time in the Lake O'Hara area, a uniquely beautiful place of
cirque and rock basin lakes, alpine heath and larch stands, framed
by the same two peaks _ Lefroy and Victoria _ that overlook Lake
Louise on the other side of the great divide. So beautiful is Lake
O'Hara that private vehicles are banned from the road leading into
it and a quota system limits the number of daily visitors to 150 to
200.
 &HT;    A day hiker from the town of Field, for example, has to make a
reservation for one of the six available seats on the daily bus
going in. You have to be at the tourist office at dawn on the
morning before you want to go. Unless you are one of the first six
people there, forget it.
 &HT;    Not being savvy, we arrived at 7 a.m. one morning and lost out.
The next day, seriously determined, we arrived at the still-locked
office by 6 o'clock, and there were only two people ahead of us.
Ten minutes later a young man from Quebec arrived, and there went
the last two spaces.
 &HT;    Literally one minute after that, an older man and his son came
up, only to be told, at 6:15, that they were too late. The
gentleman commented that the sight of the sun coming up over the
mountains had been so magnificent that he had stopped on the
highway several times to take pictures; otherwise, he said
ruefully, he might have made it.
 &HT;    ``That was you?'' the man from Quebec exclaimed. ``I was right
behind you.''
 &HT;    We picked one of the most popular hikes, from Lake O'Hara up to
Lake Oesa, then across a ledge around Yukness Mountain, down to the
Opabin Plateau, and back in time for the 6:30 p.m. bus.
 &HT;    Oesa (the Stoney Indian word for ice, so called because the lake
is frozen nearly year round) was, as predicted, gorgeous. But on
Yukness, big patches of snow still covered the trail, including one
long stretch that curved up and around the mountain with a
precipitous drop on one side.
 &HT;    At this point I remembered that I really am terribly afraid of
heights. I inched my way along the slippery track, digging now my
toes, then my heels, into the footsteps of the fools who had
preceded me. When we were finally back on solid, if not flat,
ground, I literally sobbed, relieved to be alive.
 &HT;    We began to saunter down toward the plateau. Just as I was
beginning to get back into the blissful rhythm of trekking, a voice
cried up at us from far below: ``A mother bear with two cubs!''
 &HT;    The most dangerous kind of bear.
 &HT;    We froze. ``Black or grizzly?'' my husband shouted back. We
didn't hear an answer. He scanned the valley below, and sure
enough, way down there, right where we were heading, were a large
tawny bear and two smaller ones, moving faster than race horses on
a diagonal away from the trail. They didn't look like black bears.
 &HT;    I thought of the ordeal behind me and decided I'd rather face a
grizzly than go back the way we'd come. We took a whistle out of
our pack and started tooting as we came down, making noise,
scanning both sides of the trail constantly, and marching briskly
back to Lake O'Hara. When I looked at the hiking guide later, I
realized that we'd seen nothing of one of the prettiest parts of
that hike.
 &HT;    We did get to be interviewed by the park rangers; a grizzly
sighting is big news, particularly in one of the most popular
hiking areas in the Canadian Rockies. It turned out they knew these
bears well _ they were even tagged. But they weren't supposed to be
hanging around trails those of us who are lower on the food chain
like to frequent.
 &HT;    Our final hike was more satisfying. The trail to take in Yoho is
called the Iceline, and true to its name, it was still partly under
snow even at the end of July. We had put it off until our last day,
which turned out to be a Rocky Mountain high, clear and sunny.
 &HT;    The first mile and a half was steadily uphill, sweetened by an
almost constant view of magnificent Takakkaw Falls, which burst out
of a rock cliff like a giant's broken water main. The trail climbed
high on the open avalanche slopes of the President Range and onto
the moraines of several glaciers, past two half-frozen glacier-fed
tarns.
 &HT;    We were dazzled by the utter stillness and vastness of the bleak
alpine landscape, so close to the glaciers and snowy peaks, and so
far above the Yoho Valley that we felt as if we were in the clouds
looking down.
 &HT;    There were no bears on the way down. Just crunching through
tracks in the snow in shorts and T-shirt, swinging hiking poles
like a cross-country skier, sliding down a snow bank to avoid any
more slippery traverses, down into the forest around another
pristine lake, past a raging river and more plunging falls. Yoho,
by the way, is a Cree word loosely translated as ``awesome.''

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY AURELIA C. SCOTT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The moment of truth came at an outdoor table in the Plaza Nueva
in Granada, although neither of us admitted it. Instead, my
husband, Bob, and I continued to sip our glasses of vino tinto and
roll green olives between tongue and teeth, ejecting the pits with
newly acquired expertise.
 &HT;    The evening sun was refracted through dusty air, gilding the
Gypsies and multinational youth in the plaza. Homeward-bound
Granadans threaded through the crowds carrying grocery bags topped
by market-fresh fruit. Tourists whose fanny packs made them look
bustle-bottomed clustered around displays of postcards, fluttering
lace fans and trays of castanets.
 &HT;    As the shadows lengthened, the day's deafening traffic dwindled
to the whine of motor scooters loaded beyond their capacities with
three, even four clinging passengers. We sipped and watched and
rested our feet, wondering how we would stay awake until Spanish
dinner time at 8:30 p.m. _ 8 p.m. in restaurants that cater to
tourists.
 &HT;    And we wondered, although still not giving voice to the thought,
what to do with the rest of our trip. Not that we didn't have
plans. The plans for this first trip to the land of sun and saffron
and tapas had been made in meticulous detail weeks before our
departure.
 &HT;    I had spent a fine meal's worth of money on Frommer's, Fodor's,
Eyewitness and Let's Go guides and other aides, including
Learn-Spanish-in-Your-Car CDs. We had combed newspaper travel
sections and reread articles clipped from food magazines.
 &HT;    I had followed Internet links from one Spanish travel site to
another until I was bleary-eyed and lost. We had begged friends and
relatives of friends for memories of their own trips.
 &HT;    Finally, knowing too much and not enough, we developed a
two-week itinerary. Not all of Spain, of course. Just what called
to us as we shoveled our way out of yet another Maine winter.
 &HT;    Barcelona because 30 years ago Bob had read Orwell's ``Homage to
Catalonia''; Quatretondeta in the mountains above Alicante for the
small-town experience; Agua Amarga to dip our feet in the
Mediterranean in a still-pretty seaside town; Granada for the
Alhambra; Ronda because it is the most accessible of the Moorish
pueblos blancos; Cordoba for its mosque and old city; Cuenca for
its perilously hanging houses and its location in Castilla-La
Mancha; and Barcelona again to rest before the flight home.
 &HT;    I typed it all up _ flight numbers, hotel names, telephone
numbers, dates of arrival, dates of departure. One copy faxed to
our nearest and dearest, another hand-delivered to friends who
would water our houseplants; a copy in Bob's carry-on; the copy in
my carry-on stapled to a sheaf of hotel confirmation letters and
directions.
 &HT;    Too much? Well, I like lists. Besides, we were heading on the
cusp of high season to a country whose language we do not speak. We
think of ourselves as flexible and adventurous. Yet we have reached
the stage at which we no longer wish to trail our suitcases along
foreign streets looking for a hotel with a vacancy.
 &HT;    And to be honest, Bob does not want to traipse along a dark
corridor to reach the bathroom and I need a mattress that does not
sink to the floor.
 &HT;    Munching on an olive as the sun set on the Plaza Nueva, I
reflected that thus far the plans had been executed practically
perfectly. Barcelona's light and space and elegance had made us
giddy with pleasure.
 &HT;    Arm in arm, we joined the perambulating throngs to walk up and
down, and again up and down the Rambla, the grand tree-lined
boulevard to the sea. Standing before Antoni Gaudi's famous
wave-shaped building, whose wrought-iron balconies writhe like
wind-tossed seaweed, Bob said, ``I could live here.'' Not Casa Mila
specifically, but Barcelona. I agreed.
 &HT;    Once out of Barcelona our rented silver Opel whizzed easily
along the roads, nudged only slightly by the turbulence of passing
BMWs.
 &HT;    Climbing into the mountains, we entered the Spain of my
imagination, all olive trees, grapevines and rock. Quatretondeta's
terraced almond, olive and cherry groves seduced us as much as
Barcelona had. We felt embraced by the welcome at Hotel Els Frares
and by its blissfully comfortable beds.
 &HT;    Walking among the olive trees, we inhaled air scented by
waist-high rosemary growing wild on the hillsides. We greeted
black-clad grandmothers as they stood by their scrubbed doorsteps
on pristine village streets too narrow for car traffic.
 &HT;    ``Buenos dias,'' we said, exaggerating the Castilian
pronunciation in our enthusiasm. No wonder they smiled in response.
 &HT;    On toward the south to Agua Amarga, a fishing village on the
southern coast. It was as pretty as advertised _ a tumble of low,
white buildings leading down to a quiet beach and the bluest blue
Mediterranean. The trip down the mountain took longer than planned;
plotting the mileage in Maine, I had forgotten to take the
slow-going curves of mountain roads into account.
 &HT;    We were at the edge of our patience by the time we pulled up to
the front door of our hotel, the MiKasa. But a cosseted night there
(it felt more like a private villa than a 20-room hotel) restored
us.
 &HT;    Yet now, as the first of our three scheduled days in Granada
sighed to a close, we began to feel burdened by our planning. The
structure of those lists constricted rather than comforted. We were
tired, of course, suffering from a midtrip weariness that is
signaled by a longing for one's own washer and dryer. It's the time
when I want nothing more than a cup of tea made by steeping real
Darjeeling leaves in water that has reached a full rolling boil.
 &HT;    Walking slowly toward a barely 8 p.m. dinner, Bob said, ``I wish
we could have more time in Barcelona,'' just as I said, ``I cannot
remember why we are going to Cordoba.'' We stopped and stared at
each other.
 &HT;    Over lamb chops and garlic grilled chicken at the Restaurante
Gallio on the Plaza Bib-Rambla, we dithered.
 &HT;    ``We'd have to cancel all those reservations.'' ``Immediately,
right away, now,'' I agreed, checking my watch as if it were
already too late.
 &HT;    ``The Barcelona hotels are bound to be full.'' ``Where would we
stop along the way?'' ``We can't make it back in one day.'' ``The
rental-car people might penalize us for returning the car early.''
 &HT;    This last brought us up short. Unable to change our plans
because Avis might punish us?
 &HT;    A shiver of excitement made us grin. We would be on the lam,
playing hooky, leaving at intermission, absent without leave. We
toasted each other with what was left in the bottle.
 &HT;    In the end, it was almost easy. Phrasebook in hand, we called in
our cancellations. We were sorry, sorry, sorry, but, ``si, por
favor, quiero cancelar. Muchas gracias.''
 &HT;    That done, we fretted when our Barcelona hotel proved full for
the new nights we wanted. I flapped the sheaf of canceled hotels at
Bob. ``We've done it now.'' I didn't quite wail, but I was fierce,
as if my sudden loss of mooring were his fault rather than our
shared adventure.
 &HT;    Ultimately, we handed the search over to Barcelona's hotel
reservation bureau, which found what we wanted within an hour.
Amazing.
 &HT;    The next day, we toured the Alhambra with rediscovered
enthusiasm. The day after that we tried two new tapas bars and
succeeded in staying awake for an 8:30 dinner.
 &HT;    On the fourth day, silly with excitement, we pointed our silver
Opel north toward four unencumbered, ribbon-tied days in Barcelona.
 &HT;    And the unplanned night on the road? We consulted the map. What
about visiting Elche, which claims to have the largest palm grove
in Europe? In the land of Quixote we had learned to follow our
hearts, not a schedule.

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  I am planning a trip to Tuscany, Italy, this fall and would
like to stay at a very special place. Can you find one for me?
 &HT;     A:  Palazzo Terranova is in Umbria, a 90-minute drive from
Florence. Perched at 1,800 feet overlooking the Tiber Valley, this
eight-room aerie is quite possibly the best and most beautiful
country-house hideaway in all of Italy.
 &HT;    Palazzo Terranova, which was built in the 18th century, has been
restored by Sarah and Johnny Townsend, a dazzling English couple
who have filled the rooms with family heirlooms, rare antiques, the
work of local artisans and laughter.
 &HT;    The Townsends' passion for Umbria and their wish to share their
experiences is apparent from the moment guests check in. Rooms are
spacious and each is named after an opera. There are no minibars
here, no televisions, no gadgetry. Instead, guests find four-poster
beds, great shuttered windows, 18th-century paintings, beamed
ceilings, trompe l'oeil, soft linens and total peace.
 &HT;    The Townsends have created a sweet retreat here _ each salon is
a work of art done in Old Master colors, and the library is crammed
with books affectionately inscribed by grateful guests.
 &HT;    Each day, the Terranova staff prepares delightful breakfasts to
be enjoyed on the fragrant terrace. Dinners celebrate the fresh
bounty of the Umbrian countryside. The wine cellar holds remarkable
Italian and French wines. A pool, three kitchens for culinary
instruction, a vineyard, an orchard and gardens await visitors.
 &HT;    Umbria's ancient treasures _ its churches, villages, trattorias,
wine country and friendly people _ are just minutes away as are
golf, horses, bikes, painting classes and hot-air balloons.
 &HT;    For all this quality, rates start at an astonishingly low $300 a
night, including breakfast. For more information, call
011-39-075-857-0083, e-mail sarah(AT)palazzoterranova.com or visit
www.palazzoterranova.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I are planning to take our school-age children
to North Carolina's Outer Banks this summer. We keep hearing about
an outdoor drama that tells the story of Roanoke. Do you have any
information?
 &HT;     A:  ``The Lost Colony,'' America's longest-running outdoor
drama, was written in 1937 by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright
Paul Green. It was originally intended to run for one season, but
success has propelled it into its 63rd.
 &HT;    ``The Lost Colony'' uses song, dance, drama and special effects
to tell the story of America's first English settlement (1584-1587)
and its eerie and mysterious disappearance. Impressive costumes and
the voices of the prestigious Westminster Choir College add special
touches to the performance.
 &HT;    The drama is staged at the Waterside Theatre, inside historic
Fort Raleigh. Ancient oak trees, laced with Spanish moss, frame the
theatre, and balmy ocean breezes help set the scene.
 &HT;    The production runs Monday through Saturday every summer from
June through August. Tickets range from $8 to $18, and children are
admitted for half-price on Monday nights. For reservations or more
information, call (800) 488-5012.
 &HT;    Another option is to purchase the Roanoke Island Queen's Pass,
(252) 475-1500. The pass, which costs $27 for adults and $14 for
children, includes admission to ``The Lost Colony,'' as well as the
North Carolina Aquarium, the Elizabethan Gardens and the Roanoke
Island Festival Park.
 &HT;    A great place to stay is the Tranquil House Inn on Manteo's
waterfront. Summer rates range from $149 to $189, and reservations
can be made by calling (800) 458-7069. Don't miss dinner at 1587,
located in the inn.
 &HT;     Q:  I am going to be in the Bahamas with a friend later this
year. While she loves nothing more than lying in the sun, I need a
little more stimulation. What else can one do there?
 &HT;     A:  While the Bahamas are typically known for their
sun-drenched beaches, bronzing bodies and exotic beverages, there
are also a number of other activities to keep you busy. For
example, between Sept. 22 to 24, try your luck at the Fall Black
Jack Tournament held at the Princess Casino on Grand Bahama Island.
 &HT;    The North Eleuthera Sailing Regatta will be held Oct. 12 to 15.
Spectators can watch as locally built sloops sail between Harbour
Island and Three-Island Bay, North Eleuthera.
 &HT;    During the second week of November, both visitors and locals can
take part in the 14th Annual Grand Bahama Conchman Triathlon _ a
.5-mile swim, a 20-mile bike ride and a 3.5- mile run.
 &HT;    And if you're still standing after that, why not get a head
start on your Christmas shopping at Nassau/Paradise Island's
Christmas Jollification Festival. Or try out your fishing skills at
the Annual Bahamas Wahoo Championships. Both events will be held in
early November.
 &HT;    For more information on these and other activities in the
Bahamas, visit www.bahamas.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  I have heard rumors about a series of art exhibits
featuring Los Angeles artists at the Bel Age Hotel and was
wondering if you could give me more information.
 &HT;     A:  Throughout the summer, the Wyndham Bel Age Hotel in West
Hollywood is presenting several eclectic art shows under the banner
``Art &AMP; Soul.'' The shows showcase the latest works from three L.A.
artists combined with live acoustic and jazz music.
 &HT;    The works of two artists can still be viewed this summer season
_ Michael Spalt, until Aug. 15, and J.C. Jaress, from Aug. 16 to
Sept. 12.
 &HT;    Each month the Wyndham Bel Age hosts a ``Meet the Artist''
reception in their La Brasserie Restaurant &AMP; Club, which has been
hailed as ``the best jazz room with a view'' by the Los Angeles
Times. These monthly receptions will also feature tantalizing
appetizers, fine wines and champagne.
 &HT;    For more information, please call La Brasserie at (310)
358-7776. For reservations at the Wyndham Bel Age Hotel, call (800)
WYNDHAM.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The days of the great ocean liners may be long gone, but there
are dozens of other ships making trans-Atlantic crossings that
don't reach the headlines. They're on repositioning cruises, and
major cruise lines such as Celebrity Cruises, Holland America Line
and Seabourn Cruise Line offer them every year.
 &HT;    Cruises lines that sell Mediterranean cruises in summer
typically offer Caribbean cruises in winter. To get their ships
from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean, they take them across the
Atlantic in September or October. In spring, come March and April,
they take them back. The ships are literally repositioned twice a
year, hence the name.
 &HT;    From the Mediterranean, these voyages tend to begin in Greece,
Italy or Spain, sometimes stopping in the Canary Islands before
ending up in the Caribbean. But these itineraries change as well.
Some ships may include stops in Morocco or the Cape Verde Islands
and may end in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., or even New York.
 &HT;    Because each cruise typically has a few ports of call at the
beginning and end of each voyage, the length of a trip is usually
10 to 14 days. Within the business, they're known as ``blue water''
cruises, because the ships may spend a week or more on the open
ocean.
 &HT;    ``They attract well-traveled people who've already been to many
ports,'' Anne Scully explains. Scully, a certified travel counselor
and a vice president at McCabe Bremer Travel (1491 Chain Bridge
Road, Mclean, VA 22101; 800-747-84011; www.mccabebremer.com), adds,
``They get the ship at its best and get to play on it for five or
nine days. It's really a crossing, not a cruise. You get to read a
book from beginning to end.''
 &HT;    Scully sells many such cruises and says the major difference is
that ``on a traditional cruise, you're trying to keep up with the
shore excursions and ports. On a repositioning cruise, you keep up
with your own schedule.''
 &HT;    Traditionally, these cruises offer some of the best values in
the business. They're harder to fill because they're longer and
they occur in shoulder season. That means empty cabins that are
routinely discounted.
 &HT;    Scully speculates that ``people are afraid of them because of
open ocean. But these are big ships with stabilizers. Rogue waves
and rough water do occur, but the QE2, for example, regularly sails
trans-Atlantic from April to December.''
 &HT;    Repositioning cruises have traditionally afforded a prime
opportunity to sample luxury ships at middle-of-the-road prices.
Scully maintains that by shopping carefully, the seagoing public
can get a six-star ship for the price of a three- or four-star
vessel.
 &HT;    ``My rule of thumb is to go for the least expensive cabin on the
best ship,'' Sculley says.
 &HT;    Here's a sample of repositioning cruises this fall. Unless
noted, these are list prices, per person, based on double
occupancy, without airfare. A travel agent or cruise-only agent
should be able to find a good discount on these fares.
 &HT;    Celebrity Cruises (1050 Caribbean Way, Miami, FL 33132;
800-437-3111; www.celebrity-cruises.com) has a 12-night sailing on
the 1,950-passenger Millennium that departs Genoa, Italy, on Nov. 3
and then calls at Livorno, Italy; Villefranche, France; Barcelona
and Cadiz, Spain; and finishes in New York City. Prices start at
$3,209.
 &HT;    Holland America Line (300 Elliott Avenue West, Seattle, WA
98119; 800-426-0327; www.hollandamerica.com) offers a nine-night
cruise on the 1,214-passenger Noordam that departs from Lisbon,
Portugal, on Nov. 28 and calls at Ponta Delgada and Horta in the
Azores, Half Moon Cay, Bahamas, and ends in Fort Lauderdale.
Holland America's ``Early Savings Fares'' start at $1,099.
 &HT;    Seabourn Cruise Line (6100 Blue Lagoon Drive, Suite 400, Miami,
FL 33126; 800-929-9391; www.seabourn.com) has a number of ships
that make trans-Atlantic crossings. Among them is the 116-passenger
Seabourn Goddess II, which departs Oct. 30 from Santa Cruz de
Tenerife, Canary Islands, and calls at Porto Grande, Cape Verde
Islands, before ending at Bridgetown, Barbados. Prices start at
$4,840 for the 10-night cruise.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: VETERANS GET VIP TREATMENT IN BRANSON, MO.  
 &HT;

 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When the Osmond Brothers ask all the veterans of war who attend
their showcase in Branson, Mo., to stand up, nearly one-third of
the crowd rises while the rest of the audience gives a thunderous
round of applause.
 &HT;    This show of respect is a common occurrence at the Osmond
production, one of many in Branson that run daily from breakfast to
bedtime to satisfy the more than 7 million visitors who come to
town each year.
 &HT;    Of those visitors, 2.3 million are veterans who, along with
their families, are treated like VIPs in this heartland town in
south-central Missouri. Some 250 military reunions are held there
annually, and there is even a hotline to help people organize
gatherings of all sorts, including military events. (For more
information, call 21st Century Tours at 877-349-3378.)
 &HT;    Branson's 5,000 residents and performers work hard to welcome
veterans with special treats. One that shouldn't be missed is the
six-day Veterans Homecoming, which takes place each November to
celebrate Veteran's Day. This year's celebration will include an 8K
race in which participants will walk or run _ even roll in
wheelchairs _ and special tributes to those who were bestowed the
Congressional Medal of Honor. In addition, several of the area
shows will be free to the public _ or heavily discounted _ to honor
our country's veterans.
 &HT;    For a schedule of events, write to the Branson Veterans Task
Force, P.O. Box 1726, Branson, MO 65615; or call (417) 337-8387.
 &HT;    
 THE BOOK THAT STARTED IT ALL  
 &HT;    The book ``Shepherd of the Hills,'' a tale about the lives,
loves and deceptions of the Ozark mountain people in the early
1900s, sold more than 1 million copies when it was first published
back in 1907. Its overwhelming popularity played a large part in
putting Branson on the map. Suddenly, people from across the
country wanted to see for themselves some of the ``hillbillies''
described on its pages. Eventually, the book was adapted for the
stage, and today that show is still performed nightly from April
through October.
 &HT;    As part of festivities, audience members who pay an additional
board an open-air train that takes them on an historical tour of
the area. Highlights include passing by the home of Old Matt, one
of the show's primary characters, and the 230-foot Inspiration
Tower, a landmark on the pageant grounds. The tour also includes
special events, such as a bluegrass festival.
 &HT;    The production is great fun, and during intermission the actors
welcome spectators to make their way down to the stage, take part
in a square dance and chat with the cast.
 &HT;    A combination adult ticket for the tour and play costs $27;
admission to the play alone is $21. For more information, call
(800) 653-6288 or visit www.old-matt.com. Please note: Those with
mobility problems should discuss their needs when purchasing
tickets.
 &HT;    Another way to see Branson is to buy a ticket for the Branson
Scenic Railway, (800) 287-2462, a 40-mile round-trip tour onboard a
vintage-car train. Knowledgeable guides give riders a taste of the
local history. Except for mid-December to mid-March, the train runs
daily, including a dinner run Saturday nights from May to December.
The train leaves from the Main Street depot in downtown Branson. An
adult ticket costs $19.35 plus tax.
 &HT;    
 CRAFTSMAN COLLEGE  
 &HT;    Any trip to Branson wouldn't be complete without a stop in
Silver Dollar City _ (800) 952-6626 or www.silverdollarcity.com _
an historically recreated town that takes visitors back in time to
the turn of the century in Ozark country. Here, employees dressed
in period costumes man the rides, restaurants and shops, and many
of the booths show how common goods were once created.
 &HT;    Last fall, Dr. Jack Gillispie of Kimberling City, Mo., spent a
day in Silver Dollar City _ a day that would ultimately lead him to
discover a new hobby. Because of his fascination with metalwork, it
wasn't long before the family practitioner found himself hanging
around the blacksmith's shop. By watching the smithy work and
speaking with the ``locals,'' he learned that he could enroll in a
``Craftsman for a Day'' seminar, which would teach him the basic
skills of forging. Other craft seminars offer instruction in the
finer points of dipping candles and weaving baskets, much like the
locals did years ago, before the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.
 &HT;    On his second visit to Silver Dollar this past April, Gillispie
once again visited the blacksmith shop, but this time he was
immediately handed a costume that helped him blend in with the
other villagers. Then, after a lesson in safety procedures, the
doctor was put to work to the delight of the watching crowd.
 &HT;    Being more adept with a stethoscope than a hammer and anvil,
Gillispie started with a small task _ making a little nail. He then
moved on to crafting a metal hook to hang a flower pot from and,
eventually, a rose that was constructed step by step. ``Mine looked
more like a dandelion,'' he confesses, ``but I really got into it.
It was a blast.''
 &HT;    In fact, Gillispie was so inspired by the class that herecently
ordered his own coal forge and anvil for his home, where he plans
to start tinkering with metalwork and reading a few books on the
subject before returning to Silver Dollar City for more lessons.
 &HT;    The day-long programs range in price from $30 to $125, depending
on the craft. For more information, call (800) 695-1353.
 &HT;    
 MORE TRAINING  
 &HT;    In addition to day-long craft seminars, Silver Dollar City also
offers three- to five-day seminars in specific craft skills. For
example, a pottery seminar with Master Craftsman Todd Nelson is
slated for Sept. 8 to 10, and five woodcarving seminars will be
held March 5 to 9. The longer seminars vary in price from $75 to
$275, depending on the instructor.
 &HT;    For more information about Branson _ including road information
_ call (800) 214-3661, or visit www.branson.tripusa.com on the Web.
You can also visit the city's Web site at www.bransonchamber.com.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By SARAH LYALL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    August may be the best month of all to visit Edinburgh, the most
regal of Scottish cities. Not only are the northern days still
delightfully long, but it is also the month for the Edinburgh
International Festival, a world-renowned feast of music, dance and
theater.
 &HT;    Most of Edinburgh is given over to the festival, as
international companies, including the New York City Ballet, Czech
Philharmonic Orchestra and Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm,
take over theaters and concert halls, leaving the visitor
thoroughly spoiled for choice.
 &HT;    It has been a year since Scotland embarked on a bold democratic
experiment, swearing in its first England-free Parliament in almost
300 years and getting to run its own affairs when it comes to
things such as education and health.
 &HT;    The new legislators have yet to move into their custom-made
building at Holyrood, but construction can be observed in the Old
City, on Edinburgh's south side. When Parliament is in session, the
legislators themselves can be seen building Scotland's new
political order in their temporary headquarters, near the George IV
Bridge.
 &HT;    One caveat: it is normal, while visiting Edinburgh, to become
unduly obsessed with the vicissitudes of Scottish weather. It can
be cold; it can be hot; rain is generally lurking somewhere on the
horizon. The best course is to plan for the worst, but hope for the
best.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    From Aug. 13 to Sept. 2, Edinburgh will feast on the dizzyingly
eclectic smorgasbord that is the Edinburgh International Festival.
For tickets and a full list of events, call the festival office at
(44-131) 473-2000 (www.eif.co.uk) or Globaltickets at (800)
223-6108 in the United States.
 &HT;    Tickets can also be purchased at the Hub, the festival's
handsome new headquarters _ a prime spot for eating and shopping,
too _ on the Royal Mile in the Old City. Here are some highlights:
 &HT;    On Sept. 1, the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra will be performing
Janacek's Sinfonietta and Mahler's ``Das Lied von der Erde,'' a
lyrical meditation on death and nature. Curtain time is 8 p.m. at
Usher Hall on Lothian Road. Tickets from $7.50 to $58.50
(calculated at $1.50 to the pound).
 &HT;    The pianist Christian Zacharias will direct and accompany the
Scottish Chamber Orchestra in a rendering of the complete cycle of
Mozart's piano concertos, over seven nights between Aug. 14 and 27
at Usher Hall. Tickets $7.50 to $46.50.
 &HT;    Another of the festival's delights is seeing a play in a foreign
language. This year's possibilities include a German ``Hamlet'' and
a Spanish play called ``One thousand five hundred meters above the
level of Jack,'' about a deep-sea diver teetering on the edge of
madness. All have English supertitles. On various dates; tickets
from $9 to $33.75.
 &HT;    The Netherlands Dance Theater _ really three companies in one,
with each made up of dancers at different points in their careers _
is presenting a program of bold, sexy dancing over five nights,
from Aug. 29 to Sept. 2. And on Aug. 30 and 31, dancers from NDT1,
the main company, will dance to music played by the Czech
Philharmonic Orchestra, with Sir Charles Mackerras conducting.
Performances are at 7:30 p.m. at various sites; tickets, $7.50 to
$55.50.
 &HT;    There also is the well-known but much less formalized Edinburgh
Fringe Festival, which features stand-up comedy, theater, skits,
dance, music and mime in halls, parks, clubs and on the streets.
Performances run Aug. 6 to 28; (44-131) 226-5138; www.edfringe.com.
Admission to some performances is free; tickets range up to $22.50.
 &HT;    From Aug. 4 to 26, Edinburgh is also celebrating the 50th
anniversary of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, an extravaganza of
pipes and drums and well-turned calves peeking out from beneath
kilts. It takes place at night, beside Edinburgh Castle, which adds
to the pageantry; (44-131) 225-1188, www.edintattoo.co.uk. Shows
are Monday to Friday at 9 p.m., and Saturday at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m.
Tickets: $12.75 to $36.75.
 &HT;    Devoted to Dadaists and Surrealists such as Ernst, Magritte and
Man Ray, the Dean Gallery, 73 Belford Road, is a beautifully
organized new museum in a grand, neo-Classical former orphanage in
north Edinburgh. An exhibition from Saturday through Oct. 1 will
feature Salvador Dali. Open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Sunday 2 to 5 p.m.; (44-131) 624-6200. The regular collection is
free; the Dali exhibition is $6.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    If the day is spectacularly sunny (it happens sometimes),
celebrate at the Royal Botanic Garden, 70 acres of beautiful
gardens and greenhouses that feature a display of herbaceous
borders during August. Tucked amid all the greenery are a cafe and
shop. The Garden, 20A Inverleith Row, (44-131) 552-7171, is open
daily 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. (6 p.m. in September). Free admission.
 &HT;    The former royal yacht Britannia is docked on Ocean Drive in
Leith, and you can pay $11.55 ($8.95 ages 60 and older, $5.60 ages

song ``Bohemian Rhapsody'' _ that ordinary Scots have identified as
essential to their very being. Open daily. Admission (which also
gets you into the Royal Museum next door) is $4.50, $2.25 for

 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Tucked away off the Royal Mile, Dubh Prais, 123B High Street,
offers Scottish dishes lovingly prepared with traditional recipes.
Try collops in the pan, steak medallions in a
port-and-pickled-walnut sauce; for dessert, there's atholl brose
parfait, an unusually tasty ice cream made with toasted oatmeal,
honey and Drambuie. A typical dinner for two, plus wine, costs
about $90. Reservations are essential _ there are only nine tables;
(44-131) 557-5732.
 &HT;    The Tower, at the top of the Museum of Scotland on Chambers
Street, is one of Edinburgh's hottest new restaurants. Appetizers
include sauteed mushrooms with spinach, poached egg and toasted
brioche; for the main course, portions of steak and roast beef come
in three sizes: 8, 12, and 16 ounces. Dinner for two, with wine,
generally comes to about $150. A two-course pre-theater dinner for
$18 is available from 4 to 6 p.m.; (44-131) 225-3003.
 &HT;    Most of Scotland's art galleries and museums feature smart cafes
with tasty dishes. One that stands out is Cafe Newton in the Dean
Gallery, 73 Belford Road. It is open the same hours as the gallery
and offers a small selection of light entrees, like smoked salmon
with creme fraiche, and an eggplant, feta, pesto and olive sandwich
on a choice of bread. A sculpture of Isaac Newton looks down from
the center of the room. Sandwiches average $6.35; daily hot
specials range from $6.75 to $8.25; brownies and other treats cost
from $1.20 to $4.35; no alcohol served.
 &HT;    Tucked into a corner of Hunter Square, not far from the bustle
of the Royal Mile, Bann's vegetarian cafe provides healthful food.
At dinner, appetizers include Thai phyllo parcels with stir-fried
vegetables on wilted bok choy, with a sweet sesame-seed oil
dressing; main courses include tarte tatin made of
 &HT;    layers of roasted sweet pepper, zucchini and cheddar cheese, and
an all-vegetable haggis _ no animal innards to speak of. Dinner for
two, with wine, costs about $60. Open daily 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.;
(44-131) 226-1112.
 &HT;    In the last few years, George Street has overtaken the
increasingly tacky Princes Street nearby as the city's choice
shopping and eating street. One of the nicest restaurants here is
the Dome, in a vast, high-ceilinged building that used to be a
mortuary, then a bank.
 &HT;    At the outside Garden Cafe, enjoy pizza and pasta (weather
permitting) for about $24 for two, wine included; in the Grill
Room, expect to pay from $60 to $75 for two, including wine, at
dinner for dishes that include pheasant and apricot terrine with
red currant dressing. They can both be found under one dome at 14
George Street; (44-131) 624-8624.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANN CRITTENDEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The Canadian Rockies are the only place I know where the
postcards don't lie. The snowcapped mountains and raging torrents
of water really are as spectacular as the glossy photographs make
them seem.
 &HT;    And among its charms, the area is blessed with one of the best
systems of hiking trails to be found anywhere. This is not a
secret; one of the first people to explore the region and to
recognize its hiking potential was Edward Whymper, the conqueror of
the Matterhorn.
 &HT;    On a trip last summer, my husband and I met more Germans, Swiss
and other Europeans on the trails than Americans, drawn to the kind
of civilized wilderness characteristic of Europe in the 19th
century.
 &HT;    At times we felt that we were in the era of Goethe and
Wordsworth, or at least of Frederick Church and Asher Durand and
other American landscape painters. Scenes: on a quiet road,
suddenly surrounded by a herd of male elk, their six- and
seven-point racks bobbing gently as they slowly grazed past us; on
a mountain ledge high above an emerald lake, chatting with
collectors of still unidentified Cambrian fossils; in a forest of
spruce and subalpine fir, motionless as a female moose and her calf
warily cross the path ahead; on a highline trail looking across a
valley at an explosive waterfall 1,000 feet high, with not another
soul in sight. But I'm getting ahead of my story.
 &HT;    Our first priority in planning this two-week trip was to find
good day hiking, allowing us to experience the mountains without
carrying 40-pound packs for days or having to endure the crowds and
the bus terminal madness that now surround the grand old hotels in
Banff and Lake Louise.
 &HT;    Of the five national parks that encompass the prime wilderness
of the Canadian Rockies, we discovered that the best one for our
purposes would be Yoho.
 &HT;    Banff, the first national park in Canada, including the crown
jewel of Lake Louise, is known as the hiking capital of the
country, with a huge network of well-maintained trails. But the
park also has more than five million visitors, most of them in July
and August _ too many to get away from without spending all one's
time above the tree line, sleeping on rocks.
 &HT;    Jasper, a few hours north up the magnificent Icefields Parkway,
has celebrated longer trails, but not too many get-away-from-it-all
day hikes.
 &HT;    Yoho, just west of Lake Louise on the western side of the
Continental Divide, has far fewer visitors (an estimated 1.8
million in 1999)and 185 miles of trails that can take you to the
top of the world and down again in time for a dinner and a book in
front of the fire.
 &HT;    Before we arrived in Yoho we spent a few days in Jasper and the
Lake Louise area. We liked the informal funkiness of the little
town of Jasper and our log cabin (and hot tub) in the woods nearby,
but we had to drive an hour or more each day to find good day
hikes.
 &HT;    We skirted the crowds at Lake Louise by staying eight miles away
at Lake Moraine Lodge, luxuriously rustic in the style of Ralph
Lauren. There a couple of world-class day hikes began right on the
grounds, but the lake itself, an emerald gem, was surrounded by day
trippers.
 &HT;    But on our first day in Yoho we had it all: a vigorous hike with
dazzling views; a glimpse into the geological forces that formed
this region; and seven kinds of weather, including drizzle, sun,
cloudiness and a brief hail storm. For outdoor activities in the
Canadian Rockies, the key word is layers _ rainproof layers.
 &HT;    We had joined a group put together by the Yoho-Burgess Shale
Foundation for a hike up to one of the most important fossil sites
in the world, now a Unesco World Heritage Site.
 &HT;    In 1989, Stephen Jay Gould, in his book ``Wonderful Life,''
described the ``weird wonders'' found here: strange,
500-million-year-old sea creatures displaying a greater disparity
than exists in the animal kingdom today.
 &HT;    The hike is no joke _ 12.5 miles round trip and an elevation
gain of about 2,500 feet, up to an altitude of 6,700 feet _ not
high by Colorado or High Sierra standards, but high enough to be
aware of thin air and aging muscles.
 &HT;    It was utterly worth it. The guide, a geologist named Carole
Augereau, gave us the rundown as we trudged up: how half a billion
years ago this area was the north shore of a vast supercontinent
surrounded by shallow warm seas, teeming with the earliest forms of
multicellular animal life.
 &HT;    Eons later, between 175 million and 45 million years ago, two
separate collisions of continental plates (moving at their fastest
at the speed of a growing fingernail) slowly pushed up the ancient
ocean floors, forming the mountain spines running north-south
through Canada and the United States.
 &HT;    Thus it was that in 1886 railway workers found ``stone bugs''
buried in alpine rocks, and from 1909 to 1917 Charles D. Walcott,
then head of the Smithsonian Institution and the foremost Cambrian
paleontologist of his day, found such marvelous marine
invertebrates as Opabinia, with its five eyes, Aysheaia, with its
mouth surrounded by a ring of tentacles, and the strangest of all,
Hallucigenia, an animal so bizarre that for decades no one knew
which of its sides was up.
 &HT;    To our delight, Dr. Des Collins of the Royal Ontario Museum, who
has been excavating the quarry for 25 years, was at the site when
we arrived. He told us that thanks to discoveries in two new
quarries, in China and Greenland, as well as his own finds, there
is now evidence of even more unclassified Cambrian organisms than a
decade ago.
 &HT;    ``The Cambrian world,'' he said, ``is getting stranger-looking
than ever.''
 &HT;    Dr. Collins passed around a few of that week's finds, some of
which, to a lay person's eye, looked like faint scratchings on dark
grey pieces of shale. A few steps away, half a dozen graduate
students and volunteers were busy chipping away on stacks of muddy
rocks with hammers and chisels.
 &HT;    When I peered into the quarry to have a closer look, a handsome
French scientist looked up at me and said, with deep and
unmistakable pride, ``I just found a worm.''
 &HT;    The view from Burgess Ridge was unparalleled. On our left were
the massive limestone cliffs of Burgess Mountain and on our right
was Mount Wapta. In the distance loomed Michael Peak, the President
and the Vice President, all three covered in snow.
 &HT;    Far below lay Emerald Lake, the largest body of water in Yoho
National Park. (The explorer who gave Emerald Lake its perfect name
had to rename a lake already called Emerald. Its new name: Lake
Louise.)
 &HT;    I have found that one of the principal joys of a hike is
contemplating the pleasures that await its end. Daydreams of the
hot shower, the cool drink, the good meal and the soft bed tend to
crowd out more immediate realities, like the flora and fauna of the
last few knee-crushing kilometers downhill.
 &HT;    Toward the end of this particular 10-hour day the fantasies were
vivid, for we were headed for the Emerald Lake Lodge, another
sybaritic outpost. A few hours later, we were unwinding in a hot
tub overlooking the mountain-ringed lake, perusing a tempting menu
and building a fire in our bedroom. Ah, wilderness!
 &HT;    The next day we took a less strenuous stroll around the lake and
up into the basin behind it. We arranged for a naturalist to
accompany us. A cold, snowy winter and nonexistent spring meant
that the flowering alpine meadows we had hoped to see had still not
appeared, even by mid- to late July, but myriad earlier flowers
were scattered around the lakeside, including the ubiquitous white
globe flowers and bunchberry, wild roses, yellow columbines, bright
orange western wood lilies, purple asters, tiny white and green bog
orchids, and equally delicate twinflower (Linnaea borealis), a
Linnaeus favorite.
 &HT;    We also learned the secret of the mountain lakes' brilliant
turquoise color: a substance called rock flour. As the glaciers
that feed these lakes move down the mountains, the rocks embedded
in their base scrape against other rocks, grinding them into a fine
grayish powder that washes into the lakes as the glaciers melt.
This powder reflects the blue-green part of the light spectrum,
giving the water a hue that would be garish if any painter tried to
capture it.
 &HT;    The next day we were eagerly anticipating another major trek,
this time in the Lake O'Hara area, a uniquely beautiful place of
cirque and rock basin lakes, alpine heath and larch stands, framed
by the same two peaks _ Lefroy and Victoria _ that overlook Lake
Louise on the other side of the great divide. So beautiful is Lake
O'Hara that private vehicles are banned from the road leading into
it and a quota system limits the number of daily visitors to 150 to
200.
 &HT;    A day hiker from the town of Field, for example, has to make a
reservation for one of the six available seats on the daily bus
going in. You have to be at the tourist office at dawn on the
morning before you want to go. Unless you are one of the first six
people there, forget it.
 &HT;    Not being savvy, we arrived at 7 a.m. one morning and lost out.
The next day, seriously determined, we arrived at the still-locked
office by 6 o'clock, and there were only two people ahead of us.
Ten minutes later a young man from Quebec arrived, and there went
the last two spaces.
 &HT;    Literally one minute after that, an older man and his son came
up, only to be told, at 6:15, that they were too late. The
gentleman commented that the sight of the sun coming up over the
mountains had been so magnificent that he had stopped on the
highway several times to take pictures; otherwise, he said
ruefully, he might have made it.
 &HT;    ``That was you?'' the man from Quebec exclaimed. ``I was right
behind you.''
 &HT;    We picked one of the most popular hikes, from Lake O'Hara up to
Lake Oesa, then across a ledge around Yukness Mountain, down to the
Opabin Plateau, and back in time for the 6:30 p.m. bus.
 &HT;    Oesa (the Stoney Indian word for ice, so called because the lake
is frozen nearly year round) was, as predicted, gorgeous. But on
Yukness, big patches of snow still covered the trail, including one
long stretch that curved up and around the mountain with a
precipitous drop on one side.
 &HT;    At this point I remembered that I really am terribly afraid of
heights. I inched my way along the slippery track, digging now my
toes, then my heels, into the footsteps of the fools who had
preceded me. When we were finally back on solid, if not flat,
ground, I literally sobbed, relieved to be alive.
 &HT;    We began to saunter down toward the plateau. Just as I was
beginning to get back into the blissful rhythm of trekking, a voice
cried up at us from far below: ``A mother bear with two cubs!''
 &HT;    The most dangerous kind of bear.
 &HT;    We froze. ``Black or grizzly?'' my husband shouted back. We
didn't hear an answer. He scanned the valley below, and sure
enough, way down there, right where we were heading, were a large
tawny bear and two smaller ones, moving faster than race horses on
a diagonal away from the trail. They didn't look like black bears.
 &HT;    I thought of the ordeal behind me and decided I'd rather face a
grizzly than go back the way we'd come. We took a whistle out of
our pack and started tooting as we came down, making noise,
scanning both sides of the trail constantly, and marching briskly
back to Lake O'Hara. When I looked at the hiking guide later, I
realized that we'd seen nothing of one of the prettiest parts of
that hike.
 &HT;    We did get to be interviewed by the park rangers; a grizzly
sighting is big news, particularly in one of the most popular
hiking areas in the Canadian Rockies. It turned out they knew these
bears well _ they were even tagged. But they weren't supposed to be
hanging around trails those of us who are lower on the food chain
like to frequent.
 &HT;    Our final hike was more satisfying. The trail to take in Yoho is
called the Iceline, and true to its name, it was still partly under
snow even at the end of July. We had put it off until our last day,
which turned out to be a Rocky Mountain high, clear and sunny.
 &HT;    The first mile and a half was steadily uphill, sweetened by an
almost constant view of magnificent Takakkaw Falls, which burst out
of a rock cliff like a giant's broken water main. The trail climbed
high on the open avalanche slopes of the President Range and onto
the moraines of several glaciers, past two half-frozen glacier-fed
tarns.
 &HT;    We were dazzled by the utter stillness and vastness of the bleak
alpine landscape, so close to the glaciers and snowy peaks, and so
far above the Yoho Valley that we felt as if we were in the clouds
looking down.
 &HT;    There were no bears on the way down. Just crunching through
tracks in the snow in shorts and T-shirt, swinging hiking poles
like a cross-country skier, sliding down a snow bank to avoid any
more slippery traverses, down into the forest around another
pristine lake, past a raging river and more plunging falls. Yoho,
by the way, is a Cree word loosely translated as ``awesome.''

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY AURELIA C. SCOTT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The moment of truth came at an outdoor table in the Plaza Nueva
in Granada, although neither of us admitted it. Instead, my
husband, Bob, and I continued to sip our glasses of vino tinto and
roll green olives between tongue and teeth, ejecting the pits with
newly acquired expertise.
 &HT;    The evening sun was refracted through dusty air, gilding the
Gypsies and multinational youth in the plaza. Homeward-bound
Granadans threaded through the crowds carrying grocery bags topped
by market-fresh fruit. Tourists whose fanny packs made them look
bustle-bottomed clustered around displays of postcards, fluttering
lace fans and trays of castanets.
 &HT;    As the shadows lengthened, the day's deafening traffic dwindled
to the whine of motor scooters loaded beyond their capacities with
three, even four clinging passengers. We sipped and watched and
rested our feet, wondering how we would stay awake until Spanish
dinner time at 8:30 p.m. _ 8 p.m. in restaurants that cater to
tourists.
 &HT;    And we wondered, although still not giving voice to the thought,
what to do with the rest of our trip. Not that we didn't have
plans. The plans for this first trip to the land of sun and saffron
and tapas had been made in meticulous detail weeks before our
departure.
 &HT;    I had spent a fine meal's worth of money on Frommer's, Fodor's,
Eyewitness and Let's Go guides and other aides, including
Learn-Spanish-in-Your-Car CDs. We had combed newspaper travel
sections and reread articles clipped from food magazines.
 &HT;    I had followed Internet links from one Spanish travel site to
another until I was bleary-eyed and lost. We had begged friends and
relatives of friends for memories of their own trips.
 &HT;    Finally, knowing too much and not enough, we developed a
two-week itinerary. Not all of Spain, of course. Just what called
to us as we shoveled our way out of yet another Maine winter.
 &HT;    Barcelona because 30 years ago Bob had read Orwell's ``Homage to
Catalonia''; Quatretondeta in the mountains above Alicante for the
small-town experience; Agua Amarga to dip our feet in the
Mediterranean in a still-pretty seaside town; Granada for the
Alhambra; Ronda because it is the most accessible of the Moorish
pueblos blancos; Cordoba for its mosque and old city; Cuenca for
its perilously hanging houses and its location in Castilla-La
Mancha; and Barcelona again to rest before the flight home.
 &HT;    I typed it all up _ flight numbers, hotel names, telephone
numbers, dates of arrival, dates of departure. One copy faxed to
our nearest and dearest, another hand-delivered to friends who
would water our houseplants; a copy in Bob's carry-on; the copy in
my carry-on stapled to a sheaf of hotel confirmation letters and
directions.
 &HT;    Too much? Well, I like lists. Besides, we were heading on the
cusp of high season to a country whose language we do not speak. We
think of ourselves as flexible and adventurous. Yet we have reached
the stage at which we no longer wish to trail our suitcases along
foreign streets looking for a hotel with a vacancy.
 &HT;    And to be honest, Bob does not want to traipse along a dark
corridor to reach the bathroom and I need a mattress that does not
sink to the floor.
 &HT;    Munching on an olive as the sun set on the Plaza Nueva, I
reflected that thus far the plans had been executed practically
perfectly. Barcelona's light and space and elegance had made us
giddy with pleasure.
 &HT;    Arm in arm, we joined the perambulating throngs to walk up and
down, and again up and down the Rambla, the grand tree-lined
boulevard to the sea. Standing before Antoni Gaudi's famous
wave-shaped building, whose wrought-iron balconies writhe like
wind-tossed seaweed, Bob said, ``I could live here.'' Not Casa Mila
specifically, but Barcelona. I agreed.
 &HT;    Once out of Barcelona our rented silver Opel whizzed easily
along the roads, nudged only slightly by the turbulence of passing
BMWs.
 &HT;    Climbing into the mountains, we entered the Spain of my
imagination, all olive trees, grapevines and rock. Quatretondeta's
terraced almond, olive and cherry groves seduced us as much as
Barcelona had. We felt embraced by the welcome at Hotel Els Frares
and by its blissfully comfortable beds.
 &HT;    Walking among the olive trees, we inhaled air scented by
waist-high rosemary growing wild on the hillsides. We greeted
black-clad grandmothers as they stood by their scrubbed doorsteps
on pristine village streets too narrow for car traffic.
 &HT;    ``Buenos dias,'' we said, exaggerating the Castilian
pronunciation in our enthusiasm. No wonder they smiled in response.
 &HT;    On toward the south to Agua Amarga, a fishing village on the
southern coast. It was as pretty as advertised _ a tumble of low,
white buildings leading down to a quiet beach and the bluest blue
Mediterranean. The trip down the mountain took longer than planned;
plotting the mileage in Maine, I had forgotten to take the
slow-going curves of mountain roads into account.
 &HT;    We were at the edge of our patience by the time we pulled up to
the front door of our hotel, the MiKasa. But a cosseted night there
(it felt more like a private villa than a 20-room hotel) restored
us.
 &HT;    Yet now, as the first of our three scheduled days in Granada
sighed to a close, we began to feel burdened by our planning. The
structure of those lists constricted rather than comforted. We were
tired, of course, suffering from a midtrip weariness that is
signaled by a longing for one's own washer and dryer. It's the time
when I want nothing more than a cup of tea made by steeping real
Darjeeling leaves in water that has reached a full rolling boil.
 &HT;    Walking slowly toward a barely 8 p.m. dinner, Bob said, ``I wish
we could have more time in Barcelona,'' just as I said, ``I cannot
remember why we are going to Cordoba.'' We stopped and stared at
each other.
 &HT;    Over lamb chops and garlic grilled chicken at the Restaurante
Gallio on the Plaza Bib-Rambla, we dithered.
 &HT;    ``We'd have to cancel all those reservations.'' ``Immediately,
right away, now,'' I agreed, checking my watch as if it were
already too late.
 &HT;    ``The Barcelona hotels are bound to be full.'' ``Where would we
stop along the way?'' ``We can't make it back in one day.'' ``The
rental-car people might penalize us for returning the car early.''
 &HT;    This last brought us up short. Unable to change our plans
because Avis might punish us?
 &HT;    A shiver of excitement made us grin. We would be on the lam,
playing hooky, leaving at intermission, absent without leave. We
toasted each other with what was left in the bottle.
 &HT;    In the end, it was almost easy. Phrasebook in hand, we called in
our cancellations. We were sorry, sorry, sorry, but, ``si, por
favor, quiero cancelar. Muchas gracias.''
 &HT;    That done, we fretted when our Barcelona hotel proved full for
the new nights we wanted. I flapped the sheaf of canceled hotels at
Bob. ``We've done it now.'' I didn't quite wail, but I was fierce,
as if my sudden loss of mooring were his fault rather than our
shared adventure.
 &HT;    Ultimately, we handed the search over to Barcelona's hotel
reservation bureau, which found what we wanted within an hour.
Amazing.
 &HT;    The next day, we toured the Alhambra with rediscovered
enthusiasm. The day after that we tried two new tapas bars and
succeeded in staying awake for an 8:30 dinner.
 &HT;    On the fourth day, silly with excitement, we pointed our silver
Opel north toward four unencumbered, ribbon-tied days in Barcelona.
 &HT;    And the unplanned night on the road? We consulted the map. What
about visiting Elche, which claims to have the largest palm grove
in Europe? In the land of Quixote we had learned to follow our
hearts, not a schedule.

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  I am planning a trip to Tuscany, Italy, this fall and would
like to stay at a very special place. Can you find one for me?
 &HT;     A:  Palazzo Terranova is in Umbria, a 90-minute drive from
Florence. Perched at 1,800 feet overlooking the Tiber Valley, this
eight-room aerie is quite possibly the best and most beautiful
country-house hideaway in all of Italy.
 &HT;    Palazzo Terranova, which was built in the 18th century, has been
restored by Sarah and Johnny Townsend, a dazzling English couple
who have filled the rooms with family heirlooms, rare antiques, the
work of local artisans and laughter.
 &HT;    The Townsends' passion for Umbria and their wish to share their
experiences is apparent from the moment guests check in. Rooms are
spacious and each is named after an opera. There are no minibars
here, no televisions, no gadgetry. Instead, guests find four-poster
beds, great shuttered windows, 18th-century paintings, beamed
ceilings, trompe l'oeil, soft linens and total peace.
 &HT;    The Townsends have created a sweet retreat here _ each salon is
a work of art done in Old Master colors, and the library is crammed
with books affectionately inscribed by grateful guests.
 &HT;    Each day, the Terranova staff prepares delightful breakfasts to
be enjoyed on the fragrant terrace. Dinners celebrate the fresh
bounty of the Umbrian countryside. The wine cellar holds remarkable
Italian and French wines. A pool, three kitchens for culinary
instruction, a vineyard, an orchard and gardens await visitors.
 &HT;    Umbria's ancient treasures _ its churches, villages, trattorias,
wine country and friendly people _ are just minutes away as are
golf, horses, bikes, painting classes and hot-air balloons.
 &HT;    For all this quality, rates start at an astonishingly low $300 a
night, including breakfast. For more information, call
011-39-075-857-0083, e-mail sarah(AT)palazzoterranova.com or visit
www.palazzoterranova.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I are planning to take our school-age children
to North Carolina's Outer Banks this summer. We keep hearing about
an outdoor drama that tells the story of Roanoke. Do you have any
information?
 &HT;     A:  ``The Lost Colony,'' America's longest-running outdoor
drama, was written in 1937 by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright
Paul Green. It was originally intended to run for one season, but
success has propelled it into its 63rd.
 &HT;    ``The Lost Colony'' uses song, dance, drama and special effects
to tell the story of America's first English settlement (1584-1587)
and its eerie and mysterious disappearance. Impressive costumes and
the voices of the prestigious Westminster Choir College add special
touches to the performance.
 &HT;    The drama is staged at the Waterside Theatre, inside historic
Fort Raleigh. Ancient oak trees, laced with Spanish moss, frame the
theatre, and balmy ocean breezes help set the scene.
 &HT;    The production runs Monday through Saturday every summer from
June through August. Tickets range from $8 to $18, and children are
admitted for half-price on Monday nights. For reservations or more
information, call (800) 488-5012.
 &HT;    Another option is to purchase the Roanoke Island Queen's Pass,
(252) 475-1500. The pass, which costs $27 for adults and $14 for
children, includes admission to ``The Lost Colony,'' as well as the
North Carolina Aquarium, the Elizabethan Gardens and the Roanoke
Island Festival Park.
 &HT;    A great place to stay is the Tranquil House Inn on Manteo's
waterfront. Summer rates range from $149 to $189, and reservations
can be made by calling (800) 458-7069. Don't miss dinner at 1587,
located in the inn.
 &HT;     Q:  I am going to be in the Bahamas with a friend later this
year. While she loves nothing more than lying in the sun, I need a
little more stimulation. What else can one do there?
 &HT;     A:  While the Bahamas are typically known for their
sun-drenched beaches, bronzing bodies and exotic beverages, there
are also a number of other activities to keep you busy. For
example, between Sept. 22 to 24, try your luck at the Fall Black
Jack Tournament held at the Princess Casino on Grand Bahama Island.
 &HT;    The North Eleuthera Sailing Regatta will be held Oct. 12 to 15.
Spectators can watch as locally built sloops sail between Harbour
Island and Three-Island Bay, North Eleuthera.
 &HT;    During the second week of November, both visitors and locals can
take part in the 14th Annual Grand Bahama Conchman Triathlon _ a
.5-mile swim, a 20-mile bike ride and a 3.5- mile run.
 &HT;    And if you're still standing after that, why not get a head
start on your Christmas shopping at Nassau/Paradise Island's
Christmas Jollification Festival. Or try out your fishing skills at
the Annual Bahamas Wahoo Championships. Both events will be held in
early November.
 &HT;    For more information on these and other activities in the
Bahamas, visit www.bahamas.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  I have heard rumors about a series of art exhibits
featuring Los Angeles artists at the Bel Age Hotel and was
wondering if you could give me more information.
 &HT;     A:  Throughout the summer, the Wyndham Bel Age Hotel in West
Hollywood is presenting several eclectic art shows under the banner
``Art &AMP; Soul.'' The shows showcase the latest works from three L.A.
artists combined with live acoustic and jazz music.
 &HT;    The works of two artists can still be viewed this summer season
_ Michael Spalt, until Aug. 15, and J.C. Jaress, from Aug. 16 to
Sept. 12.
 &HT;    Each month the Wyndham Bel Age hosts a ``Meet the Artist''
reception in their La Brasserie Restaurant &AMP; Club, which has been
hailed as ``the best jazz room with a view'' by the Los Angeles
Times. These monthly receptions will also feature tantalizing
appetizers, fine wines and champagne.
 &HT;    For more information, please call La Brasserie at (310)
358-7776. For reservations at the Wyndham Bel Age Hotel, call (800)
WYNDHAM.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The days of the great ocean liners may be long gone, but there
are dozens of other ships making trans-Atlantic crossings that
don't reach the headlines. They're on repositioning cruises, and
major cruise lines such as Celebrity Cruises, Holland America Line
and Seabourn Cruise Line offer them every year.
 &HT;    Cruises lines that sell Mediterranean cruises in summer
typically offer Caribbean cruises in winter. To get their ships
from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean, they take them across the
Atlantic in September or October. In spring, come March and April,
they take them back. The ships are literally repositioned twice a
year, hence the name.
 &HT;    From the Mediterranean, these voyages tend to begin in Greece,
Italy or Spain, sometimes stopping in the Canary Islands before
ending up in the Caribbean. But these itineraries change as well.
Some ships may include stops in Morocco or the Cape Verde Islands
and may end in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., or even New York.
 &HT;    Because each cruise typically has a few ports of call at the
beginning and end of each voyage, the length of a trip is usually
10 to 14 days. Within the business, they're known as ``blue water''
cruises, because the ships may spend a week or more on the open
ocean.
 &HT;    ``They attract well-traveled people who've already been to many
ports,'' Anne Scully explains. Scully, a certified travel counselor
and a vice president at McCabe Bremer Travel (1491 Chain Bridge
Road, Mclean, VA 22101; 800-747-84011; www.mccabebremer.com), adds,
``They get the ship at its best and get to play on it for five or
nine days. It's really a crossing, not a cruise. You get to read a
book from beginning to end.''
 &HT;    Scully sells many such cruises and says the major difference is
that ``on a traditional cruise, you're trying to keep up with the
shore excursions and ports. On a repositioning cruise, you keep up
with your own schedule.''
 &HT;    Traditionally, these cruises offer some of the best values in
the business. They're harder to fill because they're longer and
they occur in shoulder season. That means empty cabins that are
routinely discounted.
 &HT;    Scully speculates that ``people are afraid of them because of
open ocean. But these are big ships with stabilizers. Rogue waves
and rough water do occur, but the QE2, for example, regularly sails
trans-Atlantic from April to December.''
 &HT;    Repositioning cruises have traditionally afforded a prime
opportunity to sample luxury ships at middle-of-the-road prices.
Scully maintains that by shopping carefully, the seagoing public
can get a six-star ship for the price of a three- or four-star
vessel.
 &HT;    ``My rule of thumb is to go for the least expensive cabin on the
best ship,'' Sculley says.
 &HT;    Here's a sample of repositioning cruises this fall. Unless
noted, these are list prices, per person, based on double
occupancy, without airfare. A travel agent or cruise-only agent
should be able to find a good discount on these fares.
 &HT;    Celebrity Cruises (1050 Caribbean Way, Miami, FL 33132;
800-437-3111; www.celebrity-cruises.com) has a 12-night sailing on
the 1,950-passenger Millennium that departs Genoa, Italy, on Nov. 3
and then calls at Livorno, Italy; Villefranche, France; Barcelona
and Cadiz, Spain; and finishes in New York City. Prices start at
$3,209.
 &HT;    Holland America Line (300 Elliott Avenue West, Seattle, WA
98119; 800-426-0327; www.hollandamerica.com) offers a nine-night
cruise on the 1,214-passenger Noordam that departs from Lisbon,
Portugal, on Nov. 28 and calls at Ponta Delgada and Horta in the
Azores, Half Moon Cay, Bahamas, and ends in Fort Lauderdale.
Holland America's ``Early Savings Fares'' start at $1,099.
 &HT;    Seabourn Cruise Line (6100 Blue Lagoon Drive, Suite 400, Miami,
FL 33126; 800-929-9391; www.seabourn.com) has a number of ships
that make trans-Atlantic crossings. Among them is the 116-passenger
Seabourn Goddess II, which departs Oct. 30 from Santa Cruz de
Tenerife, Canary Islands, and calls at Porto Grande, Cape Verde
Islands, before ending at Bridgetown, Barbados. Prices start at
$4,840 for the 10-night cruise.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: VETERANS GET VIP TREATMENT IN BRANSON, MO.  
 &HT;

 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When the Osmond Brothers ask all the veterans of war who attend
their showcase in Branson, Mo., to stand up, nearly one-third of
the crowd rises while the rest of the audience gives a thunderous
round of applause.
 &HT;    This show of respect is a common occurrence at the Osmond
production, one of many in Branson that run daily from breakfast to
bedtime to satisfy the more than 7 million visitors who come to
town each year.
 &HT;    Of those visitors, 2.3 million are veterans who, along with
their families, are treated like VIPs in this heartland town in
south-central Missouri. Some 250 military reunions are held there
annually, and there is even a hotline to help people organize
gatherings of all sorts, including military events. (For more
information, call 21st Century Tours at 877-349-3378.)
 &HT;    Branson's 5,000 residents and performers work hard to welcome
veterans with special treats. One that shouldn't be missed is the
six-day Veterans Homecoming, which takes place each November to
celebrate Veteran's Day. This year's celebration will include an 8K
race in which participants will walk or run _ even roll in
wheelchairs _ and special tributes to those who were bestowed the
Congressional Medal of Honor. In addition, several of the area
shows will be free to the public _ or heavily discounted _ to honor
our country's veterans.
 &HT;    For a schedule of events, write to the Branson Veterans Task
Force, P.O. Box 1726, Branson, MO 65615; or call (417) 337-8387.
 &HT;    
 THE BOOK THAT STARTED IT ALL  
 &HT;    The book ``Shepherd of the Hills,'' a tale about the lives,
loves and deceptions of the Ozark mountain people in the early
1900s, sold more than 1 million copies when it was first published
back in 1907. Its overwhelming popularity played a large part in
putting Branson on the map. Suddenly, people from across the
country wanted to see for themselves some of the ``hillbillies''
described on its pages. Eventually, the book was adapted for the
stage, and today that show is still performed nightly from April
through October.
 &HT;    As part of festivities, audience members who pay an additional
board an open-air train that takes them on an historical tour of
the area. Highlights include passing by the home of Old Matt, one
of the show's primary characters, and the 230-foot Inspiration
Tower, a landmark on the pageant grounds. The tour also includes
special events, such as a bluegrass festival.
 &HT;    The production is great fun, and during intermission the actors
welcome spectators to make their way down to the stage, take part
in a square dance and chat with the cast.
 &HT;    A combination adult ticket for the tour and play costs $27;
admission to the play alone is $21. For more information, call
(800) 653-6288 or visit www.old-matt.com. Please note: Those with
mobility problems should discuss their needs when purchasing
tickets.
 &HT;    Another way to see Branson is to buy a ticket for the Branson
Scenic Railway, (800) 287-2462, a 40-mile round-trip tour onboard a
vintage-car train. Knowledgeable guides give riders a taste of the
local history. Except for mid-December to mid-March, the train runs
daily, including a dinner run Saturday nights from May to December.
The train leaves from the Main Street depot in downtown Branson. An
adult ticket costs $19.35 plus tax.
 &HT;    
 CRAFTSMAN COLLEGE  
 &HT;    Any trip to Branson wouldn't be complete without a stop in
Silver Dollar City _ (800) 952-6626 or www.silverdollarcity.com _
an historically recreated town that takes visitors back in time to
the turn of the century in Ozark country. Here, employees dressed
in period costumes man the rides, restaurants and shops, and many
of the booths show how common goods were once created.
 &HT;    Last fall, Dr. Jack Gillispie of Kimberling City, Mo., spent a
day in Silver Dollar City _ a day that would ultimately lead him to
discover a new hobby. Because of his fascination with metalwork, it
wasn't long before the family practitioner found himself hanging
around the blacksmith's shop. By watching the smithy work and
speaking with the ``locals,'' he learned that he could enroll in a
``Craftsman for a Day'' seminar, which would teach him the basic
skills of forging. Other craft seminars offer instruction in the
finer points of dipping candles and weaving baskets, much like the
locals did years ago, before the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.
 &HT;    On his second visit to Silver Dollar this past April, Gillispie
once again visited the blacksmith shop, but this time he was
immediately handed a costume that helped him blend in with the
other villagers. Then, after a lesson in safety procedures, the
doctor was put to work to the delight of the watching crowd.
 &HT;    Being more adept with a stethoscope than a hammer and anvil,
Gillispie started with a small task _ making a little nail. He then
moved on to crafting a metal hook to hang a flower pot from and,
eventually, a rose that was constructed step by step. ``Mine looked
more like a dandelion,'' he confesses, ``but I really got into it.
It was a blast.''
 &HT;    In fact, Gillispie was so inspired by the class that herecently
ordered his own coal forge and anvil for his home, where he plans
to start tinkering with metalwork and reading a few books on the
subject before returning to Silver Dollar City for more lessons.
 &HT;    The day-long programs range in price from $30 to $125, depending
on the craft. For more information, call (800) 695-1353.
 &HT;    
 MORE TRAINING  
 &HT;    In addition to day-long craft seminars, Silver Dollar City also
offers three- to five-day seminars in specific craft skills. For
example, a pottery seminar with Master Craftsman Todd Nelson is
slated for Sept. 8 to 10, and five woodcarving seminars will be
held March 5 to 9. The longer seminars vary in price from $75 to
$275, depending on the instructor.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By SARAH LYALL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    August may be the best month of all to visit Edinburgh, the most
regal of Scottish cities. Not only are the northern days still
delightfully long, but it is also the month for the Edinburgh
International Festival, a world-renowned feast of music, dance and
theater.
 &HT;    Most of Edinburgh is given over to the festival, as
international companies, including the New York City Ballet, Czech
Philharmonic Orchestra and Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm,
take over theaters and concert halls, leaving the visitor
thoroughly spoiled for choice.
 &HT;    It has been a year since Scotland embarked on a bold democratic
experiment, swearing in its first England-free Parliament in almost
300 years and getting to run its own affairs when it comes to
things such as education and health.
 &HT;    The new legislators have yet to move into their custom-made
building at Holyrood, but construction can be observed in the Old
City, on Edinburgh's south side. When Parliament is in session, the
legislators themselves can be seen building Scotland's new
political order in their temporary headquarters, near the George IV
Bridge.
 &HT;    One caveat: it is normal, while visiting Edinburgh, to become
unduly obsessed with the vicissitudes of Scottish weather. It can
be cold; it can be hot; rain is generally lurking somewhere on the
horizon. The best course is to plan for the worst, but hope for the
best.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    From Aug. 13 to Sept. 2, Edinburgh will feast on the dizzyingly
eclectic smorgasbord that is the Edinburgh International Festival.
For tickets and a full list of events, call the festival office at
(44-131) 473-2000 (www.eif.co.uk) or Globaltickets at (800)
223-6108 in the United States.
 &HT;    Tickets can also be purchased at the Hub, the festival's
handsome new headquarters _ a prime spot for eating and shopping,
too _ on the Royal Mile in the Old City. Here are some highlights:
 &HT;    On Sept. 1, the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra will be performing
Janacek's Sinfonietta and Mahler's ``Das Lied von der Erde,'' a
lyrical meditation on death and nature. Curtain time is 8 p.m. at
Usher Hall on Lothian Road. Tickets from $7.50 to $58.50
(calculated at $1.50 to the pound).
 &HT;    The pianist Christian Zacharias will direct and accompany the
Scottish Chamber Orchestra in a rendering of the complete cycle of
Mozart's piano concertos, over seven nights between Aug. 14 and 27
at Usher Hall. Tickets $7.50 to $46.50.
 &HT;    Another of the festival's delights is seeing a play in a foreign
language. This year's possibilities include a German ``Hamlet'' and
a Spanish play called ``One thousand five hundred meters above the
level of Jack,'' about a deep-sea diver teetering on the edge of
madness. All have English supertitles. On various dates; tickets
from $9 to $33.75.
 &HT;    The Netherlands Dance Theater _ really three companies in one,
with each made up of dancers at different points in their careers _
is presenting a program of bold, sexy dancing over five nights,
from Aug. 29 to Sept. 2. And on Aug. 30 and 31, dancers from NDT1,
the main company, will dance to music played by the Czech
Philharmonic Orchestra, with Sir Charles Mackerras conducting.
Performances are at 7:30 p.m. at various sites; tickets, $7.50 to
$55.50.
 &HT;    There also is the well-known but much less formalized Edinburgh
Fringe Festival, which features stand-up comedy, theater, skits,
dance, music and mime in halls, parks, clubs and on the streets.
Performances run Aug. 6 to 28; (44-131) 226-5138; www.edfringe.com.
Admission to some performances is free; tickets range up to $22.50.
 &HT;    From Aug. 4 to 26, Edinburgh is also celebrating the 50th
anniversary of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, an extravaganza of
pipes and drums and well-turned calves peeking out from beneath
kilts. It takes place at night, beside Edinburgh Castle, which adds
to the pageantry; (44-131) 225-1188, www.edintattoo.co.uk. Shows
are Monday to Friday at 9 p.m., and Saturday at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m.
Tickets: $12.75 to $36.75.
 &HT;    Devoted to Dadaists and Surrealists such as Ernst, Magritte and
Man Ray, the Dean Gallery, 73 Belford Road, is a beautifully
organized new museum in a grand, neo-Classical former orphanage in
north Edinburgh. An exhibition from Saturday through Oct. 1 will
feature Salvador Dali. Open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Sunday 2 to 5 p.m.; (44-131) 624-6200. The regular collection is
free; the Dali exhibition is $6.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    If the day is spectacularly sunny (it happens sometimes),
celebrate at the Royal Botanic Garden, 70 acres of beautiful
gardens and greenhouses that feature a display of herbaceous
borders during August. Tucked amid all the greenery are a cafe and
shop. The Garden, 20A Inverleith Row, (44-131) 552-7171, is open
daily 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. (6 p.m. in September). Free admission.
 &HT;    The former royal yacht Britannia is docked on Ocean Drive in
Leith, and you can pay $11.55 ($8.95 ages 60 and older, $5.60 ages
5 to 17) to stride its four decks in a monarchical manner. Open
10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday to Thursday, and until 7:30 p.m.
Friday and Saturday; (44-131) 555-5566. Reservations are advised.
 &HT;    It cost hundreds of millions of dollars less than the Millennium
Dome in Greenwich, but Dynamic Earth, a new museum not far from the
royal Palace of Holyroodhouse, is far more successful. This
minidome offers nothing less than the story of Earth in all its
diversity.
 &HT;    Visitors can experience icebergs, volcanoes and tropical rain
forests, among other things, in 11 galleries with stunning special
effects. Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in summer, with last entry at
4:45. Information: (44-131) 550-7800; admission is $10.40, $5.90
ages 5 to 15.
 &HT;    The Museum of Scotland, on Chambers Street, presents a whirlwind
tour of Scottish history. Attractions include an authentic
18th-century guillotine. The top floor is a crazy quilt of objects
_ from golf balls and hairdryers to a Saab convertible to the Queen
song ``Bohemian Rhapsody'' _ that ordinary Scots have identified as
essential to their very being. Open daily. Admission (which also
gets you into the Royal Museum next door) is $4.50, $2.25 for
students and those 60 and older. Free for people under 19, and on
Tuesdays after 4:30 p.m.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Rooms are scarce during the festival. For 11th-hour help, try
www.edinburgh.org, which has a listing of hotels, or (44-131)
473-3800. For rooms in private homes at festival time, call
(44-131) 225-1101.
 &HT;    Just 10 minutes by car from the center of town and easily
reachable by bus, the Malmaison stands in modern splendor in Leith,
a lively and much-revived waterfront neighborhood east of central
Edinburgh.
 &HT;    The hotel, one in an admired British chain, is decorated in cool
earth tones, with clean lines and geometric motifs. The 60 rooms
include five suites. Doubles from $165, with tax. One Tower Place,
Leith; (44-131) 468-5000, fax (44-131) 468-5002.
 &HT;    The recently refurbished Edinburgh Royal Circus Hotel, 19-21
Royal Circus, in a handsome Georgian building in central Edinburgh,
offers 30 rooms, friendly service, garden views and easy access to
major attractions. Doubles are $144, tax and breakfast included;
(44-131) 220-5000, fax (44-131) 220-2020.
 &HT;    Budget: The Ashlyn Guest House, 42 Inverleith Row near the
Botanic Garden, is one of scores of small family-run hotels that
offer all the comforts of someone else's home at reasonable prices.
Five of the eight bedrooms have private baths. No smoking. Doubles
start at $45 a person, breakfast included. Telephone and fax
(44-131) 552-2954.
 &HT;    The Borthwick Guest House, at 23 Mayfield Gardens on the city's
south side, offers 11 bedrooms, all with private baths. Doubles
from $45 per person, breakfast included; (44-131) 667-8475, fax
(44-131) 667-6763.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Bonham, 35 Drumsleugh Gardens, Edinburgh's newest
hip hotel, epitomizes the city's seemingly effortless ability to
combine the old and the new. Constructed from three adjoining town
houses, the hotel has a stately Victorian facade that belies a
thoroughly modern interior, with brash contemporary furniture and
modern art. There are 48 rooms; doubles from $247.50, with tax and
breakfast. If the Bonham is full, its owners will gladly recommend
their other two hotels, the Howard and Channings, which are cozy
and Old World; (800) 323-5463 from the United States, fax (44-131)
226-6080.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Tucked away off the Royal Mile, Dubh Prais, 123B High Street,
offers Scottish dishes lovingly prepared with traditional recipes.
Try collops in the pan, steak medallions in a
port-and-pickled-walnut sauce; for dessert, there's atholl brose
parfait, an unusually tasty ice cream made with toasted oatmeal,
honey and Drambuie. A typical dinner for two, plus wine, costs
about $90. Reservations are essential _ there are only nine tables;
(44-131) 557-5732.
 &HT;    The Tower, at the top of the Museum of Scotland on Chambers
Street, is one of Edinburgh's hottest new restaurants. Appetizers
include sauteed mushrooms with spinach, poached egg and toasted
brioche; for the main course, portions of steak and roast beef come
in three sizes: 8, 12, and 16 ounces. Dinner for two, with wine,
generally comes to about $150. A two-course pre-theater dinner for
$18 is available from 4 to 6 p.m.; (44-131) 225-3003.
 &HT;    Most of Scotland's art galleries and museums feature smart cafes
with tasty dishes. One that stands out is Cafe Newton in the Dean
Gallery, 73 Belford Road. It is open the same hours as the gallery
and offers a small selection of light entrees, like smoked salmon
with creme fraiche, and an eggplant, feta, pesto and olive sandwich
on a choice of bread. A sculpture of Isaac Newton looks down from
the center of the room. Sandwiches average $6.35; daily hot
specials range from $6.75 to $8.25; brownies and other treats cost
from $1.20 to $4.35; no alcohol served.
 &HT;    Tucked into a corner of Hunter Square, not far from the bustle
of the Royal Mile, Bann's vegetarian cafe provides healthful food.
At dinner, appetizers include Thai phyllo parcels with stir-fried
vegetables on wilted bok choy, with a sweet sesame-seed oil
dressing; main courses include tarte tatin made of
 &HT;    layers of roasted sweet pepper, zucchini and cheddar cheese, and
an all-vegetable haggis _ no animal innards to speak of. Dinner for
two, with wine, costs about $60. Open daily 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.;
(44-131) 226-1112.
 &HT;    In the last few years, George Street has overtaken the
increasingly tacky Princes Street nearby as the city's choice
shopping and eating street. One of the nicest restaurants here is
the Dome, in a vast, high-ceilinged building that used to be a
mortuary, then a bank.
 &HT;    At the outside Garden Cafe, enjoy pizza and pasta (weather
permitting) for about $24 for two, wine included; in the Grill
Room, expect to pay from $60 to $75 for two, including wine, at
dinner for dishes that include pheasant and apricot terrine with
red currant dressing. They can both be found under one dome at 14
George Street; (44-131) 624-8624.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANN CRITTENDEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The Canadian Rockies are the only place I know where the
postcards don't lie. The snowcapped mountains and raging torrents
of water really are as spectacular as the glossy photographs make
them seem.
 &HT;    And among its charms, the area is blessed with one of the best
systems of hiking trails to be found anywhere. This is not a
secret; one of the first people to explore the region and to
recognize its hiking potential was Edward Whymper, the conqueror of
the Matterhorn.
 &HT;    On a trip last summer, my husband and I met more Germans, Swiss
and other Europeans on the trails than Americans, drawn to the kind
of civilized wilderness characteristic of Europe in the 19th
century.
 &HT;    At times we felt that we were in the era of Goethe and
Wordsworth, or at least of Frederick Church and Asher Durand and
other American landscape painters. Scenes: on a quiet road,
suddenly surrounded by a herd of male elk, their six- and
seven-point racks bobbing gently as they slowly grazed past us; on
a mountain ledge high above an emerald lake, chatting with
collectors of still unidentified Cambrian fossils; in a forest of
spruce and subalpine fir, motionless as a female moose and her calf
warily cross the path ahead; on a highline trail looking across a
valley at an explosive waterfall 1,000 feet high, with not another
soul in sight. But I'm getting ahead of my story.
 &HT;    Our first priority in planning this two-week trip was to find
good day hiking, allowing us to experience the mountains without
carrying 40-pound packs for days or having to endure the crowds and
the bus terminal madness that now surround the grand old hotels in
Banff and Lake Louise.
 &HT;    Of the five national parks that encompass the prime wilderness
of the Canadian Rockies, we discovered that the best one for our
purposes would be Yoho.
 &HT;    Banff, the first national park in Canada, including the crown
jewel of Lake Louise, is known as the hiking capital of the
country, with a huge network of well-maintained trails. But the
park also has more than five million visitors, most of them in July
and August _ too many to get away from without spending all one's
time above the tree line, sleeping on rocks.
 &HT;    Jasper, a few hours north up the magnificent Icefields Parkway,
has celebrated longer trails, but not too many get-away-from-it-all
day hikes.
 &HT;    Yoho, just west of Lake Louise on the western side of the
Continental Divide, has far fewer visitors (an estimated 1.8
million in 1999)and 185 miles of trails that can take you to the
top of the world and down again in time for a dinner and a book in
front of the fire.
 &HT;    Before we arrived in Yoho we spent a few days in Jasper and the
Lake Louise area. We liked the informal funkiness of the little
town of Jasper and our log cabin (and hot tub) in the woods nearby,
but we had to drive an hour or more each day to find good day
hikes.
 &HT;    We skirted the crowds at Lake Louise by staying eight miles away
at Lake Moraine Lodge, luxuriously rustic in the style of Ralph
Lauren. There a couple of world-class day hikes began right on the
grounds, but the lake itself, an emerald gem, was surrounded by day
trippers.
 &HT;    But on our first day in Yoho we had it all: a vigorous hike with
dazzling views; a glimpse into the geological forces that formed
this region; and seven kinds of weather, including drizzle, sun,
cloudiness and a brief hail storm. For outdoor activities in the
Canadian Rockies, the key word is layers _ rainproof layers.
 &HT;    We had joined a group put together by the Yoho-Burgess Shale
Foundation for a hike up to one of the most important fossil sites
in the world, now a Unesco World Heritage Site.
 &HT;    In 1989, Stephen Jay Gould, in his book ``Wonderful Life,''
described the ``weird wonders'' found here: strange,
500-million-year-old sea creatures displaying a greater disparity
than exists in the animal kingdom today.
 &HT;    The hike is no joke _ 12.5 miles round trip and an elevation
gain of about 2,500 feet, up to an altitude of 6,700 feet _ not
high by Colorado or High Sierra standards, but high enough to be
aware of thin air and aging muscles.
 &HT;    It was utterly worth it. The guide, a geologist named Carole
Augereau, gave us the rundown as we trudged up: how half a billion
years ago this area was the north shore of a vast supercontinent
surrounded by shallow warm seas, teeming with the earliest forms of
multicellular animal life.
 &HT;    Eons later, between 175 million and 45 million years ago, two
separate collisions of continental plates (moving at their fastest
at the speed of a growing fingernail) slowly pushed up the ancient
ocean floors, forming the mountain spines running north-south
through Canada and the United States.
 &HT;    Thus it was that in 1886 railway workers found ``stone bugs''
buried in alpine rocks, and from 1909 to 1917 Charles D. Walcott,
then head of the Smithsonian Institution and the foremost Cambrian
paleontologist of his day, found such marvelous marine
invertebrates as Opabinia, with its five eyes, Aysheaia, with its
mouth surrounded by a ring of tentacles, and the strangest of all,
Hallucigenia, an animal so bizarre that for decades no one knew
which of its sides was up.
 &HT;    To our delight, Dr. Des Collins of the Royal Ontario Museum, who
has been excavating the quarry for 25 years, was at the site when
we arrived. He told us that thanks to discoveries in two new
quarries, in China and Greenland, as well as his own finds, there
is now evidence of even more unclassified Cambrian organisms than a
decade ago.
 &HT;    ``The Cambrian world,'' he said, ``is getting stranger-looking
than ever.''
 &HT;    Dr. Collins passed around a few of that week's finds, some of
which, to a lay person's eye, looked like faint scratchings on dark
grey pieces of shale. A few steps away, half a dozen graduate
students and volunteers were busy chipping away on stacks of muddy
rocks with hammers and chisels.
 &HT;    When I peered into the quarry to have a closer look, a handsome
French scientist looked up at me and said, with deep and
unmistakable pride, ``I just found a worm.''
 &HT;    The view from Burgess Ridge was unparalleled. On our left were
the massive limestone cliffs of Burgess Mountain and on our right
was Mount Wapta. In the distance loomed Michael Peak, the President
and the Vice President, all three covered in snow.
 &HT;    Far below lay Emerald Lake, the largest body of water in Yoho
National Park. (The explorer who gave Emerald Lake its perfect name
had to rename a lake already called Emerald. Its new name: Lake
Louise.)
 &HT;    I have found that one of the principal joys of a hike is
contemplating the pleasures that await its end. Daydreams of the
hot shower, the cool drink, the good meal and the soft bed tend to
crowd out more immediate realities, like the flora and fauna of the
last few knee-crushing kilometers downhill.
 &HT;    Toward the end of this particular 10-hour day the fantasies were
vivid, for we were headed for the Emerald Lake Lodge, another
sybaritic outpost. A few hours later, we were unwinding in a hot
tub overlooking the mountain-ringed lake, perusing a tempting menu
and building a fire in our bedroom. Ah, wilderness!
 &HT;    The next day we took a less strenuous stroll around the lake and
up into the basin behind it. We arranged for a naturalist to
accompany us. A cold, snowy winter and nonexistent spring meant
that the flowering alpine meadows we had hoped to see had still not
appeared, even by mid- to late July, but myriad earlier flowers
were scattered around the lakeside, including the ubiquitous white
globe flowers and bunchberry, wild roses, yellow columbines, bright
orange western wood lilies, purple asters, tiny white and green bog
orchids, and equally delicate twinflower (Linnaea borealis), a
Linnaeus favorite.
 &HT;    We also learned the secret of the mountain lakes' brilliant
turquoise color: a substance called rock flour. As the glaciers
that feed these lakes move down the mountains, the rocks embedded
in their base scrape against other rocks, grinding them into a fine
grayish powder that washes into the lakes as the glaciers melt.
This powder reflects the blue-green part of the light spectrum,
giving the water a hue that would be garish if any painter tried to
capture it.
 &HT;    The next day we were eagerly anticipating another major trek,
this time in the Lake O'Hara area, a uniquely beautiful place of
cirque and rock basin lakes, alpine heath and larch stands, framed
by the same two peaks _ Lefroy and Victoria _ that overlook Lake
Louise on the other side of the great divide. So beautiful is Lake
O'Hara that private vehicles are banned from the road leading into
it and a quota system limits the number of daily visitors to 150 to
200.
 &HT;    A day hiker from the town of Field, for example, has to make a
reservation for one of the six available seats on the daily bus
going in. You have to be at the tourist office at dawn on the
morning before you want to go. Unless you are one of the first six
people there, forget it.
 &HT;    Not being savvy, we arrived at 7 a.m. one morning and lost out.
The next day, seriously determined, we arrived at the still-locked
office by 6 o'clock, and there were only two people ahead of us.
Ten minutes later a young man from Quebec arrived, and there went
the last two spaces.
 &HT;    Literally one minute after that, an older man and his son came
up, only to be told, at 6:15, that they were too late. The
gentleman commented that the sight of the sun coming up over the
mountains had been so magnificent that he had stopped on the
highway several times to take pictures; otherwise, he said
ruefully, he might have made it.
 &HT;    ``That was you?'' the man from Quebec exclaimed. ``I was right
behind you.''
 &HT;    We picked one of the most popular hikes, from Lake O'Hara up to
Lake Oesa, then across a ledge around Yukness Mountain, down to the
Opabin Plateau, and back in time for the 6:30 p.m. bus.
 &HT;    Oesa (the Stoney Indian word for ice, so called because the lake
is frozen nearly year round) was, as predicted, gorgeous. But on
Yukness, big patches of snow still covered the trail, including one
long stretch that curved up and around the mountain with a
precipitous drop on one side.
 &HT;    At this point I remembered that I really am terribly afraid of
heights. I inched my way along the slippery track, digging now my
toes, then my heels, into the footsteps of the fools who had
preceded me. When we were finally back on solid, if not flat,
ground, I literally sobbed, relieved to be alive.
 &HT;    We began to saunter down toward the plateau. Just as I was
beginning to get back into the blissful rhythm of trekking, a voice
cried up at us from far below: ``A mother bear with two cubs!''
 &HT;    The most dangerous kind of bear.
 &HT;    We froze. ``Black or grizzly?'' my husband shouted back. We
didn't hear an answer. He scanned the valley below, and sure
enough, way down there, right where we were heading, were a large
tawny bear and two smaller ones, moving faster than race horses on
a diagonal away from the trail. They didn't look like black bears.
 &HT;    I thought of the ordeal behind me and decided I'd rather face a
grizzly than go back the way we'd come. We took a whistle out of
our pack and started tooting as we came down, making noise,
scanning both sides of the trail constantly, and marching briskly
back to Lake O'Hara. When I looked at the hiking guide later, I
realized that we'd seen nothing of one of the prettiest parts of
that hike.
 &HT;    We did get to be interviewed by the park rangers; a grizzly
sighting is big news, particularly in one of the most popular
hiking areas in the Canadian Rockies. It turned out they knew these
bears well _ they were even tagged. But they weren't supposed to be
hanging around trails those of us who are lower on the food chain
like to frequent.
 &HT;    Our final hike was more satisfying. The trail to take in Yoho is
called the Iceline, and true to its name, it was still partly under
snow even at the end of July. We had put it off until our last day,
which turned out to be a Rocky Mountain high, clear and sunny.
 &HT;    The first mile and a half was steadily uphill, sweetened by an
almost constant view of magnificent Takakkaw Falls, which burst out
of a rock cliff like a giant's broken water main. The trail climbed
high on the open avalanche slopes of the President Range and onto
the moraines of several glaciers, past two half-frozen glacier-fed
tarns.
 &HT;    We were dazzled by the utter stillness and vastness of the bleak
alpine landscape, so close to the glaciers and snowy peaks, and so
far above the Yoho Valley that we felt as if we were in the clouds
looking down.
 &HT;    There were no bears on the way down. Just crunching through
tracks in the snow in shorts and T-shirt, swinging hiking poles
like a cross-country skier, sliding down a snow bank to avoid any
more slippery traverses, down into the forest around another
pristine lake, past a raging river and more plunging falls. Yoho,
by the way, is a Cree word loosely translated as ``awesome.''
 &HT;    -----

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY AURELIA C. SCOTT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The moment of truth came at an outdoor table in the Plaza Nueva
in Granada, although neither of us admitted it. Instead, my
husband, Bob, and I continued to sip our glasses of vino tinto and
roll green olives between tongue and teeth, ejecting the pits with
newly acquired expertise.
 &HT;    The evening sun was refracted through dusty air, gilding the
Gypsies and multinational youth in the plaza. Homeward-bound
Granadans threaded through the crowds carrying grocery bags topped
by market-fresh fruit. Tourists whose fanny packs made them look
bustle-bottomed clustered around displays of postcards, fluttering
lace fans and trays of castanets.
 &HT;    As the shadows lengthened, the day's deafening traffic dwindled
to the whine of motor scooters loaded beyond their capacities with
three, even four clinging passengers. We sipped and watched and
rested our feet, wondering how we would stay awake until Spanish
dinner time at 8:30 p.m. _ 8 p.m. in restaurants that cater to
tourists.
 &HT;    And we wondered, although still not giving voice to the thought,
what to do with the rest of our trip. Not that we didn't have
plans. The plans for this first trip to the land of sun and saffron
and tapas had been made in meticulous detail weeks before our
departure.
 &HT;    I had spent a fine meal's worth of money on Frommer's, Fodor's,
Eyewitness and Let's Go guides and other aides, including
Learn-Spanish-in-Your-Car CDs. We had combed newspaper travel
sections and reread articles clipped from food magazines.
 &HT;    I had followed Internet links from one Spanish travel site to
another until I was bleary-eyed and lost. We had begged friends and
relatives of friends for memories of their own trips.
 &HT;    Finally, knowing too much and not enough, we developed a
two-week itinerary. Not all of Spain, of course. Just what called
to us as we shoveled our way out of yet another Maine winter.
 &HT;    Barcelona because 30 years ago Bob had read Orwell's ``Homage to
Catalonia''; Quatretondeta in the mountains above Alicante for the
small-town experience; Agua Amarga to dip our feet in the
Mediterranean in a still-pretty seaside town; Granada for the
Alhambra; Ronda because it is the most accessible of the Moorish
pueblos blancos; Cordoba for its mosque and old city; Cuenca for
its perilously hanging houses and its location in Castilla-La
Mancha; and Barcelona again to rest before the flight home.
 &HT;    I typed it all up _ flight numbers, hotel names, telephone
numbers, dates of arrival, dates of departure. One copy faxed to
our nearest and dearest, another hand-delivered to friends who
would water our houseplants; a copy in Bob's carry-on; the copy in
my carry-on stapled to a sheaf of hotel confirmation letters and
directions.
 &HT;    Too much? Well, I like lists. Besides, we were heading on the
cusp of high season to a country whose language we do not speak. We
think of ourselves as flexible and adventurous. Yet we have reached
the stage at which we no longer wish to trail our suitcases along
foreign streets looking for a hotel with a vacancy.
 &HT;    And to be honest, Bob does not want to traipse along a dark
corridor to reach the bathroom and I need a mattress that does not
sink to the floor.
 &HT;    Munching on an olive as the sun set on the Plaza Nueva, I
reflected that thus far the plans had been executed practically
perfectly. Barcelona's light and space and elegance had made us
giddy with pleasure.
 &HT;    Arm in arm, we joined the perambulating throngs to walk up and
down, and again up and down the Rambla, the grand tree-lined
boulevard to the sea. Standing before Antoni Gaudi's famous
wave-shaped building, whose wrought-iron balconies writhe like
wind-tossed seaweed, Bob said, ``I could live here.'' Not Casa Mila
specifically, but Barcelona. I agreed.
 &HT;    Once out of Barcelona our rented silver Opel whizzed easily
along the roads, nudged only slightly by the turbulence of passing
BMWs.
 &HT;    Climbing into the mountains, we entered the Spain of my
imagination, all olive trees, grapevines and rock. Quatretondeta's
terraced almond, olive and cherry groves seduced us as much as
Barcelona had. We felt embraced by the welcome at Hotel Els Frares
and by its blissfully comfortable beds.
 &HT;    Walking among the olive trees, we inhaled air scented by
waist-high rosemary growing wild on the hillsides. We greeted
black-clad grandmothers as they stood by their scrubbed doorsteps
on pristine village streets too narrow for car traffic.
 &HT;    ``Buenos dias,'' we said, exaggerating the Castilian
pronunciation in our enthusiasm. No wonder they smiled in response.
 &HT;    On toward the south to Agua Amarga, a fishing village on the
southern coast. It was as pretty as advertised _ a tumble of low,
white buildings leading down to a quiet beach and the bluest blue
Mediterranean. The trip down the mountain took longer than planned;
plotting the mileage in Maine, I had forgotten to take the
slow-going curves of mountain roads into account.
 &HT;    We were at the edge of our patience by the time we pulled up to
the front door of our hotel, the MiKasa. But a cosseted night there
(it felt more like a private villa than a 20-room hotel) restored
us.
 &HT;    Yet now, as the first of our three scheduled days in Granada
sighed to a close, we began to feel burdened by our planning. The
structure of those lists constricted rather than comforted. We were
tired, of course, suffering from a midtrip weariness that is
signaled by a longing for one's own washer and dryer. It's the time
when I want nothing more than a cup of tea made by steeping real
Darjeeling leaves in water that has reached a full rolling boil.
 &HT;    Walking slowly toward a barely 8 p.m. dinner, Bob said, ``I wish
we could have more time in Barcelona,'' just as I said, ``I cannot
remember why we are going to Cordoba.'' We stopped and stared at
each other.
 &HT;    Over lamb chops and garlic grilled chicken at the Restaurante
Gallio on the Plaza Bib-Rambla, we dithered.
 &HT;    ``We'd have to cancel all those reservations.'' ``Immediately,
right away, now,'' I agreed, checking my watch as if it were
already too late.
 &HT;    ``The Barcelona hotels are bound to be full.'' ``Where would we
stop along the way?'' ``We can't make it back in one day.'' ``The
rental-car people might penalize us for returning the car early.''
 &HT;    This last brought us up short. Unable to change our plans
because Avis might punish us?
 &HT;    A shiver of excitement made us grin. We would be on the lam,
playing hooky, leaving at intermission, absent without leave. We
toasted each other with what was left in the bottle.
 &HT;    In the end, it was almost easy. Phrasebook in hand, we called in
our cancellations. We were sorry, sorry, sorry, but, ``si, por
favor, quiero cancelar. Muchas gracias.''
 &HT;    That done, we fretted when our Barcelona hotel proved full for
the new nights we wanted. I flapped the sheaf of canceled hotels at
Bob. ``We've done it now.'' I didn't quite wail, but I was fierce,
as if my sudden loss of mooring were his fault rather than our
shared adventure.
 &HT;    Ultimately, we handed the search over to Barcelona's hotel
reservation bureau, which found what we wanted within an hour.
Amazing.
 &HT;    The next day, we toured the Alhambra with rediscovered
enthusiasm. The day after that we tried two new tapas bars and
succeeded in staying awake for an 8:30 dinner.
 &HT;    On the fourth day, silly with excitement, we pointed our silver
Opel north toward four unencumbered, ribbon-tied days in Barcelona.
 &HT;    And the unplanned night on the road? We consulted the map. What
about visiting Elche, which claims to have the largest palm grove
in Europe? In the land of Quixote we had learned to follow our
hearts, not a schedule.

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  I am planning a trip to Tuscany, Italy, this fall and would
like to stay at a very special place. Can you find one for me?
 &HT;     A:  Palazzo Terranova is in Umbria, a 90-minute drive from
Florence. Perched at 1,800 feet overlooking the Tiber Valley, this
eight-room aerie is quite possibly the best and most beautiful
country-house hideaway in all of Italy.
 &HT;    Palazzo Terranova, which was built in the 18th century, has been
restored by Sarah and Johnny Townsend, a dazzling English couple
who have filled the rooms with family heirlooms, rare antiques, the
work of local artisans and laughter.
 &HT;    The Townsends' passion for Umbria and their wish to share their
experiences is apparent from the moment guests check in. Rooms are
spacious and each is named after an opera. There are no minibars
here, no televisions, no gadgetry. Instead, guests find four-poster
beds, great shuttered windows, 18th-century paintings, beamed
ceilings, trompe l'oeil, soft linens and total peace.
 &HT;    The Townsends have created a sweet retreat here _ each salon is
a work of art done in Old Master colors, and the library is crammed
with books affectionately inscribed by grateful guests.
 &HT;    Each day, the Terranova staff prepares delightful breakfasts to
be enjoyed on the fragrant terrace. Dinners celebrate the fresh
bounty of the Umbrian countryside. The wine cellar holds remarkable
Italian and French wines. A pool, three kitchens for culinary
instruction, a vineyard, an orchard and gardens await visitors.
 &HT;    Umbria's ancient treasures _ its churches, villages, trattorias,
wine country and friendly people _ are just minutes away as are
golf, horses, bikes, painting classes and hot-air balloons.
 &HT;    For all this quality, rates start at an astonishingly low $300 a
night, including breakfast. For more information, call
011-39-075-857-0083, e-mail sarah(AT)palazzoterranova.com or visit
www.palazzoterranova.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I are planning to take our school-age children
to North Carolina's Outer Banks this summer. We keep hearing about
an outdoor drama that tells the story of Roanoke. Do you have any
information?
 &HT;     A:  ``The Lost Colony,'' America's longest-running outdoor
drama, was written in 1937 by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright
Paul Green. It was originally intended to run for one season, but
success has propelled it into its 63rd.
 &HT;    ``The Lost Colony'' uses song, dance, drama and special effects
to tell the story of America's first English settlement (1584-1587)
and its eerie and mysterious disappearance. Impressive costumes and
the voices of the prestigious Westminster Choir College add special
touches to the performance.
 &HT;    The drama is staged at the Waterside Theatre, inside historic
Fort Raleigh. Ancient oak trees, laced with Spanish moss, frame the
theatre, and balmy ocean breezes help set the scene.
 &HT;    The production runs Monday through Saturday every summer from
June through August. Tickets range from $8 to $18, and children are
admitted for half-price on Monday nights. For reservations or more
information, call (800) 488-5012.
 &HT;    Another option is to purchase the Roanoke Island Queen's Pass,
(252) 475-1500. The pass, which costs $27 for adults and $14 for
children, includes admission to ``The Lost Colony,'' as well as the
North Carolina Aquarium, the Elizabethan Gardens and the Roanoke
Island Festival Park.
 &HT;    A great place to stay is the Tranquil House Inn on Manteo's
waterfront. Summer rates range from $149 to $189, and reservations
can be made by calling (800) 458-7069. Don't miss dinner at 1587,
located in the inn.
 &HT;     Q:  I am going to be in the Bahamas with a friend later this
year. While she loves nothing more than lying in the sun, I need a
little more stimulation. What else can one do there?
 &HT;     A:  While the Bahamas are typically known for their
sun-drenched beaches, bronzing bodies and exotic beverages, there
are also a number of other activities to keep you busy. For
example, between Sept. 22 to 24, try your luck at the Fall Black
Jack Tournament held at the Princess Casino on Grand Bahama Island.
 &HT;    The North Eleuthera Sailing Regatta will be held Oct. 12 to 15.
Spectators can watch as locally built sloops sail between Harbour
Island and Three-Island Bay, North Eleuthera.
 &HT;    During the second week of November, both visitors and locals can
take part in the 14th Annual Grand Bahama Conchman Triathlon _ a
.5-mile swim, a 20-mile bike ride and a 3.5- mile run.
 &HT;    And if you're still standing after that, why not get a head
start on your Christmas shopping at Nassau/Paradise Island's
Christmas Jollification Festival. Or try out your fishing skills at
the Annual Bahamas Wahoo Championships. Both events will be held in
early November.
 &HT;    For more information on these and other activities in the
Bahamas, visit www.bahamas.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  I have heard rumors about a series of art exhibits
featuring Los Angeles artists at the Bel Age Hotel and was
wondering if you could give me more information.
 &HT;     A:  Throughout the summer, the Wyndham Bel Age Hotel in West
Hollywood is presenting several eclectic art shows under the banner
``Art &AMP; Soul.'' The shows showcase the latest works from three L.A.
artists combined with live acoustic and jazz music.
 &HT;    The works of two artists can still be viewed this summer season
_ Michael Spalt, until Aug. 15, and J.C. Jaress, from Aug. 16 to
Sept. 12.
 &HT;    Each month the Wyndham Bel Age hosts a ``Meet the Artist''
reception in their La Brasserie Restaurant &AMP; Club, which has been
hailed as ``the best jazz room with a view'' by the Los Angeles
Times. These monthly receptions will also feature tantalizing
appetizers, fine wines and champagne.
 &HT;    For more information, please call La Brasserie at (310)
358-7776. For reservations at the Wyndham Bel Age Hotel, call (800)

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The days of the great ocean liners may be long gone, but there
are dozens of other ships making trans-Atlantic crossings that
don't reach the headlines. They're on repositioning cruises, and
major cruise lines such as Celebrity Cruises, Holland America Line
and Seabourn Cruise Line offer them every year.
 &HT;    Cruises lines that sell Mediterranean cruises in summer
typically offer Caribbean cruises in winter. To get their ships
from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean, they take them across the
Atlantic in September or October. In spring, come March and April,
they take them back. The ships are literally repositioned twice a
year, hence the name.
 &HT;    From the Mediterranean, these voyages tend to begin in Greece,
Italy or Spain, sometimes stopping in the Canary Islands before
ending up in the Caribbean. But these itineraries change as well.
Some ships may include stops in Morocco or the Cape Verde Islands
and may end in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., or even New York.
 &HT;    Because each cruise typically has a few ports of call at the
beginning and end of each voyage, the length of a trip is usually
10 to 14 days. Within the business, they're known as ``blue water''
cruises, because the ships may spend a week or more on the open
ocean.
 &HT;    ``They attract well-traveled people who've already been to many
ports,'' Anne Scully explains. Scully, a certified travel counselor
and a vice president at McCabe Bremer Travel (1491 Chain Bridge
Road, Mclean, VA 22101; 800-747-84011; www.mccabebremer.com), adds,
``They get the ship at its best and get to play on it for five or
nine days. It's really a crossing, not a cruise. You get to read a
book from beginning to end.''
 &HT;    Scully sells many such cruises and says the major difference is
that ``on a traditional cruise, you're trying to keep up with the
shore excursions and ports. On a repositioning cruise, you keep up
with your own schedule.''
 &HT;    Traditionally, these cruises offer some of the best values in
the business. They're harder to fill because they're longer and
they occur in shoulder season. That means empty cabins that are
routinely discounted.
 &HT;    Scully speculates that ``people are afraid of them because of
open ocean. But these are big ships with stabilizers. Rogue waves
and rough water do occur, but the QE2, for example, regularly sails
trans-Atlantic from April to December.''
 &HT;    Repositioning cruises have traditionally afforded a prime
opportunity to sample luxury ships at middle-of-the-road prices.
Scully maintains that by shopping carefully, the seagoing public
can get a six-star ship for the price of a three- or four-star
vessel.
 &HT;    ``My rule of thumb is to go for the least expensive cabin on the
best ship,'' Sculley says.
 &HT;    Here's a sample of repositioning cruises this fall. Unless
noted, these are list prices, per person, based on double
occupancy, without airfare. A travel agent or cruise-only agent
should be able to find a good discount on these fares.
 &HT;    Celebrity Cruises (1050 Caribbean Way, Miami, FL 33132;
800-437-3111; www.celebrity-cruises.com) has a 12-night sailing on
the 1,950-passenger Millennium that departs Genoa, Italy, on Nov. 3
and then calls at Livorno, Italy; Villefranche, France; Barcelona
and Cadiz, Spain; and finishes in New York City. Prices start at
$3,209.
 &HT;    Holland America Line (300 Elliott Avenue West, Seattle, WA
98119; 800-426-0327; www.hollandamerica.com) offers a nine-night
cruise on the 1,214-passenger Noordam that departs from Lisbon,
Portugal, on Nov. 28 and calls at Ponta Delgada and Horta in the
Azores, Half Moon Cay, Bahamas, and ends in Fort Lauderdale.
Holland America's ``Early Savings Fares'' start at $1,099.
 &HT;    Seabourn Cruise Line (6100 Blue Lagoon Drive, Suite 400, Miami,
FL 33126; 800-929-9391; www.seabourn.com) has a number of ships
that make trans-Atlantic crossings. Among them is the 116-passenger
Seabourn Goddess II, which departs Oct. 30 from Santa Cruz de
Tenerife, Canary Islands, and calls at Porto Grande, Cape Verde
Islands, before ending at Bridgetown, Barbados. Prices start at
$4,840 for the 10-night cruise.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: VETERANS GET VIP TREATMENT IN BRANSON, MO.  
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material from The New York Times
Syndicate is for use by WAY TO GO! clients. Nonsubscribers can use
this article only by special arrangement. For purchase information,
see end of text. 
 &HT;    
 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When the Osmond Brothers ask all the veterans of war who attend
their showcase in Branson, Mo., to stand up, nearly one-third of
the crowd rises while the rest of the audience gives a thunderous
round of applause.
 &HT;    This show of respect is a common occurrence at the Osmond
production, one of many in Branson that run daily from breakfast to
bedtime to satisfy the more than 7 million visitors who come to
town each year.
 &HT;    Of those visitors, 2.3 million are veterans who, along with
their families, are treated like VIPs in this heartland town in
south-central Missouri. Some 250 military reunions are held there
annually, and there is even a hotline to help people organize
gatherings of all sorts, including military events. (For more
information, call 21st Century Tours at 877-349-3378.)
 &HT;    Branson's 5,000 residents and performers work hard to welcome
veterans with special treats. One that shouldn't be missed is the
six-day Veterans Homecoming, which takes place each November to
celebrate Veteran's Day. This year's celebration will include an 8K
race in which participants will walk or run _ even roll in
wheelchairs _ and special tributes to those who were bestowed the
Congressional Medal of Honor. In addition, several of the area
shows will be free to the public _ or heavily discounted _ to honor
our country's veterans.
 &HT;    For a schedule of events, write to the Branson Veterans Task
Force, P.O. Box 1726, Branson, MO 65615; or call (417) 337-8387.
 &HT;    
 THE BOOK THAT STARTED IT ALL  
 &HT;    The book ``Shepherd of the Hills,'' a tale about the lives,
loves and deceptions of the Ozark mountain people in the early
1900s, sold more than 1 million copies when it was first published
back in 1907. Its overwhelming popularity played a large part in
putting Branson on the map. Suddenly, people from across the
country wanted to see for themselves some of the ``hillbillies''
described on its pages. Eventually, the book was adapted for the
stage, and today that show is still performed nightly from April
through October.
 &HT;    As part of festivities, audience members who pay an additional
board an open-air train that takes them on an historical tour of
the area. Highlights include passing by the home of Old Matt, one
of the show's primary characters, and the 230-foot Inspiration
Tower, a landmark on the pageant grounds. The tour also includes
special events, such as a bluegrass festival.
 &HT;    The production is great fun, and during intermission the actors
welcome spectators to make their way down to the stage, take part
in a square dance and chat with the cast.
 &HT;    A combination adult ticket for the tour and play costs $27;
admission to the play alone is $21. For more information, call
(800) 653-6288 or visit www.old-matt.com. Please note: Those with
mobility problems should discuss their needs when purchasing
tickets.
 &HT;    Another way to see Branson is to buy a ticket for the Branson
Scenic Railway, (800) 287-2462, a 40-mile round-trip tour onboard a
vintage-car train. Knowledgeable guides give riders a taste of the
local history. Except for mid-December to mid-March, the train runs
daily, including a dinner run Saturday nights from May to December.
The train leaves from the Main Street depot in downtown Branson. An
adult ticket costs $19.35 plus tax.
 &HT;    
 CRAFTSMAN COLLEGE  
 &HT;    Any trip to Branson wouldn't be complete without a stop in
Silver Dollar City _ (800) 952-6626 or www.silverdollarcity.com _
an historically recreated town that takes visitors back in time to
the turn of the century in Ozark country. Here, employees dressed
in period costumes man the rides, restaurants and shops, and many
of the booths show how common goods were once created.
 &HT;    Last fall, Dr. Jack Gillispie of Kimberling City, Mo., spent a
day in Silver Dollar City _ a day that would ultimately lead him to
discover a new hobby. Because of his fascination with metalwork, it
wasn't long before the family practitioner found himself hanging
around the blacksmith's shop. By watching the smithy work and
speaking with the ``locals,'' he learned that he could enroll in a
``Craftsman for a Day'' seminar, which would teach him the basic
skills of forging. Other craft seminars offer instruction in the
finer points of dipping candles and weaving baskets, much like the
locals did years ago, before the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.
 &HT;    On his second visit to Silver Dollar this past April, Gillispie
once again visited the blacksmith shop, but this time he was
immediately handed a costume that helped him blend in with the
other villagers. Then, after a lesson in safety procedures, the
doctor was put to work to the delight of the watching crowd.
 &HT;    Being more adept with a stethoscope than a hammer and anvil,
Gillispie started with a small task _ making a little nail. He then
moved on to crafting a metal hook to hang a flower pot from and,
eventually, a rose that was constructed step by step. ``Mine looked
more like a dandelion,'' he confesses, ``but I really got into it.
It was a blast.''
 &HT;    In fact, Gillispie was so inspired by the class that herecently
ordered his own coal forge and anvil for his home, where he plans
to start tinkering with metalwork and reading a few books on the
subject before returning to Silver Dollar City for more lessons.
 &HT;    The day-long programs range in price from $30 to $125, depending
on the craft. For more information, call (800) 695-1353.
 &HT;    
 MORE TRAINING  
 &HT;    In addition to day-long craft seminars, Silver Dollar City also
offers three- to five-day seminars in specific craft skills. For
example, a pottery seminar with Master Craftsman Todd Nelson is
slated for Sept. 8 to 10, and five woodcarving seminars will be
held March 5 to 9. The longer seminars vary in price from $75 to
$275, depending on the instructor.
 &HT;    For more information about Branson _ including road information
_ call (800) 214-3661, or visit www.branson.tripusa.com on the Web.
You can also visit the city's Web site at www.bransonchamber.com.

EXPLORING THE GEORGE BURNS SCHOOL OF AGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Comedian George Burns, whose recipe for
longevity seemed to be martinis and cigars, died in 1996 at the age
of 100. When asked in his late 90s if his doctor knew he still
smoked, Burns said, ``No . . . he's dead.''
</P>
<P>
   An enlarged photograph of Burns happily puffing a cigar
brightens the article headlined ``How Long Have You Got?'' in the
Getting Ever Older section of the Scientific American Summer 2000
quarterly, ``The Quest to Beat Aging.''
</P>
<P>
   That lead article by Science News writer Kathryn Brown reports
that several of the 169 centenarians queried in a recent New
England Centenarian Study said they smoked.
</P>
<P>
   Some centenarians exercise and ``some brazenly defy the notion
of a healthy lifestyle,'' Brown writes. ``Nevertheless, almost all
have lived free of cancer, and nearly a fourth of them have escaped
any form of dementia.''
</P>
<P>
   Aging is incredibly variable, Brown continues. The average life
span has jumped from about 47 in 1900 to 76 years today, according
to the National Institute on Aging. ``We're living longer simply
because we escape many of the illnesses and events that plagued our
ancestors, from death during childbirth to tuberculosis,'' Brown
reports, ``largely because of better sanitation, cleaner water
supplies and basic medical advances such as immunizations.''
</P>
<P>
   And the older you get, the better your odds for getting older.
``Demographers have found that death rates climb steadily till
about 85 _ and then begin to slowly edge back down again,'' Brown
says.
</P>
<P>
   Variables? ``Your neighbor may have run a marathon at 70, while
your landlord was busy having heart surgery. Your great-aunt was a
chess champion, but your grandfather couldn't remember his
address.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown quotes Dr. Thomas J. Perls, co-author with Margery Silver
of ``Living to 100: Living to Your Maximum Potential at Any Age''
(Basic Books), who says: ``Researchers used to believe that the
older you get, the sicker you get. That's completely wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   An illustration in the new issue of Scientific American shows
how the body ages, noting that ``Each person's body ages in unique
ways, but a hypothetical average person can expect these changes
over time'' _ changes to the brain, eyes, heart, lungs, pancreas,
blood vessels, bones and muscles.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly's scientists, researchers and authors say healthy
habits can add years. Healthy habits prescribed include proper diet
and physical and mental exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking an antioxidant pill to fend off cellular
damage from free radicals, researchers advocate eating fruits and
vegetables that are rich in antioxidants.
</P>
<P>
   Before you swallow any magic pill, or some mystic ``natural''
nosh that promises to deter aging, the quarterly warns you to enter
your health food store with extreme caution.
</P>
<P>
   The American propensity for fad diets and miracle health cures
brings a new anti-aging diet every decade. ``Only a single dietary
regime has ever been conclusively demonstrated to extend the life
span of laboratory animals, let alone humans,'' the quarterly
declares. ``It is known in the scientific lingo as `caloric
restriction' and less technically as `eating less than you might
normally prefer.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Major Killers section covers ``Coping With Alzheimer's,''
``Stopping Cancer Before it Starts'' and ``Saving Hearts That Grow
Old.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2030, one in five Americans will be a senior, the quarterly
projects in an article titled, ``From Baby Boom to Geezer Glut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What becomes of childhood, youth, middle age and old age, if
people routinely live to 150?'' the magazine's editors ask. The
possibility of extending the human life span has ``provoked
blistering polemics among ethicists, clergy and gerontologists.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoologist Steven N. Austad of the University of Idaho predicts,
``The first 150-year-old person is probably alive right now.'' Will
it be you? Do you want it to be?

THE WORLD ACCORDING TO TAMMY FAYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RON DICKER  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time has not eroded Tammy Faye's belief in her
ex-husband's innocence, or in the sanctity of mascara.
</P>
<P>
   But the 12 years since the collapse of the PTL ministry run by
Tammy Faye and Jim Bakker have given her new perspective on their
place in tabloid culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happened to us is bigger than O.J.,'' she said
during an interview at a Manhattan hotel. ``I think we were the
first of the rag-magazine television, the rag-magazine mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they realized how much people love it and will eat it up
and will buy papers and magazines and watch TV, I think (the media)
went after some others.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief, private interview, Tammy Faye blurted out answers
not always pertinent to the question, but with the same enthusiasm
she employed when the PTL was at its zenith in the 1980s. It
reached more than 20 million people via a 24-hour satellite
network.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Faye has been a publicist's dream in New York, bouncing
through a promotional blitz for ``The Eyes of Tammy Faye,'' a
kitschy documentary about her by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato.
</P>
<P>
   The film, narrated by drag queen RuPaul, reinforces Tammy Faye's
status as a camp goddess among gays. Tammy Faye likes to remind the
skeptical that the PTL embraced the gay community despite venomous
criticism from the religious right. She spent Thursday night at a
mostly gay bar in Manhattan's Chelsea district before taking in a
Broadway show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it's like to be hated by everybody,'' she said.
``I know what it's like to be misunderstood. I know what it's like
to be lied about and watched and criticized. And I know they
understand. I know where they're at, and that's why they love me.
I've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Her small blue eyes misted up behind eyelashes as thick as palm
fronds, thanks to a daily coating of L'Oreal mascara.
</P>
<P>
   Her ensemble was enough to make a discounter speak in tongues:
She bought her low-cut lavender sweater set from Marshall's, her
matching skirt from Ross Dress for Less, and silver pumps with
glass heels from Pic n' Save.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Faye wants to write a book about how to look like a
million for a lot less.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was a bargain-shopper even when she and Bakker were
raking in millions as the first couple of televangelism. Now her
coffers are filled by whatever an occasional congregation can give
as a ``love offering,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Faye recently preached to a women's group in New York and
the love amounted to $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Faye and Jim Bakker parlayed a Christian puppet show in
the 1960s into an evangelical juggernaut in the '70s and '80s.
Mixing Lawrence Welk wholesomeness with Vegas-lounge garishness,
the Bakkers reigned over fire-and-brimstone rivals such as the
Revs. Jerry Falwell and Oral Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the PTL crumbled beneath a wave of scandal. In 1989,
Jim Bakker was convicted of defrauding 116,000 followers out of
$158 million for not delivering on a promise that the PTL would
provide lodging at its theme park and complex to anyone who pledged
$1,000 or more. He served five years in prison. Tammy Faye
maintains that the PTL was in the process of fulfilling its pledges
when Falwell, as part of a conspiracy, swooped in to seize control
of the PTL.
</P>
<P>
   But the story's sizzle came from Bakker's tryst with a PTL
employee named Jessica Hahn, whom the organization reportedly had
paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep quiet. Hahn later
whittled out a career as a pinup and personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for Jessica,'' Tammy Faye said. ``She got herself
into something bigger than her. I don't blame Jessica for what
happened. I blame Jim. Jim is a man of God and a leader of a large
Christian organization. If it wasn't Jessica, it could have been
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if ``The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' takes a soft look at its
subject, there is no denying her resilience. A supermarket-tabloid
frenzy didn't get her _ she even invited the Globe to her second
wedding. Drug addiction didn't get her _ a visit to Betty Ford took
care of that. Colon cancer couldn't claim her either _ she's been
disease-free for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
   The imprisonment of her second husband, Roe Messner, on
bankruptcy fraud is now tucked neatly in the past, too. Messner was
serving as Tammy Faye's Guy Friday in New York, and the couple
lives in Charlotte, N.C., near Tammy Faye's daughter, Tammy Sue,
and two grandchildren. Tammy Faye's son, Jamie Bakker, runs a safe
house for the tattooed, pierced and disenfranchised in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation knows Tammy Faye as the mother of the
eye-shadow queen Mimi on ``The Drew Carey Show.'' But this being
the multimedia 21st century, Tammy Faye is striving to be more. She
is selling a bath-products line on tammyfaye.com. She serves as a
spokeswoman for a traveling flea market, and she is planning a
country album.
</P>
<P>
   But Tammy Faye scoffed at the notion that she yearns to make a
splash in the secular world.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is always with the ministry,'' she said. ``I have a
calling, I believe, from God to preach. I'm a good preacher. If I
can't live it, I don't preach it.''

FIRE BURNS WAREHOUSE CONTAINING MARIJUANA PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Firefighters battling a three-alarm fire at a
warehouse uncovered a large marijuana-growing operation that may
have started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found evidence of more than 1,000 young marijuana
plants at the warehouse in the city's Bayview section. The
operation appeared to be a hydroponic nursery, said Inspector
Martin Halloran of the San Francisco police.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an advanced, sophisticated system,'' Halloran said.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran said many of the marijuana plants were burned in the
fire. He would not elaborate on what equipment was recovered from
the site, but typically, hydroponic operations include tiered
planters, water pumps, ultraviolet lamps and fans.
</P>
<P>
   The operation had been going on for at least several months,
Halloran said. He said the tenants of the unit were being sought
for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials indicated that the source of the fire, which
erupted Saturday morning, was electrical equipment at the
warehouse. It was unknown if the equipment was connected to the
marijuana operation.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke was first reported coming from the building shortly before
10 a.m. Some 100 firefighters, investigators and paramedics
descended on the two-story commercial warehouse, part of a larger
warehouse district several blocks from the Candlestick Park
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in the fire, but it caused about $100,000
damage to the building. Halloran did not have an estimate on the
street value of the seized pot plants.
</P>
<P>
   Jin Lee, who owns an electrical contracting company next door,
said he had no idea of the marijuana nursery. Lee, who has operated
at that location for four years, said he was told earlier by an
employee at the warehouse that his company repaired refrigerators
and freezers. Lee said he had no reason to suspect otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really nice people,'' Lee said. ``We didn't have any
conversations, just `hi' and `bye.'''
</P>
<P>
   Halloran said marijuana growers tend to use warehouses because
they do not arouse much suspicion. He said he has seen marijuana
nurseries set up in garages, attics and lofts as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Bayview nursery was the largest marijuana operation he has
seen all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its appears to be a sophisticated operation, but I've seen
larger,'' he said.

IN INDIA'S SILICON VALLEY, WORKERS DREAM OF THE USA 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Note optional trim)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATTHEW YI  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGALORE, India _ It is a familiar scene here: A young software
engineer with dreams of a big salary and a recruiter representing
an American technology company sit across the table from each
other, talking about careers, opportunities and, most importantly,
money.
</P>
<P>
   Annual salaries of a few thousand dollars are respectable here
but a pittance when compared to the $50,000 or more American
companies are offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a very poor family, and I want to earn enough
money to support my mother, my three sisters and my brother,'' the
29-year-old man said after his interview. ``It's my life's
ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   His desire reflects that of many young Indians working in
Bangalore, India's version of Silicon Valley _ minus the big
paychecks. With a per-capita annual income of about $1,700 in
India, it is money that lures many young talents away from their
close-knit families and into the tech centers of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are more than happy to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of the high-tech industry over the past 20 years
led to a desperate scramble for skilled workers. American companies
turned to India, known for a good education system and highly
skilled, English-speaking workers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated 300,000 Indian high-tech workers employed
abroad, about 80 percent work in the United States, said Rafiq
Dossani, an economist from India who works at Stanford University's
International Studies, Asia Pacific Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   India's education system, which focuses on math and science, has
a mission to produce information technology, or IT, professionals
in great numbers. In Bangalore alone, colleges pump out 30,000
engineering graduates every year.
</P>
<P>
   Even with its latte shops, cyber cafes and
hip-by-India-standards reputation, though, Bangalore has a long way
to go to match the amenities of California living.
</P>
<P>
   There are hints of change: The technology industry has brought
new high-rise buildings to this south-central Indian city of 5.2
million people and cars to the growing middle-class, sure signs of
a boom.
</P>
<P>
   In many other ways, though, Bangalore, the capital of the state
of Karnataka, is like the rest of India, with roads shared by
automobiles, three-wheeled auto-rickshaws, cows and pedestrians.
Air pollution is so bad that a walk down the street leaves clothing
smelling like auto exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the old-fashioned American dream is pursued by IT
graduates in Bangalore and other tech-savvy cities here, making
India a magnet for high-tech recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple. They have an outstanding education system
there. You're able to get very, very highly qualified engineers and
programmers,'' said Vivek Ranadive, chief executive officer of
Tibco Software Inc. in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Ranadive himself made the journey, partly to escape the rigors
of India's education system.
</P>
<P>
   After a year at the India Institute of Technology in Bombay, he
transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1975
because the courses in India were too difficult. At MIT, he earned
a master's degree in electrical engineering and computer science
and a master's degree in business administration from Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get someone from . . . the India Institute of
Technology, you're getting the cream of the cream of the crop,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After years of producing skilled workers only to have foreign
companies pluck away many of the brightest, there is talk that
India's technology industry has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I do have concern of there being this heavy brain
drain in the past 10 years or so. If that talent had stayed, the
situation in India would be vastly different,'' said Yogesh Sharma,
editor of Siliconindia, an English-language business and technology
magazine for South Asians.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no sign that the brain drain will end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be happy to send them to the United States. We'll just
produce more people,'' said Vivek Kulkani, information technology
secretary of Karnataka state.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians go to America mainly through a visa program for
skilled workers called H1-B, which allows them to work in the
United States for six years. Immigration and Naturalization Service
officials estimate 40 percent of all such visas go to India each
year. Until 1998, the United States had an annual cap of 65,000
H1-Bs, but Congress increased the number to 115,000 for 1999 and
2000.
</P>
<P>
   In 2001, the number of H1-Bs is scheduled to drop to 107,500.
The cap is set to return to 65,000 in 2002, but industry groups
like the Information Technology Association of America are lobbying
Congress to expand the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every indication is that the demand will grow faster than the
supply side,'' said Harris Miller, president of Information
Technology Association of America in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Although the H1-B program enjoys high levels of support in
Congress, labor unions and many high-tech workers contend the
industry has used the visas to hold down wages and discriminate
against higher-paid American workers. Still others say that layoffs
at struggling dot-com companies should provide a new pool of
workers to meet domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
   Most workers go to the United States on temporary visas, leaving
Indian officials with the expectation they will return one day to
help fuel their own high-tech revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's an increasing trend of people going back to
India,'' Sharma said. ``There's also the liberalization of the
whole economy. There has been a slow elimination of (the
government's) licensing systems, and the old world socialist
economics are transforming into market economies.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend has encouraged more workers to return in recent years,
Dossani said.
</P>
<P>
   India's economic shift started in 1991, when the government
stopped requiring special licenses to start companies, Dossani
said.
</P>
<P>
   Banks were given freedom to approve more loans, and venture
capitalists were encouraged to invest more money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a major shift from the government-controlled economy, India's
telecommunications industry began encouraging technology
entrepreneurs in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although the majority of high-tech companies in India are owned
and operated by foreigners, locally owned businesses are on the
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Dewang Mehta, president of India's National Association of
Software and Service Companies in New Dehli, said the growth is
evidence that the brain drain is slowing.

</P>
<P>
   Bangalore has helped push India's software industry from $164
million in exports in 1991-1992 to $2.5 billion in 1998-1999. About
58 percent of the exports end up in the United States. Next in line
is Europe at 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government has played a key role in that growth. In
1991, it created a nonprofit agency that helps entrepreneurs and
foreign companies wanting to do business in India.
</P>
<P>
   Through the Software Technology Parks of India, or STPI, the
government provides a wide range of services including a
clearinghouse to start a new company and to promote products made
in India.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government also allows duty-free import of computer
hardware for companies that want to do business here. Upstart
companies do not have to pay corporate income tax for the first 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the south end of Bangalore, the STPI has developed its own
400-acre industrial park, Electronics City.
</P>
<P>
   The property is a mix of mounds of dirt and greenery dotted by
large concrete buildings that house a number of software companies.
</P>
<P>
   In these buildings, young software engineers await their call to
work in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to have a couple of years of experience here
before going to the USA, but their ultimate goal is to go to
America,'' said A. Jayaprakash, director of Zelos Technologies Pvt.
Ltd. in Madras, about 170 miles east of Bangalore. ``It's the call
of USA that they want to listen to.''

SURVEY SHOWS STRUGGLING DOT-COMS ARE SHEDDING WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Since December, 122 dot-com companies have
announced staff cuts leaving a total of 7,952 workers out of a job,
according to a survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And of the 122 dot-coms that announced job cuts, about 20
percent of them have shut their doors for good, according to the
survey released by the New York-based outplacement firm Challenger,
Gray &AMP; Christmas Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-com period of survival of the fittest could be
expected to escalate, and so it has,'' said John A. Challenger, the
chief executive of Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   One are that has been less affected by the job reductions is the
business-to-business field, known as B2B, or the direct exchange of
supplies and products between enterprises. ``As an early entry to
the Internet, B-to-B is proving to be better prepared to withstand
major changes in the marketplace than some of the newcomers,''
Challenger said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey divided the Internet industry into five major
sectors:
</P>
<P>
   _ Retail accounted for 24 percent, or 1,812, of the total job
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   _ The service sector trimmed 1,287 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Entertainment cut 948 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Internet portals shed 786 workers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The health and fitness sector furloughed 671 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 122 companies reporting job cuts were:
</P>
<P>
   _ BabyCenter.com, an e-commerce site based in San Francisco that
laid off 80 workers in February.
</P>
<P>
   _ Violet.com, a San Francisco boutique, let go all of its
workers (total unknown) before folding in April.
</P>
<P>
   _ San Francisco's HealthShop, a health food store, dismissed 60
workers before selling the company in April.
</P>
<P>
   _ ExciteAtHome, the Redwood City, Calif., portal, fired 15
people in April.
</P>
<P>
   _ Salon.com, the San Francisco Web magazine, layed off 19
people, or 9 percent of its staff, in June.
</P>
<P>
   _ eBay, the San Jose auction site, reduced its staff by 13
people in July.

SURVEY SHOWS STRUGGLING DOT-COMS ARE SHEDDING WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Since December, 122 dot-com companies have
announced staff cuts leaving a total of 7,952 workers out of a job,
according to a survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And of the 122 dot-coms that announced job cuts, about 20
percent of them have shut their doors for good, according to the
survey released by the New York-based outplacement firm Challenger,
Gray &AMP; Christmas Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-com period of survival of the fittest could be
expected to escalate, and so it has,'' said John A. Challenger, the
chief executive of Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   One are that has been less affected by the job reductions is the
business-to-business field, known as B2B, or the direct exchange of
supplies and products between enterprises. ``As an early entry to
the Internet, B-to-B is proving to be better prepared to withstand
major changes in the marketplace than some of the newcomers,''
Challenger said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey divided the Internet industry into five major
sectors:
</P>
<P>
   _ Retail accounted for 24 percent, or 1,812, of the total job
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   _ The service sector trimmed 1,287 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Entertainment cut 948 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Internet portals shed 786 workers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The health and fitness sector furloughed 671 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 122 companies reporting job cuts were:
</P>
<P>
   _ BabyCenter.com, an e-commerce site based in San Francisco that
laid off 80 workers in February.
</P>
<P>
   _ Violet.com, a San Francisco boutique, let go all of its
workers (total unknown) before folding in April.
</P>
<P>
   _ San Francisco's HealthShop, a health food store, dismissed 60
workers before selling the company in April.
</P>
<P>
   _ ExciteAtHome, the Redwood City, Calif., portal, fired 15
people in April.
</P>
<P>
   _ Salon.com, the San Francisco Web magazine, layed off 19
people, or 9 percent of its staff, in June.
</P>
<P>
   _ eBay, the San Jose auction site, reduced its staff by 13
people in July.

FEINSTEIN SWAMPS CAMPBELL IN CALIFORNIA'S U.S. SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Republican Rep. Tom Campbell of California has
gained no headway in his bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, according to a San Francisco Examiner-KTVU poll showing
that one third of state voters still don't recognize his name.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell campaign officials said they planned to unleash ads
this summer that will help the moderate congressman turn the
numbers around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not yet begun to fight,'' said Campbell senior
strategist Sean
</P>
<P>
   Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted by Del Ali of Research 2000 in Rockville,
Md., showed Feinstein with a formidable 57 percent to 34 percent
lead among those who had picked their choice for U.S. Senate if the
election were held today. The poll also showed that 26 percent of
Republicans said they preferred Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   The Silicon Valley congressman is ``the kind of Republican who
could win a statewide election, but I don't see a scenario where
Campbell could pull off an upset,'' said Ali, whose firm conducted
the poll July 17 through 19. It has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The questions were posed to 827 registered voters who vote
regularly in state elections. Republicans and Democrats were
divided equally.
</P>
<P>
   Add to Campbell's weak name recognition a bustling economy and
voter approval for Feinstein, and the congressman appears to face
even more of an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incumbents get too much credit when things go well and too
much blame when things go bad. It's a good election cycle to be an
incumbent,'' said Ali. ``It always starts with the economic times.
You've got a job, money in the bank, and people feel secure.
They're not going to rock the boat by throwing out the status
quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, he added, ``would almost have to go out and try to
lose the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was first elected to the Senate in 1992 to fulfill the
last two years of a six-year term. When she stood for re-election
in 1994, she narrowly beat back a challenge from Republican Michael
Huffington.
</P>
<P>
   This is Campbell's second stint in Congress. He served as a U.S.
representative between 1988 and 1992. He returned to Congress in a
special election in 1995 after a brief term in the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   He narrowly lost a bid for the U.S. Senate primary in 1992 to
ultra-conservative Bruce Herschenson, who in turn was defeated in
the general election by liberal Democrat Barbara Boxer _ a race
many observers believed Campbell would have won had he faced her.
</P>
<P>
   The last poll on the Feinstein-Campbell race was two weeks
before
</P>
<P>
   California's March primary, when Feinstein had 54 percent to
Campbell's 36
</P>
<P>
   percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's poll shows Feinstein doing slightly better than
Campbell among men _ 48 to 44 percent _ and far better _ 65 to 24
percent _ among women.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also shows the senator from San Francisco ahead in
every region of the state except for the Central Valley, where each
received 44 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was far ahead of Campbell among ethnic groups and
Caucasians alike.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell is a pro-abortion rights Republican who sells himself
as fiscally conservative but socially more liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein scored a 57 percent favorable rating, compared to a 23
percent rating for Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of the School of Politics
and Economics at Claremont Graduate University said Feinstein
probably earned points among Democrats and Republicans alike by
coming out early in her criticisms of President Clinton's affair
with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed her independence and values and toughness. Voters
appreciate that even if the people who work with her do not,'' said
Jeffe. ``She doesn't toe an ideological partisan line and that's
where voters are these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said the Campbell campaign was gearing up for an
aggressive race, and
</P>
<P>
   planned to start defining the soft-spoken congressman long
before Labor Day, the unofficial kickoff day for the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said Campbell has been called ``the smartest man in
Congress'' by Roll Call magazine. But he acknowledged: ``We have to
raise his name ID and profile.''

FEW ON MAIN STREET PAY ATTENTION TO THE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GETTYSBURG, Pa. _ At the Lincoln Diner, where a portrait of the
16th presi-dent hangs by the road and patrons can practically touch
the passing freight trains, it has been scores of days since
anybody paid much attention to this year's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard anybody talking about it,'' said the diner's
owner, Bob Arahovas.
</P>
<P>
   The same story is told across the nation, from the salons of
Washington to the hinterlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary and it's astounding and it's frightening,'' said
Representative Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, who is heading the
Democratic effort to retake the US House and who spoke about the
national lack of interest during a recent visit to Indiana.
``People just don't pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at a recent Washington dinner party, with columnists,
lawyers, and political junkies in attendance, the hosts could not
steer the conversation to the presidential campaign until dessert
was served. ``Toward the end of the dinner, we found we weren't
talking about the campaign,'' said one of the guests, Marvin Kalb.
``It struck me as odd. Everybody is waiting for something to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But finally, after nearly six months of what seems a national
political slumber, something is about to happen: George W. Bush and
Al Gore are about to choose the vice presidential nominees. The
national conventions are coming up.
</P>
<P>
   The only question is whether America will pay much attention,
even now. And the candidates and campaigns, struggling to get their
message heard, have honed in on a very basic goal: getting voters
to listen, read, and watch what they are doing.
</P>
<P>
   So far, attention is clearly lacking. A survey conducted by
Harvard University's aptly named ``Vanishing Voter'' project, found
this month that only 12 percent of Americans are paying close
attention to the race. Kalb, a former journalist who is executive
director of the project, said the lack of interest is predictable.
With little real news in the campaign since Bush and Gore locked up
the nominations in early March, there has been only moderate media
coverage and little drama to interest voters.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is expected to announce his vice presidential choice, a
step bound to draw attention. And even if modern conventions don't
decide much of anything with the nominee a foregone conclusion and
the platform of secondary concern, they remain an occasion for
voters to begin checking in.
</P>
<P>
   If the voters interviewed at the Lincoln Diner are
representative, and those who stop here include people from all
over the country visiting the battle site, Americans are looking
for something, almost anything, to help tune in and decide whom to
support.
</P>
<P>
   At one booth in the Lincoln Diner, Bill and Karen Glass,
tourists from Boca Raton, Fla., said they were undecided and would
be closely watching the vice presidential selections. ``I think
both Bush and Gore are extreme, and I want to see who picks a
moderate,'' Bill Glass said. ``I'd vote for Bush if he picks
Elizabeth Dole,'' said his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The Glass family, and tens of millions of other undecided
voters, are at the heart of this new phase of the campaign. Both
the Republican and Democratic parties realize America tuned out
shortly after the early and decisive round of primaries, and many
of these voters are now up for grabs. In perhaps the most
significant political shift since February, Gore in recent days has
begun to erase Bush's lead in the polls, and some analysts said the
race may wind up one of the tightest in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do get the sense that more people are starting to pay
attention as we draw closer to the conventions,'' Gore spokesman
Doug Hattaway said. ``That may explain some of the recent
tightening of the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the two major parties are preparing to inundate the nation's
households with campaign information, spending tens of millions of
dollars in an effort to awaken Americans from their political
slumber.
</P>
<P>
   Voter apathy is attributable to three factors, according to
Kalb: diminished faith and confidence in government, the end of the
Cold War, and continuing prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the compressed primary schedule created a bubble of
interest early this year, spurred mostly by the insurgent candidacy
of Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican. But the bubble
burst when the nominations were quickly settled, leaving a huge gap
until Election Day in November. That's a span of time equivalent to
an entire baseball season, including spring training and the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Having no alternative, the presidential campaigns of Bush and
Gore, as well as the less-publicized efforts of Reform Party
candidate Patrick J. Buchanan and Green Party nominee Ralph Nader,
are treating public apathy as an opportunity. Bush and Gore have
launched major advertising efforts and are organizing nationwide
tours aimed at drumming up attention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush plans to take a bus tour starting Friday through Arkansas,
Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, and West Virginia before arriving Aug. 2
at the GOP convention in Philadelphia. After the convention, Bush
plans another publicity extravaganza with a whistle-stop train tour
of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, embarked last week on a string of televised
hourlong town meetings across the country. Gore hopes to heighten
interest by taking boat trips on the Great Lakes and the
Mississippi River after the Democratic convention Aug. 14-17 in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A close race could make all the difference. ``This is an
electorate that has the potential to catch fire,'' said Andrew
Kohut, executive director of the Pew Research Center for People and
the Press, which tracks voter views.
</P>
<P>
   But if voters perceive that the race is all but decided before
Election Day and believe their vote means little, turnout could hit
an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   Though voter interest will pick up during the conventions and
vice presidential selection, the bad news for the campaigns is that
it will probably ebb in September during the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest spike in interest is likely to come during the three
presidential debates, which are scheduled for Boston on Oct. 5,
North Carolina on Oct. 11, and in Missouri on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest interest will probably come in the first debate,
which will be the first chance that most Americans have for a
side-by-side comparison of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had time to pay attention,'' said Diane DiDomenico,
a New Jersey visitor to the Lincoln Diner. She plans to start
paying attention soon, but adds: ``I'll make up my mind at the last
minute.''

SOME DEMOCRATS CONCERNED NADER COULD TIP THE ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Time was when Republicans shuddered at the thought
of Reform Party candidate Patrick J. Buchanan undercutting the
political support of George W. Bush in this fall's presidential
race, indirectly handing a victory to Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Democrats have also been focusing on a different third-party
candidacy, the Green Party's Ralph Nader, highlighting the stakes
for both sides this election.
</P>
<P>
   The small but geographically diverse political support for Nader
_ up to 9 percentage points in one poll in California, a key state
for the vice president _ has some liberals wondering whether the
longtime consumer advocate will sap strength from their traditional
ally, the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Their fear is that Nader's candidacy could take away enough
votes from Gore to elect Bush, the Republican governor of Texas,
bringing a conservative philosophy to the White House. They believe
that would threaten not only the environmental and trade policies
Nader is espousing on the stump, but also other liberal causes such
as abortion rights, civil rights, gay rights, and shaping the
ideological tilt of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, an
openly gay member of Congress, has taken to sounding the alarm in
op-ed comments and recent speeches. That triggered a rebuke from
Nader, who last week said: ``Sometimes he talks faster than his
brain operates.''
</P>
<P>
   Others understand Frank's concern, even if they do not currently
share his sense of urgency about the consumer activist. Among them
is Alice Germond, executive vice president of the National Abortion
and Reproductive Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is troublesome about Nader from our perspective is that
he is suggesting Gore and Bush are similar and that's why people
should vote for him,'' Germond said. ``On the issue of choice, . .
. the two are 180 degrees apart.''
</P>
<P>
   She notes that Gore favors abortion rights, while Bush opposes
abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of a
baby's mother is threatened. Bush has also said the Supreme Court's
1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion ``overstepped the
constitutional bounds,'' while Gore has said he supports the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that sometimes this simplistic rhetoric can take hold
if people aren't paying attention to the issues, so I am always
worried when somebody who is running for the highest office in the
nation is making statements that aren't true and then expects
himself to be taken seriously, as Ralph Nader does,'' Germond said.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Isaacs, executive director of Americans for Democratic
Action, a liberal organization, said she is ``concerned, yes,
panicked, no,'' that Nader may influence the outcome of a Bush-Gore
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Her major worry is how the next president will shape the balance
of the Supreme Court, since as many as four justices could retire
during his term.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything else, that has the potential for resonating
for generations,'' Isaacs said. ``Other policy can be turned around
sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs said she takes solace in political history, which shows
that third-party candidates often flower when they are a novelty
but wilt under sustained scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that most of those who are taking a look at Mr. Nader
are going to say this election is too important for feel-good or
protest politics, and that's the reason I'm not panicked,'' she
said. ``I think that ultimately what I view as common sense will
prevail, and these people will end up voting for Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, 66, a native of Winsted, Conn., burst onto the public
scene in 1965 with his book indicting General Motors' safety
record, ``Unsafe at any Speed.'' He has gone on to found an array
of public interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Today he says he wants to eliminate the ``democracy gap'' and
make it easier for outsiders to challenge the two-party system. He
supports free trade, strong unions, and universal health care. He
also has said he would raise gas taxes and replace Alan Greenspan
as Federal Reserve chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Frank recently warned about the impact of Nader's candidacy on
liberal causes during a speech before Americans for Democratic
Action. He also complained about Nader during a keynote address at
the Democratic state convention in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he did so again on the op-ed page of the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nader argument is based on the assumption that there is no
important difference between Al Gore and George Bush that justifies
a vote for Gore,'' the congressman told columnist Thomas Oliphant.
``Well, we know for an absolute fact that Gore and Bush differ
completely on abortion rights, on gay rights, on controlling gun
violence, to pick just three examples. . . . He has never spoken
out on these matters.''
</P>
<P>
   That prompted a response from Nader during a speech last Tuesday
at the National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging his roots as a consumer and environmental
activist, Nader told his audience: ``I've been an advocate for
civil liberties when he was trying to figure out how to play soccer
in elementary school, and I don't need to be lectured by him about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   During an interview, Frank laughed at the criticism, saying,
``Ralph has never been really in touch with American culture; they
did not play soccer in Bayonne, N.J., when I was growing up. There
was a lot more stickball, as I recall.''
</P>
<P>
   Substantively, he said that Nader is ``trying to appeal to the
left, but it's hard to appeal to the left while ignoring these
other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Frank said Nader's true goal is to defeat Gore. ``If
you accomplish that, you get the Supreme Court moving in a
conservative direction,'' Frank said. ``Clinton has also vetoed
antiabortion legislation, pushed for gun legislation. Those things
would go away if Bush is elected president.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, in an interview last week, said, ``If you look at it from
Barney's viewpoint, he should welcome as much progressive effort as
possible to sharpen and hone these issues on behalf of the
Democratic Party. The Democrats are taking these constituencies for
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Then turning more blunt, Nader said: ``I think Barney is being
used as a surrogate for those too cowardly to debate me.''
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Stachelberg, political director for the Human Rights
Campaign, a leading gay and lesbian group, said she expects the gay
community to support the vice president, no matter what the polls
say about Nader right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's early and polls are fluctuating day to day, but I
think the gay and lesbian community is savvy enough to want results
and see results and that's what, I think, Al Gore has delivered,''
she said.

HIS SLEAZE IS HER GUILTY `RHAPSODY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I didn't mean to spend the weekend with ``American Rhapsody,''
much less write anything about it, but here I am, still aglow with
guilty pleasure even though I finished reading the thing hours ago,
at 6:20 a.m., to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   Guilty pleasure is the very best kind. It's been many years
since reading a book made me feel so thrillingly ashamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Rhapsody'' brought me back to preadolescence,
sneaking my mother's copy of ``Peyton Place,'' looking for the
dirty parts. Back then, I was far from certain exactly which were
the dirty parts. It didn't matter. The guilty pleasure came from
knowing I was doing something nasty and that if my mother found
out, she'd whale the stuffing out of me.
</P>
<P>
   Why, at my age, should I feel guilty about reading Joe
Eszterhas's overwrought, overhyped, semifactual, quasifictional
account of our president's lifelong love affair with his willful,
wayward willard? True, the book is one long, dirty part. No
question where the sleaze begins, or where it ends, because it's
pure dirt, start to finish. But that's not why I felt guilty. I've
seen my share of sleaze, including some of the movies Eszterhas has
written (``Basic Instinct,'' ``Showgirls''). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the guilt was triggered by a small internal voice (the
introjected mother?) that, on the rare occasions I put the book
down, kept asking me if I should be doing something more
constructive with my time, reading Proust or helping someone in
need or laboring on behalf of the presidential candidate of my
choice, although there is no choice, really.
</P>
<P>
   The small voice asked: ``Why are you reading this trash?''
</P>
<P>
   And I replied: ``Because it is trash, and it's fun. Why are you
trying to make me feel guilty?''
</P>
<P>
   Only a man who has ingested as many drugs as Eszterhas claims he
has could have written this book. I have tried to imagine the
pitch: ``It's `Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' crossed with `The
Starr Report' crossed with `Hollywood Babylon.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Eszterhas, a former writer for Rolling Stone, thinks he
intuitively understands ``the first rock 'n' roll president.''
They're of an age _ they shared a passion for sex and drugs and
rock music. As we've come to know, in Clinton's case the main
passion was, and doubtless is, sex. With Eszterhas it was drugs,
although he was no slouch in the sex department, as he reports in
prurient, yet rueful, detail. Now, though, he's a born-again
monogamist, capable of writing about the president, ``He was using
women's bodies still the way he and we had callously and selfishly
used one another's bodies in the sixties.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``American Rhapsody'' Eszterhas's monumental ego gets aired
almost as often as the presidential penis. The book's title is the
author's homage to himself. One definition of rhapsody is ``exalted
or excessively enthusiastic expression of feeling in speech or
writing.'' Eszterhas's rhapsody is far from exalted but it is
enthusiastic, especially when he's dishing dirt, and when isn't he?
</P>
<P>
   Where did he come up with some of this stuff? Ron and Nancy
Reagan toking up with Alfred and Betsy Bloomingdale? Bob Dylan and
Elizabeth Taylor together? Say it ain't so, Joe. But maybe it is.
As we've seen, so many things that beggar belief have proven true,
and Eszterhas seems to know them all.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there's nothing more satisfying than wallowing in
garbage, and ``American Rhapsody'' is about as good as garbage
gets. Others more qualified than I will judge its literary merits
or lack of it, and maybe even its political and social
implications, if any. All I want to say is that as trash,
``American Rhapsody'' gets four stars and two thumbs up from me.

AIMEE BENDER'S NEW NOVEL HAS ALLURING CHARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
AN INVISIBLE SIGN OF MY OWN 
By Aimee Bender. Doubleday. 246 pp. $22.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gorgeous allure held out by the world of mathematics is not
part of a universe that just anyone can love. It strikes fear in
some hearts, boredom in others, and perhaps only a curious regard
in those of us who take emotional succor from, say, the binomial
theorem. But what most mathophobes don't realize is that math can
organize the cosmos into a bearable place of grace _ where one is
one, three is prime, and zero is an outlaw who changes everything.
</P>
<P>
   As a numerophile, I was enchanted from the start by Aimee
Bender's sui generis novel, but the quirky charms of ``An Invisible
Sign of My Own'' may convince even the most math-reluctant of
readers. With one collection of stories (``The Girl in the
Flammable Skirt'') behind her, Bender has achieved a kind of
underground regard for her warped universe and fiercely exact
prose. Her first novel should widen that appreciation, for she has
taken an achingly idiosyncratic story and rendered it with
eloquence, hilarity, and ominous precision.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my twentieth birthday, I bought myself an ax.'' Who can
resist a first chapter that begins this way, poised somewhere
between the laconic punch of James M. Cain and the dark humor of S.
J. Perelman? The ax-wielding narrator is Mona Gray, a second-grade
math teacher whose view of the universe is cluttered neither by
sentimentality nor excess. A girl who understood early on that
``there's an equation for the way the wind shifts or an axiom for
the movement of water,'' she has spent her adolescence renouncing
her passions: running, dessert, piano, sex. Anything that presents
itself as wonderful to Mona, she cauterizes from experience. ``To
quit well requires an intuitive sense of beauty,'' she announces
with alacrity. ``You have to feel the moment of turn, right when
desire makes an appearance, here is the instant to be severed,
whack . . ..''
</P>
<P>
   Well, this is immensely sad and funny at once, which is no small
challenge, and it's little wonder our screwball ascetic proves as
charming to her 7-year-olds as she is to us. Recruited at the last
minute to replace a teacher who fled to Paraguay to become a
revolutionary, Mona finds herself facing the most demanding
audience of all: children too young to fake being interested.
Daunted by their honesty, she has them body-bend into eights and
pluses and threes. She institutes a game called Numbers and
Materials, where they search the natural world for perfectly drawn
digits. Their classroom is a microcosm of the greater, scarier
world beyond: where nice teachers can disappear, friends can fail
you, or mothers can die of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The truth of it is that ``An Invisible Sign of My Own'' is full
of suffering and odd menace from its opening pages, but it delivers
the grim reality of its subject with such hard-bitten elegance that
you hardly notice where you are until it's too late. Mona's fine
art of quitting was developed when she was 10, the year her
physician father got sick _ an illness never named but bearing all
the qualities of clinical depression. Deserted on the path of
normal by a father (he, too, a former track star) who refused to
walk it anymore, Mona proves her loyalty by creating her own
version of anhedonia: If the peach tastes good, she will throw it
away; if the turf under her feet makes her feel as though she can
fly, she will stop short. Her excursion into the world of sexual
passion ends when she makes herself sick; having experienced
pleasure, she must cancel it out with an equivalent amount of pain.
</P>
<P>
   We would call much of Mona's behavior _ knocking rituals,
counting, self-abnegation _ obsessive-compulsive disorder, but no
such diagnoses appear in her story, which has the self-contained
and timeless quality of fable. The town has no name; its residents,
with their insular rules and reasons, seem like a citizenry out of
a fairy tale. And delivering this novel as Bender does, from the
inside out, enables her to create an oddly perfect, upside-down
universe _ where bedtime stories feel as real and likely as the
noonday sun, where town eccentrics seem wiser and more trustworthy
than anyone else. Fear is all over the place in ``An Invisible Sign
of My Own''; so, too, are death, illness, spiritual poverty, and
the misfires of a child's efforts to grow up. But all these themes
are effortlessly blended into a tale of addition games and
bittersweet desires, delivered in finely understated dialogue and
prose. The novel is so true to its own internal laws, so stripped
of unnecessary ornament, that I started a little when the word
``quietly'' appeared _ that adverb, so incongruous among a forest
of nouns and verbs, stuck out like a neon sign on an oak tree.
</P>
<P>
   Mona Gray would appreciate the distinction; she is not someone
who messes around with superfluity. Instead she keeps things clean
and starkly metaphorical: 51 is the smallest number ``with no magic
inside of it''; the ax is a perfect 7; elevator doors are
courteous, as they ``accommodate last-minute decisions.'' The world
is less frightening when perceived as an orderly place _ and, given
that messy humans live within it, that's a dream that cannot last.
When Mona's system is disrupted by someone who understands it, a
science teacher who is equally eccentric but less afraid, she has
to choose between right answers and the larger, less rigorous world
of maybes.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Invisible Sign of My Own'' is a charming novel, but I don't
mean that in a diminutive way. It's charming the way a sorcerer's
incantations can charm: full of power and whimsy and other-worldly
flight. Armed with mathematical clarity, Mona is on to her own
power: ``All you really need to do is write 100,000 _ 56,899 on the
board,'' she tells us, ``and people will flee in droves, horrified
by the sight of all those zeroes in the minuend.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the minuend, of course, that makes that sentence so precise
and captivating. Depicting a world that might as well be called
``The Joys and Sorrows of Numbers,'' Aimee Bender has reduced this
novel to pure elixir, and the result is something even Mona Gray,
with all her pain-pleasure stoplights, would have trouble
resisting: beguiling and chilling at once.

SUMMER MOVIES ARE TALKING ABOUT RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not as if there's nothing to be said about race in America
in the year 2000. And it's not as if movies aren't saying it, one
way or another. As usual, the divergence between what movies think
they're saying and what they're really saying is instructive.
What's surprising is that ``Shaft'' covers a few more bases than an
update of black cool in the person of Samuel L. Jackson, that the
Farrelly brothers should weigh in with the summer's most trenchant
slant on the subject of race in ``Me, Myself and Irene,'' that
Keenen Ivory Wayans should yank the gross-out market away from the
Farrellys, partly by playing a few race cards in ``Scary Movie,''
and that a documentary called ``American Pimp'' should actually
have found its way to a screen or two in a season traditionally
given to eye candy and costly noise.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly because he has loved the original 1971 ``Shaft'' since
boyhood, John Singleton knew he couldn't remake that blaxploitation
classic, but would have to reinvent it in terms of what's gone down
in the intervening years. A lot has gone down, and not enough has
gone down. Back then, the racial divide was more pronounced. Now
it's more of a shared quagmire, crystallized by the new film's
image of two cops and partners in corruption, one black, the other
white. Richard Roundtree's original Shaft stood outside the white
world. He had to in order to operate in Harlem the way he did.
Roundtree has said in interviews that director Gordon Parks told
him that it was essential that Shaft should occupy his space as if
he owned it. It was a novel idea in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   It's less novel now. Nobody had to tell Jackson to carry himself
as if he were in charge. The new Shaft is a New York City cop,
though the movie quickly makes it apparent that he isn't going to
bring Christian Bale's rich white psychopath to justice by working
within the system. So he drops out for a while, into a Harlem whose
turf is partly controlled by a Dominican drug dealer (played by
Jeffrey Wright, in a performance that would steal the movie away
from anyone less commanding than Jackson). The new film works for a
few reasons, not the least of which is that it's driven by a smart,
gritty script (by Richard Price, Singleton, and Shane Salerno, with
contributions from Jackson). In it, character counts for more than
car chases.
</P>
<P>
   It's also less stylized, more gnarly, more realistic than the
original, with more street feel. Roundtree's Shaft was more
flamboyant. Jackson's Shaft, although as boldly contoured, also has
more shadings. There's been a lot of water under the bridge since
1971 _ and a lot of realistically textured TV cop shows. The new
film builds on them, and owes as much of its street feel to, say,
``NYPD Blue'' and ``Homicide'' as to the original ``Shaft.'' But
one of the smart things Singleton has done is to bond with the
original. He brings Roundtree back as the new Shaft's private-eye
uncle. And if you scan the tables in the Lenox Lounge scene, you
can spot Parks at one of them, repeating the cameo he contributed
to his original film. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A different target &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet the biggest difference, and perhaps the film's ultimate
statement about the difference between 1971 and 2000, is the target
audience for each film. The original ``Shaft'' was targeted at
black audiences. The new ``Shaft'' clearly was conceived as a
crossover proposition _ and is, to judge by its box-office take.
Part of what made Shaft Shaft the first time around was those fly
clothes he wore with such authority. They wouldn't fly in 2000 any
more than a classic Afro would. Fashions change. What's interesting
is what they've changed to _ with Jackson's say-so, if not his
insistence. Namely, Armani _ the working uniform of choice for
Hollywood executives under 40, and quite a few over 40.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, a black man seeking justice has it no easier now
than then. But as the last century has taught us, there's a certain
potency and a measure of cultural validation in a big Hollywood
image. African-Americans, whose status was crystallized by Ralph
Ellison when he called his 1952 novel ``Invisible Man,'' have long
been aware that visibility is a building block of respect. That
Jackson, Denzel Washington, Laurence Fishburne, Wesley Snipes, and
other African-American actors now are impressively in command of
their own images is progress. The original ``Shaft'' cannot be
underestimated as a catalyst in black pride. The new ``Shaft'' _
grimmer, more efficient, more clear-eyed about the new shapes of
racism, but no less unequivocal in its determination to portray a
black man fighting the right kind of fight _ continues what the
first ``Shaft'' started. Shaft is still a man of the streets, but
he has come in from the margins.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, who'd have expected those erstwhile gross-out kings,
the Farrelly brothers, to laser in on the source of a lot of our
racial muddle in ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene.'' Their new Jim Carrey
comedy isn't quite as envelope-pushing as we hoped it would be,
but, taking a cue from Ellison, they really tee off on the
inability of whites to see blacks. The liveliest element of ``Me,
Myself &AMP; Irene'' stems from white denial, white inability to see
blacks in terms other than stereotypical. In the film, Carrey's
run-in with the driver of his wedding limo says that although the
latter may be a Boston Mensa Society chapter chairman, with a
stratospheric IQ, we can handle his presence only if he's served up
in the subservient role of a uniformed chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey's sweet-natured dimwit character ends up bruised by the
encounter. After the guy runs off with the wife of the state
trooper played by Carrey, but not before fathering triplets that
Carrey raises as a single dad, we're forced to ask ourselves if the
trooper's subsequent color-blindness is the result of
large-heartedness or obliviousness. The triplets, grown to high
school age (played by Anthony Anderson, Mongo Brownlee, and Jerod
Mixon), steal the movie. Like their biological father, they're
geniuses. Like their adoptive father, they're loving. What gives
them their comic edge is their way of reminding us that we can
handle young black geniuses only if they're served up as street
rappers. There's no word on a new Carrey-Farrelly brothers
collaboration. ``Irene'' isn't doing as well as expected at the box
office. But those triplets will be back, having earned a film of
their own, reminding us of our limited capacity to perceive
African-American ability. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Teen-scream sendup &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The summer's gross-out champ isn't ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene.'' It's
``Scary Movie,'' a comic concoction by Keenen Ivory Wayans, who
directed, and his brothers Marlon and Shawn, who wrote the film and
appear in it. It's a crude but sometimes very funny parody of
teen-scream movies that had begun to parody themselves. Like
Carrey, Wayans was a mainstay of ``In Living Color.'' The fast and
furious envelope-pushing humor of that trail-blazing series
surfaces here. Good thing, because the movie is frankly pretty
rickety. But some of the takeoffs are hilarious. The opening one,
for instance, in which Carmen Electra goofs on the Drew Barrymore
victim sequence from ``Scream,'' but also Cheri Oteri's turn as an
opportunistic TV reporter, shamelessly raking in material so she
can get rich from the pileup of student corpses.
</P>
<P>
   But as with ``In Living Color,'' a good part of the humor plays
the race card in ways that only black humorists could employ in a
day when the knives of political correctness are out. Marlon plays
the shrimpy horror-movie buff and resident pothead. Shawn plays the
buff athlete who likes men and becomes the focus of the film's most
outrageous sight gag, involving a misadventure with a piece of male
anatomy in a restroom stall. Time and again the Wayans brothers
help themselves to dollops of over-the-topness that few white
writers would feel comfortable running by a studio exec. Although
``Scary Movie'' is hit and miss, the hits will encourage you to
overlook a lot of the misses, especially when they up the racial
ante, as they do in a great sight gag that's almost too true to be
funny when cops overreact to the radio call ``White woman in
trouble!''
</P>
<P>
   Given the bull's-eyes scored by Hollywood studio entertainments,
you'd expect the Hughes brothers' documentary, ``American Pimp,''
to be dynamite. But all you can do is sit through it _ as Allen and
Albert Hughes allow the fast-talking pimps to charm and seduce them
out of asking any really tough questions _ and think about the film
that might have been. To hear the pimps tell it, they and the women
they exploit are one big happy family, with never so much as a bad
hair day. You wish that, instead of simply presenting at face value
what every instinct tells you is a lie, the Hugheses had dug in and
done some real investigation. All the pimps are black except one.
The sole white subject operates in Nevada, where prostitution is
legal and there are no police obstacles to his prosperity. The
clear implication is that there is an unspoken complicity involving
the mostly black pimps, the powerless women who work for them, and
the mostly white establishment that allows prostitution to exist in
the shadows for the convenience of a mostly white clientele. But
the Hugheses leave this avenue of inquiry untraveled. Sounds like a
job for Shaft.

   BUSH-CHENEY-OIL (Washington) _ If Texas Gov. George W. Bush
selects Richard Cheney as his running mate, the Republicans might
face criticism that they are offering America ``the Big Oil''
ticket. Democrats could revive questions about Bush's ties to
Harken Energy when it won an exclusive offshore oil-drilling
contract with Bahrain in 1990 and about Cheney's leadership at
Halliburton Co., a Dallas-based oil and gas drilling and supply
firm. By STEWART M. POWELL.

   RICHARD-CHENEY (Washington) _ Since leaving office in 1993 as
President Bush's secretary of defense, Richard Cheney has earned
millions of dollars in private industry. Cheney, whom George W.
Bush is considering as his running mate, received $1.2 million last
year as chief executive officer of the Halliburton Co. In 1998 the
oil firm paid him a salary of $1.18 million and a bonus of $1.15
million. By ERIC ROSENBERG.

   FBI-INTERNET (Washington) _ Congressional Republicans question
FBI officials on their new program to police the Internet. The
e-mail-sniffing system, known as ``Carnivore,'' allows agents to
sift a suspect's messages out of the full stream of data passing
through an Internet service provider (ISP), like America Online.
Once installed, Carnivore has the ability to monitor all of the
e-mail on a network. Critics say the FBI could use the program to

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ Despite all the pledges about
government cost-cutting and returning federal funds to the
taxpayers, members of Congress are graciously willing to make one
exception to their stingy mood: themselves. The House quietly gave
itself a $3,800 pay raise last week. In the past such
self-aggrandizement has prompted a public outcry, but now lawmakers
think the voters are so contented they won't mind. Have times
really changed that much? By MARIANNE MEANS.

FRAMING THE PHOTOS HELPS ADVANCE THE MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNETONKA, Minn. _ Surrounded by schoolchildren, Vice President
Al Gore walked onto the field at Hopkins North Junior High School
and watched students launch rockets into the blue sky.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, Governor Jesse Ventura, and the children all shaded their
eyes from the sun and pointed excitedly at the homemade rockets as
they blasted off and then gently floated back to earth with their
miniature parachutes trailing behind.
</P>
<P>
   For the vice president, it was a picture-perfect setting. Photos
of the scene appeared in newspapers across the country the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore and Governor George W. Bush of Texas compete for the
presidency, they are waging a daily battle to get their message
across in pictures and to portray themselves as caring and
concerned by surrounding themselves with children, the elderly,
women, and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the voters aren't paying attention, the likelihood that
the visual images are the only thing getting through is pretty
high,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School
of Communications at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both campaigns say they realize that most voters
don't read long newspaper or magazine articles about their
proposals or ideas, and that most don't care much about the
presidential race so far in advance of Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot more people, frankly, look at the pictures than read the
stories,'' said Thomas D. Rath, an adviser to the Bush campaign.
``You can make some of these points exactly that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials also say that for all the speeches, press
releases, and news conferences they give, reporters usually write
or say what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no control over what's written in the stories, so we
have to try to tell the story ourselves,'' said Matt Bennett, a
senior White House official who spent two years overseeing many of
these details as Gore's trip director.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the images add up, creating a perception about the
candidates in voters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush went to Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., to propose changes
for Social Security, he was framed by a mock blue-and-white Social
Security card hanging on the wall behind him with the words
``Saving Social Security.'' Old people and young adults sat near
him as he made his pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to capture in one click a 20-minute speech,'' said
Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman. ``If a photographer takes one
picture, the picture should summarize the governor's message.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, photographs of politicians have captured a
moment that comes to symbolize the way they are perceived. When
Governor Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts was photographed in
1988 wearing a helmet in a tank, he was ridiculed, and the image
became a symbol of an off-kilter campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
   When President Jimmy Carter could not finish a race he was
running, photographers caught him looking bent over and dehydrated
as two Secret Service agents helped him away. The image came to
represent a struggling presidency.
</P>
<P>
   And when President Gerald R. Ford stumbled down the steps of Air
Force One, both he and his administration were viewed as klutzy,
despite Ford's background as an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the candidates for president are trying to prevent
unflattering images from taking hold and they hope to undo some
ideas that already exist.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the children come in. For Gore, children make him
seem more human and less stiff. For Bush, they underscore the
compassion he said he feels as a conservative, rather than the
remote, blue-suit feel of previous Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make Bush look more inclusive and more tolerant, which is
probably the two most important messages he can convey,'' said
Darrel M. West, a political science professor at Brown University.
``He needs to reassure suburban voters that he's an open, tolerant
individual, and people like soccer moms may not agree with all of
his policy positions, but they want to make sure he's not an
extremist.''
</P>
<P>
   Rath said it is not by accident that Bush has been photographed
in urban areas and in schools, with African-Americans and Latinos,
children and senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond what he has said, how he has been seen and the settings
in which he has been seen carries the message that this is a very
different kind of campaign,'' Rath said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore campaign officials said Bush's policies and beliefs
contradict the message he is trying to convey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pictures cannot hide flaws in your record,'' said Mark
Fabiani, Gore's deputy campaign manager. ``No matter how many women
and children you surround yourself with, if your record on the
environment, or education or health care is not sufficient, it will
catch up with you. Eventually, people will see the photos as
phony.''
</P>
<P>
   A sizable portion of each campaign is devoted to making sure the
candidate looks good in pictures. There are the advance people who
set up the events and the message people who craft the slogans that
grace the posters hanging in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Advance professionals across the political spectrum have certain
tricks they employ. One, pioneered by the Clinton White House and
copied by the Bush campaign, is to use a repeating message in small
letters on a poster behind the candidate. That also reduces the
likelihood of another problem known as ``bannerhead,'' when a giant
letter looks like it's sticking out of the candidate's head.
</P>
<P>
   When larger lettering is used, it almost always includes a
gerund in the slogan to give a sense of movement or action. For
example, Bush is ``Saving Social Security'' while Gore is
``Improving Our Schools'' and ``Strengthening Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign staff members also say they try to minimize
nose-pickers, yawners, and people standing behind the candidate
looking bored. To do that, candidates almost always stand a few
feet in front of the people positioned behind them. The result is
that photographers and television cameras show the candidate in
sharp focus, with everyone else in slightly blurry relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to think like a producer or a cameraman,'' Bennett
said. ``You look through your imaginary camera and think, `What's
going to appear on people's screens?' ''

DNA CHALLENGES FAMILY LAW PRINCIPLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ DNA testing, which is transforming criminal
prosecutions and death penalty appeals, is also reshaping reality
in family courts, as the scientific procedure is increasingly used
to determine paternity and to challenge child support orders.
</P>
<P>
   Activists for fathers' rights applaud the testing trend. They
said it will help alleviate an institutional bias in the US legal
system in favor of women, whose word about paternity is usually
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Child-welfare advocates, however, have voiced alarm at the
prospect that even more American families will find themselves
struggling without a father's support. And they fear that children
will be forced, sometimes years into life, to suffer with the news
that the man they called Dad is not that man.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that increased public awareness of the DNA
option has led to a surge in such tests.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Blood Banks, an accrediting
organization, estimates that 250,000 paternity screenings were
conducted in the United States in 1998, the last year for which
final tallies were available.
</P>
<P>
   That amounts to more than triple the number reported a decade
earlier, and officials at testing facilities said the trend line
continues its rapid climb.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the increase is attributable to other factors, from
people settling inheritance disagreements to adoptees searching for
their birth fathers, to parents trying to resolve mix-ups when
babies are thought to have been switched at hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But child-welfare and fathers'groups, often at odds on custody
and support issues, both attribute the bulk of the increase to men
who balk at the demand by a wife, a girlfriend, or a judge to pay
child-rearing expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good example of an area in which technology has simply
moved more quickly than the law,'' said David Westfall, a
specialist in family law at Harvard Law School. ``We have yet to
sort out what that means or what we should do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The root problem is a knotty one: Should the ``best interests of
the child,'' a powerful presumption in family law cases, still
trump biological fact? Or should support cases hinge simply on the
fact of fatherhood, balancing the rights of the man with those of
the child?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think many dads are going to abandon kids who they've
been supporting just because they find out they're not related by
blood,'' said Diana Thompson, executive director of the American
Coalition for Fathers and Children. ``But everyone has a right to
know whether a child is biologically theirs or not, and there
shouldn't be a time limit on that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a society,'' she added, ``now that we've got tests to prove
these things conclusively, we're just going to have to learn to
deal with the truth whenever we learn it and whatever it brings.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent ruling by Maryland's highest court offers a vivid
illustration of how the new technologies are forcing a rethinking
of old issues like child support in almost every state.
</P>
<P>
   The state Court of Appeals held, 4-3, that there is no time
limit on when a man can seek to challenge paternity through DNA
testing. The court also set aside the idea that the ``best
interests of the child'' must be considered in weighing a
determination of paternity.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was based on the efforts by two men to terminate
support payments for children they had acknowledged as their own a
decade ago. They now know better, because of DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases began as narrow financial disputes, but engendered a
debate raising far-reaching questions, such as: How decisive should
biological proof of parenthood be in a time when so many Americans
live in unconventional families?
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland ruling has drawn raves from groups such as
Thompson's, as well as from proponents of conventional families.
They say it both affirms the importance of blood ties and chips
away at institutional discrimination against men in child-custody
and -support cases.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of nontraditional families, however, are troubled by
the decision. They say that particularly at a time when adoption
and foster care are increasingly promoted as positive parenting
options, the judges' acceptance of genetics as the bottom line on
parenthood indicates there is still a lingering social bias against
alternative families.
</P>
<P>
   But the harshest critics of last month's decision are advocates
for children.
</P>
<P>
   They are upset, generally, because the majority held that the
``best-interests-of-the-child'' standard does not apply. And they
worry the result will be a run on DNA testing facilities by men who
want to avoid paying child support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will cause a great deal of disruption . . . and not
only because it will increase the number of children who will lose
their economic support,'' said Joan Entmacher, director of Family
Economic Security at the National Women's Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children will also be hurt when genetic tests disprove
something that was a cornerstone of their identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Robert Bell of Maryland made a similar point in a
scathing dissent: ``It is not inconceivable, and, indeed, quite
probable, that there will be a number of requests for blood and
genetic tests made by men who agreed to paternity'' but are now
``behind in payments or perhaps regretting the initial decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, according to children's advocates, is not that men
might want to know if they fathered a child. They agree that an
early, definitive finding on paternity may benefit all parties.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the critics say, the problem is the open-ended nature of
the Maryland court's decision, and its holding that the interests
of the child are subordinate to those of the adult seeking the
test.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law gives men 60 days to rescind voluntary
acknowledgement of paternity, after which states set their own time
limits for challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The common practice nationwide has been to allow a maximum of
two years, with some states offering far less. Massachusetts
imposes a limit of two years.
</P>
<P>
   Such limits have resulted in cases like that of Gerald Miscovich
in Pennsylvania, which fathers'-rights groups point to as a prime
example of the unfair treatment of men in American courts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, two years after getting divorced, Miscovich decided to
check his paternity because both he and his ex-wife had blue eyes
but 4-year-old Gerald Jr.'s were brown. That fact made it unlikely
that Miscovich was the biological father, and the DNA test
confirmed as much.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a 500-year-old English common-law doctrine, which holds
that a man is considered the father of children born during a
marriage, a state court nevertheless ordered Miscovich to pay $537
in child support.
</P>
<P>
   Miscovich tried for seven years to reverse the judgment, but
gave up when the US Supreme Court refused to hear his appeal last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, after a state resident received considerable
publicity for being ordered to pay child support despite DNA proof
that he was not the father, the Legislature passed a statute in
1995 allowing courts to modify paternity orders in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Appeals Court ruling in late June was the first test of the
law, and it is expected to reverberate nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Marie Nee, the lawyer for one of the men who brought the
case, said she shares the concern that the ruling will lead to
similar challenges to paternity and the obligations that flow from
it.
</P>
<P>
   She voiced hope that fathers do not view DNA testing simply as
an ``an excuse to get out of their responsibilities . . . and
realize their children have an emotional attachment, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Gelb of New York, who runs one of the most active
paternity consulting and testing businesses in the country, said he
has seen a marked increase in the number of men coming to him for
DNA screenings relating to child support since the tests became
nearly 100 percent accurate in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that in his experience, few of his customers use
their newfound knowledge to try to skirt making payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a moral issue and not a financial one anyway,''
Gelb said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a father's been there a long time, he should remain the
daddy. Whatever he does with the information, though, he has a
right to know if he's the biological father.''

RIDE PROVIDES STRENGTH, REBIRTH 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a matter of no small amount of pride that, more than a
third of her way across America, Mary Wargo has yet to be
``sagged.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sagged, in the vernacular of the cross-country bicyclist,
is to be hoisted aboard a ``support and gear'' truck and driven to
that night's campsite. It would hardly seem a cause for shame,
considering the 81 miles she is averaging every day on a 3,250-mile
ride from Seattle to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think refusing to be sagged is about proving that I'm
stronger than I think I am,'' says Mary, a reference to the inner
challenge as much as the physical one posed by her participation
with 200 or so other cyclists in the Big Ride Across America for
the American Lung Association. She was calling from Minnesota to
report on her progress.
</P>
<P>
   Cycling through strong headwinds between Owatonna and Winona,
Minn., last week is not where Mary Wargo ever expected to find
herself. This time a year ago, she was packing up her Denver
apartment to come home to Wellesley, Mass. to help care for her
65-year-old mother, suddenly stricken with lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words `Mary, Mom has cancer' are ones that will always be
with me,'' she wrote to friends this summer, soliciting the
required $7,000 in pledges, 90 percent of which goes to the lung
association. ``Unfortunately, my time spent taking care of her was
marked by days, not months, as planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Peg Wargo died last August, only six weeks after her lung cancer
was diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to do something as I was, figuratively, dying
myself,'' Mary said. ``I missed her so much and felt so helpless
and alone. The smile on my face was hers and when she died it also
died.''
</P>
<P>
   We treat a parent's death, even a premature one, as part of the
natural order of things, but Mary saw nothing natural about her
mother's loss. ``The last time my mom smoked a cigarette was 20
years ago. Her doctor stated she died from smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary was sad, but she was also angry. She decided to join the
Big Ride to raise awareness about the danger of smoking after
seeing a 13-year-old puffing on a cigarette on his way home from
the Wellesley Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   At 31, she was in fine physical shape, but her idea of exercise
leaned more toward walking the family's aged mutt, Mickey, around
the block than a grueling cross-country cycling trip. That turned
out to be part of the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom taught me I could do anything I set my mind to. I
wanted to prove she was right,'' says Mary, who now rises at 6 a.m.
and pedals seven or eight hours, burning 6,000 to 9,000 calories a
day. ``I've discovered muscles in places I didn't know I had
them.''
</P>
<P>
   A week out of Seattle, she ran into a woman she had met on June
19, the first day of the 48-day trip. The other rider told Mary she
was surprised but relieved to see her still along.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said I seemed so unhappy the first day, she didn't think
I'd make it,'' Mary said. ``I hadn't realized until she said it how
much what I was feeling inside showed. I feel like I am being
transformed on this trip. It sounds melodramatic, but I am coming
back to life on this bike. When you are grinding every day, pushing
yourself, you feel every muscle and every breath. You are tired but
you feel really alive. The harder my day out here the more I
appreciate everything that's around us. I realize there is no
reason to be angry or sad, that it is a waste of energy and of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling has been reinforced by the company she has keeping.
Some riders are along just for the adventure, but most, like Mary,
have a personal story to share: a father dead of emphysema, a
mother struck down by lung cancer, a sister stricken with
debilitating asthma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to share your story,'' she says. ``You feel less
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary has encountered the spirit of her mother daily along the
ride. In the mountains of Wyoming, the wheat and sunflower fields
of South Dakota, at water stops and campsites, where local women
arrive carrying homemade pies and cakes so like the ones Peg Wargo
could be counted on to bring to a neighborhood party at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so sad at home, I couldn't get past it,'' she says,
``but I feel my mom is with me out here. Sometimes a butterfly will
stay with me for a long time. I think, `That's her,' and I talk to
her while I ride. I talk to the birds, to the butterflies. I must
look really strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Only to the birds, Mary. The other riders must know just how you
feel.

 From W magazine

 &HT;    Too busy to make it to that $1,000-a-plate dinner, mail in a
donation or participate in an all-day walk-a-thon?
 &HT;    Now there's an easier way to save the world: by sitting at home
and shopping. In a rare convergence of corporate marketing and the
common good, a handful of new for-profit Web sites are leading
online shoppers to top Internet retailing sites, such as
amazon.com, cdnow.com and beautyjungle.com, then donating a portion
of each shopper's bill to a favorite charity.
 &HT;    Shoe fanatics will be happy to note that greatergood.com offers
a link to the Neiman Marcus site (among almost 100 e-commerce
sites), which means that there are two ways to buy Manolo Blahniks
without feeling guilty. One involves sitting in the store's shoe
department with your eyes shut while you sign the credit-card slip;
the other is to use greatergood.com's link to snap up a pair of
beaded mules for $545, of which a percentage (the site doesn't say
exactly how much) goes directly to a charity you specify. The
donation isn't tax deductible, but the karmic benefits alone make
it well worthwhile.
 &HT;    Likewise, once you've registered with iGive.com, ordering a new
Palm VII through iGo.com could send $37.43, or 7.5 percent of the
sale, to Habitat for Humanity. The possibilities are endless: Stock
up on Bliss products by linking to ibeauty.com, buy the new Elliot
Smith album at cdnow.com or bid on a vintage Pauline Trigere coat
at sothebys.amazon.com _ all in the name of philanthropy _ while
the retailer and the umbrella site absorb the cost of your
donation. For them, it's all about marketing.
 &HT;    ``We're an extremely effective way of gaining customers for
retailers,'' says Robert Grosshandler, president and founder of
iGive.com. ``An iGive customer tends to buy more often and buy
more, so they like sending us money.''
 &HT;    And it's not only the online marketeers getting in on the act.
Nonprofit organizations are quickly catching on and have begun to
use the Web themselves as a fund-raising tool.
 &HT;    Most major charities, including Doctors Without Borders
(dwb.org), Unicef (unicefusa.org) and the World Wildlife Foundation
(panda.org) have developed their own Web sites and accept online
credit-card tax-deductible donations directly.
 &HT;    Others, such as the National Audubon Society (audubon.org) and
Amnesty International (amnestyusa.org), have taken their
letter-writing campaigns digital. At redcross.org, you can even
download a stock-donation form to submit to your broker, while
helping.org offers lists of volunteer opportunities by zip code.
 &HT;    ``A lot of nonprofits are starting to take advantage of the ease
with which you can do auctions online as well,'' says Andrew
McInnes, director of special projects for amfAR (amfar.org). AmfAR
has used the method by auctioning the chance to attend its
star-studded Cinema Against AIDS benefit in Cannes on yahoo.com.
 &HT;    But to experience the power of Internet marketing at its most
beneficent, try making a contribution through thehungersite.org.
When you click a button, a pack of advertisements for the site's
sponsors pops up on your screen and 2 1/4 cups of rice are promised
to the United Nations World Food Program. Sort of like a
bike-a-thon, but easier.
 &HT;    Tony Hsieh and Alfred Lin, founders of the Internet
venture-capital firm Venture Frogs in San Francisco and of
charityfrogs.com, have taken a similar approach, pledging $1 to the
American Red Cross for each visitor's click of the site's ``ribbit
button'' until the sum totals $1 million.
 &HT;    A generous offer, to be sure, and one that separates the Frogs
from the dot-coms that might invest in a Super Bowl Sunday ad spot
instead.
 &HT;    ``It raises awareness for the Red Cross in a way that writing a
check just wouldn't,'' Hsieh says. ``But it also raises awareness
for our own company.'' c.2000 Fairchild Publications

 NEW WAVE  
 &HT;    ``It really brought out the baby in me,'' Mark Wahlberg
confessed.
 &HT;    Though the bright sunshine outside the premiere of ``The Perfect
Storm'' was a far cry from all those grueling days in the waves,
Wahlberg's expression hinted that the trauma wasn't entirely behind
him.
 &HT;    ``We tried to make it as real as possible _ which meant getting
your butt kicked,'' he explained. ``And I'm not as tough as I
thought I was.''
 &HT;    George Clooney volunteered to explain Wahlberg's hardships in
greater detail.
 &HT;    ``Well, the thing is that Mark throws up like a madman. It was
miserable.''
 &HT;    Diane Lane emerged with a water terror of her own.
 &HT;    ``The story invaded my subconscious,'' she said. ``A real
hurricane came to town, and I half expected a huge wave to break
into my room any minute.''
 &HT;    ``I'll never sail again,'' Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio insisted.
``I like to be on terra firma, preferably sitting in a restaurant _
indoors. I don't even like picnics.''
 &HT;    The following night, a crowd came out to toast the premiere of
``The Patriot,'' in which Mel Gibson portrays a reluctant
Revolutionary War hero.
 &HT;    ``Oh,'' Gibson sighed, ``he's just another freak in my little
gallery.''
 &HT;    
 LIFETIME TV FOR BAYOU  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Look out, Martha. Watch your back, B. Smith.
 &HT;    Los Angeles-based designer Bradley Bayou is staking out your
turf with a new how-to style program to air six times a week on
cable's Lifetime network in the fall.
 &HT;    Tentatively called ``Do It with Style,'' each 30-minute episode
will feature Bayou and other style mavens, such as chefs, florists
and interior designers, helping viewers to host parties, stage
weddings or cook romantic dinners.
 &HT;    But unlike Martha Stewart's over-the-top place settings and
extravagant meals, Bayou said his show, which he is also executive
producing, will be more realistic.
 &HT;    ``It's all done within the context of their budget and their
time frame,'' he said. ``We don't go in there, put on the event and
leave; they do it themselves. It's like Martha in reality.''
 &HT;    For the pilot, Bayou, a chef and an interior designer, helped
Mary Lou, a third-grade teacher and mother of three, to prepare a
romantic dinner for her and her husband with a budget of $100. At
the end of program, she had prepared a three-course meal, including
oysters on the half-shell, stuffed shrimp, and asparagus, with corn
bread and a dessert of strawberries dipped in chocolate.
 &HT;    The show premieres Oct. 16 with a 40-show commitment. Production
starts at the end of this month.
 &HT;    But don't expect Bayou to become a television star and forget
about designing his signature gowns, suits and eveningwear.
 &HT;    ``I ain't giving it up,'' he promised. ``I've worked too hard at
it.''
 &HT;    
 NEW A&AMP;F FAN  
 &HT;    These days, you never know where Rudy Giuliani will pop up. The
mayor himself is featured in a Q&AMP;A in the back-to-school edition of
the Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch quarterly.
 &HT;    Donning an A&AMP;F baseball cap, Giuliani addresses several topics,
including how it wasn't just him, but his City Hall team, who
helped to make the city safer.
 &HT;    When asked what he'd do if he weren't mayor, Giuliani said,
``I've always wanted to manage the Yankees or perform at the
Metropolitan Opera, but since I'm trained as a lawyer, I guess I'd
do that.''
 &HT;    And if the Giuliani interview isn't enough, there's also one
with former mayor Ed Koch.
 &HT;    ``We almost had Hillary, but there was a scheduling problem,''
said Sam Shahid, owner of Shahid &AMP; Co., the ad agency that created
the catalog, which is an homage to New York. The $6 edition went on
sale last week at A&AMP;F stores and was sent to subscribers. It tells
the story of two guys and a girl from Princeton University who
arrive in Manhattan and see all the sights _ but she leaves with a
different guy.
 &HT;    Overall, the catalog is fairly tame by A&AMP;F's standards, except
for a rear-end shot of a hunky guy with dollar bills coming out of
his thong, and a photo of a guy with his shorts pulled down,
frolicking in the lake in Central Park.
 &HT;    The catalog features Bruce Weber photos of such landmarks as
Grand Central Terminal, the Brooklyn Bridge, ``21'' Club, the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Public Library, the Hudson
River, Saks Fifth Avenue and Lenox Lounge in Harlem. John Scott
shot Giuliani and Koch, among others.
 &HT;    The catalog also includes a fall film guide, a 24-hour jaunt
through the Big Apple and a guide to nighttime hot spots.
 &HT;    A&AMP;F ruffled some Tiger hairs by photographing a building at
Princeton University without permission.
 &HT;    ``We definitely didn't approve it,'' said Marilyn Marks, a
Princeton spokeswoman. ``We have a policy that Nassau Hall isn't
used in promotional photography. Our attorney has been in contact
with their attorney and we expect there will be a settlement.''
 &HT;    An Abercrombie spokeswoman in Columbus, Ohio, said the company
had no comment on its use of the image or a settlement.

 &HT;    
 LIFETIME TV FOR BAYOU  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Look out, Martha. Watch your back, B. Smith.
 &HT;    Los Angeles-based designer Bradley Bayou is staking out your
turf with a new how-to style program to air six times a week on
cable's Lifetime network in the fall.
 &HT;    Tentatively called ``Do It with Style,'' each 30-minute episode
will feature Bayou and other style mavens, such as chefs, florists
and interior designers, helping viewers to host parties, stage
weddings or cook romantic dinners.
 &HT;    But unlike Martha Stewart's over-the-top place settings and
extravagant meals, Bayou said his show, which he is also executive
producing, will be more realistic.
 &HT;    ``It's all done within the context of their budget and their
time frame,'' he said. ``We don't go in there, put on the event and
leave; they do it themselves. It's like Martha in reality.''
 &HT;    For the pilot, Bayou, a chef and an interior designer, helped
Mary Lou, a third-grade teacher and mother of three, to prepare a
romantic dinner for her and her husband with a budget of $100. At
the end of program, she had prepared a three-course meal, including
oysters on the half-shell, stuffed shrimp, and asparagus, with corn
bread and a dessert of strawberries dipped in chocolate.
 &HT;    The show premieres Oct. 16 with a 40-show commitment. Production
starts at the end of this month.
 &HT;    But don't expect Bayou to become a television star and forget
about designing his signature gowns, suits and eveningwear.
 &HT;    ``I ain't giving it up,'' he promised. ``I've worked too hard at
it.''
 &HT;    
 NEW A&AMP;F FAN  
 &HT;    These days, you never know where Rudy Giuliani will pop up. The
mayor himself is featured in a Q&AMP;A in the back-to-school edition of
the Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch quarterly.
 &HT;    Donning an A&AMP;F baseball cap, Giuliani addresses several topics,
including how it wasn't just him, but his City Hall team, who
helped to make the city safer.
 &HT;    When asked what he'd do if he weren't mayor, Giuliani said,
``I've always wanted to manage the Yankees or perform at the
Metropolitan Opera, but since I'm trained as a lawyer, I guess I'd
do that.''
 &HT;    And if the Giuliani interview isn't enough, there's also one
with former mayor Ed Koch.
 &HT;    ``We almost had Hillary, but there was a scheduling problem,''
said Sam Shahid, owner of Shahid &AMP; Co., the ad agency that created
the catalog, which is an homage to New York. The $6 edition went on
sale last week at A&AMP;F stores and was sent to subscribers. It tells
the story of two guys and a girl from Princeton University who
arrive in Manhattan and see all the sights _ but she leaves with a
different guy.
 &HT;    Overall, the catalog is fairly tame by A&AMP;F's standards, except
for a rear-end shot of a hunky guy with dollar bills coming out of
his thong, and a photo of a guy with his shorts pulled down,
frolicking in the lake in Central Park.
 &HT;    The catalog features Bruce Weber photos of such landmarks as
Grand Central Terminal, the Brooklyn Bridge, ``21'' Club, the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Public Library, the Hudson
River, Saks Fifth Avenue and Lenox Lounge in Harlem. John Scott
shot Giuliani and Koch, among others.
 &HT;    The catalog also includes a fall film guide, a 24-hour jaunt
through the Big Apple and a guide to nighttime hot spots.
 &HT;    A&AMP;F ruffled some Tiger hairs by photographing a building at
Princeton University without permission.
 &HT;    ``We definitely didn't approve it,'' said Marilyn Marks, a
Princeton spokeswoman. ``We have a policy that Nassau Hall isn't
used in promotional photography. Our attorney has been in contact
with their attorney and we expect there will be a settlement.''
 &HT;    An Abercrombie spokeswoman in Columbus, Ohio, said the company
had no comment on its use of the image or a settlement.

 By MILES SOCHA 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    PARIS _ Designers who have worked at Prada like to describe the
experience as ``school.''
 &HT;    The focus of their studies is a double major in creativity and
commerce, taught with authority and passion by professors Miuccia
Prada and Patrizio Bertelli, respectively.
 &HT;    Their degree? For a growing number of Prada graduates: a plum
job as the head designer of a high-profile European fashion house.
 &HT;    Consider what's happened to Yvan Mispelaere, Stefano Pilati and
Neil Barrett, to name a few. Mispelaere recently assumed the design
reins at Louis Feraud after two years at Miuccia's elbow in Milan.
He showed his first couture collection for the house on July 11 in
Paris.
 &HT;    Pilati, who had worked on the Miu Miu collections in Paris, was
named women's design director for Yves Saint Laurent ready-to-wear
in March. Although Tom Ford is the chief designer of YSL rtw and
creative director of the house, Pilati is assisting in creating one
of the most eagerly anticipated collections of the fall season.
 &HT;    Barrett, since exiting Prada after years as its men's-wear
director, has seen his career catapult. He launched acclaimed men's
and women's signature lines and was tapped last year as designer of
Samsonite's new and popular Travelwear collection.
 &HT;    Other former Prada assistants to have landed well include the
French designer Marc Audibet, now women's rtw designer at
Ferragamo, and Lawrence Steele, who launched a Milan-based designer
business after working for years at Prada and Moschino.
 &HT;    For these graduates of the Prada school, their success in
finding great jobs is testimony to the power of the Prada formula:
a finely tuned balance between creativity and marketing.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, for recruitment experts, it's further proof that
hiring a prominent design assistant, especially from a house as
highly regarded as Prada, is a strategy as sound and solid as
hiring a marquee name.
 &HT;    ``They are not only designers; they have a vision about
fashion,'' said Floriane de Saint Pierre, who runs an executive
search firm in Paris.
 &HT;    She said these designers are increasingly attractive to fashion
houses looking for new talent because of the renowned eye of Prada
and Bertelli.
 &HT;    De Saint Pierre said Bertelli and Prada have a reputation for
selecting individuals who have charisma, strength, a modern design
perspective and a highly sophisticated taste level _ valuable
qualities for a house in need of a dusting or makeover.
 &HT;    Lanvin was among the first venerable French houses to opt for a
design assistant rather than a name designer when it sought a
replacement for couturier Ocimar Versolato in 1997. Its choice:
Christina Ortiz, who had previously been women's design director at
Prada.
 &HT;    ``When we met her, she was more interested in marketing than
many of the creative people we had seen,'' recalled Gerald Asaria,
Lanvin's chief executive officer.
 &HT;    Six seasons later, he said it's easy to measure the impact of
her approach. Sales of the women's collection leaped by 31 percent
for fall, and the collection continues to make inroads in major
stores in North America.
 &HT;    Ortiz declined to be interviewed about her Prada experience, as
did Pilati. Prada and Bertelli also declined to participate in this
story. However, several designers spoke frankly about how their
Prada days altered their approach to the fashion business _ and
added a lot of heat to their resumes.
 &HT;    Mispelaere, interviewed as he prepared for his couture debut,
described over espressos at a cafe here what an eye-opening
experience it was to work at Prada, given that he had earlier
designed at Valentino for a more unabashedly elitist clientele.
 &HT;    At Prada, he said, he had ``the great opportunity to work in a
very merchandising, marketing way, to think about the product and
how the clothes will be received by the customer and displayed in
the store. The most important thing about Prada is thinking through
at the beginning what will happen at the end, controlling the whole
process.''
 &HT;    Although Miuccia Prada's approach to fashion is often described
as intellectual, Mispelaere characterized it as more cultural and
instinctive.
 &HT;    ``She has a really particular eye and knowledge of clothes, the
culture of clothes and the details of clothes,'' he said. ``But we
had a very simple approach, thinking about dresses, skirts,
jackets, concentrating on the way it looks without thinking we are
making special, revolutionary clothes.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Bertelli operates as the commercial conscience of the
organization, adamant that what is designed will be appealing to a
great number of people and sell briskly, Mispelaere said.
 &HT;    ``It's very well known that working at Prada is not easy,'' he
said. ``It's a lot of work and involvement. It's really about the
stress of satisfying Bertelli and Miuccia, but it's a good school
for that. It's a way of thinking: being natural in your work about
what you want to do and realizing what is reasonable and what will
be successful. It's playing with the limits of a designer's work.''
 &HT;    French designer Marc Audibet said he worked at Prada just as the
family-owned luggage firm was gaining fame for rtw and setting up
its design teams. The experience served him well. Last year, he was
recruited by Florentine house Ferragamo to work with Nicole
Fischelis and Giovanna Gentile Ferragamo, who oversees rtw.
 &HT;    ``Now, other firms want to hire designers from Prada because
they want to buy a piece of the company's success,'' said Audibet,
who spent six years at Prada in the early '90s.
 &HT;    Audibet started his career at Cerruti, later working at Hermes
and Trussardi. He asserted that Bertelli, not Miuccia Prada, drives
the company's success.
 &HT;    ``If a house really wants to tap Prada's success, they should
hire Bertelli,'' he said.
 &HT;    Neil Barrett did not mince words in recounting the degree of
control Bertelli imposes on his organization, which famously
extends to the number of pencils in employees' pencil holders to
the type of toilet paper installed in the company's restrooms.
 &HT;    ``The Bertelli regime imposes certain standards of precision,
which on a work level I thoroughly enjoyed,'' he said, describing
the company variously as ``precise'' and even ``anal.''
 &HT;    ``One of the most important aspects of the training was seeing
the big picture, which became fundamental when I set up my own
company,'' he said. ``Our work was organized because Bertelli
wanted to be able to walk into a room and in five minutes
understand what you had been working on for the past three weeks.
Our job was to make things legible for him and Miuccia.
 &HT;    ``Everything was thought out in depth because, down to the width
of the stitches, Bertelli was very keyed in with the technical
aspects. What he didn't understand, he wanted to understand.''
 &HT;    Steele, who left Prada to launch is own collection in 1995 after
working on the women's collection for five years, agreed ``it was
great to work in the middle of two brilliant people.
 &HT;    ``Miuccia is very passionate about design. She is an expressive
and poetic person,'' he said. ``Bertelli, on the other hand, is
always so excited and driven. They have a great method of working,
because even though they have different roles, there is a great,
common harmony.
 &HT;    ``Bertelli has a particular way of structuring because he's
involved with the color choices, the clothes and the accessories.
The greatest experience was seeking the big picture with the eyes
of two different people who are so in sync.''
 &HT;    Of course, Prada is not the only house to produce desirable
design assistants who went on to major careers in fashion.
 &HT;    Early examples include Narciso Rodriguez, a prominent assistant
at Calvin Klein who was ultimately hired by Cerruti and Loewe, and
Alber Elbaz, a behind-the-scenes talent at Geoffrey Beene who burst
into prominence when he took over the design reins at Guy Laroche
and, more recently, Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche for three
seasons.
 &HT;    Other fashion houses that have prominent former assistants at
the helm include Nathalie Gervais at Nina Ricci, Peter Speliopoulos
at Cerruti and Roberto Menichetti at Burberry. Previously, they
were top assistants at Valentino, Donna Karan and Jil Sander,
respectively.
 &HT;    The strategy of hiring prominent design assistants emerged in
the late '90s as an alternative to the star-making, buzz-generating
but cost-prohibitive ways of LVMH chief Bernard Arnault, who hired
glittering, headline-making talents for Christian Dior, Givenchy,
Louis Vuitton and Celine in the mid-'90s: John Galliano, Alexander
McQueen, Marc Jacobs and Michael Kors, respectively.
 &HT;    According to industry sources, some of these designers now earn
annual salaries in the range of $1 million. But LVMH is also said
to pay the salaries of key assistants, and in the cases of
Galliano, Jacobs and Kors, the luxury giant also owns stakes in
their signature businesses.
 &HT;    But healthy salaries aren't the only factor behind the move to
hiring prominent assistants.
 &HT;    De Saint Pierre said one big plus of hiring a prominent
assistant is that editors and buyers have no preconceptions,
positive or negative, about the designer's work. Granted, buyers
may wait several seasons to evaluate the designer's work before
placing an order, but ``they really judge on the product,'' De
Saint Pierre said.
 &HT;    Asaria stressed there are no hard-and-fast rules about which
strategy works best for a fashion house, be it a marquee name, a
prominent assistant or an anonymous team behind the label.
 &HT;    But he acknowledged there are potential complications with the
famous designer route, insofar as these men and women must divide
their energies between their own label and the one they are hired
to revitalize. And once they leave, their customers often follow
them.
 &HT;    ``That makes things a little more complicated,'' he said. ``But
each house has to deal with that in its own way.''
 &HT;    Annie Bingham, a consultant at the executive search firm TMP
Worldwide here, agreed, and said, ``I think it's better when you
have someone who doesn't have their own signature collection and
can devote their entire energies to the house.''
 &HT;    As for when those designers come from Prada, Bingham echoed the
designers precisely, describing it as a school where ``designers
have been trained very well in the style of the house.''

MAY CHICAGO '68 BE ON EVERY DEMOCRAT'S MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles next month
is even remotely reminiscent of the party's 1968 convention in
Chicago _ and signs are that it may be _ it could spell as much
trouble for Vice President Al Gore as it did for Vice President
Hubert H. Humphrey 32 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At that convention, Chicago Mayor Richard Daley prepared for the
expected street protests by turning the city into a virtual police
state. The strategy backfired into a series of bloody clashes
between the club-wielding police and anti-Vietnam War
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   As demonstrators chanted ``the whole world is watching,'' the
violent overreaction of the Chicago police was indeed telecast to
the nation and beyond. Viewers were appalled by what they saw. In
the end, the episode shamed and embarrassed the Democratic Party,
damaged Humphrey's candidacy, and helped Richard Nixon win the
White House for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The police clubbing of the demonstrators probably raised doubts
in many voters' minds as to whether Democrats could end the
nation's domestic turmoil over the war.
</P>
<P>
   It is with that history as a backdrop that Democrats approach
their convention in Los Angeles next month. It serves to remind
them of the possible consequences if LA's elected officials make
the same mistakes that Chicago's did a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Los Angeles have a recent memory that should
prove instructive _ that of the protests in Seattle last November
and December over global trade policies. There, too, police
overreaction won the public relations war for the protesters. And
in Los Angeles, the even more recent celebration that turned into
mayhem after the Lakers won the National Basketball Association
championship last month should remind city officials to be prepared
by convention time.
</P>
<P>
   But the steps the LA authorities are already taking, the talk of
the strong police presence needed, sound eerily familiar to those
who remember Chicago in '68.
</P>
<P>
   Even Thomas Hayden, who was a key protester in Chicago back then
and now is a California state senator and both a convention
delegate and a protester, saw the similarities between Chicago and
Los Angeles and spoke out against the city's plan to keep the
protesters at a distance. Hayden and others won a lawsuit last week
when a federal judge ordered city officials better access to the
Democratic Convention site.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid an overreaction, LA officials should heed news reports
that organized labor (which dramatically boosted the number of
protesters in Seattle) will not be on the streets in LA. Rather,
labor's backers will work inside the convention hall, where
one-third of the delegates _ AFL-CIO President John Sweeney among
them _ will be union members.
</P>
<P>
   That means that the number of protesters outside will probably
be considerably lower than the earlier police estimates of 10,000
to 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney and other union leaders were strongly disappointed over
Vice President Al Gore's support for the bill granting China normal
trade relations status, but they are willing to set those
differences aside and work now on Gore's behalf. The alternative to
a Gore presidency, Sweeney noted, is a Bush presidency, and that
``would be horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Some labor activists are privately worried that protests could
end up hurting Gore's chances. The organizers, perhaps not wanting
to be blamed for any problems arising from the demonstrations, have
insisted that the protest will be peaceful. They say the event
(which goes by the shorthand name D2KLA, to represent the
convergence of Democrats and the millennium in LA) will address
labor issues while criticizing the ``coporatization'' of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that many of the demonstrators in LA will be behind
Gore's candidacy sets it apart from what happened in Chicago in
1968, where Humphrey enjoyed no backing from those outside the
hall. It may also help keep violence from breaking out.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters would support Ralph Nader's Green Party
candidacy over Gore's, but they do so knowing it works to the
benefit of the person whose views are most at odds with their own _
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the GOP convention in Philadelphia, which gets under
way in a week, will have no major protests to worry about _
although an alternative ``shadow convention'' is planned by
activists and reformers.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, Gore has been climbing in the polls. A
disastrous convention could halt, if not reverse, that climb.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats learned anything from Chicago, it is this: The
actions of the police could do more to ruin the Democratic
convention and seriously harm Gore's chances than the actions of
the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   If the LA authorities lose control of their police, Democrats
could lose control of the presidency in November.

 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    PARIS _ Designers who have worked at Prada like to describe the
experience as ``school.''
 &HT;    The focus of their studies is a double major in creativity and
commerce, taught with authority and passion by professors Miuccia
Prada and Patrizio Bertelli, respectively.
 &HT;    Their degree? For a growing number of Prada graduates: a plum

 &HT;    Consider what's happened to Yvan Mispelaere, Stefano Pilati and

He showed his first couture collection for the house on July 11 in

for that. It's a way of thinking: being natural in your work about
what you want to do and realizing what is reasonable and what will
be successful. It's playing with the limits of a designer's work.''
 &HT;    French designer Marc Audibet said he worked at Prada just as the
family-owned luggage firm was gaining fame for rtw and setting up
its design teams. The experience served him well. Last year, he was
recruited by Florentine house Ferragamo to work with Nicole
Fischelis and Giovanna Gentile Ferragamo, who oversees rtw.
 &HT;    ``Now, other firms want to hire designers from Prada because
they want to buy a piece of the company's success,'' said Audibet,
who spent six years at Prada in the early '90s.
 &HT;    Audibet started his career at Cerruti, later working at Hermes
and Trussardi. He asserted that Bertelli, not Miuccia Prada, drives
the company's success.
 &HT;    ``If a house really wants to tap Prada's success, they should
hire Bertelli,'' he said.
 &HT;    Neil Barrett did not mince words in recounting the degree of
control Bertelli imposes on his organization, which famously
extends to the number of pencils in employees' pencil holders to
the type of toilet paper installed in the company's restrooms.
 &HT;    ``The Bertelli regime imposes certain standards of precision,
which on a work level I thoroughly enjoyed,'' he said, describing
the company variously as ``precise'' and even ``anal.''
 &HT;    ``One of the most important aspects of the training was seeing
the big picture, which became fundamental when I set up my own
company,'' he said. ``Our work was organized because Bertelli
wanted to be able to walk into a room and in five minutes
understand what you had been working on for the past three weeks.
Our job was to make things legible for him and Miuccia.
 &HT;    ``Everything was thought out in depth because, down to the width
of the stitches, Bertelli was very keyed in with the technical
aspects. What he didn't understand, he wanted to understand.''
 &HT;    Steele, who left Prada to launch is own collection in 1995 after
working on the women's collection for five years, agreed ``it was
great to work in the middle of two brilliant people.
 &HT;    ``Miuccia is very passionate about design. She is an expressive
and poetic person,'' he said. ``Bertelli, on the other hand, is
always so excited and driven. They have a great method of working,
because even though they have different roles, there is a great,
common harmony.
 &HT;    ``Bertelli has a particular way of structuring because he's
involved with the color choices, the clothes and the accessories.
The greatest experience was seeking the big picture with the eyes
of two different people who are so in sync.''
 &HT;    Of course, Prada is not the only house to produce desirable
design assistants who went on to major careers in fashion.
 &HT;    Early examples include Narciso Rodriguez, a prominent assistant
at Calvin Klein who was ultimately hired by Cerruti and Loewe, and
Alber Elbaz, a behind-the-scenes talent at Geoffrey Beene who burst
into prominence when he took over the design reins at Guy Laroche
and, more recently, Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche for three
seasons.
 &HT;    Other fashion houses that have prominent former assistants at
the helm include Nathalie Gervais at Nina Ricci, Peter Speliopoulos
at Cerruti and Roberto Menichetti at Burberry. Previously, they
were top assistants at Valentino, Donna Karan and Jil Sander,
respectively.
 &HT;    The strategy of hiring prominent design assistants emerged in
the late '90s as an alternative to the star-making, buzz-generating
but cost-prohibitive ways of LVMH chief Bernard Arnault, who hired
glittering, headline-making talents for Christian Dior, Givenchy,
Louis Vuitton and Celine in the mid-'90s: John Galliano, Alexander
McQueen, Marc Jacobs and Michael Kors, respectively.
 &HT;    According to industry sources, some of these designers now earn
annual salaries in the range of $1 million. But LVMH is also said
to pay the salaries of key assistants, and in the cases of
Galliano, Jacobs and Kors, the luxury giant also owns stakes in
their signature businesses.
 &HT;    But healthy salaries aren't the only factor behind the move to
hiring prominent assistants.
 &HT;    De Saint Pierre said one big plus of hiring a prominent
assistant is that editors and buyers have no preconceptions,
positive or negative, about the designer's work. Granted, buyers
may wait several seasons to evaluate the designer's work before
placing an order, but ``they really judge on the product,'' De
Saint Pierre said.
 &HT;    Asaria stressed there are no hard-and-fast rules about which
strategy works best for a fashion house, be it a marquee name, a
prominent assistant or an anonymous team behind the label.
 &HT;    But he acknowledged there are potential complications with the
famous designer route, insofar as these men and women must divide
their energies between their own label and the one they are hired
to revitalize. And once they leave, their customers often follow
them.
 &HT;    ``That makes things a little more complicated,'' he said. ``But
each house has to deal with that in its own way.''
 &HT;    Annie Bingham, a consultant at the executive search firm TMP
Worldwide here, agreed, and said, ``I think it's better when you
have someone who doesn't have their own signature collection and
can devote their entire energies to the house.''
 &HT;    As for when those designers come from Prada, Bingham echoed the
designers precisely, describing it as a school where ``designers
have been trained very well in the style of the house.''

READING BETWEEN THE GENDER LINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you can't tell a book by its cover, you can tell a book group
by its gender _ and that, in turn, reveals something fundamental
about America's literary interests.
</P>
<P>
   From Oprah's Book Club to the reading groups that gather monthly
in the nation's living rooms, the conversation about modern
fiction, at least, is a discussion by, of, and for women. Indeed,
women have claimed the imagined world as their own in ways that,
while echoed in history, have a distinctly contemporary cast.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in reading groups,which are among the few social
organizations that have not declined in recent years, is 80 percent
female. That, at least, is what Harvard professor Robert Putnam, he
of ``Bowling Alone'' fame, has found in his painstaking new
examination of American social life.
</P>
<P>
   For all the important issues Putnam's larger work raises, that
single statistic demonstrating distaff dominance of book groups
opens some equally interesting questions about gender psychology
and differences, such as why men don't come together to talk about
books.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when evidence points to a blossoming of book groups,
some observers agree it is women who buying, reading, and
discussing books, and especially novels, in America.
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting way, today's majority female literary salon
replicates a role women have played at various points throughout
history.
</P>
<P>
   Literary discussion in revolutionary France revolved around the
salon of Germaine de Stael. A renowned author and coruscating
conversationalist, Madame de Stael thought male talk trite _ and
Napoleon a boor for answering, when asked to name history's
greatest women: ``The one who has made the most children.'' So
sharp (and seditious) were her sallies that Napoleon banished her
from Paris, so intriguing her literary ability that her works later
captivated the erstwhile emperor when he was in exile.
</P>
<P>
   It's a line of heritage that would run through the American
critic and writer Margaret Fuller, who made women's discussion
groups part of the American scene in the 1840s; to expatriate
Gertrude Stein, whose early 20th-century Paris salon drew artists
like Sherwood Anderson, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Ernest Hemingway;
to caustic critic Dorothy Parker, part of the nucleus of the
Algonquin ``Round Table'' of the 1920s and '30s.
</P>
<P>
   If those trends influenced their day, the disproportionate
female interest in fiction is just as clearly affecting the
literary world today, as publishing houses cater to women's
interest in reading, and talking about, novels.
</P>
<P>
   In fall 1997, Ballantine Books began including a reader's guide
_ some questions to focus the discussion or an interview with the
author _ with some of its paperback fiction.
</P>
<P>
   They became so popular, says Maureen O'Neal, the editorial
director, that the Ballantine Reader's Circle logo dramatically
increased the sale of books. Other publishers quickly followed
suit.
</P>
<P>
   The novels chosen for the program are aimed squarely at female
readers, says O'Neal, who describes the typical selection this way:
``It is not too dark, it has great female characters, it is not
going to be a thriller or a mystery. It is more about relationships
and the emotional lives of women.''
</P>
<P>
   The desire to discuss relationships and emotions and to relate
to a novel's protagonist marks a fundamental difference separating
male and female readers, others say.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it shouldn't be a surprise that women are apparently
much more willing to engage in what Coleridge called ``the willing
suspension of disbelief'' necessary to read fiction intelligently.
</P>
<P>
   To discuss an emotionally complex novel is to reveal a part of
yourself, to open to others a part of one's inner being, and that's
something women are more willing to do than men.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the intuitive sense of several psychologists,
who emphasize they are speculating.
</P>
<P>
   ``A novel is like an inkblot, a Rorschach test: The way you
respond will reveal something about you, and that may be
threatening for men in groups because masculinity is a front they
have to keep up,'' says Shari Turner, a clinical psychologist,
Boston University professor, and 25-year-member of an women's
Beacon Hill book club. ``Books trigger an emotional response and
women are much more able to talk about emotional issues than men.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sargent, a Boston-area psychologist, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking about your reaction to and thoughts about a book is a
kind of sharing that is sometimes a bit more comfortable for
women,'' Sargent says.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly that's the perspective from several Boston area book
groups. Sara Butterfield, member of Norwell/Scituate women's book
group, thinks women's greater taste for fiction speaks to gender
difference reinforced by life roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think men have a more difficult time putting themselves
outside of their realm and into a character's position and dealing
with that on an emotional level,'' says Butterfield. ``I think
women think more in terms of emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly in our therapeutic age, book-group discussions seem to
wander with some regularity from the printed page to a discussion
full of real-life antecedents, and thus are fraught with greater
personal meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Book groups are not just about reading the book,'' says Kathy
Lehan, member of an 8-year-old women's group that has migrated with
its members from Boston to the suburbs. ``It seems to me that book
groups are about relating yourself to a character, and that in turn
brings out problems you have faced in the past, problems you face
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, to be sure, not everyone considers book-group discussion
the acme of analytic activity; the same extrapolation from
literature to life that attracts some women repels others, who say
comparing an author's imagined world to a reader's real life tends
to blur the fictive purpose of the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kaffeklatsch with a college education,'' sniffs one
literary type. She said she recently suffered through a discussion
that condemned a novel because the protagonist treated his wife
callously. ``There are reasons to be affronted by misogyny but not
because you have trained your husband and sons not to act that way,
so the author should have trained his characters not to act that
way,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does everyone endorse the idea that a willingness or ability
to relate a character's life or experience to one's own is a
prerequisite to perceptive reading.
</P>
<P>
   Among the skeptics is Harold Bloom, definer and defender of the
Western canon and author, most recently, of ``How to Read and
Why.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I reread `Moby-Dick' every year and don't find much of my
cloistered life in Melville's wonderful wildness,'' Bloom says.
</P>
<P>
   But though he rejects the view that fiction is a prism through
which we analyze our own lives, Bloom, a professor of humanities at
Yale University, agrees that women are more eager and acute fiction
readers than men.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many, many years now,'' Bloom says, ``the majority of my
best students _ that is to say, the most sensitive and brilliant
and dedicated readers _ have been women. I would say two-thirds,
perhaps 70 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bloom's leviathan example aside, book-group favorites
tend to be novels that allow some sort of psychological analysis
and identification, such as ``The Book of Ruth,'' ``The Liars'
Club,'' ``The God of Small Things,'' ``Stones from the River,''
``Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,'' ``She's Come Undone,''
``Memoirs of a Geisha,'' ``Bridget Jones's Diary,'' and ``Charming
Billy.'' Virginia Woolf's ``Mrs. Dalloway'' and Michael
Cunningham's ``The Hours'' are a favorite pairing.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly it is hard to quarrel with the assertion that
women as a group seem to be more interested in discussing emotions
and relationships than men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think that men get together to talk about
intimate things, do they?'' Lehan says.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt some do, but it also seems fair to say that to stay
afloat in the daily flow of male conversation is to spend a
mind-numbing amount of time discussing professional sports
(physical struggle) or politics (metaphorical struggle) or golf
(obsession?), away from the emotional conflict or psychological
issues at the core of most satisfying fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Further, when it comes to men, genre may follow gender.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, books like ``The Perfect Storm,''
``Into Thin Air,'' ``The Greatest Generation,'' or ``The
Endurance,'' about the travails of polar explorer Ernest Shackleton
seem to have had particular appeal to the average male reader.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from marveling at the fury of nature, the folly of man, or
the destiny of character, those kinds of books do not necessarily
lend themselves to enlightening analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But before members of one gender grow too smug, or members of
the other become too defensive, it is worthwhile to consider
Sargent's experience with discussion groups.
</P>
<P>
   More than decade ago, the psychologist and some women friends
started a professional group to talk about career and family
issues.
</P>
<P>
   And their husbands? They met as a result of their wives'
organization _ and promptly formed a book group.

SUMMIT BREAKTHROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ The ``suitcase move'' is so much a part of
Israeli diplomatic history that you can imagine courses in it for
fledgling foreign service officers.
</P>
<P>
   The wrinkle here last week was that President Clinton was the
one to make the move, ordering his bags packed, a motorcade
assembled in front of his lodge at Camp David, even putting out a
statement that the Middle East summit had ended without an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis certainly understood the gambit's seriousness; they
were doing the suitcase move themselves, which above all means
letting it be seen you're literally preparing to leave.
</P>
<P>
   But according to American brokers here, the ``hey, wait a
minute,'' counter-gambit came from the people who set the endgames
in motion by not having a proportionate response to a historic as
well as generous Israeli set of ideas about Jerusalem _ the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat did not have a
proportionate response to Clinton's ideas about how the two sides
might negotiate about the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat did decide that it was far better to stay here than
return home to deal with the consequences _ worsening tensions and
strife, combined with the evaporation of hope that a viable
Palestinian state is possible.
</P>
<P>
   In non-diplomatic terms, Jerusalem _ the third rail of Middle
East religion/politics _ has been touched for the first time by the
parties involved and it has not been fatal.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to understand that until this summit, no Israeli
nor Palestinian official had ever negotiated about the city, whose
Arab, eastern sector was occupied by the Israelis 33 years ago.
This ``taboo'' is similar to two shattered by Israel under Yitzhak
Rabin and Arafat seven years ago _ the acceptance of the concept of
exchanging occupied land for real peace and the acceptance of the
concept that there was going to be a Palestinian nation on that
land.
</P>
<P>
   In the run-up to the current summit, the two sides made
considerable progress on the remaining, so-called final status
issues: borders, water and other infrastructure resources, even the
return of Palestinians displaced by the conflict that followed
Israel's birth 52 years ago to Israel itself and to the envisaged,
Palestinian nation. But beyond exchanging boilerplate, what the
diplomats call declaratory positions, about East Jerusalem (as in,
``It's ours''), they never negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have, which at least implies a willingness to go beyond
boilerplate _ in effect to shift gears on the S word, moving from a
shouting match about ``sovereignty'' to concepts that really mean
``sharing'' administration of an area with about a quarter-million
Palestinians living in it.
</P>
<P>
   Barak made the dramatic gesture, confirmed by the so-called
bridging refinements quickly suggested by Clinton. But Arafat
balked at a similarly creative response, which is why first Barak
and then Clinton began to believe that there was no point in
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The analogy is imperfect, but it exists between the positions of
Arafat and the late Hafez al-Assad of Syria five months ago. Assad
looked real peace in the face in Geneva _ the real thing, land in
exchange for it and then acceptance of Israel _ and blinked before
he went home to his economic basket case of a country to die.
</P>
<P>
   Given all that Barak has done with his extraordinary election
mandate, it is still not clear that Arafat is fully prepared to end
the dispute, which has to mean an end to claims.
</P>
<P>
   What the summit was really about up until the dramatic events
early Thursday morning was taking a long look at the detailed
meaning of failure (unilateral declarations, annexations, economic
deprivation, extreme tensions and even violence) in order to
establish the case that however wrenching the adjustments required
by peace, they are preferable. That look, what all sides have come
to call peering into the abyss, has held the final status talks
together for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage to Clinton's journey to the eight-nation summit in
Japan is that it can give Arafat time to understand better what
failure would mean in terms of what has been achieved just since
March _ a loss of the chance at all but about six percent of the
West Bank; a loss of any right or economic ability of longtime
refugees and their families to return; no chance at anything better
than the status quo in Jerusalem; little change of significant
economic aid from the West, much less the Americans; and perhaps,
most ominous of all, a gradual erosion if not collapse of US
goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   All this, as well as an American effort at mobilizing Arab,
Western, and US congressional assistance, is what is on the line,
in return for mature and creative discussion about East Jerusalem,
where the reality on the ground is already not what the negotiating
positions imply.
</P>
<P>
   Phase I of the summit rejected failure and broke the last taboo.
From this Americans are justified in inferring that settlement is
indeed possible and thus in insisting on it.

 BOSTON: ... he says.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New PBS president Pat Mitchell acknowledges that WGBH has ``a
substantial amount of the real estate'' on PBS, which she
attributes to both ``a longtime buildup there of the best talent''
and to the unique structure of PBS, which relies heavily on member
stations as program suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, when there wasn't so much money to go
around, 'GBH built this strong unit of filmmakers and producers
that just did really quality work,'' says Mitchell. That remains
true, in her view. ``If you were naming the top producers in almost
any field,'' she says, it would have to include McGhee; Apsell;
Margaret Drain, executive producer of ``The American Experience'';
and David Fanning, executive producer of ``Frontline.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at some other PBS stations concur. ``The WGBH logo is
on some of our finest prime-time programs,'' says Barbara Goen,
senior vice president of KCET-TV in Los Angeles. ``WGBH embodies
quality, and stands for all the real significant values of PBS.''
Adds Allen Harmon, general manager of WBSE-TV in Duluth: ``They
have succeeded in striking the always delicate balance between
providing information and education, and producing entertaining
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, WGBH's dominance could be in for a challenge. Many
local stations are hoping Mitchell will follow through on her plan
to give more stations a crack at producing programs and to ``look a
little more diverse.'' Goen, of KCET, says stations ``would love to
see an increase in the number of producing stations.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Mitchell is moving to appoint regional programming
executives in Miami, Los Angeles, and the Midwest to help PBS
stations give documentaries more of a local voice. Since
documentaries are central to WGBH's identity, that could
potentially weaken its grip on the PBS schedule. Mitchell says that
one of her goals is to ``bring more stations into the
producing-station lineup,'' but hastens to add that that ``doesn't
mean you push something from 'GBH off'' the schedule. She says WGBH
executives have agreed to help forge a ``local-national model.''
</P>
<P>
   Becton says he welcomes both the competition and the opportunity
to ``pool resources'' with other PBS stations. WGBH is taking steps
in that direction, he says, with a documentary on the history of
Chicago the ``American Experience'' team is producing with WTTW-TV
in Chicago, and with a series of local election-themed programs
``Frontline'' is producing with 16 PBS stations as part of the
quadrennial series ``The Choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond inspiring envy, there are other ways in which WGBH's
prominence can be a double-edged sword. The station's stature added
to the size of the black eye PBS suffered when WGBH was among
dozens of stations found to have swapped donor lists with political
groups, and also when two appraisers on ``Antiques Roadshow'' were
discovered to have staged an on-air appraisal of a Civil War-era
sword.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics, lamenting the lack of a local newscast since WGBH
canceled ``The 10 O'Clock News'' in 1991, argue that local
programming has suffered because of the station's focus on national
production. Becton disputes that, contending that another newscast
is less vital nowadays than the ``analysis and context and depth''
he says are provided by the nightly public-affairs program
``Greater Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   McGhee maintains that local programs (``Greater Boston,''
``Greater Boston Arts,'' ``La Plaza,'' ``Basic Black'') benefit
indirectly from national production because the latter helps pay
general overhead costs at WGBH. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Not always a powerhouse &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The role of programming powerhouse that WGBH now enjoys did not
come easily, according to McGhee, who arrived at the station in
1969. ``Boston was never a favorite child (within PBS) as New York
and Washington were,'' he says. ``So Boston had to develop its own
muscles and resourcefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   With WNET-TV strong in drama and the performing arts and WETA-TV
in Washington, D.C., supplying political programs, the chief
opening WGBH saw for itself was in documentaries. McGhee and others
at the station talked frequently in the early 1970s about the
dearth of public-affairs documentaries on television. ``A lot of
people had proclaimed the documentary dead,'' recalls McGhee.
</P>
<P>
   So the station sought to bring it to life on PBS. In doing so,
McGhee says, two factors were key: the universities in Boston that
supplied a wealth of academic expertise for documentaries on
history and public affairs, and the host of ambitious young
producers, including McGhee, who had cut their teeth on WGBH's
1960s public-affairs show, ``The Advocates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a knit-together group, which allowed us to operate in
a competitive environment,'' he says. ``Maybe we were quicker off
the block in the beginning. We learned how to raise money.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, after a WGBH producer on a visit to London saw the
plethora of science programming on the BBC, WGBH created ``Nova.''
In 1983, the station introduced ``Frontline,'' and five years later
it rolled out ``The American Experience.'' Those programs emanate
almost entirely from WGBH, whereas a show like ``Masterpiece
Theatre'' is coproduced with the BBC or Channel 4 in Britain, and
filmed abroad. But all final editorial control rests with WGBH.
</P>
<P>
   As for children's programming, the continued strength of WGBH
was underscored last week when its newest offering, ``Between the
Lions,'' was named the best children's program by the Television
Critics Association four months after the show went on the air.
</P>
<P>
   If WGBH has laurels aplenty, the station doesn't appear to be
resting on them. Despite current pressures to decentralize
production, chances are PBS will still depend on the Boston station
to keep it competitive in a TV world dominated by ``Survivor'' and
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' _ and the people who work there
seem to know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to figure out what the right thing is for public
television to do,'' says Brigid Sullivan, vice president of
children's programming. ``And then we do it.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ Images of ballerinas are flickering across a computer
monitor just 2 feet away from Paula Apsell, but it is words, not
images, that preoccupy the ``Nova'' executive producer as she edits
a documentary on anorexia.
</P>
<P>
   Her pen darting from sentence to sentence as she hunches over a
script in an editing suite at WGBH-TV (Channel 2), Apsell searches
for les mots justes with producer Larkin McPhee: ``Uncommonly
thin'' or ``bony''? ``At risk'' of developing an eating disorder,
or ``in danger''? Amid the semantic hairsplitting, they toss around
names of prospective narrators for the film: Kevin Bacon, Susan
Sarandon, Alfre Woodard, Camryn Manheim.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of rewriting and rewinding, Apsell is still not
satisfied with the film's prologue. ``We need to work on this,''
she mutters. ``I don't have a great idea, but we will.'' After all,
she says, ``we have a large constituency out there.''
</P>
<P>
   She is speaking of ``Nova,'' the science documentary series, but
Apsell could as well be describing WGBH. The station on Western
Avenue in Allston constitutes one of the paradoxes of Boston
television. Locally, WGBH is often a quiet bystander, overshadowed
by the noisy ratings battles and big-name personalities at the
commercial stations. But nationally, WGBH is a heavyweight whose
call letters are familiar to PBS viewers from Mobile, Ala., to
Duluth, Minn., from Topeka, Kan., to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston station produces or coproduces nearly 35 percent of
PBS's prime-time lineup _ an output rivaled only by WNET-TV in New
York _ and also generates roughly 20 percent of the children's
programs. The advent of the Internet has expanded the station's
reach: More than one-third of all visits to PBS Web sites are for
WGBH programs. As for the numbers that matter most _ ratings _ WGBH
accounts for more than half of PBS's 10 most-watched shows in any
given month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sitting in this city on the most amazing public resource
in the history of television: the producing arm of WGBH, without
which a lot of people might throw out their television sets,'' says
longtime TV activist Peggy Charren, who joined the WGBH board of
trustees in the past year, after championing the station for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone sees 'GBH in as favorable a light. William Hoynes,
an associate professor of sociology at Vassar College and author of
a book on public television, says that WGBH and WNET ``occupy so
much space on the schedule'' that they ``squeeze out other
producers who may be able to produce innovative, challenging
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoynes says that while WGBH deserves credit for ``pioneering the
long-term documentary, and being an important player in maintaining
that style,'' the station's production role means ``they can throw
their weight around on PBS, and local stations find that
frustrating, that some stations are more equal than others.''
</P>
<P>
   WGBH's dual role _ member station and major program supplier _
is unique to public television, and has no parallel within the
world of commercial network television. In that realm, affiliates
are on the receiving, not sending, end of programs from NBC, CBS,
ABC, and Fox, and even the most powerful West Coast production
studios rarely have more than a handful of shows running
simultaneously on one network.
</P>
<P>
   Yet WGBH either produces or coproduces many of the marquee
titles on PBS: ``Nova,'' ``Antiques Roadshow,'' ``The American
Experience,'' ``ExxonMobil Masterpiece Theatre,'' ``Mystery!,''
``Arthur,'' ``Zoom,'' ``Between the Lions,'' ``Frontline,'' ``This
Old House,'' ``Victory Garden,'' ``P.O.V.,'' and ``The New Yankee
Workshop.''
</P>
<P>
   WGBH's hegemony over public television is no accident, but
rather the product of a carefully crafted strategy over the past
two decades to identify gaps in the PBS lineup and fill them. With
shrewd program development, WGBH established a twofold niche for
itself: as a producer of serious documentaries (enabling the
station to ride, and to some extent create, growing public interest
in history and medicine), and as a producer of children's
programs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A new strategy &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WGBH president Henry Becton says the station embarked on ``a
deliberate strategy to build up a competence in children's
programming'' a dozen years ago because ``when we looked around the
(PBS) landscape, there hadn't been anything new for quite a
while.'' For the same reason, the station moved full throttle into
documentaries in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we're opportunistic,'' says Peter McGhee, vice
president of national programs and a key architect of the strategy.
``If we see an opportunity, we go after it.'' Over time, that
opportunism paid off in an increasing share of the PBS schedule.
``We had a track record,'' says McGhee. ``We kept the promises we
made, and people came to believe in the promises we made.''
</P>
<P>
   The cachet and clout WGBH enjoys come in handy when the station
is pushing a new show. For instance, when WGBH first proposed an
American version of the BBC's ``Antiques Roadshow,'' PBS executives
said it should be a half-hour afternoon show. ``We said, `No, no,
you don't understand. This is a prime-time show that has to run an
hour,' '' recalls McGee.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH won that argument, and ``Antiques Roadshow'' is now
consistently the top-rated program on PBS, so popular that in May,
four episodes of the show (including a rerun) drew larger audiences
than any other PBS program. Similarly, when WGBH first proposed
``Arthur'' in the mid-1990s, some at PBS balked at the idea of an
animated program rather than the live-action or puppet-based shows
with which PBS's children's fare was identified. WGBH prevailed,
and ``Arthur'' has been the highest-rated children's program on PBS
_ and one of the most popular on television, period.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, none of the WGBH programs on PBS originated with a
request for a new show in a particular genre from PBS. In each
case, according to McGhee, WGBH brought the idea to PBS after
developing it on its own (either original, as with ``Zoom,'' or
derived from an existing show, as with ``Antiques Roadshow''),
after hooking up with a foreign production partner (as with
``Masterpiece Theatre'' and ``Mystery!''), or after acquiring the
show. The station receives around $40 million per year from PBS to
pay the costs of national production, and raises the rest from
outside funders.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH's omnipresence does not always endear it to the other 345
PBS stations, some of which would like a piece of the national
programming action themselves, or a chance to air more local
programs rather than be tied to a WGBH-dominated schedule. ``We
take such a big piece of the pie that it's politically
uncomfortable for PBS,'' admits McGhee.
</P>
<P>
   Hoynes says WGBH ``makes use of a great deal of the resources
within public television, which makes it contradictory.'' Eugene
Williams, general manager of KTWU in Topeka, says that while
``there are a lot of great shows that come out of'' WGBH, there is
``a lot of truth'' to assertions that smaller stations feel there
is too much dominance of the schedule by a handful of large
stations. ``The resources seem to be more available to the stations
in the larger markets for them to go out and secure programming,''
he says. &QL;

RUDY! 
An Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani 
By Wayne Barrett. Basic Books. 498 pp. Illustrated. $26. 
 
 
RUDY GIULIANI 
Emperor of the City 
By Andrew Kirtzman. Morrow. 333 pp. $25. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the authors of these two biographies signed their
contracts, it was assumed that their protagonist, Rudy Giuliani,
would by now be well into the nation's hottest Senate race _ the
feisty and famous mayor of New York vs. the first lady of the
United States _ and that their printed revelations might alter the
course of the election.
</P>
<P>
   Best-laid plans, and all that. In May, facing health and marital
crises, Giuliani pulled out of the race; the authors rapidly
rewrote their last chapters; and the publishers moved up the
release dates, fearing that, before too long, the public might lose
interest in the man altogether.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a shame, were that to happen. Giuliani remains one
of the most fascinating figures in politics; the much-touted
revival of New York City under his watch is one of the remarkable
sagas in urban America; and these books offer compelling, if often
conflicting, accounts of both.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Barrett's ``Rudy!'' has made the bigger splash, thanks to
an excerpt in the Village Voice _ for which he has long been chief
political reporter _ revealing that the great crime fighter's
father was a Mafia thug who did time in Sing Sing. It's an amazing
tale, and it says much for Barrett's peerless investigative prowess
that Giuliani has been in the public eye for 20 years _ many of
them in law enforcement, as the number-three man in President
Reagan's Justice Department, then as the US aattorney in Manhattan
_ and yet, till now, this dimension of his background has never
been rumored, much less known.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani's childhood takes up only a couple of chapters in
this tome. The rest amounts to a detailed dissection of his entire
life _ personal and professional _ and a wholesale assault on every
positive claim that comprises his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   As he admits up front, Barrett has a peculiar history with his
subject. The two were friendly in the 1980s, when Giuliani was
prosecuting mobsters and corrupt politicians; Barrett's book about
the scandals of Ed Koch's mayoralty, ``City for Sale,'' portrayed
Giuliani as the unabashed hero. Then, when Giuliani entered
politics and reversed his stands on so many issues, Barrett _ a
deeply moral journalist _ became his chief antagonist.
</P>
<P>
   There is a venom to this book. Rudy's whole life is summed up as
``a mesh of half-truths, double agendas and secrets . . . his
family life a fraud, his achievements a boast, his integrity a
whim, his judgment a memory . . . his beliefs a mirage.'' Barrett
paints Giuliani as a hollow man who has switched principles,
throughout his career, strictly to advance his ambition. The last
chapter _ detailing the backroom deals and cronyism of the man who
once opposed the mildest forms of patronage _ is as disheartening
as anything written about city politics. The accounts of his
brutality against anyone who dares betray him, or steal his
limelight, are full of meaty new morsels.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a way like Rudy himself, Barrett goes too far in his
prosecutorial zeal. He's loath to give Giuliani credit for anything
_ especially for the main source of his acclaim, the slashing of
New York's crime rate. Barrett argues that (a) crime didn't really
drop that much and (b) if it did, Giuliani's predecessor, David
Dinkins, deserves more accolades.
</P>
<P>
   He correctly points out that crime started to come down under
Dinkins, but overlooks that crime fell faster the first year of
Giuliani's reign than in all of Dinkins's years combined. Barrett
argues that crime was falling in cities across the country, with
New York just part of the trend. But 18 months into Giuliani's
first term, crime nationwide was down 1 percent, while in New York
it was down 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's attempt to deconstruct the New York Police
Department's crime statistics, while intriguing, is sometimes
beside the point. For instance, he muses on possible manipulations
in the data on arrests for felonious assaults, but ignores that the
incidence of such assaults fell by more than a third.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the numbers, he understates the fear of crime, once so
prevalent and now nearly evaporated. (As Andrew Kirtzman notes, the
word ``mugging,'' once ``a staple of daily conversation,'' has
fallen ``into disuse.'') One cause of this decline, surely, is
Giuliani's crackdown on ``quality of life'' crimes _ the open-air
drug deals, the aggressive panhandling, the thievery, and public
urinating that made daily life in the city so fatiguing.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologist Fred Siegel, in his book ``The Future Once Happened
Here''(which Kirtzman cites as a model), recounts that in 1993, a
TV interviewer told Dinkins that she had moved out of the city, fed
up with the fear. ``Sorry you left us,'' the then-mayor replied, on
camera. ``Sorrier still that we can't raise your personal income
tax.''
</P>
<P>
   That sums up the indifference that Dinkins conveyed, and
explains much of why Giuliani beat him later that year. Barrett
states Dinkins lost solely because he was black. He paints a tawdry
picture of Giuliani playing the race card in that election, and it
was certainly a factor. But one could as easily argue that, with
his record, Dinkins might have lost by a still larger margin had he
been white (and thus not attracted nearly every black voter and
many white liberals who felt too guilty to boot out the city's
first black mayor).
</P>
<P>
   Barrett cannot bring himself to admit that Giuliani was popular
in his first term. He derides as a media myth the idea that
Giuliani's 1997 reelection victory was a ``landslide,'' noting that
he won 172,000 fewer votes than he had four years earlier. He does
not note that Giuliani defeated his opponent, Ruth Messinger, by a
16-point margin _ a landslide by any definition _ or that one
reason for the low turnout was that many people figured, from
preelection polls, that Giuliani was so far ahead, there was no
point to voting.
</P>
<P>
   Where Barrett gives the mayor too little credit, Kirtzman, in
his book, ``Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City,'' gives him too
much. He repeats the fictions _ which Barrett properly debunks _
that Rudy scrubbed graffiti off the subways (that era ended in
1989, four years before he became mayor), got rid of the squeegie
men (Dinkins did that in his final days), and signed the contract
with Disney that revitalized Times Square (ditto).
</P>
<P>
   If journalism is the first draft of history, Kirtzman _ a
political reporter for New York 1, the city's all-news cable
channel _ has written a second draft: a solid condensation of what
the New York media have reported the past six years, plus a few
interesting new details, but little that would alter anyone's
outlook. One notable exception is his account of how Al Sharpton
came to control the protests over the police-killing of Amadou
Diallo _ including an eye-opening explanation of why Diallo's
mother spurned Giuliani's efforts to contact her.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Barrett delivers more startling revelations, Kirtzman
recognizes the city's sorry state, and Dinkins's clueless response,
as the basic context for Giuliani's rise and, at least initially,
his appeal. As late as 1997, even a majority of blacks approved how
he was handling his job; 20 percent of them voted for his
reelection, a stunning figure for any New York Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Kirtzman also treats more seriously the role of the Manhattan
Institute, especially George Kelling's theory of ``broken
windows,'' in shaping Giuliani's views on the links between crime
and public disorder. Barrett dismisses these ideas as ``trendy''
and the mayor's adoption of them as mere opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, both authors view Giuliani as a tragic figure, done
in by his own arrogance and insularity. Kirtzman sees him as a man
of ``strength, resolve and vision'' whose tragedy is that ``he
could have accomplished so much more.'' Barrett sees him as a
pretender who never had a clear idea of what he wanted besides
power. A full picture requires reading both.

WATER 
The Fate of Our Most Precious Resource 
By Marq de Villiers. Houghton Mifflin. 288 pp. $26. 
 
 
LIFE'S MATRIX 
A Biography of Water 
By Philip Ball. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. 417 pp. Illustrated. $25. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not hard to understand why humanity, especially in the
developed world, sees water as ubiquitous and eternal. It covers
most of the planet. It has existed for at least 3.8 billion years,
emerging less than a billion years after the planet was formed, and
well before anything resembling people turned up, at most a mere 6
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And it has imbued humanity like nothing else, physically
sustaining life, but also in the last several thousand years
orienting every aspect of human endeavor and expression, from
science to philosophy to art. How could it not be everywhere and
always?
</P>
<P>
   But the world is running out of water, thanks to humanity
itself. We have devised the technology to pump water at a rate
faster than can be sustained to serve an increasingly urbanized and
industrialized population that is itself growing at a stunning pace
and polluting all the way. There were 3 billion people on the
planet in 1970. There are 6 billion now. There will be more than 9
billion by 2050, when the population is expected to crest.
</P>
<P>
   In very different, equally informative, but ultimately
problematic books, Marq de Villiers and Philip Ball strive to show
how imperiled water has become. Ball takes a more scientific
approach in ``Life's Matrix,'' while de Villiers takes a more
journalistic approach in ``Water.'' But both seek to send roughly
the same message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble with water _ and there is trouble with water _ is
that they're not making any more of it,'' writes de Villiers, a
former editor and publisher of Toronto Life and author of six
books. ``They're not making any less, mind, but no more either.
There is the same amount of water on the planet now as there was in
prehistoric times. People, however, they're making more of _ many
more, far more than is ecologically sensible _ and all those people
are utterly dependent on water for their lives (humans consist
mostly of water), for their livelihoods, their food, and
increasingly, their industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a survey of the global crisis, touching on hot spots
from the plummeting Dead Sea to the expanding Sahara Desert, de
Villiers discusses the concepts behind, history of, and problems
with water, from contamination, to irrigation, to desertification.
He then begins a series of case studies, taking him to such exotic
places as the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in the Middle East and
the Nile River in Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt, focusing on the
mounting political tensions over water bringing these regions to
the brink of war. He then offers solutions: developing new water
supplies; conserving existing supplies; curbing population. None is
especially convincing, even to him.
</P>
<P>
   Ball, a consulting editor for Nature and author of three books,
spends much of his time exploring water's physical, chemical, and
biological characteristics, as understood now and through history.
In a jarring shift, he then examines some recent, bizarre theories
scientists have offered on water, like the supposed discovery of
cold fusion in 1989. He does so ostensibly to show that water in
its ubiquity and mystery unfortunately lends itself to such folly,
but he seems more intent on attacking what he considers colloquial
science. In yet another shift, he surveys some of the threats
facing water in a short and less than compelling epilogue, one that
seems almost an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``With future increases in population, industry, and
agriculture, things will get worse,'' Ball writes at the epilogue's
start. ``UNESCO predicts a serious worldwide shortage by around
2020, which is consistent with the figures quoted earlier. The
implications for human health and for political stability are
immense. Determining where the problems arise, considering what
might be done about them, and anticipating what might happen if we
ignore them _ these are issues that lie outside a survey of the
science of water. But it seems fitting, indeed essential, to
conclude water's scientific biography with a coda that looks at the
aspect of water that none of us can ignore: we all need it, yet it
is getting scarcer, per capita, by the day.''
</P>
<P>
   What is most problematic in both books is a fatal presumption
each author makes about his readers _ a presumption of alliance by
de Villiers, and of interest by Ball. De Villiers's sarcasm, even
cynicism, toward the environmentalists, scientists, journalists,
government officials, and others on whom he reports assumes the
reader feels the same way, and so fails to let the reader decide
for himself on the veracity of the reporting. It is an assumption
that undermines de Villiers's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the diverse opinion over the years on climate
change, de Villiers goes so far as to presume an ``us'' _ author
and reader. ``So either the world's scientists, as synchronized as
a school of fish, are darting hither and yon in overreacting to the
latest ambiguous data, or they aren't nearly as unanimous as the
media reports, politicians, and Greens would like us to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of Ball's intent to elevate the subject of water to
artful biography _ sprinkling his narrative with quotes from Kurt
Vonnegut and Gaston Bachelard, for instance, to evoke literary and
philosophical allusion _ he has by and large written a textbook. It
examines in the driest imaginable terms topics from cloud formation
to cell structure. It lacks even the elegance of history of
science, in that much of the discussion of water through the ages
lacks cultural context. Rather, it is generally what luminaries
from Descartes to Da Vinci asserted in a purely conceptual way
about water. And it is not enough to sustain interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``A plant's vascular system can be regarded as a bundle of tubes
divided at each juncture into smaller bundles,'' Ball writes.
``These tubes are long cylindrical cells joined end to end, either
open or with sieve-like caps. In contrast to the human
blood-circulation system. . . .'' Such dead prose limits Ball's
readers to devotees of the physical, chemical, and biological
nature of water, or requires them to convert. It is elitism of
sorts _ underscored by his views of scientists who do not, in his
opinion, practice the profession as rigorously as they should _
that is no less undermining.

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
!!!! ``Chuck &AMP; Buck'' One of the year's most original and merciful
films. Mike White is unforgettable as geeky Buck, whose life went
on hold during preadolescence, and Paul Weitz neatly covers a few
complex bases as the now-grown Chuck, who isn't thrilled to see
Buck when the latter tracks him down in LA after years of
non-communication. The film is by turns creepy, funny, moving _ and
never predictable. (R) 
 
!! 1/2 ``The In Crowd'' As formulaic, teen-targeted thrillers go,
``The In Crowd'' is entirely harmless and, on occasion, genuinely
amusing. The clothes are terrific, the beach is a gas, and
archetypal characters abound: the evil clique leader, her passive
sidekick, a clueless hunk, and the innocent victim. Tension builds,
barely, and then justice is done. (PG-13) (Joan Anderman) 
 
!! 1/2 ``Loser'' Mena Suvari and Jason Biggs entrench themselves on
the acting A list. They play misfit coeds at a college very much
like NYU in Amy Heckerling's comedy about nice kids trying to
survive their own innocence. In Suvari's case, there's also Greg
Kinnear's exploitative prof; in Biggs's, three slick sleazoid
roommates. Predictable, but it goes down smoothly enough. (PG-13) 
 
!!! ``Set Me Free'' Lea Pool's rich semi-autobiographical
coming-of-age story, set in Montreal, is powered by Karine
Vanasse's luminous performance as a 13-year-old girl trying to
steer a course between a misfit father and an ailing mother. Her
support system consists of a simpatico brother, an understanding
teacher, and a generous girlfriend. (Unrated) 
 
!!! ``Shower'' In Zhang Yang's tender, humane film, a hard-driving
Chinese yuppie backs up a few steps and reconnects with the
important things in life when he's called home to look in on his
ailing father, who runs a bathhouse-cum-community center in
Beijing. The prodigal who didn't realize he was one undergoes a
spiritual cleansing when he's plunged back into a way of life he
thought he had outgrown. (PG-13) 
 
!! ``What Lies Beneath'' Michelle Pfeiffer, Harrison Ford, and
director Robert Zemeckis never really get comfortable. It should
have been a slick screamfest about a wife (Pfeiffer) who sees dead
people, including a woman her geneticist husband (Ford) slept with.
Instead, it plays like a lame Hitchcock spinoff, more cerebral than
primal. (PG-13)

'N SYNC REMAINS TRUE TO ITS PURPOSE OF BRINGING JOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear 'N Sync,
</P>
<P>
   I totally understand that you haven't had time to respond to the
letter I wrote after seeing your concert at the Tweeter Center last
summer. I bet you guys have had a super-busy year, what with
selling a record-shattering 2.4 million copies of your new album,
``No Strings Attached,'' its first week out, rehearsing for a major
stadium tour, and deflecting rumors about Justin and Britney
getting engaged.
</P>
<P>
   All your hard work showed on Saturday at Foxboro, and so did the
work of your voice coaches, choreographers, special-effects
designers, fireworks engineer, scenic artists, videographers,
lighting technicians, and Regis Philbin _ who filmed a re-creation
of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' with Lance in the hot seat
answering a question about Pokemon. Some people say your
connect-the-dots pop tunes cater to the lowest common denominator,
but asking the audience to be Lance's last lifeline showed how much
you respect your fans' intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The glitzy production values paled in comparison to your
deepening sense of symbolism and irony, though. At last year's show
you were airlifted high over the audience during the finale _
innocent young men reaching for the stars. A mere 12 months later,
you descended from the heavens at the very start, like deities
bestowing a visit on the devout. Your canny self-knowledge is a
real thrill. And the song from ``Pinocchio'' that was playing made
us realize that the free-spirited mavericks in 'N Sync have got no
strings to hold them down, either.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the entire show has been retooled to emphasize the
whole amazing idea of 'N Sync instead of just the plain old music
of 'N Sync. Turning the interactive MTV show ``Total Request Live''
into Total 'N Sync Live _ complete with an appearance by VJ Ananda
Lewis and running ticker-tape comments from fans like ``Justin is
such a hottie'' and `` 'N Sync is da bomb'' during ``Tearin' Up My
Heart'' _ reminded us of how popular you guys are. And the cozy
living room set you lounged on during ``Drive Myself Crazy'' was a
dream come true. I bet all the girls have thought about curling up
with one or more of you guys on a sofa.
</P>
<P>
   Your fashion sense is evolving, too. Chris has traded his wacky
dreadlocks for weird makeup, and Justin wore sequin-encrusted
bandanas over his mass of blond curls _ the sight of which on the
night's one scarfless song seemed to strike much of the audience
(if shrieking is any indication) as just as poignant and moving as
the song itself, ``It's Gonna Be Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, telling the audience when to scream seemed a
little beside the point because everyone was screaming the whole
time anyway. And it sort of made you guys seem sort of bossy, which
obviously isn't true because the gentle and beautiful ``I Thought
She Knew'' let us see your vulnerability and true inner sweetness.
Plus, when you journeyed over the crowd on that moving metal
platform during ``This I Promise You'' and poured water that might
have touched your lips from your plastic cups onto our heads . . .
well, baptism is one word that comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   You may be teen idols, but don't let anyone call you false gods.
You guys are nothing if not true to your purpose of bringing joy to
the hearts of girls everywhere. If a little product is moved in the
bargain, so be it. Hire a few more choreographers and effects
designers, and see you next summer.
</P>
<P>

LOVE, JOAN &QL;

THE BASIC INSTINCTS OF JOE ESZTERHAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ On yet another perfect day on Point Dume, the
beach-hugging community that Streisand, Dylan, and a host of other
members of the entertainment elite call home, the Eszterhas
admiration society was in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi, Joe was saying, was his all _ his typist, his sounding
board, his moon, his stars, his sun. Make that sunlight, which is
how he describes his wife in the dedication to ``American
Rhapsody,'' the hotly awaited book that mixes fact and fiction to
mess with the reader's memory of Bill Clinton's dalliance with
Monica Lewinsky and 50 years of political history.
</P>
<P>
   Joe in turn, was serious, insightful, certain his 1960s-inspired
take would turn conventional wisdom on its head, Naomi said. He
was, in fact, such a brilliant writer-thinker that she found
herself pitying the president of the United States' penis. Known
throughout the 432-page tome as ``Willard,'' the appendage is as
integral a part of the plot as Linda Tripp or Kenneth Starr. He/it
even merits his/its own chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He so personified him that by the time you get there, you've
heard about what Willard likes and what Willard's done and who he's
done it with,'' said Naomi, due to give birth soon to her and Joe's
fourth son. ``I said to Joe, `This is ridiculous, I'm feeling sorry
for a penis. You've really humanized an inanimate object, for lack
of a better word.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The pet name Willard, allegedly created by the commander in
chief, was supplied by Gennifer Flowers, whose book on her
involvement with Clinton represented just a small part of the
copious research Eszterhas said he did in preparing to write
``American Rhapsody.'' There were scores of other sources, from
biographies of every celebrity he mentions in the book (and there
are plenty) to each of the footnotes in the Starr Report. Then
there was the TV, to which the Hollywood screenwriter behind
``Basic Instinct'' and ``Showgirls'' stayed glued from the start of
the scandal to the conclusion of the impeachment hearings,
sometimes putting in entire days on the couch, often having to be
told by his wife to come to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Legal pads covered with longhand aside, Eszterhas said, he
didn't set out to write a book. He just couldn't put down the
remote, couldn't turn off Geraldo or Larry or any cable channel
where the conversation kept coming back to Clinton and the former
White House intern. Only later, when it was all over, did he
realize he wanted to offer up his take to a nation already
inundated with books by many other participants and observers of
the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Riveted by the drama
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched every day, 24 hours a day, and at times I felt
totally grizzled, red-eyed, obsessed,'' said Eszterhas, who twice
voted for Clinton. ``Just the pure theater of it, the drama, all of
the human elements. This was not a policy-wonk crisis. This was a
psychosexual crisis, and that drama absolutely gripped me.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, released by Knopf last week with an initial print
run of 200,000 hardback copies, is a book that purports to get at a
greater truth by climbing inside the heads of numerous characters,
among them John McCain, George Bush, and Hillary Clinton, whose
made-up monologue is a particular pride of Eszterhas's. In this
world, Ken Starr lusts after Gennifer Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Eszterhas defended his approach by stressing that the author's
note clearly identifies the chapters based on research (those in
standard typeface and written by the man responsible for movies
such as ``Music Box'') and the ones born in his imagination (those
in boldface and written by what the note describes as his alter
ego, ``the twisted little man inside me'' whose other movies are
drenched in sex). Yet the claim that Democratic political
consultant James Carville is gonzo journalist Hunter Thompson's
``bastard brother'' appears in plain old type. Even Naomi conceded
it can get confusing. For his part, Eszterhas said he enjoyed
playing literary hoaxster a la Mark Twain, a pose enabled by the
book's lack of footnotes or bibliography.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a Hollywood book,'' said Eszterhas, who lamented the
pre-publication focus on his dish about celebrities and Hollywood
insiders. ``It's a book about our values, our society, a
generation's view of itself. . . . I don't presume to speak for the
American people. I speak for people who grew up in the '60s, and I
think I have that absolute right because I grew up in that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Eszterhas's '60s and early '70s were wild, to put it mildly. A
Hungarian native who grew up in Cleveland, he left newspapering to
become a writer for Rolling Stone. Soon he was living the rock-star
life by proxy: drugs, sex, drugs, sex, drugs. But he outgrew it, he
said, while Clinton still wants to be Mick Jagger cutting a swath
through his groupies. In person and in print, he made clear that he
believed the women in Clinton's past, from Flowers to Lewinsky to
others whose names are not as well known. He also made clear he
felt they were used if not sexually abused by the president.
</P>
<P>
   As Eszterhas, 55, put it, ``I have a theory that most of the men
in my generation, no matter what we ended up being, wanted to be
rock 'n' roll stars. Some of us have outgrown that and we've
matured and realized our own humanity. (Clinton) doesn't seem to
have done that. He seems to be as controlled by his Willard as he
was when he was 12 years old.''
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some might say that Eszsterhas's use of the Mick Jagger analogy
is throwing stones. Eszterhas himself, after all, is no stranger to
scandal. He starred in one that went something like this: During
the filming of ``Basic Instinct,'' actress Sharon Stone began an
affair with producer Bill MacDonald, who was married to Naomi
MacDonald at the time. Eszterhas, who also has two grown children,
then separated from his wife of 25 years and went on to woo Naomi,
now his sunlight. Stone later dumped the producer.
</P>
<P>
   These days the Eszterhases seem like any couple, albeit one with
a housekeeper to fetch drinks and a nanny to romp with the three
boys and limos to deliver them to events. Filled with oversize art,
bookshelves overflowing with leather-bound scripts and
videocassettes, and pale green furniture with a Native American
motif, the main room of their house says family more than fame.
Photographs of the children are on almost every shelf and wall,
along with mementos of Eszterhas's rock 'n' roll past and one
(unflattering) picture of Stone above a nasty headline.
</P>
<P>
   Still, hints of a Hollywood-size ego were evident. Eszterhas
clearly feels his retelling of oft-told facts was masterful. He
related the reactions of people who called ``American Rhapsody''
genius. He dropped names, mentioning that the enormous bouquet in
the kitchen was from a studio head wishing him well and that editor
Tina Brown had thrown him a party for ``300 of Hollywood's heaviest
people'' to celebrate Talk's excerpt of ``American Rhapsody.'' He
said he expects the Clintons to read his book and that the
president will laugh at parts, be outraged at others.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Eszterhas's mountain-man looks, flowing hair, and full
beard, the bear of a reputation that precedes him was mostly in
hibernation. At times, he even seemed the slightest bit worried
that ``American Rhapsody'' will be held up to ridicule and that his
lifetime love of politics will be lost on readers, that they will
see the book as outrageous rather than outrageously funny at times,
as smutty rather than sexually revealing.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, he said he just wants to return to scriptwriting
and head to Maui with the family after Naomi gives birth next
month. One movie he won't be making, however, is ``American
Rhapsody.'' He said he put all of his creativity into it already,
although he doesn't rule it out for another, perhaps quirkier
screenwriter. But the tale may be too unbelievable for the big
screen, according to the man who had a hand in ``Flashdance,'' in
which a young woman welds steel by day and dances provocatively by
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be impossible for (the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal) to
be a script,'' Eszterhas said. ``They would have said, `Nah, it's
not believable. How is it possible the president of the United
States could have this kind of relationship with Monica Lewinsky?'
Some good script doctor would have said, `Rewrite, rewrite,
rewrite.' ''

DICAPRIO FLOPS; ALMODOVAR DEMONSTRATES HIS MASTERY

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``The Beach'' _ Leonardo DiCaprio's career hit the
sand like a disoriented whale in this bloated mix of mystery and
sex. Maybe he should stay out of the sea and sun for a while; he's
in danger of sinking faster than the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``All About My Mother'' _ Spanish director Pedro Almodovar's
mastery of the medium can't be denied. He has one particular shot
in this melodramatic tale of Oedipal desire that's as good as
anything you'll ever see on-screen. The winner of the Academy Award
for best picture in a foreign language has English subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo'' _ When a comedy lowers the bar as
low as this one and still isn't funny, you know there's trouble.
Rob Schneider makes you pray for the return of the brazen
mediocrity of Adam Sandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mansfield Park'' _ Director Patricia Rozema transforms the
grace and artistic innuendo of novelist Jane Austen into a
cinematic screed marked by bland performances from Frances O'Connor
and playwright Harold Pinter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beethoven's 3rd'' _ You didn't miss this one in the theaters;
it just never opened. Judge Reinhold, whose career has spiraled
downhill ever since ``Home Alone,'' stars in the direct-to-video
installment of the St. Bernard series. It's a real bow-wow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moon Over Broadway'' _ Those fans who saw the pre-Broadway
Boston run of Ken Ludwig's play ``Moon Over Buffalo'' might get a
real kick out of this 1998 documentary produced and directed by D.
A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus. It's a great idea, and the play's
stars, Philip Bosco and Carol Burnett, granted the filmmakers full
access. The DVD includes additional forthright commentary from the
principals, explaining why the play ultimately failed. The
filmmakers capture some backstage fireworks, but, given the
volatile personalities and the play's problems, the
behind-the-scenes battling might have been more explosive than what
we see.

A PORTRAIT OF HARRY STEIN, FROM LEFT TO RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
HOW I ACCIDENTALLY JOINED THE VAST RIGHT-WING CONSPIRACY 
(And Found Inner Peace) 
By Harry Stein 
Delacorte, 274 pp., $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry Stein used to possess what he calls ``impeccable liberal
credentials.'' Then his first child was born, and he took a turn to
the right. His experience is far from uncommon: Some people call it
``growing up.'' But reading ``How I Accidentally Joined the Vast
Right-Wing Conspiracy (And Found Inner Peace),'' I had the
impression that the author must be the only person in the world who
has ever ever produced a kid and then turned conservative. He
criticizes his contemporaries for being narcissistic, but he's
Exhibit A.
</P>
<P>
   Any review of this book is bound to seem superfluous, since
Stein has done such a swell job of reviewing it himself, devoting a
chapter to imagining the overheated pans his book will get in
liberal publications (`` `A mishmash of bitterness, ideological
gibberish and frenzied self-justification.' _ New York Times'').
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a real review in The New York Times Book Review was
brief but flattering, which must have vexed Stein, whose proudest
moments, apart from the paternal, seem to occur when liberals are
calling him a fascist. He fondly describes the first time someone
flung the F-word at him, when he dared to defend Dan Quayle's
``Murphy Brown Speech.'' He fell back, he writes, ``on a lifetime's
worth of my own moral superiority,'' and asked, quietly, in the
manner of one of his early (liberal) heroes, Joseph Welch, ``That's
how you argue? By calling me names?''
</P>
<P>
   Stein used to write a column called ``Ethics'' for Esquire. To
give the devil his due, as my dear mother would say, he's a funny
writer. He's perceptive and amusing about the excesses of political
correctness in schools and universities, about the media's
left-wing bias, and about moral relativism, among other subjects. I
found his take on feminism (``A movement that, since the
achievement of equality, has poisoned the culture by a relentless
war on nature'') totally nuts, but it got my dander up. So did some
of his humor, so-called, like these lines from a list ``How to Tell
You've Joined the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Black history month seems to last from February to July.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's going on about how fantastic San Francisco is, and
it suddenly hits you that's the one place on earth you never want
to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein lambastes liberals for intellectual dishonesty. He has his
own collection of cheap tricks. One example: He thinks a voting
test might be a good idea, arguing that most women are too
uninformed and emotional to be trusted with decisions about
government. (Is he joking? I don't think so.) As evidence, he
writes about an unnamed female ``friend'' who is a nice person but
doesn't keep up with the news. To bolster his argument, he provides
a list of 14 schmaltzy movies that were shown during one week on
Lifetime, ``the network for women.'' (Would a list of programs on
ESPN2 suffice to prove that men are too uninformed to vote? Or
would we have to produce the World Wrestling Federation schedule?)
</P>
<P>
   Since his book is an ideological autobiography, I guess it's
fair to review the author. Stein comes across as something of a
jerk. How big a jerk? In a coy attempt to establish his credentials
as a veteran of the sexual revolution, he devotes a chapter to
listing the women he slept with in the 1960s and '70s. His wife,
Priscilla, advised him to drop it. ``Pathetic'' was her word for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Priscilla is responsible for his turn to the right, having
introduced him to ``the universe of kids.'' She had been a liberal
too, but even before they met she had begun to question the wisdom
of her involvement with a group called Women Against Right-Wing
Scum.
</P>
<P>
   When the first of their two children was born, Stein was stunned
by his wife's decision to quit her job and stay at home. Having
assumed that ``babies were basically slightly more animate
shrubs,'' he was surprised by his own response to his daughter (``I
couldn't believe how fascinating this tiny being was''). Before
long he was reading conservative magazines, making new friends
``wiser than most I've left behind.'' These friends had also been
pushed to the right by parenthood and were committed to raising
their kids right, unlike all the liberals who ``by the millions''
have been ``neglecting'' their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``How I Accidentally Joined the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy''
appears to be aimed at readers who have made a transition from
liberal to conservative. So why does Stein keep prefacing his
opinions with phrases such as, ``Please don't get me wrong. . . .''
and ``Excuse me, but . . .''? These are not serious apologies,
obviously. But if, as he writes, one of the big advantages of being
a conservative is that you don't have to apologize, why does he
keep apologizing? And who is he apologizing to?
</P>
<P>
   If it's this reader, I accept. Just don't do it again. Please.

IT'S COOKS AGAINST THE OFFENSIVE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ A few years ago former San Francisco 49er
Dana Stubblefield combined eloquence and indulgence when he came to
the aid of a baffled cafeteria worker, who didn't know how to fit a
slab of ribs, three chicken breasts and two fish fillets onto a
single plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all going to the same place,'' he said. ``Pile it on.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are in training camp on the campus of the University
of the Pacific. And as usual, one of the most awesome sights in
camp is not Jerry Rice putting the moves on a rookie cornerback,
but the training table _ tables, really, several of them _ groaning
under the load of food intended to satisfy more than 80 hungry
football players, many in the 280-to-320-pound range.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlike anything most people have seen. Consider the dinner
menu one night this past week. New York steaks, ribs and chicken
breasts cooking on an outdoor grill. Hamburgers and turkey burgers
sizzling on an indoor grill. Nearby, a wok turned out cashew
chicken, stir-fried vegetables and chow mein.
</P>
<P>
   Want more? Try baked potatoes, rice pilaf, fresh vegetables,
potato salad, a green salad bar with 20 items such as peas, beets,
cheese and hard-boiled eggs, along with a selection of fresh fruit,
a deli bar with the fixings for sandwiches _ turkey, ham, roast
beef and cheese, and a pasta bar featuring Alfredo and marina
sauce, along with fresh baked bread sticks. The desert table held
peach cobbler and chocolate cake, each piece topped with a cherry.
</P>
<P>
   Is there no end?
</P>
<P>
   ``I took out the ice cream,'' said Richard Gleason, who runs the
food service operation at the University of the Pacific. ``They
just weren't eating it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh really? No room for a little dish of ice cream after feasting
off the above menu?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Gleason subbed frozen yogurt because the players were
avoiding high-fat ice cream. And that's the key to surviving the
training table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to eat as healthy as I can,'' said Dave Fiore, a
295-pound offensive tackle. That means trying to stay away from
foods with a high fat content. At dinner, Fiore had ``a couple
steaks, four or five chicken breasts and lots of vegetables and
rice.''
</P>
<P>
   And here comes what should be the killer for most normal people.
``It's hard not to lose weight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiore, recovering from knee surgery, isn't even taking part in
the two-a-day practices yet. He's rehabbing the knee _ doing lots
of cardiovascular work, weight lifting and special drills.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Deese, another offensive tackle, is taking part in both
daily practices. He lost eight pounds last Wednesday, gained three
back by the next morning, then lost seven pounds Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made him eat and drink,'' coach Steve Mariucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Over-eating usually isn't a problem in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Barnes, the team's strength development coordinator, turns
to the precise language of his craft to explain how these behemoths
manage to gorge and still lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes more caloric expenditure to move 300 pounds from
Point A to Point B,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said Fiore was the biggest eater on the team, yet he
always battles to keep weight on. Barnes said it's a common problem
on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can go overboard,'' he said of the
breakfast, lunch and dinner-time trips to the training table.
``With two-a-day practices they're putting out more calories than
they're taking in.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said the team did insist on a ``well-rounded training
table,'' with a healthy representation of the basic food groups _
foods such as no-fat dairy products, lean cuts of meat, whole wheat
grains and fresh fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Greg Clark, 251 pounds, said he is careful in his food
selection. ``You have to eat the right way,'' he said. ``I stay
away from the pizza, fried chicken and ice cream. You get in
trouble with that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pizza? Yes, that's one of the daily fixtures at lunch. Along
with _ on a recent day _ two entrees, such as Philly cheese steak
and chicken strips, roasted potato wedges, spicy beans and
sausages, fried rice, French fries, broccoli and corn. Plus the
usual hamburger grill, salad bar, pasta bar and desert bar.
</P>
<P>
   The breakfast menu is equally diverse with French toast, Belgium
waffles, western scrambles, biscuits and gravy, grits, oatmeal,
corn beef hash, breakfast burritos, hash browns, fruits and
berries, 10 varieties of cereal, Danish, biscuits, donuts and
yogurt. Gleason also offers eggs made to order. ``Many of them will
order five or six cooked the way they like, and many now will ask
for just the egg whites.''
</P>
<P>
   Gleason said not everyone digs in with gusto. He described Rice
and retired quarterback Steve Young as ``finicky eaters who often
would just have salad and cottage cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   The team doesn't have many of those. In planning the menus,
Gleason figures 1 1/2 to two portions for each person. And that
average is skewered because the training table serves as many
``normal eaters'' _ coaches, office workers, support people,
writers and visitors _ as it does football players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eating is really important,'' Fiore said. ``That's how you
replenish yourself.''

   MIDEAST-SUMMIT _ THURMONT, Md. _ Spot coverage as President
Clinton, who returned from the G8 summit in Okinawa Sunday, rejoins
the final status peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians at

to reconcile some 52 years of enmity and agreement on issues
ranging from a Palestinian state to sovereignty over Jerusalem.

   SUMMIT-ASSESS _ THURMONT, Md. _ After two grinding weeks,
President Clinton's Mideast peace summit at nearby Camp David is
teetering somewhere between triumph and disaster. The outcome rests
on a single question: Can Clinton and his diplomats, working with
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, find a way for the two
adversaries to share the ancient city of Jerusalem? In diplomatic
terms, that translates into an unholy morass of contradictory aims
and immovable intentions. The quest for elegant solutions to
seemingly
</P>
<P>
   intractable political problems, however, is the heart and soul
of statecraft. And when Clinton speaks of his role as an honest
broker in the talks, serving up
</P>
<P>
   proposals for such a solution ? then trying to sell them to the
parties _ is precisely what he means. MAY FOLD IN DAY'S NEWS,

   ISRAEL-BEREAVED TEL AVIV _ Maybe it's not so unusual that
Israeli Yitzhak Frankenthal would know that it has been exactly

may surprise you is the company he keeps. Throughout the Camp David
peace talks, Frankenthal has hosted gatherings among Israelis who
lost family members to war and terror with Palestinians who lost
loved ones to Israeli guns. They are literally under one large tent
in a downtown plaza where Frankenthal leads the Family Forum, a
group of ``bereived'' Israelis and Palestinians showing their
support for the talks and their hope for a peace agreement.

   UNIVERSITY-RESEARCH _ WASHINGTON _ Far from ripping off the
federal government, research universities pick up between $700
milllion and $1.5 billion of the overhead costs for the $15 billion
in federal research contracts that they get each year. Those
findings from a two-year-long, congressionally mandated study _ to
be released at a briefing Monday by the Rand Corporation, a

together and takeoff and land at shorter intervals. UPS will begin
equipping its own planes with ADS-B this year, and others including
FedEx, Airborne and DHL are likely to follow by the end of 2002

   TEL AVIV, Israel _ You might expect Israeli Yitzhak Frankenthal
to know that it has been exactly 2,206 days since his son, Arik,
was killed by Hamas terrorists. But, you might be surprised by the
company he keeps.
</P>
<P>
   While peace talks have continued at Camp David, Frankenthal has
hosted gatherings that mingle Israelis who lost family members in
war and terror with Palestinians who lost loved ones to Israeli
guns.
</P>
<P>
   They are literally under one tent. It's a large one in a
downtown plaza where Frankenthal leads the Family Forum. The group
of ``bereaved'' Israelis and Palestinians are showing their support
for a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I lost Arik, I had a choice to let my feelings lead me or
let my intelligence lead me. I decided to let my brain lead me,''
Frankenthal says. ``As a father I failed. I brought a child into
the world and he did not live. But, I have four other children and
I do not want it to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, dozens of Palestinians and Israelis met to share
stories. Two young Israelis opposed to the peace talks wandered in.
</P>
<P>
   They entered a polite debate with a Palestinian who spent seven
years in Israeli jails for a bombing. No one died in the bombing
and he now supports the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenthal, heavy set with wavy gray hair topped by a gray
yarmulke, or skull cap, worked his mobile phone, smoked his pipe,
and did a live interview for Israeli television.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped outside to pray by himself, rocking back and forth,
behind the huge generator providing light and air-conditioning to
the tent. A 49-year-old religious Jew and father of a son killed by
Arabs, he is not your usual leftist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has two things that are very touching, convincing to
Israelis. He is religious and his son was killed,'' said peace
talks supporter and tent visitor Meir Meshel. ``Normally, you would
think such a man would want revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show the public here slightly in favor of the talks. But,
by local stereotypes anyway, religiously observant Jews tend to be
more opposed to the peace talks than secular Jews. Two religious
political parties dropped out of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's coalition when he departed for Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the most outspoken opponents of any peace deals with
the Palestinians have been the families of terror victims. They say
peace agreements weaken and endanger Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenthal's son Arik was a 19-year-old Israeli soldier in
1994. He was hitchhiking home from a tank training course when he
was abducted on an Israeli road by Hamas gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled and was shot three times in the head. Three of his
captors were later killed, one is in jail and another is missing.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenthal said both he and Arik wanted peace with the Arabs.
But, in the mourning period of his son's death, friends urged
Frankenthal to conclude that Arabs only understood violence.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected their position. Having just sold his business, a
radiation testing company, before Arik's death, he decided to work
full-time for peace.
</P>
<P>
   He founded the family group, which now has 120 Arab and 140
Israeli members and backing from influential Israelis. He is also a
leader of the Meimad political party, a small religious party still
in Barak's government.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Barak called the tent and spoke to Frankenthal,
trying to assure him of the efforts he was making for a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   The tent has support from other peace groups. Passersby can get
bumper stickers and make donations. In the evenings, Frankenthal
helps host town meetings, where people can talk about their lost
loved ones or why they support the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes members of the Israeli parliament show up. They sit
among Palestinian visitors, some of whom used to attack Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenthal says the important thing is that they have made the
transition to peace. The past is not forgotten, he says, it's just
not dwelled upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not forgiving anybody for murdering my son,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He neither forgives or forgets what happened, but wants to focus
on the future between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about reconciliation,'' he says. ``Reconciliation
means I am willing to go forward from where I am and they are
willing to go forward from where they are.''

THE TERMS OF PHILANTHROPY CAN BE LESS THAN ENDEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
Jack Rosenthal, former editor in chief of The New York Times
Magazine, has pinch-hit for the vacationing William Safire since
1982. 
 By JACK ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the first things that struck me when I started as
president of The New York Times Foundation this year is the
language of philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   It was probably inevitable. Years as a writer and editor at The
Times had sharpened my eye for jargon, much of it from government
and politics. It took only a few weeks of reading grant
applications from educational, cultural, social, environmental and
even journalistic groups to realize that the foundation world is
equally burdened with limp, lazy usages.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference. In grant applications, trite, trendy
or vague terms do more than glaze the reader's eye. They invite
grant denials.
</P>
<P>
   Here is our Word of the Month, from an application for a
learning center:  &UR; empowermation &LR; . Here is our Phrase of the Month,
from an educational reform organization: ``convening stakeholders
to develop action plans to promote standards reform, and initiating
implementation of those plans.'' And here is a collection of trendy
terms, drawn from our experience and that of others on both sides
of the grant-making business:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; accountability &LR; ,  &UR; bench-marking &LR; ,  &UR; challenge &LR; ,  &UR; collaborative &LR; ,
 &UR; constraints &LR; ,  &UR; cutting edge &LR; ,  &UR; extrapolate &LR; ,  &UR; integrate &LR; ,
 &UR; learnings &LR; ,  &UR; leverage &LR; ,  &UR; linkage &LR; ,  &UR; paradigm &LR; ,  &UR; parameter &LR; ,
 &UR; pro-active &LR; ,  &UR; resources &LR; ,  &UR; strategy &LR; ,  &UR; synergy &LR; ,  &UR; targeting &LR; ,
 &UR; time frame &LR; ,  &UR; zero-based &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Many of these terms are objects of comment in a booklet just
published by the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, ``In Other
Words'' (available while copies last from the foundation, 250 Park
Ave., New York, NY 10177).
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bailin, its president, having heard just about all the
ways people ask for money, sometimes finds himself recoiling from
such terms of beseechment. So he decided to do something about it,
in just the way you'd imagine a foundation executive would. He
commissioned Tony Proscio, a foundation consultant and former
editorial writer, to write a report.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Other Words'' is the result, and in it Proscio performs
skillful verbal archaeology. For instance, he traces the term
 &UR; throughput &LR;  back to industrial engineering before World War II.
``After some years of disciplined life describing the pace and
scope of work on old-fashioned assembly lines,'' he says, the word
became popular in the infant computer industry. ``But the computer
pioneers soon lost control of the word ....  &UR; Throughput &LR;  is now the
universal metaphor for any interval between the moment anything is
put into anything else and the moment it re-emerges, presumably
altered.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the same process of dilution, Proscio notes, that has
afflicted its parent words,  &UR; input &LR;  and  &UR; output &LR;  (as in ``the
family pet recently output on the living-room carpet''). En route
to being emptied of meaning altogether, terms like these become
buzzwords, Proscio says, and ``a policy paper simply isn't serious
if it doesn't include the latest exotic technical term or chic
business school phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   Excuses can be made for some jargon, some of the time. One is
the need for shorthand. Experts in community-development
corporations are surely entitled to say ``CDC'' to one another.
Likewise, it is understandable when people asking for money curry
favor by parroting back language they think foundations like.
Bailin recently instituted a funding category called ``institution
and field building.'' Soon, he says, he got back inquiries
dutifully using the term ``even though I myself wasn't entirely
sure what I meant by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Excuses aside, by using lame or impenetrable terms,
organizations that serve laudable public purposes do not advance
their chances in the competition for foundation funds _ not when
most jargon and cliches can be avoided with a little effort.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a round of applause to Chubb Insurance Co. for telling
customers: ``In this policy, we use words in their plain English
meaning. Words with special meanings are defined in the part of the
policy where they are used.''
</P>
<P>
   The offending terms cited here are hardly limited to
philanthropy. They befog language in the academy, the Pentagon, the
laboratory, the corporate office. Glazing the eye, they dissolve
into invisibility, discourage reading and defeat comprehension
completely.
</P>
<P>
   SPINICISM
</P>
<P>
   Bill Safire, the regular proprietor of this space, once
generously identified me as the coiner of the term ``spin
doctors,'' referring to faceless campaign aides who work
ceaselessly to impart favorable interpretations to their
candidates' harried pronouncements. Let me offer another neologism
to describe a related attitude that has been evolving over the last
decade and more.
</P>
<P>
   Why, as demonstrated by dismal voter turnout, has the public
become so indifferent to government, politics and public life? The
most likely answers include private preoccupation with affluence
and the excrescent excesses of campaign finance. There's another,
equally plausible possibility: a huge overdose of spin.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of spin, like radiation, are probably cumulative
over a lifetime, and in recent years, people have been subjected to
an ever-rising tide of it. Think of all the speeches written by
ghosts, the talk show appearances rehearsed with consultants, the
TV ads edited down to the last microsecond by creative directors
and imagery and icons devised by professional design teams. What
reality remains?
</P>
<P>
   At some point, one is tempted to think, people will
instinctively recognize how little these media manipulations
resemble the real candidates. And at that point _ a point that may
have already arrived _ people will have learned to discount all the
spin and to react with skepticism, even cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Hence  &UR; spinicism &LR; . And hence the public's appetite for recent
television inventions like ``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother.'' The
settings may be contrived, but paradoxically in our rehearsed
world, the participants' behavior is reassuringly real.

<P>
   Are you confused about dietary fats? Well, you're not alone.
Judging from the sometimes conflicting reports recently presented
at a scientific conference, experts in the field seem to be having
the devil's own time sorting out which fats and oils and how much
of them are likely to be most beneficial to health and at the same
time acceptable to consumers and food producers.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was organized by the American Heart Association,
American Cancer Society and Oldways Preservation and Exchange
Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Research into the fat issue is unlikely to come to definitive
conclusions any time soon. But since you do have to continue to
eat, and since fat is part of a normal diet that adds flavor to
food, promotes satiation and carries in essential vitamins, you
would be wise to follow the advice provided by some of the world's
leading experts on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Sacks, a cardiac researcher from the Harvard School of
Public Health, said it best: ``After looking at the whole picture,
it makes sense to follow a diet moderate in fat that derives
between 30 percent and 35 percent of its calories from fat, but
that is low in saturated fat and contains a mixture of natural
liquid vegetable oils and fish oil from foods.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no perfect fat or oil. As Sacks noted, ``For almost any
fat, there will be something not good about it.'' Although some
fats (for example, fish oil and pure vegetable oils) are clearly
better for your heart than others (for example, dairy fat, meat fat
and hydrogenated vegetable oils), it is not possible to say which
of the better oils is best.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there a hard and fast rule about the amount of fat
appropriate in a healthful diet. Looking, for example, at
heart-healthy diets in various parts of the world as well as those
tested in clinical studies, there is a wide range _ from 10 percent
to more than 40 percent of calories from fat _ to be found in
wholesome diets.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what anyone thinks, one size does not fit all,''
said K. Dun Gifford, founder and president of Oldways, a nonprofit
organization that identifies and promotes healthful diets from
different countries. ``We're driven to find a common denominator _
to simplify, simplify, simplify _ but that's a dangerous thing to
do in a culturally diverse society such as ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacks made a plea for ``the dietary pattern approach that
considers foods in the context of the whole diet, not in isolation,
since the biological effects of the pattern may differ from the
individual effects of component foods.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Mediterranean diet, which is rich in olive oil
yet associated with low rates of heart disease and several common
cancers, contains very little meat but is loaded with other
health-promoting ingredients, including plentiful vegetables and
fruits and dried beans and peas. The traditional Asian diet, on the
other hand, is very low in all fats, but also rich in vegetables as
well as fish and carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made some mistakes with the low-fat message,'' Sacks
said. He explained that it led some people to adopt a poor dietary
pattern, a diet loaded with calories from refined carbohydrates
like white bread, simple carbohydrates like sugar and a slew of
convenience foods but with little or no increase in fruits,
vegetables or whole grains.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been poor nutrition, widespread weight gain, a
precipitous rise in diabetes and little or no benefit to the health
of the heart or any other organ.
</P>
<P>
   A study in Lyon, France, may be the best evidence yet for
adopting a wholesome dietary pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Participants were men known to have heart disease. Among those
who ate more fruits, vegetables, bread, beans, fiber, cheese,
poultry, fish and canola oil and less meats, butter and cream,
total mortality was reduced by 56 percent, cardiac deaths by 65
percent, nonfatal heart attacks by 70 percent and cancer by 61
percent compared with participants who continued to eat a typical
Lyon diet.
</P>
<P>
   Without changing total fat intake for the experimental group,
saturated fats in the Lyon diet were replaced by monounsaturated
and polyunsaturated vegetable oils and fish oils.
</P>
<P>
   However, Americans have not yet reached the most important goal
for fat consumption: a reduction in saturated fats (from meats,
poultry, dairy products and solid vegetable fats that are hard at
room temperature) to less than 10 percent of calories. Saturated
fats, along with trans fats formed when vegetable oil is
hydrogenated, raise blood levels of cholesterol and are strongly
linked to high rates of heart disease. The average intake of
saturates is now at about 12 or 13 percent, and some people are
consuming more than 15 percent of their calories as saturated fat.
</P>
<P>
   All fats and oils are mixtures of fatty acids: saturated,
monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. Within each of these
categories, there are many different fatty acids, each of which has
its own pattern of activity in the body.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one kind of saturated fatty acid, stearic acid
found in meats and chocolate, does not raise harmful LDL
cholesterol levels. Unfortunately, most of the saturated fat in
meats is palmitic, which does raise LDL cholesterol and which
accounts for about two-thirds of the saturated fat in the American
diet.
</P>
<P>
   Another saturated fatty acid, myristic, found in dairy fat,
raises LDL cholesterol even more than palmitic, which is a good
reason for choosing only nonfat or low-fat dairy foods.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's look at the more healthful fats, the monounsaturated
and polyunsaturated oils found in plants and fish. The American
Heart Association suggests that up to 15 percent of calories can
come from monounsaturates, prominent in olive and canola oils,
avocados and many nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Monounsaturates make up an average of 10 percent of calories,
with about two-thirds of them coming from animal fats that are rich
in undesirable saturated fatty acids. Monounsaturated fatty acids
lower harmful LDL cholesterol but have no adverse effect on
heart-protective HDL cholesterol, which acts like arterial Drano,
helping to keep blood vessels clear of fatty deposits.
</P>
<P>
   According to one conference report, olive oil (but not canola
oil) temporarily impairs the ability of blood vessels to dilate,
but the health significance of this finding is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Polyunsaturated fatty acids, prominent in corn, soybean,
safflower and sunflower oils, lower blood cholesterol even more
than monounsaturates, but they do so by lowering the LDLs and to
some extent the HD's. The heart association suggests that
polyunsaturates make up no more than 10 percent of calories, a
level above which no population naturally consumes. In studies in
animals and tens of thousands of people, diets that favor
polyunsaturates lower the rate of heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Also helpful are the omega-3 fatty acids, polyunsaturates
prominent in fish and a few rarely eaten greens like purslane, as
well as canola and soybean oils. Several studies have linked
fish-eating to reduced rates of sudden death from heart disease,
and the more fish the better. In a study in the Netherlands, the
risk of cardiac death was 60 percent lower among frequent
fish-eaters than among people who ate little or no fish. However,
while fish oil reduces cardiac deaths, it does not prevent cardiac
events like heart attacks, suggesting that it works mainly by
preventing abnormal heart rhythms rather than atherosclerosis.

   SUMMIT-ASSESS _ THURMONT, Md. _ After two grinding weeks,
President Clinton's Mideast peace summit at nearby Camp David is
teetering somewhere between triumph and disaster. The outcome rests
on a single question: Can Clinton and his diplomats, working with
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, find a way for the two
adversaries to share the ancient city of Jerusalem? In diplomatic
terms, that translates into an unholy morass of contradictory aims
and immovable intentions. The quest for elegant solutions to
seemingly
</P>
<P>
   intractable political problems, however, is the heart and soul
of statecraft. And when Clinton speaks of his role as an honest
broker in the talks, serving up
</P>

peace talks, Frankenthal has hosted gatherings among Israelis who
lost family members to war and terror with Palestinians who lost
loved ones to Israeli guns. They are literally under one large tent

   UPS-AIR _ A subsidiary of UPS is testing a new technology that,
proponents say, can drastically reduce or even eliminate mid-air
and runway collisions. The experimental system known as ADS-B (for
Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast) also promises to
unclog aerial gridlock by allowing planes to safely fly closer
together and takeoff and land at shorter intervals. UPS will begin
equipping its own planes with ADS-B this year, and others including
FedEx, Airborne and DHL are likely to follow by the end of 2002
when all cargo planes will be required to carry collision avoidance
equipment. (Hirschman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 42.

 &HT;    Nickelodeon breaking ground with three Latino-themed shows
 &HT;    By Kevin Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ When Jeff Valdez pitched a Latino sitcom to
one of the broadcast networks, the meeting didn't last very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told in so many words that they weren't going to do a
show with all Latino people,'' Valdez recalls. ``Well, not even in
so many words. That's what was said.''
</P>
<P>
   Another commercial network, however, bought ``The Brothers
Garcia,'' a coming-of-age story about three Mexican-American
brothers growing up in San Antonio, Texas. Then it never returned
Valdez's follow-up phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `OK, cool,''' he remembers. ``We'll go where people
... are showing the real fabric of America.''
</P>
<P>
   That place is Nickelodeon. Not only will the popular cable
channel for kids air ``The Brothers Garcia,'' which debuted Monday
at 8:30 p.m., but later this year it will also feature two other
Hispanic-themed shows. ``Dora the Explorer'' is a play-along,
animated adventure starring a 7-year-old heroine who lives inside a
computer. The series is scheduled to premiere Aug. 14 on Nick Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``Taina'' will chronicle the life of Taina Morales
(Christina Vidal), a 15-year-old, Jennifer Lopez-like wannabe
balancing her traditional family life with dreams of being a star.
That series is expected to debut Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Three Latino-based shows on one network at the same time is
definitely a television first. And, as Maria Perez-Brown,
``Taina's'' executive producer, notes, each shows a different side
of Latino culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the disadvantages of never having had Latino shows like
this is that the first one out of the box is going to have the
burden of proving Latino-ism'' is viable, says Perez-Brown, a
former lawyer who created ``Gullah Gullah Island,'' Nickelodeon's
popular preschool series. ``But having three shows is going to show
you three different points of view and three different approaches
to what is Latino in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon admits the move was long overdue. ``As we took
inventory of our shows, we thought we were doing a pretty good job
reflecting images of blacks and whites and Asians, but we really
felt we had underrepresented Latino kids,'' said Albie Hecht,
Nickelodeon's president of film and television.
</P>
<P>
   Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon's executive vice president and
general manager, points out that kids' lives are vastly different
than they were 20 years ago. The world they live in today is rich
with culture and diversity. And TV shows need to do a better job to
keep pace with those changes.
</P>
<P>
   While broadcast networks often pay weak lip service to beefing
up Latinos' presence on television, such cables,'' says Valdez,
whom the Los Angeles Times once dubbed the ``Ed Sullivan of Latino
talent.'' ``They haven't said, `Hey, let's put everybody in
sombreros.' I've had network executives say those kinds of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the burden on minority shows is immense. When
shows with all-white casts fail, you don't hear panicky network
suits saying, `Well, we won't do one of those shows again.' But
that's what happens with shows that have predominantly black casts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do one Latino show or pilot a year,'' says Valdez. ``And
they go, `See, we told you that wouldn't work. Let's try again in
five years.' Then they'll do six shows of Two Guys, A Girl, A
Pizza; Two Girls and a Bottle of Perrier and A Guy with a Dog and
Two Guys, A Dog and An Order of French Fries.''
</P>
<P>
   But Valdez's ``The Brothers Garcia'' is breaking new television
ground. It's the first English language sitcom with an all-Latino
cast and creative team of writers, directors and producers. From
his witty, now adult perspective, Larry Garcia (Alvin Alvarez)
fondly recalls his attempt as an 11-year-old to fit in with his
older brothers, 13-year-old Carlos (Jeffrey Licon), a stud athlete,
and 12-year-old George (Bobby Gonzalez), a walking encyclopedia.
Emmy-winner John Leguizamo narrates the show as the adult Larry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the Latin Daniel Stern,'' Leguizamo cracks, referring to
the actor's narration role on ABC's ``The Wonder Years.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon believes The Brothers Garcia should offer all kids a
sense of belonging. After all, timeless tales of kids anxious to
grow up and facing tough challenges should resonate with all
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that although this is about an American Latino family
where the culture is part of the fabric of the show, there are
these universal truths about family and sibling rivalry, so that
when you watch those scenes and those gem moments, you can say,
`Oh, I remember that!,''' Hecht says.
</P>
<P>
   While Leguizamo is known for such gritty fare as ``Summer of
Sam'' and ``Freak,'' his one-man, Emmy-winning HBO stage play, the
versatile performer says the time is right for him to act in
something his kids can watch
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I'm 34 and have kids, I want to do something (for
them) and be responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Leguizamo is thankful ``The Brothers Garcia'' has nothing to
do with his tortured childhood. ``I don't wish my life on
anybody,'' he says. ``That's why I write ... I'm trying to exorcise
demons. Now, this is a great, middle-class, normal Latin family. It
shows kids that, when you're growing up, you have choices. Not
everybody is ghetto, and not everybody is doing drive-bys. It's
nice to see such a normal show and something sweet.''

   BIRDING IN TRINIDAD
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I would like to go birding in Trinidad and
Tobago. Can you help us find companies that organize such trips? _
Rachel Schmidt, St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. The West Indian republic of Trinidad and Tobago is becoming
increasingly popular among wildlife enthusiasts, particularly
birders. The country's dense rain forests and mangrove swamps are
teeming with more than 400 species, including scarlet ibises,
toucans, parrots, hummingbirds and yellow orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Nature Expeditions International, in Plantation, Fla., has an
eight-day package for groups of two or more people, with weekly
departures throughout the year. The itinerary includes four nights
at the Asa Wright Nature Center and Lodge, a former coffee
plantation on Trinidad that has been converted into an inn and a
200-acre nature reserve. Birding expeditions to the Caroni Bird
Sanctuary on Trinidad's west coast and visits to waterfalls and
swamps are among the activities. Three days are spent at Blue
Waters Inn on Tobago's Atlantic coast; from there you'll take a day
trip to Little Tobago Island, a seabird breeding area. The price is
$2,390 a person, double occupancy, excluding air fare. Information:
(800) 869-0639.
</P>
<P>
   A similar eight-day package is offered by Caligo Ventures, based
in Armonk, N.Y. Visitors stay at the Asa Wright Lodge and Blue
Waters Inn; on Trinidad, they will take birding trips to Nariva
Swamp and the Caroni Bird Sanctuary; outings on Tobago include
visits to King's Bay, the island's mountainous forests and Little
Tobago Island. Through Dec. 15, the cost is $1,525 a person, double
occupancy, including air fare from Miami or New York; from Dec. 16
to March 31, 2001, the price is $1,895. Information: (800)
426-7781.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to include another bird-watching paradise _ the
Orinoco River delta in northern Venezuela, some 15 miles south of
Trinidad _ Clipper Cruise Lines has an eight-day excursion on the
138-passenger Yorktown Clipper, departing Dec. 29 from Port of
Spain. The itinerary has a naturalist focus and includes birding
expeditions to the Caroni Bird Sanctuary, the Asa Wright reserve
and Little Tobago, as well as visits to sites along the Orinoco
River, including Angel Falls. Depending on the cabin, prices range
from $1,980 to $3,500, double occupancy. Air fare is not included.
Information: (800) 325-0010.

Southwark Literature Festival, from Oct. 26 to Nov. 3, will feature
Chaucer's work. Readings and discussions are planned, and on Oct.
26, at Southwark Cathedral, George Dyson's cantata ``The Canterbury
Pilgrims'' will be performed, at a time to be announced.

with readings from Chaucer's writings. Information: (44-20) 7222
7110. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Canterbury, the two-week Canterbury Festival will open on
Oct. 14 with a procession at 6:30 p.m. of actors playing Chaucer
characters. Throughout the festival, modern Canterbury Tales will
be read by their authors at various places around Canterbury.
Admission is $7.45, at 67 pence to the dollar. Information:
(44-1227) 452 853. &QL;

St. Peter's Street in Canterbury. Information: (44-1227) 470 379. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Sept. 30 to Nov. 4, ``Passing Tales'' will be on view at
the Royal Museum and Art Gallery on High Street in Canterbury.
Highlights include a 16th-century portrait of Chaucer and
late-medieval pilgrims' badges. The museum is open 10 a.m. to 5
p.m.; closed Sunday. Admission is free. Information: (44-1227) 452

RECOVERING FAT AND MUSCLE LOST IN SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Science Times)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Astronauts who stay in space for a long time lose muscle and
bone mass. Is it permanent?
</P>
<P>
   A. There is growing evidence that exercise can help astronauts
recover from muscle and bone losses and limit such losses.
</P>
<P>
   In the near-absence of gravity, bone mass decreases in the
load-bearing regions of the skeleton, and muscles shrink when not
used. But Michael Foale, who was on the Russian space station Mir
for four and a half months, said that he had been able to recover
most of the bone density and all of the muscle he lost on the Mir
through weight-lifting, running and swimming. Muscle recovery took
about six months; bone rebuilding, to up to 99 percent of his
pre-flight levels, took a year.
</P>
<P>
   After earlier long flights, astronauts often had trouble
recovering. On the 184-day Skylab 4 mission in 1974, astronauts
lost 4.5 percent to 7 percent of their bone mass and were still
down about that much five to seven years later.
</P>
<P>
   When both Shannon Lucid and Norman Thagard spent long periods
aboard Mir, he lost up to 11.7 percent of his bone mineral and 17.5

weight and lost less muscle mass and bone mineral than he did, even
though she was in space 73 days longer. Lucid was ``much more in
compliance with exercise,'' a NASA doctor said at the time; she had
put in hundreds of hours on Mir's treadmill and stationary bicycle.

TEE TIME AMONG THE TULIPS

<TEXT>
<P>
   When I arrived in Amsterdam early in May, the streets were
almost deserted and the shops were closed because it was a national
holiday, commemorating the anniversary of the liberation of the
Netherlands from the German army 55 years earlier. The first person
I saw as I left the hotel and turned onto the Nieuwe Doelenstrasse
was a golfer carrying his clubs. I thought this augured well for my
trip, since its unlikely purpose was to play golf, while all those
around me were happily engaged in the more expected pursuits of
museum visits, canal tours and bike trips through the tulip fields.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands is not known for golf, and has not been since
the 17th century, when an early form of the game called kolfspel,
which was played with a wooden club, or kolf, flourished on the
frozen canals. The Dutch even claim to have invented golf, which is
hotly disputed by the Scots. While the Dutch may have been first,
the Netherlands has relatively few courses and the terrain in most
places is famously flat.
</P>
<P>
   There are, though, a handful of world-class courses, which
proved ideal for my weeklong golfing vacation. As it turned out, I
could hardly have asked for more since the remarkably uncrowded
private courses welcome visitors on weekdays (weekends are another
story), and during the entire week it was a balmy 80 degrees. The
owner of one of the antiques stores in the Spiegel-kwartier, across
from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, where I found a blue and white
tile from 1700 showing two men with round brimmed hats and breeches
playing kolfspel, told me that there had not been a week of such
weather in the Netherlands in a hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   There are three superb courses along the North Sea coast in the
25-mile stretch between Zandvoort in the north and The Hague to the
south _ Kennemer Golf and Country Club, Noordwijkse Golf Club and
the Royal Hague Golf Club. These courses are anything but flat, as
they toss and tumble incessantly over the dunes in a landscape very
similar to that of the great courses of Scotland and Ireland. They
also share the distinction of having been designed by the two
leading English golf course architects of the last century, the
legendary Harry Colt and his postwar successor, Frank Pennink.
</P>
<P>
   Kennemer, the most famous course in the Netherlands, is on the
outskirts of Zandvoort, which is the busiest and closest beach
resort to Amsterdam. Zandvoort itself is pretty tacky, in a
cheerful way, with crowded tented pavilions along the beach. Behind
the beach, there are stalls on the paved boardwalk selling seafood
with a heavy emphasis on herring, as well as parlors that sell
pancakes and poffertjes (fritters).
</P>
<P>
   The nearby golf course is a world apart, and its appeal is
instantly recognizable. The clubhouse, built in 1912, has an
enormous, symmetrical thatched roof with tiny dormer windows.
Inside, there is an anonymous portrait of a boy and a girl painted
around 1635 in which the little boy holds what is unmistakably a
golf club.
</P>
<P>
   From the clubhouse, the fairways of the three nine-hole courses
uncoil in all directions. The caddiemaster, with whom one must
arrange a tee time, sits in the second story of a brick tower with
a thatched dome, the better to survey his domain. Colt designed the
original 18 holes in 1927, the B and C nines. A third nine, the A
course, was designed more recently by Pennink.
</P>
<P>
   I arrived at Kennemer around noon on Sunday after a hearty
breakfast of fried mussels and onions with three sauces on the
beach in Zandvoort. While I had arranged to play during the week, I
was hoping the caddiemaster would let me play that afternoon,
although the course is normally closed to visitors on weekends.
After a suitable period of supplication, he told me I could come
back at 4 o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   This left time for a visit to the Keukenhof, the botanical
gardens sponsored by the Dutch flower growers. The Keukenhof is in
the bulb fields that spread down the coast from Haarlem to Leiden,
near the pretty little villages of Bennebroek, Hillegom and Lisse.
From 1401 to 1436, the grounds belonged to Countess Jacoba of
Bavaria, who had a vegetable garden there for her kitchen. Hence
the name Keukenhof, or kitchen garden.
</P>
<P>
   The spring exhibition runs from late March through late May and
consists of thousands upon thousands of parterres of tulips
bordered by hyacinths and daffodils, each one a carefully
choreographed fusillade of yellows, reds, purples and pinks. The
tulips are laid out along lanes of beech, flowering almond trees
and horse chestnuts, and cascade around ponds and sculpture
gardens. There are glass pavilions with different flower exhibits
and shops that sell the bulbs for shipment abroad.
</P>
<P>
   When I returned to Kennemer, I began with the A course, the
newest of the three nines, built in 1985. It's a bit quirkier and
narrower than the original 18, and considered more difficult, but
it is just as memorable. The best hole was the par 5 seventh, whose
rippling fairway turns to the right and climbs to a raised green
with a view of the church steeple and old brick water tower of
Zandvoort in the distance. The only sounds came from the songbirds
and the rattling of the trains that run from Amsterdam to
Zandvoort.
</P>
<P>
   The old course designed by Colt is seaside golf at its best,
with nestling greens set in little dells among the dunes, spacious,
rumpled fairways and springy turf. I asked a member about the
bushes that lurk off the fairways and she showed me jeneverbest,
the juniper bush that produces strong Dutch gin; kardinaalsmuts,
named for its red berries shaped like a cardinal's hat, and the
white flowering madoorn bushes. There are no weak holes at
Kennemer, but the single most fearsome hole is the 10th, a blind
drive over a dune with only a red-and-white striped pole to guide
you.
</P>
<P>
   Noordwijk aan Zee lies on the edge of the surrounding tulip
fields with their striated bands of brilliant color. A more sedate
and unspoiled beach resort than Zandvoort, its hotels are set back
from the grassy dune that leads to the broad sandy beach.
</P>
<P>
   Although golf in Noordwijk aan Zee began in 1915, the present
course, designed by Pennink, was laid out in 1972 near the tiny
village of Noordwijkerhout. The Noordwijkse Golf Club has a
distinctly different flavor from Kennemer's, notwithstanding their
proximity. Kennemer is set back from the sea, but Noordwijkse lies
exposed, just behind the barrier dunes that shield against the
North Sea. You never actually see the sea, but you can hear the
waves the whole way around. The black and white clubhouse, perched
on a bluff above the course, looks like a slightly ramshackle ocean
liner.
</P>
<P>
   The day I played Noordwijkse it was bright and calm, so the
course was at its most docile. After a few holes, I paired up with
Edith, a good golfer who has been a member of Noordwijkse for 25
years. The first three holes are out in the open and then the
course disappears into a forest of pines, to re-emerge only on the
eighth. There is a rousing stretch of unabashed seaside golf from
No. 13 all the way to the finish, with semiblind drives to fairways
full of humps and hollows that zigzag through the dunes.
</P>
<P>
   The Hague Golf Club, or Haagsche, is the third of the sparkling
seaside courses and is the oldest club in the Netherlands, founded
in 1893. The original course, however, was badly damaged by the
German army in World War II and a new course was built in the very
swanky, wooded suburb of Wassenaar.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the course is down the street from the Auberge de
Kieviet, which Edith recommended and where I stopped for a
delicious lunch _ a salad of smoked lamb with apricots, grilled
tuna with spinach and chocolate raspberry mousse cake.
</P>
<P>
   The Hague course also bears the stamp of Harry Colt, but is
distinct in its design, with billowing, roller coaster fairways. On
some holes, I could barely see the green even on short pitch shots.
</P>
<P>
   While the Hague course has a coastal flavor, it's more overgrown
and enclosed than Kennemer or Noordwijkse, with bushes and
flowering trees that can easily snatch your ball. To compound the
difficulty, the rough is deep and lush. Most of all, the course is
a study in assembled shades of green, from pale pastel to the
yellowy green river birch to the dark green firs.
</P>
<P>
   I started out at the Hague with four straight pars and a bogey,
but my score soared when I reached the par 4 sixth. This is the
toughest hole, requiring a blind drive over the corner of an
uncharacteristically bare and menacing sand dune. The final hole is
a showstopper, a par 5 from a ski slope tee that plunges to a long
flat, funneling fairway. The hole finishes below the thatched
clubhouse with its red and white shutters, where the members sit
outside on a grass patio under white umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I headed inland to Utrecht, but not before
visiting the Mauritshuis, the art museum in The Hague. I had hoped
to see Vermeer's ``Girl With a Pearl Earring,'' but it was out on
loan. However, I did see Hendrick Avercamp's ``Enjoying the Ice,''
a pell-mell scene of life along the frozen canals in the early 17th
century, in which several people are playing kolfspel.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the best inland courses in Holland are Utrechtse Golfclub
`De Pan' and Hilversumsche Golf Club, both set in piney heathland.
De Pan is in Bosch en Duin, outside Utrecht, a lively university
city with innumerable cafes and flowering chestnut trees along its
central canal, the Oudegracht. Founded in 1894, De Pan is the
country's second oldest golf club, but moved to its present site in
1929. The clubhouse, with a statue of Pan playing his flute in
front, has a steep, oversized thatched roof.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere is friendly and informal and the course, designed
by Colt in the classic English heathland style, curves through
stands of pine, birch, oak, acacia and sweet and wild chestnut.
There are some lovely holes where you drive over valleys of heather
and sand, including the 6th, 7th and 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the elevated 15th tee, it is clear that the same
vision that went into creating Sunningdale and Wentworth outside
London, the courses for which Colt is best known, is at work here.
The drive is over the braided branches of dwarf pines to a
straightaway fairway with the tapering bunkers down both sides set
off against dark, encircling pines.
</P>
<P>
   Hilversumsche, which dates from 1910, is less than half an
hour's drive north of Utrecht. An attractive town with some
surprisingly modernist Dutch architecture, Hilversum is set in the
heart of the Gooi, an area of woods and lakes east of Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Hilversumsche played host to the Dutch Open for seven straight
years, which, much to the chagrin of the engaging caddiemaster, was
being played this year at Noordwijkse. A sylvan, secluded course,
its symbol is the kievit bird, or lapwing. The pines cast long
shadows over the beautifully conditioned fairways and greens, which
are guarded by steep grass-faced bunkers. Many of the holes are
separated by leafy little country lanes with wooden gates, which
adds to the strong sense of seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   No golfing trip to the Netherlands would be complete without a
visit to Golf Club De Haar. Only nine holes, it's nonetheless an
enchanting course in an enchanted setting, on the grounds of Kastel
De Haar. Next to the village of Haarzuilens, near Utrecht, it is
not far from Breukelen, which gave its name to Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Rising from a moat, the castle is the largest in the
Netherlands, dating to the 14th century or earlier. It was burned
by the army of Louis XIV in 1672 and by the time Baron Etienne van
Zuylen van Nijevelt van de Haar inherited it in 1890, the castle
lay in ruins. The baron and his wife, Helene de Rothschild,
restored the place in all its medieval neo-Gothic glory. It's well
worth taking a tour of the elaborately furnished castle, which is
open to the public except in September, when the current Baron van
Zuylen and his family are there.
</P>
<P>
   The adjoining golf course was built in 1974, and the baron, the
grandson of the van Zuylen who restored the castle, is himself a
golfer. The clubhouse was once a stable for the deer that roamed
the park, where the animals slept in what is now the sunken bar.
</P>
<P>
   The golf course is dominated by the trees, transported to the
grounds at the turn of the century from every cranny of Utrecht
province so that the baron would have a fully mature park in the
English style. Altogether, his landscape gardener transplanted
7,000 trees, which are now 150 years old. Each hole is an arboreal
revelation, as the course threads through mighty red and green
beech, ash, lindens, chestnuts, planes, poplars and wild cherry. In
a field guide to each hole published by the club, one can identify
the ``Bomen op De Haar,'' or ``Trees of De Haar.''
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding all the trees, the holes are imaginative and fun
to play. The second is a par 3 over a creek with the green in a gap
in an allee of ash trees. The par 5 fourth hole, the best on the
course, curves right to left with the creek running down the left,
an island of maples protecting the green, and, in May, sprays of
white and red flowering hawthorn to the right. On the sixth hole,
you hear the caterwauling of a peacock that lives in the sand trap
next to the green.
</P>
<P>
   On the ninth hole, the second par 5, the drive must carry the
corner of a large lily pond, and the castle with its red brick
walls and pointed black spires looms fully into view as you near
the green. The only disappointing thing about De Haar is that it's
just nine holes, but then, you can always go around again.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   GUIDE TO PRIVATE COURSES
</P>
<P>
   Private courses in the Netherlands generally allow visitors
during the week but not on weekends. You should call a course's
caddiemaster to arrange a tee time. The clubs require a maximum
handicap, which varies from 26 to 28, and it is advisable to have a
handicap card.
</P>
<P>
   The average greens fee is about $55, at 2.3 guilders to the
dollar. Most Dutch golfers use pull carts, which can usually be
rented, but motorized carts are rarely used. Most of the clubs
accept credit cards, but not De Pan and Hilversumsche. Everyone at
the golf courses speaks English.

   WHERE TO STAY
</P>
<P>
   The courses are close enough to Amsterdam that you can make the
city your base, but here are some hotels near the courses:
</P>
<P>
   Grand Hotel Huis ter Duin, Koningen Astrid Boulevard 5,
Noordwijk aan Zee, (31-71) 361-9220, fax (31-71) 361-9401,
www.huisterduin.com. This luxury hotel overlooking the sea first
opened in 1885, and was rebuilt and expanded about 10 years ago.

 &HT;    X-Files gets its character transfusion

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ One of the keys to ``The X-Files' `` success
is that the show always raises more questions than it answers. Who
or what got Scully pregnant? Is she really pregon and actor.''
</P>
<P>
   If you remember Patrick's menacing Terminator character in T2,
you know exactly what Carter's talking about. Not many guys can
convincingly throw Arnold Schwarzenegger through a wall. Patrick
was also effectively creepy as an alien teacher in ``The Faculty.''
I say give Patrick some macho fight scenes with the beefy alien
bounty hunter.
</P>
<P>
   When I first heard in May that Duchovny would be in only half of
next season's episodes, I was concerned. After all, this
still-stellar drama is built around the chemistry between Mulder
and Scully. But change is good. Like all long-running shows,
sometimes ``The X-Files'' is a tad stale. Adding new blood should
give it a boost. Bringing in new cast members certainly hasn't hurt
``Law &AMP; Order.'' ``NYPD Blue'' always gets better for a few weeks
after a new detective joins the s

 &HT;    Hispanics have golden opportunity but must buck trends
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hispanic Americans are the fastest growing ethnic group in the
United States. At the same time, a new study finds that Hispanic
workers are disproportionately concentrated in low-wage jobs that
offer few benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The income disparity for Hispanic workers has hardly improved
even during the past eight years of economic prosperity, according
to the study.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, many American employers are being forced to
import workers with the skills necessary to program, install and
maintain the equipment used in America's burgeoning high-tech
industries.
</P>
<P>
   There's something amiss when one portion of American society is
heavily underemployed or unemployed while another segment of
society is scouring foreign nations to find workers for good-paying
jobs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers who helped prepare the 230-page report for the
National Conference of La Raza correctly observed that these income
disparities are troubling for the entire nation as Hispanics form a
greater share of the nation's work force.
</P>
<P>
   If the situation is not reversed, government programs funded by
income taxes will be hurt. Social Security and Medicare are two
such programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about being nice to Latino people,'' a labor
researcher told the Washington Post. ``This is about America's
future and our best interests as a nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, per capita income for Hispanics was $11,434 compared to
African-Americans at $12,957 and Anglos at $22,952.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed that the median income for Hispanic married
couples with families was $34,826 compared to $54,736 for Anglos
families.
</P>
<P>
   There are several factors responsible for this disparity. Some
researchers note the influx of Hispanic immigration, which is about
50 percent of total immigration. Many Hispanic immigrants have
limited education and poor language and job skills.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is the high dropout rate for Hispanic Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Education has always been the single best avenue out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts such as Waco Independent School District's new Career
and Technology Education program should help guide young people
toward good-paying jobs currently available in the marketplace and
higher learning venues available to them, like Texas State
Technical College.
</P>
<P>
   District officials are making earnest efforts to curb dropouts
and guide students toward educational and career opportunities
following graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Employers should join federal, state and local officials in
putting effort and resources into the education and training that
matches American citizens to good-paying American jobs.

<P>
   Alzheimer's disease, which robs people of their most basic
neurological functions, may give subtle clues to its approach years
before clear symptoms emerge.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study in The Archives of Neurology suggests that
cognitive tests may allow doctors to know if a patient is
developing the disease. While there is no treatment for Alzheimer's
now, the technique could be useful as drugs become available.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the report, Dr. Merrill F. Elias of the University
of Maine, drew on data compiled in the Framingham Heart Study, the
52-year health assessment of residents of Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   From 1975 to 1979, as part of the study, psychologists gave a
number of tests meant to gauge the participants' brain functions.
</P>
<P>
   The study participants were tested for learning and immediate
recall, visual reproduction from memory and abstract reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, all appeared free of Alzheimer's disease. But those
who developed the disease later, researchers found, were more
likely to have had lower test results in the cognitive studies.
Less retention of verbal material and lower abstract reasoning were
the strongest predictors, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The journal noted, however, that the lower scores did not
necessarily mean a person would develop Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   NEW VIEW ON OLDER PEOPLE EXERCISING
</P>
<P>
   Urging older people to have stress tests before they begin
exercise programs, a common medical practice, is not only unfounded
but may even discourage people from getting the physical activity
they need, a new study reports.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of older people do not need the test, in which
heart function is measured as a patient uses a treadmill, the
researchers wrote in a recent issue of The Journal of the American
Medical Association. Instead, they said, the patients should simply
have complete physical examinations.
</P>
<P>
   The lead author of the study, Dr. Thomas M. Gill, a professor of
internal medicine and geriatrics at Yale, noted that only about a
third of elderly people are considered physically active.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's discouraging to us,'' he said, ``because in the past,
there has been a wealth of new evidence demonstrating the benefits
of physical activity and exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   The study said a review of the evidence suggested that the risk
of heart attack related to exercise might be overstated, and the
researchers suggested that the overall benefits of exercise
outweighed any risk.
</P>
<P>
   In a 79-year-old woman, vigorous exercise like slow jogging,
speed-walking or tennis appeared to raise the annual risk of a
heart attack to 1.6 percent from 1.3 percent. In a 90-year-old man,
the risk rose to 4.8 percent, from 3.9 percent. Less stressful
forms of exercise carry even less risk, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines of the American Heart Association and the
American College of Sports Medicine, doctors are advised to conduct
stress tests routinely among older people who want to start
exercising. The goal is to detect asymptomatic heart blockages. But
often, Gill said, older people cannot complete the treadmill test
satisfactorily, and so require more elaborate tests to determine if
there is a blockage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, older people who have not been active should
begin slowly, with activities like walking and balance exercises.
</P>
<P>
   BACTERIA SEEN AS CONTRIBUTING TO STROKES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Common bacteria, already found to have a possible association
with heart attacks, may also play a role in strokes, a new study
has found.
</P>
<P>
   People infected with the bacterium, Chlamydia pneumomiae, appear
four and a half times as likely to suffer a first ischemic stroke
than uninfected people. The findings are reported in the July issue
of the journal Stroke. Dr. Mitchell S.V. Elkind of Columbia
University based the findings on a study of 89 stroke patients.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that people with signs of recent infection
were the most at risk, but that people who had been infected in the
past several years were also at higher risk.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria are not those that cause the sexually transmitted
disease chlamydia, but instead affect the respiratory tract. Almost
everyone is infected at one point or another. Researchers believe
the bacteria may cause an inflammation that leads to stroke and
heart attacks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALLERGIC TO FISH? AVOID AIR AROUND THEM
</P>
<P>
   Most people who are allergic to pollen presumably make it a
point to avoid blooming fields of ragweed or goldenrod.
</P>
<P>
   But most people allergic to fish probably figure that to avoid
an unpleasant reaction, they need only avoid eating anything that
contains fish.
</P>
<P>
   Think again.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have found that for people allergic to fish, it is
enough just to inhale some of the allergens wafting off the skin to
have a reaction. And that, the study says, means that the
piscatorial equivalent of the field in bloom is the fish market.
</P>
<P>
   The report was published earlier this year in the Journal of
Allergy and Clinical Immunology, and was prepared by researchers
from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and researchers from a
hospital in Madrid, Spain. Mayo researchers released details of the
study this month.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted at an open-air fish market in Madrid,
where allergy patients have reported reactions. Hypersensitivity to
fish is a significant problem in several European countries, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
   On 41 different days, researchers took air samples in the
market, and consistently found fish allergens. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXPLORING THE SCIENCE OF THE GOLF SWING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is the perfect golf swing, that elusive marriage of grace and
strength that separates the duffer from the pro, about to yield its
secrets to science?
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely, but researchers at the University of Chicago, using
brain-imaging equipment, are studying how professional golfers
prepare to swing, in the hope that it will help in physical
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, volunteers from the LPGA Tour, in Chicago for a
tournament, agreed to let doctors examine them with MRIs while the
players visualized their swing. The machines track small movements
of blood in the brain, and researchers say they hope the study will
allow them to understanding the nature of rapid body movement.
</P>
<P>
   The test requires the subjects to remain still. ``We have to
study an aspect of movement, without the person moving,'' said Dr.
John G. Milton, a neurology professor at the university.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers hit on the idea of using golfers because the
best ones are known to fully visualize their swing before they hit
the ball. Indeed, said Milton, who has played golf for six years,
the swing is so fast that golfers have no time to reposition
themselves once it has begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meant to me that everything has to be preprogrammed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers plan to examine three groups of women: the pro
golfers, competent amateur ones and those who have never hit a golf
ball, Milton said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the third group will then be given golf lessons for
16 weeks and re-examined, to see if there are any change in their
brain patterns.

 &HT;    UNIVERSITIES SUBSIDIZE FEDERAL RESEARCH, SAYS REPORT
 &HT;    Eds: See Cox-state inserts at end of story.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Far from ripping off the federal government,
research universities pick up between $700 million and $1.5 billion
of the overhead costs for the $15 billion in federal research
contracts that they get each year.
</P>
<P>
   Those findings from an 18-month congressionally mandated study
were released Monday by Rand Corporation researchers at the
National Science Foundation's Science and Technology Policy
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what the university community has been saying for
years _ that universities are subsidizing federal research,'' said
Richard J. Turman(cq), director of federal relations for the
Association of American Universities, which includes 60 major
public and private research institutions.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes the Rand report will help universities resist
efforts in Congress to make them pick up a bigger portion of the
overhead costs for federally financed research.
</P>
<P>
   Federal grants are supposed to cover the direct and indirect
costs of scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   Direct costs include such items as salaries, materials and
special equipment for a project. Indirect costs include such
overhead items as wear and tear on facilities, administrative and
accounting costs, and even janitorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, about 70 percent of a project's expenses are direct
costs and 30 percent are indirect, according to the Rand report. It
said the average federal grant covers all of the direct costs, but
only 70 to 90 percent of the indirect costs.
</P>
<P>
   Rand economist Charles A. Goldman, a co-author of the report,
said he could not calculate similar figures for research contracts
with private companies, because the Department of Defense, which
issues the bulk of such contracts, told him it considers such data
to be the private property of the contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Although dozens of federal agencies sponsor some scientific
research, most grants to universities are awarded by Defense, the
National Institutes of Health or the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, American universities spent about $26 billion on
scientific research. That included $15 billion in federal funds, $5
billion from university funds, $2 billion in state and local funds,
and $4 billion from private sources, including corporations and
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said the $5 billion in university funds included the
$700 million to $1.5 billion needed to cover the shortfall in
federal reimbursements for indirect costs.
</P>
<P>
   Universities have been willing to absorb such expenses as part
of the price of competing for prestigious federal research
projects. In addition, some see other benefits. The state
comptroller in Texas estimated that each dollar spent on research
stimulates $3.62 in economic activity within that state.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, some members of Congress tried to cut overhead
reimbursements for federal research projects at universities by 10
percent. As a compromise, Congress instead ordered the White House
to issue recommendations by July 1999 on whether changes were
needed in order to keep universities from claiming excess expenses
for overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The White House commissioned the Rand report, which was released
Monday. The Rand data was used as the basis for recommendations to
be released Tuesday _ one year late _ and posted on the Web site of
the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations include opposition to efforts to recover
additional overhead costs from universities, according to a letter
to members of Congress from Neal Lane, the president's science
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``These additional costs could end up either reducing university
spending for research and education, or being passed on to students
through increased tuition rates,'' Lane wrote.

 &HT;    Tiger survives as fittest in sporting
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta's Bobby Jones, the greatest golfer of his era, was once
asked his thoughts about a young golfer named Jack Nicklaus. His
response became part of the Nicklaus legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays a game with which I am not familiar,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The world has turned a time or two since then. And in the way of
such things, the 60-year-old Nicklaus, now winding down his career,
is saying much the same thing these days about another young man,
Eldrick _ better known as Tiger _ Woods.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways to describe what Woods has accomplished. You
could point out that he has won the world's last two major golf
tournaments by a combined 23 strokes, an average of three strokes a
round better than the world's best golfers, playing at the top of
their form. You might also note that Woods has become a household
name even in households that wouldn't know a driver from a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no more telling indicator of Woods' dominance than
his impact on his fellow golfers. Professional athletes have to
nurture a sense of arrogance in themselves, but Woods, at the age
of 24, has beaten that natural arrogance out of his colleagues.
They have been forced to acknowledge, publicly and often, that he
is simply much better than they are, and that they are helpless to
close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most intriguing thing about Tiger is our own
eagerness to turn the man into an icon. While he is the best in the
world at what he does, his particular skill amounts to using a
stick to knock a ball into a hole some 400 yards away. Why should
that obscure ability command such fame and monetary reward?
</P>
<P>
   While golf, by its nature, is perhaps the most abstract and
absurd of all the major sports, most of the other games we humans
play are also arbitrary contests. There is no real-life counterpart
to swishing a 30-foot basket, turning a double play, heading in a
goal or tossing a touchdown pass either. But millions love to watch
those feats nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Some might claim that our culture's fascination with sport is
evidence of its superficiality. However, sport transcends both time
and culture. The ancient Aztecs, the Greeks and Romans, Mongolian
tribes and Native Americans _ they too manufactured physical
challenges and then celebrated those who mastered them.
</P>
<P>
   So sports are universal, appealing to something fundamental in
human beings. Perhaps they are at some level a metaphor for life, a
ritual and drama of success and failure, of effort rewarded and
sometimes cruelly unrewarded.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, Tiger and his competitors play a game with which
we are all familiar.

BEYOND `TITANIC': JAMES CAMERON LOOKS FOR NEW WORLDS TO CONQUER

 (Includes a color slide of director James Cameron on the set of
``Titanic.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 EDITOR'S NOTE: Possibly objectionable language in 5th and 22nd
paragraphs. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    James Cameron is not David O. Selznick.
 &HT;    The legendary producer spent a huge chunk of his career trying
in vain to top ``Gone With The Wind'' (1939), which had won eight
Oscars and become the most successful film ever made to that time.
Even winning a second straight Best Picture Oscar for ``Rebecca''
(1940) didn't ease Selznick's futile compulsion to top himself.
 &HT;    Writer/director Cameron famously declared himself ``the king of
the world'' when ``Titanic'' (1997) copped a Best Picture Oscar of
its own, capping a triumphant run for the film which now stands as
the most successful ever made. But he insists that no pressure to
top himself lies behind his three years of inactivity since then.
 &HT;    ```Titanic' was definitely a once-in-a-career kind of thing,''
Cameron says. ``Steven Spielberg has spent a career trying to top
`E.T.' (1982), and he's done it. He's done it artistically and done
it financially. So I'm not saying it's likely to happen, but I
don't think it should stop you from trying.
 &HT;    ``Here's the thing,'' Cameron says. ``When you make a feature,
you try to do the best damn movie you can do, bar none, hands down.
It's not like you hold back 5 percent. You are always trying to do
the best _ and the best, in my book, is not just that the movie
satisfies me, but that the movie will satisfy the most people. So
every time I've gone out there, I've tried to do `Titanic.'
 &HT;    ``It just so happens that one time I did it.''
 &HT;    What he'll finally take on as an encore to ``Titanic'' remains
to be seen. In the meantime, though, another ship has come in:
Cameron _ along with Charles Eglee, a longtime friend and Emmy
Award-winning writer and producer _ co-created and will serve as
co-executive producer for ``Dark Angel,'' a sci-fi television
series that will debut on Fox in October. The two-hour pilot has
been penned by Cameron and Eglee.
 &HT;    Set in post-apocalyptic Seattle in 2020, ``Dark Angel'' will
introduce audiences to Max (Jessica Alba), a genetically enhanced
young woman who's been on the run since escaping the compound in
which she was engineered. Though she's kept a low profile working
as a bike messenger, her life forever changes when she encounters
Logan Cale (Michael Weatherly), a cyberjournalist fighting the
corrupt establishment.
 &HT;    Max would prefer to dodge trouble, but joins Cale in the hope of
discovering the truth about herself, staying one step ahead of the
relentless military man (John Savage) who's trying to recapture her
and locating others like herself.
 &HT;    ``The drivers for every episode, and there are two, will be
emotional and moral,'' says Cameron, who's friendly, upbeat and
talkative during a telephone call from his production company's Los
Angeles offices. ``The emotional driver for Max is that she doesn't
have a family and so she wants one. She's the ultimate orphan. She
doesn't even have biological parents _ she has gene-sequence
donors. The only family she's ever known are the other transgenic
children in her group at the clinic.''
 &HT;    As for the moral driver, Cameron explains that Max has been
hardened by her past experiences and by her sense of herself as
different. It's a universal feeling, he says _ all kids, to a
greater or lesser degree, endure a period in their teens when they
feel different from everybody else and think they'll never fit in.
 &HT;    ``They haven't found their place in life yet, don't know what
their values are and don't know what they want to do with the rest
of their life,'' Cameron says. ``Certainly there was always the
head of the football team and the head cheerleader, and they don't
feel like they need to evolve any beyond what they are, but I think
those are the exceptions.
 &HT;    ``So I think what you do with a character like Max is tap into
teen angst, but in a way that's serious drama and not of a cutesy,
lightweight, fun-in-high-school nature,'' he says. ``That's a
distinction between us and `Buffy,' to which we've been compared.
We're dealing with the problems from a psychological basis a little
more seriously.''
 &HT;    That's all well and good, but millions of people out there are
probably scratching their heads and wondering why the
self-professed ``king of the world'' is doing television. After
all, this is the same medium that gave us ``Manimal'' and
``Supertrain'' _ heck, the same network that brought the world
``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?''
 &HT;    ``It would seem to be an odd choice if I was just a director on
it, because television is not really a director's medium,'' Cameron
says. ``But I really was a screenwriter first, last and always. As
a writer, television makes a lot more sense.
 &HT;    ``I think of the first season of `Dark Angel' as a 14-hour
movie,'' he adds. ``In a 14-hour movie you can do a lot more with
the depth of character than you can in, say, a
three-hour-and-15-minute movie, like my last one.
 &HT;    ``Film characters tend not to have a past,'' he says, ``and tend
to rely heavily on casting to create a sense of character. Sandra
Bullock in a movie is a certain character, and the writer doesn't
have to do much. For television, you have much more time to develop
the character, take it on various kinds of journeys and have it
interact with other characters.''
 &HT;    Cameron will be ``pretty involved'' with ``Dark Angel'' after
the pilot airs, but intends to leave the day-to-day line producing
to Eglee. Chances are, however, that he'll pen a future episode or
two, and perhaps even direct one.
 &HT;    Back on the feature front, a ``True Lies'' sequel remains very
much a possibility. On the other hand, Cameron says, ``Terminator
3'' is a dead issue _ even though Arnold Schwarzenegger, after
signing to reprise his signature role, publicly proclaimed his
desire that Cameron call the shots again.
 &HT;    ``That would be wise on his part, but it's not up to him,'' says
Cameron, who also flirted with directing a big-screen
``Spider-Man'' and a new take on ``Planet of the Apes.'' ``It
reached a point where I've moved on. There are other things I want
to be doing.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to hold him up for years and years until I just
one day decide it will be a good idea,'' the director adds. ``I
don't really own it, so there's no real economic imperative for me
to do it, other than pride of authorship.
 &HT;    ``And so I've sat down with Arnold and said, `Look, just go do
the character. You've earned it. You are this guy. Everybody
associates him with you. Go kick ass.'''
 &HT;    Had ``Titanic'' tanked, Cameron acknowledges, he would have
dived back into action in order to prove something to himself.
 &HT;    ``But,'' he says, ``it didn't.''
 &HT;    As a result, Cameron is following his game plan, which involved
making ``one big score'' and then taking some time off to enjoy
life's pleasures.
 &HT;    ``What, I'm going to first enjoy life when I'm 70?'' asks the
46-year-old director, who embarked on his fifth marriage when he
wed ``Titanic'' co-star Suzy Amis in June. ``I don't think so. I
won't be able to do all the things I like to do, fly helicopters,
scuba dive. So I'm going to do all that stuff now and get it out of
the way.
 &HT;    ``And then I can go make movies when I'm 70, because you just
sit in a chair and bark out orders.''

REPRISE: THE UNEXPECTED RETURN OF CAT STEVENS

 (Includes a color slide of singer/songwriter Cat Stevens.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    After more than 20 years of living quietly in England as a
devout Muslim and a spiritual educator, Yusuf Islam has decided to
be Cat Stevens again. Kind of.
 &HT;    The 52-year-old Islam, who hasn't had much to say since retiring
from pop music in 1978, is openly talking about those days again to
promote an ambitious reissue of his 1970s albums, which include
still-popular songs such as ``Wild World'' (1970), ``Morning Has
Broken'' (1971), ``Peace Train'' (1971) and ``Moonshadow'' (1971).
 &HT;    The endeavor also includes a greatest-hits collection, a
boxed-set compilation and possibly an archival live recording.
 &HT;    ``It's an interesting time,'' Islam says. ``For me, it's like
rediscovering perhaps a few of the treasures that I buried in the
past. It's quite a delightful time, in a way _ I'm revisiting the
whole past with more of a perspective, I think, these days and
maybe a little more maturity.
 &HT;    ``I'm quite enjoying this moment.''
 &HT;    Islam hasn't been entirely out of the spotlight since 1978, of
course. In 1988 he prompted a boycott of his records after he sided
with Muslim fundamentalists who had called for the murder of author
Salman Rushdie over his book ``The Satanic Verses.'' The group
10,000 Maniacs protested Islam's stance _ which he had since
retracted _ by pulling its cover of ``Peace Train'' from its album
``In My Tribe.''
 &HT;    More recently, he was denied entry to Israel by government
officials who labeled him a threat to national security because of
his past financial contributions to Hamas, the Palestinian
terrorist organization.
 &HT;    Islam, who had been headed to Israel to film a portion of an
upcoming VH1 ``Behind the Music'' episode about him, denied ever
knowingly supporting terrorists. He claims his contributions were
to aid orphans in the Hebron region and other humanitarian causes,
and calls the accusations ``an attempt to cast doubt again on my
character and good intentions.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, Islam _ who's active in interfaith concerns in
London through his Islamia School, founded in 1983 _ says that he's
now working to help bring about understanding and tolerance between
peoples divided by religious and spiritual issues.
 &HT;    ``I don't necessarily believe that you're going to be able to
merge religions,'' he says, ``but principles certainly can be
agreed upon, and those principles are so clear and so well
understood that I see no difficulty at all in coming to those kinds
of conclusions and agreeing with other of different faiths on those
_ and that is to do with spiritualness itself, to do with divine
presence, with consciousness and mortality, and to do with
accountability.''
 &HT;    Religion wasn't a big part of the life of Stephen Georgiou, who
grew up in London as a bit of a loner, the son of a Greek
restaurateur and a Swedish mother. Smitten with music, he began
performing _ using the name Steve Adams _ while attending
Hammersmith College in London, where he also absorbed early
performances by Cream, Pink Floyd and American acts such as Jimi
Hendrix, James Taylor and Paul Simon.
 &HT;    ``It was a time of great creativity,'' recalls Islam, who admits
that he dabbled in drugs and drink, but not heavily. ``(The
Beatles) had opened so many what you might call windows of
opportunity.
 &HT;    ``I used to go down to a club in London that was frequented by a
guy called Paul Simon,'' Islam says. ``He used to come to our thing
and try a few things out there, and later these became worldwide
hits, like `Homeward Bound' (1965) and `The Sounds of Silence'
(1964). It was an amazing, amazing time for everybody.''
 &HT;    Islam began performing as Cat Stevens in 1966, and scored his
first hit that fall with ``I Love My Dog,'' which reached No. 28 on
the British charts. He logged several other pop hits, but his
career shifted after he contracted tuberculosis in 1968 and, while
recuperating, decided to make a more earthy, folk-tinged kind of
music that also began to reveal a spiritual quest.
 &HT;    ``It was extremely conscious,'' says Islam, who says he was
raised with ``a basic Christian upbringing'' but was turned to
other religions after a friend gave him a Buddhist book, ``The
Secret Path,'' while he was in the hospital. ``At that time there
was definitely a surge of interest in things spiritual and
mystical, you may say. There was flower power and transcendental
meditation going on. There were more questions to life, I felt,
that needed answers.
 &HT;    ``I was looking for the truth,'' he says. ``I suppose Einstein
had a little to play in that, because he'd thrown everything into
the area of relativity. So you think, `Well, can there be absolute
truth?' But I did believe that it existed, somewhat.''
 &HT;    Three decades later, Islam can hear his quest clearly in songs
such as ``I Wish, I Wish'' (1970), ``Miles From Nowhere'' (1970),
``The Wind'' (1971) and ``Morning Has Broken'' _ the latter of
which he found in an old hymn book.
 &HT;    ``It's like a journey,'' he says. ``If you analyze them, in many
places they describe the journey I was on ... I wrote down and
recorded my emotions, my development, my evolution, I would say. I
began as a human being, and I just developed.''
 &HT;    The clearest link to that evolution, Islam says, is in his 1971
hit ``Peace Train.''
 &HT;    ``If you look at the name of my faith, Islam itself, the basic
root of that word is `salaam,' which means `peace,''' he explains.
``Now, when I was writing that song, `Peace Train,' I didn't know
exactly where it was going, but I believe today it's landed in
Islam.
 &HT;    ``And in that song, I realize in some ways that it's not always
going to be easy, even with those who hope for peace,'' Islam adds.
``I said in one of the lyrics, I think, `Why must we go on
hating?/Why can't we live in bliss?' _ in other words, accepting
and realizing not everybody is going to be on that train.''
 &HT;    But after his years in the limelight, Islam is happy simply
being a passenger on that train these days. He almost performed at
the London Live Aid concert in 1985, but was bumped when organizers
told him there was no time _ though he suspects that they were also
afraid of what he might say to the crowd.
 &HT;    He did, however, play last year in Sarajevo, Bosnia, to
commemorate the end of the Bosnian civil war.
 &HT;    But Islam says that he has no interest in being a performing
artist again, and that the new music he's recording _ such as his
latest release, an album and book project called ``A is for Allah''
(2000) _ will be spiritual in nature and focused towards children.
 &HT;    ``I think that they do need more help in understanding this
world than they are being given now,'' says Islam, who notes that
his own five children are ``quite interested'' in the history of
Cat Stevens. ``Look at what's happening in America today, the
killing of one schoolchild by another. It's telling us, isn't it,
that you've got to look at this issue and see what you can teach
children.
 &HT;    ``So instead of teaching `A is for apple' and `Go get it, boys,'
let children learn a little bit more about the creator of apples,''
Islam says, ``and perhaps what might happen is we can help them to
guide their lives a little bit more.
 &HT;    ``I think that's a greater calling than trying to have a hit on
the radio.''

 (Includes a color slide of Jerry Bruckheimer on the set of ``Coyote
Ugly.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    War is hell. And producer Jerry Bruckheimer couldn't be happier.
 &HT;    Bruckheimer is busy filming one of the most expensive, most
anticipated movies in history, the $200 million ``Pearl Harbor,''
due out on Memorial Day, 2001, and he isn't pulling any punches.
 &HT;    ``We had 70 actual survivors of the attack present so we could
make sure we were completely accurate,'' he says over breakfast at
the Ritz-Carlton in Marina Del Ray, Calif. ``It's not a
documentary, but you can get it right.''
 &HT;    Bruckheimer is on a furlough from the Hawaii set, supposedly in
town to promote his latest film, ``Coyote Ugly.'' But ``Pearl
Harbor'' is clearly foremost in his mind.
 &HT;    ``I'm standing there with bombs going off overhead,'' he
recalls, ``and I'd catch a glimpse of the faces of real-life
retired Army men or nurses who were there in the 1940s and maybe
lost someone they loved. You could feel their pain and sorrow at
having to watch this again. You could see their sadness.
 &HT;    ``Just walking around our set, all you needed to do was look
down and it hit you,'' he says soberly. ``You saw the real bullet
holes from the attack still lodged in the ground.''
 &HT;    Ben Affleck and the film's other stars were also given a chance
to experience the reality of it all.
 &HT;    ``We had the real Army Rangers set up a little boot camp for the
actors,'' Bruckheimer says, laughing. ``The sergeant who trained
the cast of `Full Metal Jacket' (1987) scared them half to death.
Ben kept joking, `Don't you know I'm an actor? Don't you know I'm
famous?' It didn't matter.''
 &HT;    As for ``Coyote Ugly,'' opening nationwide on Aug. 4, it's been
dubbed an updated ``Flashdance'' (1983) or ``Cocktail'' (1988) with
girls. Bruckheimer cast unknown Piper Perabo as Violet, a
21-year-old who comes to New York to become a song writer, but
winds up working as a bartender at Coyote Ugly, a bar run by sexy,
young women who tantalize customers with their outrageous antics.
Supermodel Tyra Banks and former ``E.R.'' star Maria Bello play
fellow barmaids.
 &HT;    The bar is a real place, one which Bruckheimer first learned of
in a 1997 GQ article titled ``The Muse of the Coyote Ugly Saloon.''
 &HT;    ``It was about these women trying to survive in the big city,
and it did have elements of `Flashdance' in it,'' Bruckheimer says.
``I also thought it would be great to go out there and hold a
nationwide casting call and find new talent.''
 &HT;    If ``Coyote Ugly'' is heavy on the estrogen, testosterone is the
name of the game in Bruckheimer's fall film, ``Remember the
Titans.'' Set in 1971, it's the story of a high-school football
coach (Denzel Washington) who leads one of the first integrated
football teams in Alexandria, Va.
 &HT;    Throw in his recent hit ``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' and it's clear
that Bruckheimer is one prolific producer _ all the more impressive
in light of the fact that many in Hollywood thought he was finished
after the 1995 death of his longtime partner, Don Simpson.
 &HT;    Bruckheimer was on the set of their co-production ``The Rock''
(1996) when he got a call on his cell phone: ``Don is dead.''
 &HT;    The 52-year-old Simpson, who with Bruckheimer had grossed $1.4
billion worldwide with movies such as ``Flashdance,'' ``Beverly
Hills Cop'' (1984) and ``Top Gun'' (1986), had overdosed from a
lethal combination of cocaine, sedatives, antidepressants and
antipsychotic medications.
 &HT;    It was not an unexpected end for Simpson, one of the most
flamboyantly self-destructive men in Hollywood, but it still came
as a shock to his partner of 13 years.
 &HT;    ``The call was very traumatic, but not a surprise,'' Bruckheimer
says. ``It was a phone call that you hoped you would never get.
But, considering the way Don lived his life, you knew that someday
you would get that call.''
 &HT;    The producer admits that he had his own doubts about his ability
to go it alone.
 &HT;    ``Besides losing a dear friend, it's always great to have
another mind around,'' Bruckheimer says. ``I think it takes more
than two intelligent people to make a successful film. Now I don't
have as much IQ around. And Don was a very smart man.''
 &HT;    Smart, but hardly wise. Freewheeling, free-spending and reckless
in business and in his private life, Simpson had provided the team
with its splash and dash. Bruckheimer was always depicted as the
calm, quiet and sane one, spelling out the contracts for the deals
that Simpson threw together.
 &HT;    ``Don was more high profile,'' the producer says. ``But the
media coverage wasn't always fair. Many journalists didn't check
their sources and just believed what people told them.''
 &HT;    At the time of Simpson's death, the duo was ironically in the
midst of a major career comeback after a rocky stretch in the early
1990s. They'd scored their first hit in years with ``Crimson Tide''
(1995), then continued with a string of blockbusters including
``Dangerous Minds'' (1995), ``Bad Boys'' (1995) and ``The Rock,''
which combined to earn a staggering $376 million.
 &HT;    And then Bruckheimer was suddenly on his own. It would be
understandable if he were angry with Simpson, but today he shows
only sadness in recalling his partner.
 &HT;    ``People end up doing what they want,'' he says. ``Nobody was
going to stop him. You can only guide someone so far.''
 &HT;    It turned out that Bruckheimer was more than capable of carrying
on under his own aegis. ``Con Air'' (1997) was a hit, and
``Armageddon'' (1998) earned more than $300 million worldwide. Not
bad for a man once written off as a paper-shuffler riding on his
partner's coattails.
 &HT;    More to the point, not bad for a shy boy who grew up in Detroit
living for Saturday afternoons at the movies. Today he's immersed
in the world of film, and he says that it doesn't get old _ that,
after nearly 20 years making movies, he's happier than ever doing
it.
 &HT;    ``I love to juggle all the balls at the same time,'' Bruckheimer
says. ``I love to be in the thick of things.''

 (Includes a color slide of Bart Simpson in a scene from ``The
Simpsons.'') 
 By KEN CARRIERE  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before July 30. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few months ago, after another badly played hockey game, my
teammates and I were in the locker room getting changed. It was
late, and we were tired.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the cheap beer or the mild concussions, but we all
started talking about Homer Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, now there's a way to ease the pain.
</P>
<P>
   This was a room full of guys from different backgrounds with
different jobs, but Homer appealed to us all. We repeated favorite
quotes and discussed favorite episodes. Some guys tried to prove
that they were Homer, or claimed that the producers must watch them
to get ideas for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Even after 11 seasons, ``The Simpsons'' is as popular as ever.
And, let's face it, that's largely thanks to the Big Guy. Homer's
where the heart is. He may be fat, bald and dimwitted, but how many
television personalities can get every guy in a locker room talking
excitedly? Outside of some ``Baywatch'' actresses, perhaps, only
Homer.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, some of Homer's biggest fans work on the series.
Mike Scully, who joined the show in 1993, has written seven
episodes and is currently an executive producer, adores the
character as much as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homer represents the kid that exists in every adult male that
we're always being told to leave behind,'' Scully says. ``Homer so
clearly embraces the child within him. I think that's why men in
particular enjoy watching him. I think kids enjoy watching him
because they love watching adults who are idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``The Simpsons'' debuted in 1989, Homer was secondary. The
star was little Bart, an underachiever and proud of it. Homer
existed only to react angrily to Bart. In fact, in the first season
or two, Homer was a responsible grownup and at times even
approached intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   That changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only speculate on it, because I was not with the show at
the time, but I think the general feeling was that he was coming
across too mean and too insensitive,'' Scully says. ``They made him
a little softer and a little more loving toward his family.''
</P>
<P>
   As Homer softened and became the lunatic we know and love, he
also became the star. Basically every episode featured him on a new
adventure. Any episode that featured another character in the lead
was surely meant only to cleanse the palate _ we could rest assured
that Homer would be back next week in fine, foolish form. Bart
joined the other characters _ Marge, Lisa and Maggie Simpson, plus
the other Springfield citizens _ in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was never a conscious change,'' Scully says. ``I think
the show was so focused on Bart in the beginning that a lot of Bart
stories were burned up in the first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``An adult doesn't have the limitations that a kid has,'' he
adds. ``You don't have to stretch believability as much to get him
into certain situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, almost every episode has starred Homer. He became an
astronaut _ and got into a fistfight aboard the space shuttle. He
drove his multimillionaire half-brother into bankruptcy, then
joined a traveling show because he was willing to take a cannonball
in the gut.
</P>
<P>
   Marge: ``Just because you were invited to join a freak show
doesn't mean you have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Homer, staring blankly: ``You know, in some ways you and I are
very different people.''
</P>
<P>
   As Scully says, Homer represents the kid inside every man, the
kid we try not to reveal to our wives or girlfriends, even though
they know. As sad as it may be, men can live vicariously through
this beloved yellow blob. He's our Holden Caulfield _ Holden
ditches school, Homer ditches work, but they both do what they
want.
</P>
<P>
   As the Great One says to Marge in a 1998 episode: ``I don't
think anything I've ever done is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In some episodes, that abounding confidence has led Homer into
strange territory. Does Scully think that the writers ever took
Homer too far?
</P>
<P>
   ``As a moron?'' he says with a laugh. ``I'm sure we've crossed
the line with Homer a few times in terms of how stupid he might be
in a given situation. I think whenever you're doing a character
like Homer and you're walking that line of idiocy, you can't help
but cross it here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Simpsons writers have some rules about how to
deal with the Big Guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My basic rule is that he should always at least know his
name,'' Scully says. ``John Swartzwelder, who has written for the
show since the first season, says that he writes Homer like a dog
who can talk. In one scene, Homer can go through seven or eight
different emotions, just like a dog. He can go from sleeping to
eating in a matter of seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it: The ``Simpsons'' writers think about a
talking dog when they write for Homer, and then men the world over
strive to measure up.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, for anyone who loves Homer, Harper Collins will
release the book ``Homer's Guide to Being a Man'' in April 2001. It
will include quotations from the series and some newly written
material.
</P>
<P>
   Next season is sure to offer more classic Homer episodes. In the
Nov. 5 season premiere, for example, which happens to be the
series' 250th episode, Homer grows enraged when the telephone
company splits Springfield into two area codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What infuriates Homer,'' Scully says, ``is that he has to
memorize three new numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Homer incites a civic civil war. To the rescue,
thank goodness, come the classic British rockers The Who to restore
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they have done for so many cities,'' Scully adds.
</P>
<P>
   Although Homer is crazy, stupid, selfish, inconsiderate and
drunk most of the time, he's still a nice guy. That's why we really
love him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's well-established now that Homer really does love
his family,'' Scully says. ``No matter what he says or what he
does, you know where his heart is.''

 (Includes a color slide of director James Cameron on the set of
``Titanic.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 EDITOR'S NOTE: Possibly objectionable language in 5th and 22nd
paragraphs. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    James Cameron is not David O. Selznick.
 &HT;    The legendary producer spent a huge chunk of his career trying
in vain to top ``Gone With The Wind'' (1939), which had won eight
Oscars and become the most successful film ever made to that time.
Even winning a second straight Best Picture Oscar for ``Rebecca''
(1940) didn't ease Selznick's futile compulsion to top himself.
 &HT;    Writer/director Cameron famously declared himself ``the king of
the world'' when ``Titanic'' (1997) copped a Best Picture Oscar of
its own, capping a triumphant run for the film which now stands as
the most successful ever made. But he insists that no pressure to
top himself lies behind his three years of inactivity since then.
 &HT;    ```Titanic' was definitely a once-in-a-career kind of thing,''
Cameron says. ``Steven Spielberg has spent a career trying to top
`E.T.' (1982), and he's done it. He's done it artistically and done
it financially. So I'm not saying it's likely to happen, but I
don't think it should stop you from trying.
 &HT;    ``Here's the thing,'' Cameron says. ``When you make a feature,
you try to do the best damn movie you can do, bar none, hands down.
It's not like you hold back 5 percent. You are always trying to do
the best _ and the best, in my book, is not just that the movie
satisfies me, but that the movie will satisfy the most people. So
every time I've gone out there, I've tried to do `Titanic.'
 &HT;    ``It just so happens that one time I did it.''
 &HT;    What he'll finally take on as an encore to ``Titanic'' remains
to be seen. In the meantime, though, another ship has come in:
Cameron _ along with Charles Eglee, a longtime friend and Emmy
Award-winning writer and producer _ co-created and will serve as
co-executive producer for ``Dark Angel,'' a sci-fi television
series that will debut on Fox in October. The two-hour pilot has
been penned by Cameron and Eglee.
 &HT;    Set in post-apocalyptic Seattle in 2020, ``Dark Angel'' will
introduce audiences to Max (Jessica Alba), a genetically enhanced
young woman who's been on the run since escaping the compound in
which she was engineered. Though she's kept a low profile working
as a bike messenger, her life forever changes when she encounters
Logan Cale (Michael Weatherly), a cyberjournalist fighting the
corrupt establishment.
 &HT;    Max would prefer to dodge trouble, but joins Cale in the hope of
discovering the truth about herself, staying one step ahead of the
relentless military man (John Savage) who's trying to recapture her
and locating others like herself.
 &HT;    ``The drivers for every episode, and there are two, will be
emotional and moral,'' says Cameron, who's friendly, upbeat and
talkative during a telephone call from his production company's Los
Angeles offices. ``The emotional driver for Max is that she doesn't
have a family and so she wants one. She's the ultimate orphan. She
doesn't even have biological parents _ she has gene-sequence
donors. The only family she's ever known are the other transgenic
children in her group at the clinic.''
 &HT;    As for the moral driver, Cameron explains that Max has been
hardened by her past experiences and by her sense of herself as
different. It's a universal feeling, he says _ all kids, to a
greater or lesser degree, endure a period in their teens when they
feel different from everybody else and think they'll never fit in.
 &HT;    ``They haven't found their place in life yet, don't know what
their values are and don't know what they want to do with the rest
of their life,'' Cameron says. ``Certainly there was always the
head of the football team and the head cheerleader, and they don't
feel like they need to evolve any beyond what they are, but I think
those are the exceptions.
 &HT;    ``So I think what you do with a character like Max is tap into
teen angst, but in a way that's serious drama and not of a cutesy,
lightweight, fun-in-high-school nature,'' he says. ``That's a
distinction between us and `Buffy,' to which we've been compared.
We're dealing with the problems from a psychological basis a little
more seriously.''
 &HT;    That's all well and good, but millions of people out there are
probably scratching their heads and wondering why the
self-professed ``king of the world'' is doing television. After
all, this is the same medium that gave us ``Manimal'' and
``Supertrain'' _ heck, the same network that brought the world
``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?''
 &HT;    ``It would seem to be an odd choice if I was just a director on
it, because television is not really a director's medium,'' Cameron
says. ``But I really was a screenwriter first, last and always. As
a writer, television makes a lot more sense.
 &HT;    ``I think of the first season of `Dark Angel' as a 14-hour
movie,'' he adds. ``In a 14-hour movie you can do a lot more with
the depth of character than you can in, say, a
three-hour-and-15-minute movie, like my last one.
 &HT;    ``Film characters tend not to have a past,'' he says, ``and tend
to rely heavily on casting to create a sense of character. Sandra
Bullock in a movie is a certain character, and the writer doesn't
have to do much. For television, you have much more time to develop
the character, take it on various kinds of journeys and have it
interact with other characters.''
 &HT;    Cameron will be ``pretty involved'' with ``Dark Angel'' after
the pilot airs, but intends to leave the day-to-day line producing
to Eglee. Chances are, however, that he'll pen a future episode or
two, and perhaps even direct one.
 &HT;    Back on the feature front, a ``True Lies'' sequel remains very
much a possibility. On the other hand, Cameron says, ``Terminator
3'' is a dead issue _ even though Arnold Schwarzenegger, after
signing to reprise his signature role, publicly proclaimed his
desire that Cameron call the shots again.
 &HT;    ``That would be wise on his part, but it's not up to him,'' says
Cameron, who also flirted with directing a big-screen
``Spider-Man'' and a new take on ``Planet of the Apes.'' ``It
reached a point where I've moved on. There are other things I want
to be doing.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to hold him up for years and years until I just
one day decide it will be a good idea,'' the director adds. ``I
don't really own it, so there's no real economic imperative for me
to do it, other than pride of authorship.
 &HT;    ``And so I've sat down with Arnold and said, `Look, just go do
the character. You've earned it. You are this guy. Everybody
associates him with you. Go kick ass.'''
 &HT;    Had ``Titanic'' tanked, Cameron acknowledges, he would have
dived back into action in order to prove something to himself.
 &HT;    ``But,'' he says, ``it didn't.''
 &HT;    As a result, Cameron is following his game plan, which involved
making ``one big score'' and then taking some time off to enjoy
life's pleasures.
 &HT;    ``What, I'm going to first enjoy life when I'm 70?'' asks the
46-year-old director, who embarked on his fifth marriage when he
wed ``Titanic'' co-star Suzy Amis in June. ``I don't think so. I
won't be able to do all the things I like to do, fly helicopters,
scuba dive. So I'm going to do all that stuff now and get it out of
the way.
 &HT;    ``And then I can go make movies when I'm 70, because you just
sit in a chair and bark out orders.''

REPRISE: THE UNEXPECTED RETURN OF CAT STEVENS

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of singer/songwriter Cat Stevens.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    After more than 20 years of living quietly in England as a
devout Muslim and a spiritual educator, Yusuf Islam has decided to
be Cat Stevens again. Kind of.
 &HT;    The 52-year-old Islam, who hasn't had much to say since retiring
from pop music in 1978, is openly talking about those days again to
promote an ambitious reissue of his 1970s albums, which include
still-popular songs such as ``Wild World'' (1970), ``Morning Has
Broken'' (1971), ``Peace Train'' (1971) and ``Moonshadow'' (1971).
 &HT;    The endeavor also includes a greatest-hits collection, a
boxed-set compilation and possibly an archival live recording.
 &HT;    ``It's an interesting time,'' Islam says. ``For me, it's like
rediscovering perhaps a few of the treasures that I buried in the
past. It's quite a delightful time, in a way _ I'm revisiting the
whole past with more of a perspective, I think, these days and
maybe a little more maturity.
 &HT;    ``I'm quite enjoying this moment.''
 &HT;    Islam hasn't been entirely out of the spotlight since 1978, of
course. In 1988 he prompted a boycott of his records after he sided
with Muslim fundamentalists who had called for the murder of author
Salman Rushdie over his book ``The Satanic Verses.'' The group
10,000 Maniacs protested Islam's stance _ which he had since
retracted _ by pulling its cover of ``Peace Train'' from its album
``In My Tribe.''
 &HT;    More recently, he was denied entry to Israel by government
officials who labeled him a threat to national security because of
his past financial contributions to Hamas, the Palestinian
terrorist organization.
 &HT;    Islam, who had been headed to Israel to film a portion of an
upcoming VH1 ``Behind the Music'' episode about him, denied ever
knowingly supporting terrorists. He claims his contributions were
to aid orphans in the Hebron region and other humanitarian causes,
and calls the accusations ``an attempt to cast doubt again on my
character and good intentions.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, Islam _ who's active in interfaith concerns in
London through his Islamia School, founded in 1983 _ says that he's
now working to help bring about understanding and tolerance between
peoples divided by religious and spiritual issues.
 &HT;    ``I don't necessarily believe that you're going to be able to
merge religions,'' he says, ``but principles certainly can be
agreed upon, and those principles are so clear and so well
understood that I see no difficulty at all in coming to those kinds
of conclusions and agreeing with other of different faiths on those
_ and that is to do with spiritualness itself, to do with divine
presence, with consciousness and mortality, and to do with
accountability.''
 &HT;    Religion wasn't a big part of the life of Stephen Georgiou, who
grew up in London as a bit of a loner, the son of a Greek
restaurateur and a Swedish mother. Smitten with music, he began
performing _ using the name Steve Adams _ while attending
Hammersmith College in London, where he also absorbed early
performances by Cream, Pink Floyd and American acts such as Jimi
Hendrix, James Taylor and Paul Simon.
 &HT;    ``It was a time of great creativity,'' recalls Islam, who admits
that he dabbled in drugs and drink, but not heavily. ``(The
Beatles) had opened so many what you might call windows of
opportunity.
 &HT;    ``I used to go down to a club in London that was frequented by a
guy called Paul Simon,'' Islam says. ``He used to come to our thing
and try a few things out there, and later these became worldwide
hits, like `Homeward Bound' (1965) and `The Sounds of Silence'
(1964). It was an amazing, amazing time for everybody.''
 &HT;    Islam began performing as Cat Stevens in 1966, and scored his
first hit that fall with ``I Love My Dog,'' which reached No. 28 on
the British charts. He logged several other pop hits, but his
career shifted after he contracted tuberculosis in 1968 and, while
recuperating, decided to make a more earthy, folk-tinged kind of
music that also began to reveal a spiritual quest.
 &HT;    ``It was extremely conscious,'' says Islam, who says he was
raised with ``a basic Christian upbringing'' but was turned to
other religions after a friend gave him a Buddhist book, ``The
Secret Path,'' while he was in the hospital. ``At that time there
was definitely a surge of interest in things spiritual and
mystical, you may say. There was flower power and transcendental
meditation going on. There were more questions to life, I felt,
that needed answers.
 &HT;    ``I was looking for the truth,'' he says. ``I suppose Einstein
had a little to play in that, because he'd thrown everything into
the area of relativity. So you think, `Well, can there be absolute
truth?' But I did believe that it existed, somewhat.''
 &HT;    Three decades later, Islam can hear his quest clearly in songs
such as ``I Wish, I Wish'' (1970), ``Miles From Nowhere'' (1970),
``The Wind'' (1971) and ``Morning Has Broken'' _ the latter of
which he found in an old hymn book.
 &HT;    ``It's like a journey,'' he says. ``If you analyze them, in many
places they describe the journey I was on ... I wrote down and
recorded my emotions, my development, my evolution, I would say. I
began as a human being, and I just developed.''
 &HT;    The clearest link to that evolution, Islam says, is in his 1971
hit ``Peace Train.''
 &HT;    ``If you look at the name of my faith, Islam itself, the basic
root of that word is `salaam,' which means `peace,''' he explains.
``Now, when I was writing that song, `Peace Train,' I didn't know
exactly where it was going, but I believe today it's landed in
Islam.
 &HT;    ``And in that song, I realize in some ways that it's not always
going to be easy, even with those who hope for peace,'' Islam adds.
``I said in one of the lyrics, I think, `Why must we go on
hating?/Why can't we live in bliss?' _ in other words, accepting
and realizing not everybody is going to be on that train.''
 &HT;    But after his years in the limelight, Islam is happy simply
being a passenger on that train these days. He almost performed at
the London Live Aid concert in 1985, but was bumped when organizers
told him there was no time _ though he suspects that they were also
afraid of what he might say to the crowd.
 &HT;    He did, however, play last year in Sarajevo, Bosnia, to
commemorate the end of the Bosnian civil war.
 &HT;    But Islam says that he has no interest in being a performing
artist again, and that the new music he's recording _ such as his
latest release, an album and book project called ``A is for Allah''
(2000) _ will be spiritual in nature and focused towards children.
 &HT;    ``I think that they do need more help in understanding this
world than they are being given now,'' says Islam, who notes that
his own five children are ``quite interested'' in the history of
Cat Stevens. ``Look at what's happening in America today, the
killing of one schoolchild by another. It's telling us, isn't it,
that you've got to look at this issue and see what you can teach
children.
 &HT;    ``So instead of teaching `A is for apple' and `Go get it, boys,'
let children learn a little bit more about the creator of apples,''
Islam says, ``and perhaps what might happen is we can help them to
guide their lives a little bit more.
 &HT;    ``I think that's a greater calling than trying to have a hit on
the radio.''

 (Includes a color slide of Jerry Bruckheimer on the set of ``Coyote
Ugly.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    War is hell. And producer Jerry Bruckheimer couldn't be happier.
 &HT;    Bruckheimer is busy filming one of the most expensive, most
anticipated movies in history, the $200 million ``Pearl Harbor,''
due out on Memorial Day, 2001, and he isn't pulling any punches.
 &HT;    ``We had 70 actual survivors of the attack present so we could
make sure we were completely accurate,'' he says over breakfast at
the Ritz-Carlton in Marina Del Ray, Calif. ``It's not a
documentary, but you can get it right.''
 &HT;    Bruckheimer is on a furlough from the Hawaii set, supposedly in
town to promote his latest film, ``Coyote Ugly.'' But ``Pearl
Harbor'' is clearly foremost in his mind.
 &HT;    ``I'm standing there with bombs going off overhead,'' he
recalls, ``and I'd catch a glimpse of the faces of real-life
retired Army men or nurses who were there in the 1940s and maybe
lost someone they loved. You could feel their pain and sorrow at
having to watch this again. You could see their sadness.
 &HT;    ``Just walking around our set, all you needed to do was look
down and it hit you,'' he says soberly. ``You saw the real bullet
holes from the attack still lodged in the ground.''
 &HT;    Ben Affleck and the film's other stars were also given a chance
to experience the reality of it all.
 &HT;    ``We had the real Army Rangers set up a little boot camp for the
actors,'' Bruckheimer says, laughing. ``The sergeant who trained
the cast of `Full Metal Jacket' (1987) scared them half to death.
Ben kept joking, `Don't you know I'm an actor? Don't you know I'm
famous?' It didn't matter.''
 &HT;    As for ``Coyote Ugly,'' opening nationwide on Aug. 4, it's been
dubbed an updated ``Flashdance'' (1983) or ``Cocktail'' (1988) with
girls. Bruckheimer cast unknown Piper Perabo as Violet, a
21-year-old who comes to New York to become a song writer, but
winds up working as a bartender at Coyote Ugly, a bar run by sexy,
young women who tantalize customers with their outrageous antics.
Supermodel Tyra Banks and former ``E.R.'' star Maria Bello play
fellow barmaids.
 &HT;    The bar is a real place, one which Bruckheimer first learned of
in a 1997 GQ article titled ``The Muse of the Coyote Ugly Saloon.''
 &HT;    ``It was about these women trying to survive in the big city,
and it did have elements of `Flashdance' in it,'' Bruckheimer says.
``I also thought it would be great to go out there and hold a
nationwide casting call and find new talent.''
 &HT;    If ``Coyote Ugly'' is heavy on the estrogen, testosterone is the
name of the game in Bruckheimer's fall film, ``Remember the
Titans.'' Set in 1971, it's the story of a high-school football
coach (Denzel Washington) who leads one of the first integrated
football teams in Alexandria, Va.
 &HT;    Throw in his recent hit ``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' and it's clear
that Bruckheimer is one prolific producer _ all the more impressive
in light of the fact that many in Hollywood thought he was finished
after the 1995 death of his longtime partner, Don Simpson.
 &HT;    Bruckheimer was on the set of their co-production ``The Rock''
(1996) when he got a call on his cell phone: ``Don is dead.''
 &HT;    The 52-year-old Simpson, who with Bruckheimer had grossed $1.4
billion worldwide with movies such as ``Flashdance,'' ``Beverly
Hills Cop'' (1984) and ``Top Gun'' (1986), had overdosed from a
lethal combination of cocaine, sedatives, antidepressants and
antipsychotic medications.
 &HT;    It was not an unexpected end for Simpson, one of the most
flamboyantly self-destructive men in Hollywood, but it still came
as a shock to his partner of 13 years.
 &HT;    ``The call was very traumatic, but not a surprise,'' Bruckheimer
says. ``It was a phone call that you hoped you would never get.
But, considering the way Don lived his life, you knew that someday
you would get that call.''
 &HT;    The producer admits that he had his own doubts about his ability
to go it alone.
 &HT;    ``Besides losing a dear friend, it's always great to have
another mind around,'' Bruckheimer says. ``I think it takes more
than two intelligent people to make a successful film. Now I don't
have as much IQ around. And Don was a very smart man.''
 &HT;    Smart, but hardly wise. Freewheeling, free-spending and reckless
in business and in his private life, Simpson had provided the team
with its splash and dash. Bruckheimer was always depicted as the
calm, quiet and sane one, spelling out the contracts for the deals
that Simpson threw together.
 &HT;    ``Don was more high profile,'' the producer says. ``But the
media coverage wasn't always fair. Many journalists didn't check
their sources and just believed what people told them.''
 &HT;    At the time of Simpson's death, the duo was ironically in the
midst of a major career comeback after a rocky stretch in the early
1990s. They'd scored their first hit in years with ``Crimson Tide''
(1995), then continued with a string of blockbusters including
``Dangerous Minds'' (1995), ``Bad Boys'' (1995) and ``The Rock,''
which combined to earn a staggering $376 million.
 &HT;    And then Bruckheimer was suddenly on his own. It would be
understandable if he were angry with Simpson, but today he shows
only sadness in recalling his partner.
 &HT;    ``People end up doing what they want,'' he says. ``Nobody was
going to stop him. You can only guide someone so far.''
 &HT;    It turned out that Bruckheimer was more than capable of carrying
on under his own aegis. ``Con Air'' (1997) was a hit, and
``Armageddon'' (1998) earned more than $300 million worldwide. Not
bad for a man once written off as a paper-shuffler riding on his
partner's coattails.
 &HT;    More to the point, not bad for a shy boy who grew up in Detroit
living for Saturday afternoons at the movies. Today he's immersed
in the world of film, and he says that it doesn't get old _ that,
after nearly 20 years making movies, he's happier than ever doing
it.
 &HT;    ``I love to juggle all the balls at the same time,'' Bruckheimer
says. ``I love to be in the thick of things.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A few months ago, after another badly played hockey game, my
teammates and I were in the locker room getting changed. It was
late, and we were tired.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the cheap beer or the mild concussions, but we all
started talking about Homer Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, now there's a way to ease the pain.
</P>
<P>
   This was a room full of guys from different backgrounds with
different jobs, but Homer appealed to us all. We repeated favorite
quotes and discussed favorite episodes. Some guys tried to prove
that they were Homer, or claimed that the producers must watch them
to get ideas for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Even after 11 seasons, ``The Simpsons'' is as popular as ever.
And, let's face it, that's largely thanks to the Big Guy. Homer's
where the heart is. He may be fat, bald and dimwitted, but how many
television personalities can get every guy in a locker room talking
excitedly? Outside of some ``Baywatch'' actresses, perhaps, only
Homer.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, some of Homer's biggest fans work on the series.
Mike Scully, who joined the show in 1993, has written seven
episodes and is currently an executive producer, adores the
character as much as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homer represents the kid that exists in every adult male that
we're always being told to leave behind,'' Scully says. ``Homer so
clearly embraces the child within him. I think that's why men in
particular enjoy watching him. I think kids enjoy watching him
because they love watching adults who are idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``The Simpsons'' debuted in 1989, Homer was secondary. The
star was little Bart, an underachiever and proud of it. Homer
existed only to react angrily to Bart. In fact, in the first season
or two, Homer was a responsible grownup and at times even
approached intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   That changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only speculate on it, because I was not with the show at
the time, but I think the general feeling was that he was coming
across too mean and too insensitive,'' Scully says. ``They made him
a little softer and a little more loving toward his family.''
</P>
<P>
   As Homer softened and became the lunatic we know and love, he
also became the star. Basically every episode featured him on a new
adventure. Any episode that featured another character in the lead
was surely meant only to cleanse the palate _ we could rest assured
that Homer would be back next week in fine, foolish form. Bart
joined the other characters _ Marge, Lisa and Maggie Simpson, plus
the other Springfield citizens _ in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was never a conscious change,'' Scully says. ``I think
the show was so focused on Bart in the beginning that a lot of Bart
stories were burned up in the first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``An adult doesn't have the limitations that a kid has,'' he
adds. ``You don't have to stretch believability as much to get him
into certain situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, almost every episode has starred Homer. He became an
astronaut _ and got into a fistfight aboard the space shuttle. He
drove his multimillionaire half-brother into bankruptcy, then
joined a traveling show because he was willing to take a cannonball
in the gut.
</P>
<P>
   Marge: ``Just because you were invited to join a freak show
doesn't mean you have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Homer, staring blankly: ``You know, in some ways you and I are
very different people.''
</P>
<P>
   As Scully says, Homer represents the kid inside every man, the
kid we try not to reveal to our wives or girlfriends, even though
they know. As sad as it may be, men can live vicariously through
this beloved yellow blob. He's our Holden Caulfield _ Holden
ditches school, Homer ditches work, but they both do what they
want.
</P>
<P>
   As the Great One says to Marge in a 1998 episode: ``I don't
think anything I've ever done is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In some episodes, that abounding confidence has led Homer into
strange territory. Does Scully think that the writers ever took
Homer too far?
</P>
<P>
   ``As a moron?'' he says with a laugh. ``I'm sure we've crossed
the line with Homer a few times in terms of how stupid he might be
in a given situation. I think whenever you're doing a character
like Homer and you're walking that line of idiocy, you can't help
but cross it here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Simpsons writers have some rules about how to
deal with the Big Guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My basic rule is that he should always at least know his
name,'' Scully says. ``John Swartzwelder, who has written for the
show since the first season, says that he writes Homer like a dog
who can talk. In one scene, Homer can go through seven or eight
different emotions, just like a dog. He can go from sleeping to
eating in a matter of seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it: The ``Simpsons'' writers think about a
talking dog when they write for Homer, and then men the world over
strive to measure up.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, for anyone who loves Homer, Harper Collins will
release the book ``Homer's Guide to Being a Man'' in April 2001. It
will include quotations from the series and some newly written
material.
</P>
<P>
   Next season is sure to offer more classic Homer episodes. In the
Nov. 5 season premiere, for example, which happens to be the
series' 250th episode, Homer grows enraged when the telephone
company splits Springfield into two area codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What infuriates Homer,'' Scully says, ``is that he has to
memorize three new numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Homer incites a civic civil war. To the rescue,
thank goodness, come the classic British rockers The Who to restore
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they have done for so many cities,'' Scully adds.
</P>
<P>
   Although Homer is crazy, stupid, selfish, inconsiderate and
drunk most of the time, he's still a nice guy. That's why we really
love him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's well-established now that Homer really does love
his family,'' Scully says. ``No matter what he says or what he
does, you know where his heart is.''

<P>
   The speculation continues about George W. Bush's choice of a
running mate. Former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is believed to
be the latest front-runner - but Bush aides say there could still
be a surprise choice. Like Colin Powell. Dan Rather reported on CBS
Radio that two sources who are ``close in on the negotiations''
said that both the Texas governor and his father, the former
president, have been in touch with Powell ``very recently'' and
that Powell's wife, Alma, apparently has dropped her objections to
his running for national office. CNN and Reuters, however, report
that Powell's office denied the CBS report. The Washington Post
reports Bush has settled on Cheney. We may know for sure any time
now.
</P>
<P>
   HOW DOES SENATOR MILLER SOUND?
</P>
<P>
   Zell Miller, the popular ex-two-term Democratic governor of
Georgia, is expected to be appointed by Gov. Roy Barnes to the late
Republican Paul Coverdell's Senate seat and run for the remaining
four years of the term in November. The Associated Press reported
that Barnes would make the announcement tonight. Georgia law gives
the governor the right to appoint a successor. Coverdell, 61, the
first Georgia Republican since Reconstruction to be re-elected to
the Senate, died of a stroke last week. The appointment of Miller,
68, would reduce the Republican edge in the Senate to 54-46.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA CLUB PICKS ITS MAN
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has formally picked up the support of a major
environmental group. Accepting the Sierra Club's endorsement in
Grand Rapids, Mich., Gore promised to ``to protect the air, the
water and the planet God gave us. I want you to know that's a cause
I have held for my entire life, long before I entered public
service.'' The Sierra endorsement was a product of a six-month
process that reviewed the records of all the
</P>
<P>
   candidates and surveyed all chapters nationwide. The
organization's president, Robert Cox, said Gore would be ``the most
pro-environment president in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   LOG CABIN EFFORT PAYS OFF
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona is set to make history next week when
he'll become the first openly gay member of Congress to address a
Republican convention. Kolbe will have a prime-time speaking slot,
addressing the GOP on trade issues for three minutes between 8 and
8:30 p.m. on Tuesday. First elected in 1984, Kolbe is the most
senior openly gay member of Congress and is the only openly gay
Republican in the House. Having Kolbe speak at the convention was
an idea first raised by District of Columbia Councilman David
Catania in April, when the Log Cabin Republicans met with George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   OLD FRIENDS ON FINAL NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Jan Bullock, the widow of Texas Democratic political icon Bob
Bullock, will be one of several fellow Texans who will speak about
George W. Bush on the final night of the Republican convention.
``On Thursday night, we will have people speak who know him well
and know different aspects of him, and Jan is part of that,'' the
Associated Press quoted an unnamed official as saying. Bob Bullock,
who died in June 1999, was a former powerful Democratic lieutenant
governor who forged a close relationship with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   PHILLY UNIONS, CITY STILL BARGAINING
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia city officials resumed talks with two unions today
with a strike deadline approaching and less than a week before the
Republican National Convention. Talks with District Council 47 of
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees,
the white-collar union, and District Council 33, the blue-collar
workers, bargained until after midnight, then resumed at late
morning after the negotiators got some sleep. In 1986, a three-week
municipal workers strike left museums, libraries and recreation
centers closed, streets piled with garbage, and water-main repairs
and other services delayed.
</P>
<P>
   TWO IDEAS HEADLONG IN CONFLICT
</P>
<P>
   Associated Press interviews with most of the 2,066 Republican
convention delegates show that tension over abortion rights is
deeply embedded in the party despite a wish by both sides to avoid
an argument that could complicate George W. Bush's chances of
becoming president. When Republicans meet in Philadelphia this week
to write party policy, some of them will be energized by two
opposing ideas that are long on conviction but short on
practicality: One is that the nation might be persuaded to amend
the Constitution to ban abortion. The other is that the GOP might
actually be persuaded to stop calling for that goal.
</P>
<P>
   POPULIST THEME FOR CONVENTION
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's campaign laid out a theme for the convention that
credits the vice president for the nation's prosperity and casts
him as a populist fighter against powerful interest groups, and
attempts to define George W. Bush as a tool of the oil industry and
other special interests. Still, Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said
the main focus would be on the Gore's agenda and personal
background. Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said Republicans ``will
welcome their theme as an opportunity to highlight the failures of
the Clinton-Gore administration.''
</P>
<P>
   MONEY THE STRONGEST MEDICINE
</P>
<P>
   With billions of dollars in profits on the line, the health care
industry is waging the largest national ad campaign conducted by a
political special interest, with a price tag for this election
cycle that could approach $90 million. Already, leading
pharmaceutical companies have spent about $34 million on ads since
last July. The drug makers are fighting a plan to expand Medicare
by adding prescription drug coverage. Managed-care companies
opposed to proposals such as a right for patients to sue are also
pouring lots of cash into political ads.
</P>
<P>
   THINNER GOP SENATE EDGE?
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidates have more money to spend on close Senate
races this fall, but Democrats are financially competitive in most
of the tightest contests, according to recently filed midyear
fund-raising reports. Coupled with the fact that the death last
week of Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) has thrown another seat into
contention for the November elections, the new reports reinforce
widely held expectations that Democrats will pick up several Senate
seats. Some analysts say the Democrats could gain as many as four
seats, reducing the GOP edge to 51-49.
</P>
<P>
   GUNS DON'T KILL PEOPLE, BULLETS DO
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans heading to their national conventions
stand far apart on whether gun controls should be tougher, yet many
from both sides agree handguns should come with trigger locks,
according to interviews by the Associated Press. Four in 10
Republican delegates and eight in 10 Democratic delegates back the
safety devices. On gun control laws, however, 68 percent of
Democrats say current measures need to be stronger, while nearly as
many Republicans _ 61 percent_ say the laws are ``about right.''
</P>
<P>
   NO, NOT THE SOUP, THE CANDIDATE
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Tom Campbell has gained no headway in his bid to
unseat Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, according to a San
Francisco Examiner-KTVU poll showing that one-third of state voters
still don't recognize his name. Campbell campaign officials said
they planned to unleash ads this summer that will help the moderate
Silicon Valley congressman turn the numbers around. The poll,
conducted by Research 2000 of Maryland with a 3.5 percentage point
margin of error, showed Feinstein with a formidable 57-34 percent
lead. The poll also found that 26 percent of Republicans said they
preferred Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   YOU KNOW THOSE CLINTONS (WINK, WINK)
</P>
<P>
   The chief campaign strategist for New York Senate candidate Rick
Lazio said he believes Hillary Clinton's assertion that she did not
use an anti-Semitic slur in 1974, but he added that she has a
``credibility problem.'' Said Mike Murphy: ``I have no way to know.
I will believe her denial, but I will say, and I think most New
Yorkers will say, there's an unease about trustworthiness of Mrs.
Clinton, because there's such a history of spin taken to the
ultimate with the Clintons, that she has a credibility problem.''

A PORTRAIT OF HEROISM IS REDRAWN, WITH THE SUBJECT'S HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PADUCAH, Ky. _ He was the teen-age hero who turned a
horrifying school shooting into a parable of good against evil. His
name is Ben Strong, the gregarious son of a preacher who was said
to have displayed remarkable courage when he disarmed Michael
Carneal, the 14-year-old killer who opened fire on a prayer group
at Heath High School here on Dec. 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the shooting, Strong, an appealing high school
senior, was a regular on national television, where he was
portrayed as a symbol of hope. His inspirational story of
confronting the killer was repeated in newspapers across the
country, including this one. Since then, he has been the subject of
cover articles in magazines and has traveled the country preaching
to young people. Now 20, and working at his father's Assembly of
God Church, he is often introduced as the hero of Heath High.
</P>
<P>
   But as new information about the events that morning is starting
to emerge because of a civil lawsuit, some people here are openly
challenging the portrait of Strong as a hero who rushed up to a
killer as he was firing and persuaded him to drop the gun he had
used to murder three girls and wound five other students. In a
brief interview recently, even Strong acknowledged for the first
time to a reporter that the heroic picture of him might have been
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he said in the interview, ``people get the wrong
idea.'' In terse answers to questions, he agreed that he had not
taken the gun away from Carneal, as he sometimes suggested after
the shooting, and he agreed that he might not have influenced
Carneal at all in his decision to stop shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Ben Strong story shows how chaos and panic can distort the
accounts that witnesses give of the rampage killings that
periodically horrify the country. It may show, too, how the stories
of the killings are often shaped by the powerful desire of
reporters and everyone else involved to find some good news, even
signs of heroism, in horrible, inexplicable events.
</P>
<P>
   A striking finding from a New York Times examination of rampage
killings, published in April, is that long after the news media
depart, a different story of the events often emerges. Usually, the
first accounts present inaccurate information about the killer, the
crime, the victims or the roles of bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   After the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, for example,
one student, Cassie Bernall, was widely described as having
answered ``yes'' when one of the two killers asked her whether she
believed in God. She was killed, it was said, for her faith.
</P>
<P>
   After that account put her in the realm of martyrdom and spawned
a best-selling book, some news accounts last year reported that the
``yes'' most likely came from another student, Valeen Schnurr, who
survived.
</P>
<P>
   At Heath High School, the news media took their lead from Bill
J. Bond, the principal at the time of the shooting. Bond was the
first person to tell reporters that a prayerful senior who was a
football player, Benjamin Scott Strong, had probably saved lives,
including Bond's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world wants a hero,'' Bond said in a recent
interview. ``It is natural to look for some goodness in a tragedy
and I probably contributed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony filed in McCracken County Circuit Court here this
spring, Strong said he had won praise for his bravery ``because of
what people said, how things were portrayed'' after the shooting,
not what really happened.
</P>
<P>
   In the deposition for the civil suit filed by the families of
the three murdered girls, Strong testified this winter that the
killer had discarded the gun on his own. ``He just got done, and he
dropped it,'' Strong said. His testimony has received little public
notice.
</P>
<P>
   Carneal, who is serving a life sentence after pleading guilty
but mentally ill to murder, also testified in the suit. When a
lawyer asked whether Strong had stopped him from shooting he
replied, ``No sir.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bond was told in a recent interview about Strong's newly
released testimony, he said information about Strong's actions had
come from Strong initially and had always been somewhat imprecise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him what he did,'' Bond said, ``and he said, `I told
him to lay the gun down,' and I took that at face value.''
</P>
<P>
   With scores of reporters pressing around the school the
afternoon of the shooting, Bond said, the story of Strong's actions
may have been exaggerated and ``it probably developed a life of its
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong helped the story along. Within hours of the shooting, he
was giving interviews and standing by as reporters described him as
the leader of the prayer group, a title he no longer claims.
</P>
<P>
   His descriptions of the shooting varied in the early interviews.
But in some accounts he suggested there had been a tug-of-war over
the gun. ``And then I went for him and I grabbed him, you know,''
he said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' the day after the
shootings, ``and he put down the gun and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he simply stood by or denied he was a hero, which
some of his new admirers took as humility. On CNN's ``Larry King
Live'' a week after the killings, Strong listened silently while
another guest, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, called Strong a ``major
hero'' and repeated the widespread story. Falwell described how
Strong ``literally walked right up to the young man in the face of
a firing gun and said, `Give me the gun.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Strong's deposition, on Jan. 20, a transcript shows, the
lawyer for the victims' families, Mike Breen of Bowling Green, Ky.,
read him a Time magazine article published the week after the
shooting. Time, which had interviewed Strong, said that Strong
``turned his eyes'' on the killer ``and, forcefully said, `Put down
the gun.''' In his deposition, Strong said he could not guarantee
that he had actually said any of that out loud. ``Now the
forcefully part,'' he added, ``that was written by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong was questioned under oath by the lawyer for the victims'
families, partly because they had sued him, as well as school
officials and many other people here who they said could have
prevented the killings. Strong has always acknowledged that Carneal
warned him not to come to the prayer group that Monday because
something was going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   But Strong has denied that he had any reason to suspect that
Carneal would commit murder. The judge dismissed the case against
Strong and most of the other defendants.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is clear from the deposition testimony that Strong did
eventually go to Carneal while some other students ran away. He
might have reached Carneal at the same time as Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Carneal, according to the testimony, had by then stopped
shooting, discarded his gun and was slumping to the ground, perhaps
in tears. It is undisputed that when Strong and Bond arrived,
Carneal was distraught and asked Strong to ``kill me, please kill
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Carneal said in his testimony that Strong did speak as he
approached. He quoted Strong as saying: ``What are you shooting
people for?'' Then, Carneal said, Strong groaned, gritted his teeth
and took Carneal by the shoulders and shook him.
</P>
<P>
   Strong ended two brief interviews recently by saying that he was
not comfortable talking about the subject any longer. But he was
accepting of the idea that the story of what happened the day of
the shooting might be different from the one that is widely known.
``Truth is truth,'' he said very quietly. ``That's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, Strong suggested that he wanted to be brave.
But in shock, he said, ``Your body doesn't function like it
normally does.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first days, the story of Strong as a hero may have
been beyond his ability to control it. In large ways and small, the
story was being used by other people who wanted a hero in a
tragedy, including the news media. But in West Paducah, the
families of the murdered girls seethed because they believed Strong
was profiting from their daughters' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's got some problems, some reason he has to think of
himself as a hero,'' said Joe James, whose daughter Jessica was
killed in the shooting. The parents of the three girls who were
killed all said they were infuriated by a Web site, bstrong.com,
that advertised a CD with a song by professional artists titled
``BStrong'' and included remarks from Strong. In the recent
interview, Strong said he had not received any proceeds from the
sale of the CD. The producers of the CD have said it was a
fund-raising effort for the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever part Strong played in perpetuating his story, his
public image has quietly divided people here. To some, he remains a
young man who, no matter what, represents positive values in stark
contrast to those of the killer.
</P>
<P>
   But some here say the Ben Strong story has overshadowed the
tragedy itself and they are bitter about him. In May, about 30
students from a parochial school near here, Christian Fellowship
School, traveled to an intramural event at Oral Roberts University,
the Christian college in Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   In a large meeting for all the high school students, a speaker
told the assembled crowd that teen-agers today should be more like
Ben Strong, the student who confronted the killer in West Paducah,
said Cathy Davis, a parent from here who was with the group as a
chaperone.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, the parochial school group rose and left the room, said
people who were there. ``Some of the kids were terribly offended,''
Davis said, ``because they know Ben Strong is not the hero he was
played up to be.''

TWO FINE MINDS, TESTED BY FAILING BODIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 By LESLIE BERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her 1961 poem, ``Grace,'' Maxine Kumin described hens pecking
on gravel and the invincible armor one might gain by similarly
ingesting small stones. ``I find it good to line my gut,'' she
wrote, ``with tidy octagons of grit.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four decades later, as she lay immobilized in the
hospital with a nearly fatal spinal cord injury, Kumin's kernels of
redemption were the words she managed to connect to her thoughts
and ultimately commit to paper, at first dictating them when her
own hands were incapable of typing. Although ``Grace'' didn't
specifically come to mind as she kept her journal, Kumin said in a
telephone interview, she has no doubt that writing (and her
daughter Judith, who helped her to write) was her salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's what saved me, really. But words have always been
what saved me,'' she said from her New Hampshire farm.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting book, ``Inside the Halo and Beyond: The Anatomy of
a Recovery'' (W.W. Norton &AMP; Co.), offers a clear description, in
accessible terms, of spinal cord injuries and the harrowing methods
used to help patients regain the use of their bodies. Though Kumin
is an avowed atheist, this memoir is nonetheless a testament to
self-discipline and the power of creative expression. For those
interested in the life of one of the country's pre-eminent poets,
``Inside the Halo and Beyond'' is filled with insights into her
childhood, her marriage, her relationships with her children and
the deep connection she feels to nature.
</P>
<P>
   The title of her memoir comes from the metal bird-cagelike
contraption that was literally pinned into her skull to keep her
head and neck from moving and give her spinal cord a chance to
heal. An avid equestrian, Kumin regained consciousness inside the
device after her beloved horse Deuter bolted on July 21, 1998,
throwing her from the carriage she was driving and fracturing the
top two vertebrae of her spine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a human head inside the cage fastened by four titanium
pins that dig into the skull,'' she writes. ``The pins are as sharp
as ice picks. I wake up in this cage, disoriented, desperate,
sicker than I have ever been. No feeling in my arms or legs, but a
vague sense that my head is entrapped forever. No movement left or
right, up or down. I am a stationary parrot inside my strict cage.
... Some orthopedic wag dubbed this form of axial traction a
halo.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pulitzer Prize-winning poet remained in the halo for three
excruciating months, until X-rays and other tests showed the
vertebrae had fused back together on their own. She was spared the
life-threatening surgery that the actor Christopher Reeve, for one,
was forced to undergo after his own 1995 horseback riding accident.
In Kumin's case, her mystified would-be surgeon pronounced her
condition a miracle; most people who suffer her type of injury
either die or, like Reeve, become paralyzed. Today, she is hiking
again, driving, carefully riding Deuter, cooking and trying to wean
herself from painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   During her recovery, the fiercely independent Kumin, who was 73
at the time of her accident, endured constant pain, grueling
therapy, the fear that she might always be impaired, and the
indignities of being catheterized. Exposing herself in a memoir
seemed easy by comparison, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything becomes so public when your body is almost
destroyed,'' she said. ``You have no autonomy. You're full of
tubes, your bodily functions are not within your control. You're
completely infantilized, you just become a piece of flesh. By
writing about it, it was a way of regaining some small piece of
autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kumin also forced herself to read, sometimes only a paragraph at
a time because of the awkward position of her head, and she drew
upon her memory bank of poems. Inside the claustrophobic tube of an
MRI, for example, she recites A.E. Housman's ``A Shropshire Lad''
to the medical machine's thumping beat. She was fearless, almost
masochistic, in her choice of reading materials, which included
medical articles and Reeve's own heartbreaking 1998 memoir, ``Still
Me'' (Random House).
</P>
<P>
   Like Kumin, Reeve was supported through his injury by a loving
and resourceful family. While Kumin's kin sustained her with
baskets of fresh vegetables from her garden, Reeve's relatives
faithfully served up fan mail to nourish his spirit through the
worst of his depression. With his spinal cord completely severed (
Kumin's was merely ``dinged'') it was immediately clear he faced
life without the use of his arms and legs and would need a
ventilator to help him breathe.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, the actor best known as Superman candidly
chronicles his suicidal thoughts and the constant dread that he
would suffocate. ``A large part of the fear was because I couldn't
take a single breath on my own,'' he writes. ``And the connections
of the hoses on these ventilators are tenuous at best. The nurses
put tape over the joints, but they don't always hold very well, and
you lie there at three in the morning in fear of a pop-off, when
the hose just comes off the ventilator. I had several. After you've
missed two breaths, an alarm sounds. You just have to hope that
someone will come very quickly. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Reeve's fine mind and education kick in when his
body fails him and, like Kumin, he finds salvation in his work. His
book culminates with his directing, from his wheelchair, the HBO
movie, ``In the Gloaming.'' He concludes that ``a hero is an
ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere and endure
in spite of overwhelming obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these authors is ordinary, of course; but, as their
books attest, their use of their talents in response to their cruel
accidents make them all the more remarkable.

LEIDEN, WHERE REMBRANDT WAS BORN, EVEN THE PILGRIMS VISITED FOR A
WHILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: 3rd take is a 600-word guide to lodging and museums.) 
 (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By CHRISTOPHER HALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leiden, a walkable city on two small branches of the Rhine
River, is something more than a nice little Dutch town, as it was
once described to me by a friend who lived there. Although
unmistakably Dutch in appearance _ with quiet neighborhoods of
gabled, canalside houses and a small open-air market selling North
Sea herring and wheels of Gouda _ Leiden's window on the world is
larger than its population of 117,000 would indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Almost since the founding of its university in 1575, the city
has attracted some of the brightest minds in Europe, and these days
scholars from around the world go there to teach and conduct
research. The 11,000 students who attend the University of Leiden
and fill the city's dark, smoky coffeehouses keep things from
getting too fusty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of its academic tradition and the Netherlands'
historic role as a crossroads of international commerce, Leiden is
a city of museums. With the exception of Amsterdam, which is 35
minutes northeast by train and has a population nearly seven times
that of Leiden, no other city in the Netherlands has such a broad
range of museums _ a dozen, large and small, covering everything
from classical antiquities to the history of medicine, to
windmills. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For its size, Leiden is unusually rich in historic sites.
Rembrandt was born there; the city was an early center of
publishing and medicine, and the first tulips in Holland were
planted in the university's botanical garden. In the 17th century
America's Pilgrim Fathers took refuge in Leiden before leaving for
the New World. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given our brief two days there in March, my partner, Mac, and I
decided to limit our museumgoing to three or four institutions and
our historic sites to those we could see on a leisurely walk around
Leiden's compact city center. It proved to be a good plan, although
we had to make several adjustments when confronted with unexpected
closures and renovations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that many of the museums are closed on Mondays, we
arrived on a Tuesday. It was a cold and gray morning on the cusp of
spring at the city's modern glass-and-steel train station. Exiting
through a sea of bicycles parked outside the station, we walked 10
minutes to the Rapenburg, a handsome tree-lined canal along which
some of Leiden's most prosperous citizens built stately homes in
the 17th century, when the city was flush with money from the
production of woolen cloth. We stopped briefly to leave our bags at
the Hotel De Doelen, a converted 1638 neo-Classical mansion where
we were spending the night, and then continued to the university
and its botanical garden. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the university and of Leiden's eventual
prominence lie in a Spanish siege of the city in 1574 during the
Protestant Dutch revolt against the iron rule of Catholic Spain.
Thousands of its citizens died of starvation and disease during the
siege, and popular belief has it that the mayor, one Van der Werf,
convinced a ravenous mob not to surrender only by offering his own
body as food. A nice story, but as noted with admirable candor in a
booklet I picked up at Leiden's tourist office, ``its accuracy is
dubious, since the annals show that Van der Werf had to be
dissuaded from opening the gates to the Spaniards on more than one
occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   The booklet also casts doubt on another popular belief, that the
university was a gift from William of Orange in appreciation for
Leiden's successful resistance. Instead, it appears, the Protestant
Low Countries needed their own university, and Leiden made sense
because it was freed early on from Spain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The main ceremonial building of the university, the Academy
(Academiegebouw), occupies a former Dominican convent on the
Rapenburg. A dignified, two-story brick structure with a steep
slate roof and a domed bell tower, the Academy still resembles a
church, although it is now used for lectures and official
university functions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Behind the Academy is the university's Hortus Botanicus, a
botanical garden originally laid out in 1590 as a place to grow and
study medicinal and poisonous plants. In the 16th century such
gardens were common at universities with medical schools, but the
first curator of Leiden's garden, the Flemish botanist Carolus
Clusius, eventually had the novel idea of creating a place where
all known plants would be collected and studied. As a result,
imports from the New World _ such as the tomato, the potato,
tobacco and corn _ were introduced into Northern Europe through the
Leiden garden. Clusius also introduced tulips to Holland (they were
originally from Turkey), first planting them in the Hortus in
1594. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the centuries, Clusius' garden has grown into a large oasis
of old trees, flowers and thousands of plant species from around
the world, although on the day we visited the entrance was torn up
by the construction of a new winter garden (which opened in May),
and the garden still had its bare, winter look. As we walked
around, however, we did come across a few signs of spring _ several
beds of crocus, swelling nodes on an ancient wisteria, and a
scattering of solitary daffodils, whose yellow blooms looked
particularly vibrant under the steely sky.
</P>
<P>
   A light drizzle eventually drove us into the garden's extensive
greenhouses, where we happily wandered through the heavy, warm air,
passing under towering tree ferns and stopping to examine a
carnivorous plant from Borneo or cerise-colored blooms sprouting
like miniature feather boas from the branches of a New Guinea
euphorbia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back outside, we retraced our steps along the Rapenburg to the
National Museum of Antiquities (Rijksmuseum van Oudheden). It's the
principal archaeological museum in the Netherlands, and we'd been
looking forward to seeing its outstanding collection of Egyptian
and Classical Greek and Roman artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, we found the museum in the midst of a major
renovation (scheduled to be completed next spring), and most of its
permanent collection was on loan or in storage. What we did see
whetted our appetites _ papyrus manuscripts, beautifully
proportioned Greek vases, translucent alabaster cups and solemn,
marble busts of eminent Romans. We both enjoyed a small display
devoted to the ancient Egyptian love of beer, and also managed to
peek into the museum's most dramatic gallery (which was closed): a
covered courtyard filled with heroic-sized statuary and an entire
temple of Isis rescued from the rising waters behind the Aswan
Dam. &QL;

UNDATED: Aswan Dam.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We ate a light lunch at Camino Real, a cozy, two-level
restaurant that occupies a former stable just around the corner
from the Academy. Surrounded by an animated university crowd of
professorial types in worn tweed jackets and students in jeans and
T-shirts, we split a bowl of flavorful celery-onion soup and a
sandwich of cheese, smoked salmon, avocado and mixed greens on
Italian flatbread. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the time we finished, the overcast sky had yielded to
brilliant blue with billowing white clouds, so we spent the rest of
the afternoon walking around Leiden's center, stopping frequently
to investigate a shop or a historic building, or to admire spring
blooms placed in the front window of a house. Here and there were
mural-sized poems painted on the sides of buildings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Pieterskerk, a large old church a block off the Rapenburg,
now used for concerts and other nonreligious functions, we saw a
memorial plaque dedicated to John Robinson, the Pilgrims' spiritual
leader. The Pilgrims arrived in Leiden in 1609 and left for America
in 1620, in part because they feared that cosmopolitan Leiden would
corrupt their morals. Robinson intended to join them later but
never made it, dying in Leiden in 1625. We weren't able to see
inside the church since it was closed, but on a nearby pedestrian
lane of pleasant shops and restaurants (Pieterskerk-Choorsteeg) we
did spot a plaque marking the site of the Pilgrims' printing
press. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Across from the church, at Kloksteeg 21, we sat for a while in
the quiet, grassy courtyard of the 1683 almshouse that replaced
Robinson's residence. During Leiden's golden era, well-to-do
individuals _ some getting on in years and worried about the
salvation of their souls _ built small houses where elderly poor
people could live for free. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The almshouses are known in Dutch as ``hofjes,'' or ``little
courtyards,'' because they were traditionally built around a common
court that had a single opening onto the street. While many of
Leiden's 35 existing hofjes are now private residences, some
courtyards are open to the public; the visitors center has a
brochure outlining a walking tour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next day we arrived at the National Museum of the History of
Science and Medicine, known as the Boerhaave Museum, just as it was
opening. It had not been high on our list of museums, but our
friend Oliver Moore, who had recently moved to the city, had
convinced us that it had more to offer than pickled brains and
scary old surgical implements. It is housed in a beautifully
renovated building where Herman Boerhaave (1668-1738), an innovator
in clinical medicine, founded one of the first teaching hospitals
in the world. The collection is quirky _ ranging from exquisitely
crafted microscopes of polished brass to an amusing display of
antique apothecary shop signs from Amsterdam, each depicting a
human head with mouth agape. I was particularly fascinated by a
reconstruction of Leiden's Theatrum Anatomicum, a steeply raked
anatomical theater where Boerhaave and others performed human
dissections while skeletons and other memento mori loomed
overhead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Later that day we toured a collection of old Dutch tile,
household furnishings and paintings at the Lakenhal Municipal
Museum (Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal), which occupies the city's
1640 cloth hall. In the galleries we saw one of Rembrandt's
earliest dated paintings, ``An Unidentified Historical Subject,'' a
fussy mythological scene from 1625 that is far more detailed and
far less striking than his mature works. Although Rembrandt first
studied painting in Leiden, he became famous only after settling in
Amsterdam in 1631. His boyhood home no longer exists, but other
sites connected with his youth in Leiden _ such as the street
(Weddesteeg) where he grew up and the Latin School on
Lokhorststraat where he studied _ still survive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the day, while on our way to the train
station, we stopped at the restored 18th-century windmill that now
houses the Valk Municipal Windmill Museum (Stedelijk Molenmuseum De
Valk). The Valk is one of about 950 windmills left in the
Netherlands, down from 10,000 about 100 years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's wife, Ts'ai Ch'in, had encouraged us to visit the Valk,
and once inside I could see why. After a brief look at the
informative historical displays, we clambered up ladder-like steps,
passed the massive grinding wheels and stepped onto the outside
platform, where the mill's huge sails swooped precariously close to
our heads. Although we had a train to catch, we lingered a few
minutes, enjoying a bird's-eye view of Leiden and the bracing feel
of North Sea wind on our faces.  &QR;

 &HT;    X-Files gets its character transfusion
 &HT;    By Kevin Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ One of the keys to ``The X-Files' `` success
is that the show always raises more questions than it answers. Who
or what got Scully pregnant? Is she really pregnant? Will she have
the baby? Is Cigarette Smoking Man dead? Can Mulder still eat
sunflower seeds in outer space? OK, you get the point. The moody,
paranormal drama always leaves you wanting more.
</P>
<P>
   No one teases audiences better than series creator Chris Carter.
He did it again after Fox officially announced that Robert Patrick,
who played the shape-shifting killing machine in ``Terminator 2,''
will join the cast as special agent John Doggett. As part of his
agreement to return for an eighth season, David Duchovny will only
appear in only 11 of the 20 episodes, including Nov. 5's season
opener. Patrick, however, will be in all 20.
</P>
<P>
   So, just who is this Doggett guy?
</P>
<P>
   Carter says that Doggett, unlike Mulder, is an insider at the
FBI, a by-the-book agent and former New York City detective. Like
Scully (Gillian Anderson) used to be, Doggett will be a skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a person who's doubting by nature,'' Carter says. ``He
really is one of these people who needs to see it, touch it, smell
it, taste it, feel it, in order to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   While Doggett will team with Scully to find Mulder, they will
not become partners _ not immediately, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a gradual, hopefully, realistic integration of
the character into the series,'' Carter says.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly more than 100 actors were considered for one of TV's
most coveted roles. But Carter says Patrick stood out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Patrick embodied this character,'' he says.
``Everything from the timbre of his voice to his presence, to his
intensity. Because he's going to be on screen with Scully a lot, I
saw them as worthy adversaries and worthy partners. He was not
going to be a person that would shrink because she's a very
powerful person and actor.''
</P>
<P>
   If you remember Patrick's menacing Terminator character in T2,
you know exactly what Carter's talking about. Not many guys can
convincingly throw Arnold Schwarzenegger through a wall. Patrick
was also effectively creepy as an alien teacher in ``The Faculty.''
I say give Patrick some macho fight scenes with the beefy alien
bounty hunter.
</P>
<P>
   When I first heard in May that Duchovny would be in only half of
next season's episodes, I was concerned. After all, this
still-stellar drama is built around the chemistry between Mulder
and Scully. But change is good. Like all long-running shows,
sometimes ``The X-Files'' is a tad stale. Adding new blood should
give it a boost. Bringing in new cast members certainly hasn't hurt
``Law &AMP; Order.'' ``NYPD Blue'' always gets better for a few weeks
after a new detective joins the squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's afraid of change,'' Carter says. ``But that doesn't
mean you can't threaten the paradigm, or that you can't threaten
the model.''
</P>
<P>
   What has been threatened was Carter's relationship with
Duchovny. Last year, the actor filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit
against Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. Duchovny claimed the
company cheated him out of millions in X-Files-related profits. On
top of that, Duchovny's suit alleged that Carter (who was not a
defendant) conspired with Fox to keep quiet about the depleted
profit sharing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still am yet to understand, truly, what it is I was accused
of doing and have it articulated to me in any kind of
understandable way,'' Carter says. ``There's still a little bit of
a mystery to me, but lawsuits are mysterious. I'm happy just to
move on and try to do the good work that we've done together.''
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files isn't Carter's only series. ``The Lone Gunmen,''
based on the X-Files' geeky trio of conspiracy theorists, is
scheduled to debut next year. But don't expect another dark drama.
Carter, it seems, has learned his lesson from ``Millennium'' and
``Harsh Realm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like Mission: Impossible on laughing gas,'' he
says, ``It's a light touch and approach, and I think that we're
doing some things we would never have done on ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fox announced ``MAD TV'' will add two cast members this fall.
Comedians Nelson Ascencio and Christian Duguay will join the
late-night sketch comedy for its sixth season. Ascencio appeared in
several episodes last season, including one in which he played
Ricky Martin. This will be Duguay's national television debut.
</P>
<P>
   The list of celebrity voices on ``King of the Hill'' keeps
getting longer and longer. This year you'll hear Lisa Kudrow,
Brendan Fraser, Snoop Dogg and former Texas Gov. Ann Richards on
Fox's hit comedy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quote of the weekend: ``Has anyone else noticed that we
basically, blatantly ripped off the HBO series ``OZ'' with our
structure? Anybody? I mean, except we're a lot funnier and (we
have) no prison rape scenes ... yet. We have opening titles that
look like they were thrown together in a garage in Van Nuys in
about four hours. They were, except it took two hours.'' _
Christopher Titus on his hit comedy ``Titus.''

LOOKING OUT FOR THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite all the pious promises of government
cost-cutting and taxpayer refunds, members of Congress are happily
willing to make one exception to their stingy budget mood:
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The House quietly gave itself a $3,800 pay raise last week,
upping the annual salary to a tidy $145,5000, plus the usual perks
and special benefits. Why are we not surprised? Our legislative
worthies have always known how to look after their own financial
interests.
</P>
<P>
   What is a surprise, however, is how little a fuss this is
causing so far. In the past, congressional pay raises have been
about as popular as a bawling child in a small theater.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Congress was so desperate to raise members'
pay without taking the political consequences that it cowered
behind a presidential commission, which predictably embraced the
notion of a regular windfall for Capitol Hill. Conservative
talk-show audiences went nuts, turning the issue into raw material
for incumbents' next campaign opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot was that Congress created a clever mechanism in 1989
that would automatically grant cost-of-living raises unless
Congress specifically voted to block them. That's what happened in
the House. Without technically going for the gold, lawmakers
granted themselves their third pay raise in four years, their
second in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is likely to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   This boost will cost taxpayers an additional $2.5 million a
year. Not a budget-busting sum in a year with a projected budget
surplus of $100 billion. And it does not reflect partisan greed. A
majority of both Democrats and Republicans were for it.
</P>
<P>
   So should we care, really, how much Congress pays itself?
</P>
<P>
   We have no tradition of rewarding our elected representatives on
the basis of merit. We pay the dummies, the demagogues and the
hard-working, well-meaning policy-makers the same. You get elected;
you get paid.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot less than Dick Cheney's annual salary as boss of the
Halliburton Corporation in Dallas, which was $1.2 million last year
plus a $1.15 million bonus plus income from all his company stock.
If he becomes the Republican vice presidential nominee and wins,
Cheney will take a big pay cut. (Included in the congressional hike
is a boost in the vice president's $175,000 salary, bringing it to
a little less than $180,000).
</P>
<P>
   That's less than the next president's salary, which will go up
to $400,000 next year, double the present $200,000. But it's a lot
more than most American families earn. The median family income in
1998 was $46,737.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Congress wants a pay raise, somebody argues that a
hefty income is necessary to keep attracting the best-quality
candidates. This, of course, is a joke. There is never a lack of
ambitious men and women clamoring for the opportunity to find good
times and glory in Washington. And often their congressional pay
amounts to more money than they were making back home.
</P>
<P>
   Legally lining one's own pockets may not be politically lethal
any more, but it's still nothing to brag about. Hillary Rodham
Clinton, for instance, was quick to attack her New York Republican
rival for the U.S. Senate seat, Rep. Rick Lazio, for not voting to
block the pay raise bill. She pointed out that Lazio had campaigned
against House pay raises in principle but backed away when the
question applied to himself. Lazio responded that, golly, gee, the
pay raise was embedded in a big budget bill and he was really just
voting for the other items included in it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mystery why voters are not furious about this backdoor
pay hike. One theory is that people are so contented with the flush
economy no one begrudges the lawmakers taking a share. Another is
that conservative talk-radio hosts are not as enthusiastic about
dumping on a Congress controlled by Republicans as they were when
the Democrats were in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The days are apparently past when callers shouted, ``Why don't
all those stuffed shirts just live off their bribes?'' Maybe,
however, all this good-natured calm is merely temporary. Wait until
the next recession hits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the income disparity between our national lawmakers
and their constituents continues to grow. This is not healthy. It
is easy to lose touch with reality when you are surrounded by
perquisites of power unavailable to the rest of the country.
Members of Congress sometimes deserve our respect and honor. But
they also need to feel our pain, as a certain president would say.

 &HT;    CORPORATE SEMINARS FOR JUDGES INFLUENCE CASES, GROUP CHARGES
 &HT;    550&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ROB O'DELL
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A number of rulings in recent federal environmental
cases appear to be influenced by corporate-sponsored seminars
attended by the cases' judges, a judicial watchdog group said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A study released by the Community Rights Council found that in
10 of the most dramatic departures from precedent in the last
decade, the judge striking down an environmental protection
attended one or more seminars hosted by a group the council
believes had an interest in the cases.
</P>
<P>
   In six of these cases, the judge attended a corporate-funded
seminar while the case was pending in court. In at least three, the
litigant who won a favorable ruling was ``bankrolled'' by the
seminar's sponsors, the CRC said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate special interests are attempting to buy judicial
influence at the highest levels, and it appears to be working,''
said Doug Kendall, executive director of the CRC. ``Although we
cannot say for sure the seminars had an impact on the judges'
decisions, we have compiled very compelling evidence that appears
to be more than just coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether corporations and special interests
should be able to buy influence in the courts by hosting lavish and
biased educational seminars for judges, and we believe the answer
is no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at more than 60,000 financial disclosure
reports of federal judges between the years of 1992 and 1998. The
number of judges attending seminars increased significantly over
the course of the study, with the value of the average trip
estimated at $5,000, Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A record 88 judges attended a seminar from the three biggest
seminar-sponsoring organizations _ and with about 800 active
federal judges, that is about 10 percent of all judges taking these
trips every year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also found that only 9 percent of judges disclosed the
value of the seminar trips they are taking, but one judge reported
a corporate-sponsored trip valued at $7,367.''
</P>
<P>
   The CRC posted a database on its Web site showing privately
funded trips taken by federal judges between 1992 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall cited a District of Columbia Circuit Court judge who
changed a previous decision on habitat protection after attending a
corporate-sponsored seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Stephen Williams joined an opinion to uphold habitat
protection in 1993, and two weeks later attended a week-long
seminar held by the Foundation for Research on Economics and the
Environment, a non-profit organization that has several timber
company executives on its board, Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning, Williams granted a rare rehearing, switched his
vote and wrote an opinion striking down a portion of the Endangered
Species Act prohibiting habitat modifications that would harm
endangered species, Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the Foundation for Research on Economics and the
Environment refuses to disclose who funds their organization, it is
hard to say for certain that FREE received money from timber
companies at the time of Judge Williams's case,'' Kendall said.
``But I do suspect that FREE was receiving money directly from
timber companies, at the time when Judge Williams was hearing the
suit by the timber companies over the Endangered Species Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams could not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The study also cited U.S. District Judge Kenneth L. Ryskamp of
Jupiter, Fla., as taking one of the largest number of
corporate-sponsored trips in the study.
</P>
<P>
   Ryskamp, who stepped down from his Southern District of Florida
post at the beginning of this year, was cited for taking nine
seminar trips from 1992 to 1998, the sixth highest number for any
federal judge during that time, the report said. Ryskamp also could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall called for Congress to bar federal judges from attending
these corporate-sponsored seminars, and urged the Federal Judicial
Center, which conducts continuing education programs for judges, to
ask Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to apply a similar ban.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., announced Monday he will introduce a
bill in the Senate that would ban privately funded seminars for
judges, create a travel fund for the Judicial Center so that judges
could participate in educational seminars, require approval by the
Judicial Center for all seminars attended, and require public
disclosure of the seminar after it is approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a minimum, these seminars create a perception of improper
influence that erodes the trust that the American people must have
in our judicial system,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry expects to introduce the legislation soon, after a
Republican agrees to co-sponsor it, a spokesman said.

 &HT;    CURE FOR NURSE SHORTAGE: MORE JOB SATISFACTION
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A growing shortage of nurses can be remedied only
if hospitals restore some of the job satisfaction lost amid
cost-cutting, officials of a nurse placement firm said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Higher pay is needed, but not as much as better working
conditions, said Joseph A. Boshart, president of Cross Country
Staffing, which provides temporary nursing staff for hospitals
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   He offered those conclusions after his company hosted a
conference here on how to deal with the twin trends of a nurse
shortage and new state mandates requiring hospitals to raise
nurse-patient ratios.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrific business environment for us,'' acknowledged
Boshart. His Boca Raton, Fla.-based company currently has 4,500
nurses working in about 3,000 hospitals around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he said, the projected demand for more nurses means
that ``there's no way that we can fill these vacancies'' in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The nursing gap, now estimated at 300,000 positions nationwide,
is expected to double by the end of the decade as registered nurses
leave patient care for other jobs and enrollment in nursing schools
continues a five-year decline.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study led by Peter I. Buerhaus of Vanderbilt
University's nursing school predicted that the supply of registered
nurses would fall 20 percent below the demand by 2010. The study
cited expanding job opportunities for women in other fields as the
chief reason.
</P>
<P>
   Boshart also blamed cost-cutting measures that began in the
early 1990s, when hospitals laid off experienced nursing staff and
began shortening hospital stays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurses have been devalued,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That view was echoed by Frank A. Shaffer, a veteran registered
nurse who heads Cross Country's continuing education arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest means of recruiting somebody into the
profession is word of mouth,'' he said. ``The average nurse will
not tell you that they enjoy it. They will not encourage their sons
or daughters to be nurses. They find it too frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today because of the very short length of stay, you do not get
to see the results of your care. So you don't get that job
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to help people get better. It might sound trite, but
that's the heart and soul of why we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pay is also an issue, Shaffer said, noting that a registered
nurse is paid about $35,000 a year on a national average, up very
little over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurses tell you, 'I make less that the garbage man or the
plumber, and I help save your life,' `` Shaffer said.

A LITERARY FRIENDSHIP AND THE BANALITY OF EVIL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOB ARMSTRONG  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I recently wrote about famous writers who cut
each other up under the guise of thoughtful essays. I noted Mary
McCarthy's zap at Lillian Hellman: ``Every word she writes is a
lie, including `and' and `the.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although I enjoy reading about literary feuds, an enduring
literary friendship is equally appealing. In Mary McCarthy's case,
such a friendship bloomed, but only after she was foolish enough to
get in a scrap with Hannah Arendt, whose writings on the dynamics
of totalitarian regimes, terror and revolution are considered
seminal works in political philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1945. A party in Manhattan is packed with intellectuals.
With World War II coming to a close, the conversation turns to the
twisted mind of Hitler. McCarthy, always inclined to stir up a
hornet's nest, casually remarks she feels pity toward Hitler
because he is absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Arendt, who was driven out of Germany in 1933 and emigrated to
the United States in 1941, is deeply offended. She snaps at
McCarthy, asks her how she could make such a noxious remark, walks
away.
</P>
<P>
   They ran with the same brainy crowd, but avoided each other for
three years. Then Arendt approached McCarthy. ``Let's end this
nonsense,'' she said, ``We think so much alike.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a close friendship the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Their letters to each other, in ``Between Friends,'' edited by
Carol Brightman, show a lively exchange between the novelist's
concern with rage in the bedroom and the political philosopher's
concern with same in the totalitarian mind.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy pours it all out. Arendt is aloof. She seeks Arendt's
advice on the studly brainiacs coming and going, including three
husbands. McCarthy expects her men to change. Arendt is more in
tune with the hard wiring embedded in the heterosexual male and
suggests Mary either leave them ``as is'' _ or leave them.
</P>
<P>
   As fate would have it, both came under heavy critical fire
within a few months of each other in 1963. McCarthy's novel about
eight girls at Vassar, ``The Group,'' hit the best-seller list, but
got trashed as low-brow pulp. Even worse, according to Norman
Mailer, it was merely a ``lady-book.''
</P>
<P>
   Arendt's troubles were far greater after the publication of her
book with an ominous phrase in its sub-title: ``Eichmann in
Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil.''
</P>
<P>
   In attempting to comprehend the incomprehensible _ the Holocaust
_ Arendt argued that Adolf Eichmann was not a monster or sadist
like those in the SS, but a friendly guy, a perfect family man with
the careerist ambitions of a mid-level manager, a terrific
facilitator who coolly assisted in directing the flow of ``cargo''
in cattle cars moving east.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as McCarthy said of Eichmann in an essay defending Arendt,
``Had Mein Kampf been his `Bible,' he might have pressed a flower
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the banality of evil.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Arendt's striking formulation is generally accepted in
intellectual circles, but at the time it raised howls of protest.
Jews were especially upset because Arendt noted the Jewish
Councils' compliance with Nazi demands to turn over the names of
those in their congregations, which greased the wheels for their
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charged she had trivialized Eichmann's role, exonerated
him from responsibility and slandered Jews. Her character came
under attack _ whispered asides about the ``self-hating Jewess,''
calculated slips of the tongue calling her ``Hannah Eichmann.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the letters to McCarthy she wrote: ``What a risky
business to tell the truth on a factual level without theoretical
or scholarly embroidery.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is theory in her report on Eichmann's trial. Not
embroidery, but careful stitching which can't be seen, for it is
theory grounded in the reality of the 20th century's darkest time.
</P>
<P>
   And I can't help but wonder if the seed for Arendt's thoughts on
Eichmann was planted at a party years earlier when she turned her
back on McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   After all, doesn't the intemperate remark about feeling sorry
for Hitler, on grounds of absurdity, illustrate perfectly the
banality of evil?

THE INDEFENSIBLE DEFENSE OF NAZI GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The German historian who has made a specialty of
defending Nazi Germany rationalized Hitler's persecution of the
Jews as part of the Fuehrer's war against Bolshevism.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst Nolte has been at it for years, but only now has been
rewarded with the prestigious Konrad Adenauer Prize, considered
Germany's top literary honor.
</P>
<P>
   Nolte argued that as so many Jews were communists, Hitler's
anti-Semitic policies should be regarded as part of praiseworthy
efforts to combat the Red Menace to Western civilization.
</P>
<P>
   This assertion is hardly new, having been made by the Nazi
themselves, who also, however, contrived to explain their
persecution of the Jews in terms of fighting international
capitalism as well.
</P>
<P>
   Nolte's interpretation would be laughable were it not for the
literary prize and the support that betokens among at least a
significant segment of the German establishment. Of course, that
same stolid establishment climbed aboard the Nazi bandwagon with
alacrity when Hitler was building his power.
</P>
<P>
   Conveniently overlooked in the recognition of Nolte's work is
that virulent German anti-Semitism preceded the rise of communism.
Furthermore, history reveals that the German government itself did
more to foster Bolshevism than any number of Jewish adherents
possibly could have done.
</P>
<P>
   During World War I, it was the regime of Kaiser Wilhelm that
bent extraordinary efforts to build communist power. It did so by
sending Vladimir Lenin, the man who made the Bolshevik revolution
and led it through its formative years, from his Swiss exile back
to Russia in a sealed railway car, with the specific expectation
that he would foment revolution to undermine the czar and take
Russia out of the war.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the most important victories Germany ever won.
</P>
<P>
   If the Nolte logic is to be applied, then Hitler should not only
have singled out Jews as a target, but all of Wilhelmine Germany,
as well as the more numerous people of Christian background who
contributed so much more to the rise and early success of
communism, such as it was.
</P>
<P>
   What a farce this whole Nolte matter is. There is no conceivable
rationalization for the racist policies, whose end was murder _ not
of Jews, not of Christians, not of imperial Germans, nor any one
else. The very idea is absurd. What, except the power to do so,
could possibly justify the pitiless slaughter of children, women
and men who had never been communists or anything else?
</P>
<P>
   Having been the foremost target of czarist persecution, having
been denied entry to preferred occupations, education and areas in
which to live, it is little wonder that some Jews supported
movements _ not only communist ones _ that sought to overthrow that
oppressive tyranny. But once the Communists attained control, Jews
in the Soviet Union, just as in Germany and then Nazi Germany, in
the first instance were persecuted and discriminated against for
being Jews. They needed to have committed no other offense to
qualify for this treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that those who would recast the horrors of Nazi Germany
in a softer light, and excuse Germany from history's judgment, have
developed enough confidence to assert their sentiments publicly, in
Germany, Austria, even in France, is a telling sign. While many
German academics condemned Nolte, at least one well-regarded
historian, Horst Moller, director of the what is described as the
``highly respected'' Institute for Contemporary History, defended
Nolte's work.
</P>
<P>
   I write on this subject from the perspective of having lived the
first 10 years of my life in Nazi Germany, escaping Hitler's
``anti-Bolshevik'' campaign at nearly the last minute. My wife also
lived as a child in Nazi Germany. Our relatives who could not
emigrate were slaughtered. Not a one was a Communist.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Karksi died 10 days ago. His was not a household name, but
it is in mine. He was the Polish diplomat who saw with his own eyes
what the Holocaust was doing to Poland's Jews and brought word of
it to the West to seek help. Few believed him; it was too
incredible. Help was not forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Today we know too much to disregard warning signs. As
right-wing, racist policies gain respectability in Europe, alarm
bells should disturb our self-satisfaction and tranquility, lest
before we know it, it will be too late again.

TOO MUCH OF A `CHICK THING' 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ My brother was telling me about a friend of his
who bought one of the first of those new Volkswagen beetles. After
a few months tooling around in the car, he decided to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good car,'' he said, ``but it's a chick car.''
</P>
<P>
   My brother and I both laughed, even though he's a macho guy who
lives in Cleveland and I'm a pseudo-sensitive guy from San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   We share an understanding of ``chick'' vs. ``guy,'' an American
cultural distinction greater than Republican vs. Democrat, highbrow
vs. lowbrow or sports utility vehicle vs. minivan.
</P>
<P>
   After all, both minivans and SUVs are chick cars, the SUV being
``the new station wagon,'' as Dave Barry once put it.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, all you pseudo-macho guys in Land Rovers. You'll just
have to trade those things in for pickup trucks or get secure about
your masculinity.
</P>
<P>
   All Americans understand the guy-chick distinction, even if they
object to the word ``chick.'' Recently it's been rescued from the
overflowing dustbin of political incorrectness, but as my wife
says, ``I can use it but you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, many men, especially TV movie reviewers, chicken
out in mixed company and instead of calling the latest Meg Ryan
opus a ``chick movie,'' call it a ``date movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A date movie is a chick movie a guy takes a girl to when he
wants to get (rhymes with a Florida county),'' said my wife, who is
definitely not what you'd call a chick, at least if you're a guy
who values his front teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she knows what's chick and what's guy. I asked her to
describe the difference between chick movies and guy movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guy movies have melting faces and lots of detonators,'' she
said. ``Chick movies have crying and phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions to the rules, of course. My wife says that
if a movie has lots of detonators and Keanu Reeves, then it can be
a chick movie.
</P>
<P>
   But no amount of detonators and melting faces could make
anything by Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant a guy movie. Although,
maybe if they were melted and detonated. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate chick TV is Lifetime and daytime, while guy TV is
``The Man Show,'' the Hitler Channel _ I mean the History Channel _
and that one with all the airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The chick computer is the iMac. It's Hello Kitty without a face.
The guy computer is whatever costs the most.
</P>
<P>
   The guy idea of a chick present is an ``outfit.'' The chick idea
of a guy present is something beige he'll never wear.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal chick weekend involves walks on the beach. A guy
weekend involves Laguna Seca.
</P>
<P>
   Chick music is all that stuff by women with names like Alanis,
Fiona and Jonatha, stuff I happen to like because I'm a sensitive
guy of the Joni generation. Guy music, according to my wife, is
stuff by Oasis or Bush. Never heard of them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the governor, I've heard of, and he's a guy politician
with both chick and guy appeal, unfortunately for Al Gore. The
ultimate chick politician, of course, is Hillary Rodham Clinton.
That is, she has chick appeal like Oprah and Martha, but the last
thing you'd ever call her is a chick.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we want to call any women ``chicks.'' We're talking
about a polar distinction in a society obsessed by gender roles and
the social construction of reality - to throw around a few chick
phrases.
</P>
<P>
   If anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss did field work in modern
America, he wouldn't have written ``The Raw and the Cooked.'' He
would have written ``The Chick and the Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chick food and guy food are both sort of al dente. That's where
the resemblance ends. Even when it comes to pasta, meat sauce is
guy and pesto is chick.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate chick food is Chinese chicken salad. The ultimate
guy food is meat. And the meat in Chinese chicken salad doesn't
count.
</P>
<P>
   Try this experiment sometime. The man orders the Chinese chicken
salad and the woman orders the meat, then see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   Real men can admit they like chick stuff. I'm a guy who likes
cosmos, white wine and Chinese chicken salad (well, with a side of
meat). I own an iMac and drive an SUV _ worse, a little Honda SUV.
</P>
<P>
   I've read ``Bridget Jones's Diary.'' The female clerk in the
bookstore said she'd never sold a copy to a man before. Did you
ever try to read Tom Clancy?
</P>
<P>
   I'll even watch Jane Austen movies on A&AMP;E, but during
commercials I'll be on the remote flipping to war footage on the
Hitler Channel.

   HEROISM-RECONSIDERED (West Paducah, Ky.) _ Ben Strong was said
to have displayed remarkable courage when he disarmed Michael
Carneal, the 14-year-old killer who opened fire on a prayer group
at Heath High School here on Dec. 1, 1997. But as new information
about the events that morning emerges because of a civil lawsuit,
some people here are openly challenging the portrait of Strong as a
hero. His story shows how chaos and panic can distort the accounts
that witnesses give of the rampage killings that periodically
horrify the country. It may show, too, how the stories of the
killings are often shaped by the powerful desire of reporters and
everyone else involved to find some good news in horrible,
inexplicable events. By Alex Berenson.

 &HT;    Armstrong to begin whirlwind publicity tour of United States
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Lance Armstrong spent only a few hours at his part-time
home in Nice, France, late Monday, leaving Paris a day after
clinching his second straight Tour de France championship.
</P>
<P>
   This morning he starts his whirlwind publicity tour of the
United States, flying to New York and then Los Angeles before
returning to France on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Stapleton, Armstrong's Austin-based attorney, said
Armstrong is scheduled to appear on ``Good Morning America'' and
``Live with Regis and Kathie Lee'' on Wednesday. There is a
possibility Armstrong will appear on other network talk shows, but
those interviews had not been set by Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Nike Inc., Armstrong's longtime sponsor, has set up a press
conference and book signing at Nike Town in Manhattan Wednesday
afternoon. A letter from President Clinton will be read to
Armstrong during the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Armstrong will fly to Los Angeles. He is scheduled
to appear on the ``Tonight Show'' Thursday. There also will be a
party thrown in his honor at a home in Beverly Hills. The mansion
will be lighted in yellow to commemorate Armstrong's second
straight Tour championship.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Armstrong returns to Nice to prepare for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Armstrong was able to return to Austin in August
after his Tour victory. But because of the Olympics in Sydney in
September, Armstrong will not return home until early October.
</P>
<P>
   With his win in the Tour time trial on Friday, Armstrong has
emerged as the leading contender for the gold medal in the Olympic
time trial on Sept. 30. The Olympic time trial course and the one
Armstrong rode from Freiburg, Germany, to Mulhouse, France, are
very similar.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the Olympics, Armstrong will compete in two races
in Spain _ the San Sebastian and the Tour of Borgos. He also will
compete in the World Cup at Zurich, Switzerland. He then will
travel to Australia in mid-September.

 &HT;    Next competition for Armstrong will be Sydney Olympics
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - What's left and what's next for Lance Armstrong
might be one and the same.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's next high-profile cycling competition will be at the
Olympics in Sydney. The two-time Tour de France champion is also a
two-time Olympian, but without the same measure of success.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Armstrong finished 14th in
the men's individual road race behind winner Fabio Casartelli of
Italy. At the Atlanta Games in 1996, he was 12th behind champion
Pascal Richard of Switzerland, and finished sixth in the individual
time trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance really wants to win an Olympic gold medal,'' said his
coach, Chris Carmichael. ``It's driven him for a long time, and
he's in good shape for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States formally will announce its five-man road-race
team on Aug. 1. The only entry officially on the squad is Antonio
Cruz of Long Beach, Calif., for winning the May 20 Olympic trials
road race in Jackson, Miss. But it's a certainty Armstrong will be
included, barring anything unforeseen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be naming the team, and I'd be a pretty stupid coach if
he wasn't on it,'' Jim Ochowicz, the U.S. men's road cycling coach,
said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men have had little success in Olympic individual road
racing. Their best finish was third in 1912 by Carl Schutte. In
more recent times, George Mount's sixth-place showing in Montreal
in 1976 has been the highest by a U.S. representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being an Olym and be a medalist, not just a member of the
team. His goal is to win a gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   The road racing portion of the Olympics will be held Sept.
26-27, with individual time trials on Sept. 30.

COWBOYS' GALLOWAY OFFERS MORE THAN JUST SPEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRENT ZWERNEMAN  
 c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Receiver Joey Galloway has big hair,
fleet feet and Dallas Cowboys coach Dave Campo making up big words
about his big-time speed.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the Cowboys expect big things from their $42 million
addition who sports a sprouting Afro.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt Joey Galloway gives you the `stretchability'
that you need,'' Campo said of probably the fastest Cowboys
receiver since Bob Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' other starting receiver, Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail,
has jets himself. So who's faster?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess that Joey is, but he's deceptively faster
because he doesn't look like he's moving as quick as Rocket,'' said
quarterback Troy Aikman, who knows better than anyone. ``That's
taken a little bit of getting used to.''
</P>
<P>
   A little bit of getting used to? Compared to last year, when
injuries racked an already-thin receiving corps, it's like Aikman
traded in a compact for a Corvette, and now must adapt to the new
accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are subtle changes when you've got that kind of speed,''
Aikman said. ``The angles of the throws are different and where
you've got to lay the ball becomes different.''
</P>
<P>
   And apparently Campo has inherited a different Galloway, or at
least one unlike the one portrayed last year as a super-selfish
Seattle Seahawk after an eight-week holdout while still under
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``That perception is something as a player you can't do a whole
lot about,'' Galloway said. ``People are going to have their
opinions, I just have to go out and do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo said Galloway, whom the Cowboys acquired in February for
two No. 1 picks, is better than advertised, and gives Dallas a
receiver who can catch outside and inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's been given enough credit on his ability to
catch the ball over the middle,'' Campo said. ``He's as fast a guy
as I've ever been around when he comes out of his cut and
accelerates. And he's not a small guy. Rocket is more slight and is
more of a deep outside-type of receiver, whereas Galloway can come
inside for the football.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cowboys offensive coordinator Jack Reilly: ``Joey can run
good patterns for a fast guy. He's not some big `track guy,' who's
just stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry signed the 28-year-old Galloway to a $42
million contract over seven years and included a $12 million
signing bonus, in an effort to crank open the closing window of
another shot at a Super Bowl in the era of Aikman, who turns 34
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway played five seasons with the Seahawks, showing flashes
that he could join the league's elite. But he's never quite reached
the level of Tampa Bay's Keyshawn Johnson, another high-profile
off-season free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Three times, Galloway surpassed a thousand yards receiving in a
season _ although never more than 1,049 _ and he's made a couple of
Pro Bowls. His best season came in 1997, when he caught 72 passes.
</P>
<P>
   Jets cornerback Aaron Glenn knows Galloway all too well, having
surrendered 70- and 57-yard touchdown passes to him in the same
game two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said the Cowboys must tap into the versatility of
Galloway, who played collegiately at Ohio State and was the No. 8
overall pick in the 1995 NFL Draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be looking to use his speed and his ability to go
across the middle,'' Glenn said. ``Because he's the type of guy who
will go across the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Cowboys hope for, since Michael Irvin has
retired. Like Irvin, Galloway has endured a poor perception in the
league, although for entirely different reasons. While Irvin was
loved on the field for his leadership, his off-the-field escapades
got him in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   As for Galloway, his long holdout last year _ he finished the
season with only 22 catches after finally being activated Nov. 13 _
earned him a reputation for selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that your franchise-type players understand how
necessary it is for them to conduct themselves a certain way for
the sake of the football team,'' Seattle coach Mike Holmgren said
early in Galloway's holdout last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Campo said his new receiver has become every bit the leader
early in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like about him as well as anything is that he's
talking to the other receivers, and talking about things he needs
to do, and what we need to do as a group,'' Campo said. ``He's
really a team guy. We knew he was a talented player, but I think
some of the intangibles are some of the things we're really
learning right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Galloway said he's grown into his role as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the league for six years now, and any time
there's a young guy who's doing some things that maybe I can help
with, then I try to do that,'' he said. ``When I first got to
Seattle, I had Brian Blades there, and that was sort of his job at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's time for me to pass some things around.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of passing, Aikman has underthrown Galloway on several
occasions in camp, showing the two still have much timing work
before the season opener Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway shook off the idea Aikman's passes may not match his
speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very strong-armed quarterback, and there are going to
be ones that I don't get to and some that he underthrows,''
Galloway said.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman jokingly tells a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey has made it clear I can't overthrow him,'' Aikman said
with a grin. ``So the first time I do, write about it.''

REDSKINS FANS LEARNING TO LOVE THE MAN THEY ONCE REVILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM ORSBORN  
 c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHBURN, Va. _ Cornerback Darrell Green and defensive end Bruce
Smith are locks for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Johnson is a Pro Bowl quarterback. Rookie tackle Chris
Samuels just signed a $30 million contract and looks every bit like
a future All-Pro.
</P>
<P>
   All four of those big-name players have had their fair share of
autograph requests since the Redskins opened training camp
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But none has even come close to attracting the kind of attention
that's been showered on one Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Just five months ago, Sanders was one of the most hated members
of Washington's chief rival. But these days, Redskins fans who used
to curse the cornerback/kick returner when he was a Dallas Cowboy
flatter him with shouts of ``Deee-on.''
</P>
<P>
   Once reviled as ``that showboating Sanders,'' the seven-time
Pro-Bowler now is the man the Redskins faithful expect to shut down
the likes of Dallas' Joey Galloway and Tampa Bay's Keyshawn
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would be wearing a Deion Sanders jersey,''
said 70-year-old Redskins fan Bill Glacken, shaking his head. ``My
two sons can't believe I'm wearing one either. But I think he'll do
our team good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Redskin now, and we've taken him in,'' said Glacken's
wife of 50 years, Fae.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we look at is, he's an ex-Atlanta Falcon, not an
ex-Cowboy,'' Mark Coran, 31, said. ``We don't claim him as being
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who turns 33 on Aug. 9, is in his 12th NFL season. He
signed a seven-year, $56 million contract with the Redskins on June
6 after spending the past five seasons with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Long considered one of the greatest cover corners in NFL history
and called ``the ultimate weapon'' by Redskins owner Dan Snyder,
Sanders helped San Francisco win a title in 1994 and Dallas one in
'95.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams won the Super Bowl the season after acquiring
Sanders. The Redskins _ thanks to a huge off-season spending spree
by Snyder _ have been tabbed as the favorite to win Super Bowl XXXV
by many Las Vegas oddsmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the potential to win a championship,'' said Sanders,
who received an $8 million signing bonus. ``We have the potential
to do something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season wasn't one of the best of Sanders' illustrious
career. He missed the first two games with a toe injury and was
troubled by groin and hamstring problems later in the campaign. In
January, he underwent arthroscopic knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he's now injury-free and is expected to replace
17-year veteran Darrell Green as the club's starting right
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be an exciting year,'' said Sanders, who will
earn a base salary of $500,000 this season, followed by $3.5
million in 2001. ``I'm looking forward to it. I wish the season
started in a couple of weeks. I feel good. I feel like a young
Darrell Green, and Darrell is the godfather of NFL cornerbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders got burned for some long receptions last season, and
that trend continued on the first day of camp, when wide receiver
Michael Westbrook blew by ``Prime Time'' with a nifty fake and made
the reception about 40 yards downfield.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders laughed off the play, saying a fake by Johnson in the
backfield froze him.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Redskins coach) Norv (Turner) game-plans against me,''
Sanders said with a smile. ``I told him, `Just run it on the other
teams just like you ran it on me.'''
</P>
<P>
   First-year Redskins defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes didn't
exactly shower Sanders with praise after a recent practice. Rhodes
is counting on Sanders to help improve a defense that last season
ranked 30th among 31 NFL teams in total defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is running back into shape, getting his timing back,''
Rhodes said. ``He'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chemistry-wise, Sanders seems to have fit in nicely inside the
Redskins locker room. One of his biggest fans is Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an exceptional player, an exceptional athlete,'' said
Johnson, who was Sanders' college teammate at Florida State. ``I
tell you this, I'd rather play with him than against him. He's an
exciting player, and he'll definitely make our team better.''
</P>
<P>
   Even wide receiver Albert Connell, a fourth-year pro from Texas
A&AMP;M, has embraced Sanders. Connell got into an altercation with
Sanders late in the Cowboys' 38-20 victory over the Redskins last
Oct. 24 at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Connell told reporters the week before the game that Sanders
couldn't cover him. Sanders responded by popping Connell in the
jaw. Minutes later, Sanders shook off the effects of a concussion
and returned a punt 70 yards for the game's final touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Connell said afterward that he had lost all respect for Sanders.
But now all is forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love going up against him in practice,'' Connell said. ``He
said the other day that I was really fast, and that means a lot to
me, especially when it comes from one of the fastest men on our
team.''
</P>
<P>
   And one of the most popular.

EVEN EARLY CRITICS SEE THE POSITIVE SIDE OF DISABILITIES ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL DAY  
 c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Even before the Americans With Disabilities Act
became law 10 years ago this week, it touched off waves of protests
from the business world.
</P>
<P>
   Making changes to accommodate disabled people, business leaders
said, would be prohibitively expensive, spark frivolous lawsuits
and prove especially burdensome to small business.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, attitudes have changed. While not every business
leader is a wholehearted booster of the law, known by the initials
ADA, many say that compliance has been less onerous than they
feared. Others candidly acknowledge that ADA has even been good for
business.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Decker understands how far business has come. The executive
director of a national advocacy group, Decker took part in the
enactment of ADA a decade ago. Today he continues to negotiate with
companies about providing full access to the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   He recently was involved in talks between federal regulators and
Greyhound Bus Lines about making bus travel easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it would bankrupt them and put them out of
business,'' Decker said. But the bus line eventually agreed to
provide disabled-accessible buses. As it turns out, it was a
victory not only for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later, I saw a letter from Greyhound that said their ridership
was up, due to disabled people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ADA, which celebrates its anniversary on Wednesday, has been
hailed as sweeping civil rights legislation. It required public
buildings and businesses to be accessible to people with limited
mobility, sight, hearing or speech.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some expense involved with compliance and
business leaders always chafe when the government dictates rules.
But fears about having to lay off workers or even being forced into
bankruptcy have not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the employers' perspective, the ADA has not turned out to
be the practical nightmare that some predicted,'' said Dallas
lawyer Mike Abcarian, whose firm, Winstead, Sechrest &AMP; Minick,
represents employers in ADA-related matters. ``There are some
fairly definite things you have to do as an employer, and if you do
those things, you'll avoid problems with the ADA.''
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses in particular fretted about being required to
install elevators where none existed, or the burden of disabled
workers who couldn't perform basic functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``An overriding fear we had 10 years ago was, `Will we have to
hire someone to sit next to people who can't see to type for
them?''' said Linda Schoonmaker, an associate with the Dallas
office of the Seyfarth Shaw law firm. ``Little did we know that it
wasn't going to be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The implementation of ADA hasn't been entirely problem-free.
When Maverick Video Productions built a new $2 million,
20,000-square-foot headquarters in Hollywood Park two years ago, it
encountered a surprising amount of ADA-related regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building is on a lot that's slanted, so we couldn't have
any steps,'' said Maverick co-owner Pat Iverson. ``The hallways had
to be slanted, and in the dressing rooms, the hallways had to be
wide enough and we had to have a bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the requirements, she said, were easily folded into the
cost of new construction. The shocker was the $600 fee to have the
building's plans scrutinized for possible ADA violations.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Lamkin, with Dallas-based Brown Reynolds Watford
Architects, said businesses that build new headquarters often have
an easier time with ADA than those that renovate old buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting in a handicapped-accessible ramp doesn't cost any more
than putting in a non-accessible walkway,'' Lamkin said. ``You just
have to plan it from the get-go.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamkin's firm has been authorized by the state of Texas to
oversee ADA compliance in buildings. She said that immediately
after the act's passage in 1990, she saw a spate of compliance
construction in old buildings. Now, business owners usually wait
until they are renovating, then work compliance into their plans.
</P>
<P>
   Retail establishments likely would feel compelled to increase
access even without a shove from the ADA. Estimates on how many
Americans have disabilities range from 40 million to 60 million,
and that number will grow substantially as baby boomers age.
Businesses that exclude disabled customers will suffer financially,
Decker said.
</P>
<P>
   The law also has helped with employment in an era of tight labor
markets. In the decade since the ADA was passed, the nation has
experienced an economic expansion. Many employers looked to the
disabled to fill in the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   The economic expansion has alleviated some of business' pain at
having to open access. The long-running bull market started not
long after ADA was signed into law.

   ISRAEL-BEREAVED TEL AVIV _ Maybe it's not so unusual that
Israeli Yitzhak Frankenthal would know that it has been exactly
2,206 days since his son Arik was killed by Hamas terrorists. What
may surprise you is the company he keeps. Throughout the Camp David
peace talks, Frankenthal has hosted gatherings among Israelis who
lost family members to war and terror with Palestinians who lost
loved ones to Israeli guns. They are literally under one large tent
in a downtown plaza where Frankenthal leads the Family Forum, a
group of ``bereived'' Israelis and Palestinians showing their
support for the talks and their hope for a peace agreement.

   UNIVERSITY-RESEARCH _ WASHINGTON _ Far from ripping off the
federal government, research universities pick up between $700
milllion and $1.5 billion of the overhead costs for the $15 billion
in federal research contracts that they get each year. Those
findings from a two-year-long, congressionally mandated study _ to
be released at a briefing Monday by the Rand Corporation, a
nonprofit think tank _ give ammunition to universities that are
resisting efforts by some in Congress to increase cost-sharing by
recipients of federal research grants. (Mollison, Cox News

bonehead predictions, pronouncements and decisions ever made, and
offered them to the public in an 88-page, soft-cover book. The
result is _ well, two kinds of reading satisfaction. The first is
relief in knowing that it wasn't you who committed the big-time

that your own stupidity has surpassed

   BBO-WOHLERS _ LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Former Braves reliever Mark
Wohlers has found that life goes on, despite one setback after
another. After losing his control, then his job, with the Braves,
Wohlers is trying to make it back to the bigs with the Cincinnati
organization after elbow surgery. No longer does he have trouble
throwing the ball over the plate. But batters are having little
trouble hitting him. At least his home life is better. He will be
married in November. (Curtright, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

Andres Galarraga are on pace to also hit 40. But the feat no longer
means as much. Toronto could have four players reach 40. The Braves
open a three-game series with Florida on Tuesday. (Stinson, Atlanta

 &HT;    Plenty of hype-free substance to all the Potter-maniaDon
O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adults who have dismissed the Harry Potter books as fairy tales
for children may want to change their minds after reading Joan
Acocella's assessment of J.K. Rowling's novels in The New Yorker
($3).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she notes, the Potter stories are fairy tales, but they
also are ``a bildungsroman, plus a murder mystery, plus a cosmic
war of good and evil.'' Acocella finds elements of the Arthurian
legend, the Superman comics, ``Star Wars,'' ``Cinderella,'' ``The
Lord of the Rings,'' ``The Chronicles of Narnia,'' Genesis, Exodus
and ``Paradise Lost,'' all with a touch of Jane Austen and Charles
Dickens. Rowling is not only a good psychotherapist, Acocella says,
she teaches excellent morals. ``Those parents who have objected to
the Potter series on the grounds that it promotes unchristian
values should give it another read.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Politics and personalities: In a special pre-convention issue,
George ($2.95) puts a photograph of a smiling Ronald Reagan on the
cover with the pertinent political question, ``Who will make us
proud again?'' Apparently no one in this batch of candidates. In
addition to retrospective pieces on the last two presidents who
made us feel good _ John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan _ the
magazine includes a viewer's guide to the conventions. If anyone
watches, that is. As the editors point out, the Democrats averaged
18 million viewers and the Republicans attracted 16.6 million in
1996. An episode of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' draws around
23 million.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Going with the grain: Time ($3.50) weighs in on the debate
over genetically engineered crops this week with a cover story on
Swiss professor Ingo Potrykus and his beta-carotene-enriched rice.
This golden rice could save a million kids a year, Potrykus says,
and so could other genetically improved crops. But there are a
number of concerns, including the fear that transgenic foods are
potential sources of allergens and could cause genetic pollution.
Plant scientist Florence Wambugu dismisses protests as ridiculous,
noting that nearly half the fruit and vegetable harvest is lost
because it rots on the way to market. ``If we had a transgenic
banana that ripened more slowly,'' she says, ``we could have 40
percent more bananas than now.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Entertainment Weekly's ($3.50) 10th-anniversary
issue features 10 years of the best pictures from the magazine.
Photos range from the glamorous (Drew Barrymore in lingerie) to the
grotesque (a closeup of a blood-splattered Christian Bale from
``American Psycho''). ... In a revealing photo spread and interview
in W ($3.95), Jennifer Lopez talks about Puff Daddy (``he and I do
understand each other,'') her infamous dress (``I couldn't believe
it was such a big deal.'') and her prominent backside (``A little
bit of jiggly is OK if that's what your boyfriend likes.'').

 &HT;    Women breaking loose at this week's conference
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Brace yourself, Atlanta. More than 80,000 women are
coming to the city this week to get loosed.
</P>
<P>
   The women are traveling from as far as England and South Africa
to attend Bishop T.D. Jakes' third annual ``Woman, Thou Art
Loosed!'' conference at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``When women get full of God, you guys step back,'' said
Paulette Fisher-Wong, 43, who is traveling from Toronto _ an
18-hour bus ride _ to listen to Jakes.
</P>
<P>
   What Fisher-Wong will hear is one of America's hottest
preachers. Last year the dome's single-day attendance record set by
the Rev. Billy Graham was broken when Jakes' attracted 81,000. The
full three-day conference drew more than a quarter-million.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes' storming of Atlanta begins today at 10 a.m. at
Underground Atlanta during a book signing at The Enterprise
bookstore and tonight at 8 at the Atlanta Civic Center when his
play, ``Behind Closed Doors,'' premieres.
</P>
<P>
   The week's activities kick into overdrive Thursday when Jakes'
three-day religious revival opens. It will offer a blend of
preaching and gospel music and center on one theme _ empowering
women.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes is a preaching pioneer. He combines theology and therapy
with a Pentecostal preaching style. It's not uncommon for women to
cry and dance at his services _ even, on occasion, collapse.
Fisher-Wong recalled one of Jakes' sermons when he explored the
issue of rape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to bawl for the people around me,'' she said. ``You
have to go around and hug people in the crowd and say, `It's OK
now, the Lord is taking over.' You become the minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakes is holding a second conference this year, a ``Woman Thou
Art Loosed Plus'' revival. The three-day event, which also begins
Thursday and will be held in the World Congress Center, focuses on
economic empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes, 42, said that while the Bible's message does not center
around finances, the Bible considers it important.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heard bleeds when I meet people who have good moral
integrity but poor business principles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes, the senior pastor of the Potter's House in Dallas, a
nondenominational megachurch with 26,000 members, has not had that
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes is a savvy businessman who has created a cottage industry
that includes the ``Woman Thou Art Loosed'' revival, a best-selling
book of the same name, a special-edition Bible and a CD, ``Sacred
Love Songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher-Wong said she can't wait to shake off her Canadian
reserve this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women will be laying on the ground, crying out to God,'' she
said from her home in Toronto. ``We don't do that up here. We're so
proper. But Americans don't care who's around them. They're just in
love with God.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Exceptionally cool weather for late July will linger in much of
the East. A wavering front will be the focus for clouds and
clusters of showers from the Southeast to the Middle Atlantic
States. The steadiest rain will be in the Carolinas and
southeastern Virginia as low pressure moves north along the front.
On Tuesday night and Wednesday, showers will reach most areas from
the east slopes of the central Appalachians to southern New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonable warmth and ample sunshine will cover a large area
from the Plains to the interior Southeast. After some morning
showers dissipate in the upper Mississippi Valley, a jet stream
disturbance will ignite afternoon thunderstorms in the northern
parts of the Dakotas and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the West will be sunny and hot. A few thunderstorms will
erupt on the peaks of the central Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: MISSING WARMTH
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, record low temperatures were set in several spots
from the Mississippi Valley to the upper Middle West where
overnight readings in the 50's were common. In parts of the
interior Northeast, July is averaging among the coolest in the past
100 years. In the past, unusual summer chill has been connected to
volcanic eruptions which spew fine dust into the stratosphere. In
New England, the summer of 1816, which followed the eruption of
Tambora in Indonesia, had many cool spells and was later dubbed
``the year without a summer.'' This year's chill has no volcanic
connection.

HUMAN DEATHS FROM MAD COW DISEASE RISING: 14 DEAD SO FAR THIS YEAR
IN BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 (Science Times) 
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deaths from the human form of mad cow disease appear to be
increasing, British health officials have reported, but they say it
is still unclear whether the increase is the start of an epidemic
or merely a statistical blip.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 14 Britons have died of the disease. That is
as many as died all last year, and five others are known to be
dying from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend continues and it is, in fact, the beginning of an
epidemic, experts estimate that over the next 30 years as many as
500,000 Britons could die from the disease, which is contracted
from eating infected beef products and is always fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the numbers begin to fall or hold steady, they said,
hundreds or thousands people are going to die from the disease,
called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, which literally eats
holes in the brains of its victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am worried about this year's figures,'' Dr. Roy Anderson, a
zoologist from Oxford University who has studied the epidemic, told
The Independent, a British newspaper, last week.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said Britain was just now seeing the consequences of
exposure to the disease in cows in the early 1980s. He said in
humans the disease had a ``long incubation period, then cases
appearing in a trickle.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise in deaths now fits that pattern, he said: ``That's what
you expect in an epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said the trend was less certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know what the new numbers mean,'' Dr. Peter
Smith, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine, said in a telephone interview. Smith is acting
director of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Council, which
advises the British government on the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that the number of cases remained flat for the last
four years, and that something now appeared to have been ``switched
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it first appeared in humans in 1996, a total of 74 people
in Britain, two in France and one in Ireland are dead or dying from
the disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in deaths this year ``is surprising, and it is of
some concern,'' Smith said. ``But it does not necessarily portend a
large epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department issues a monthly bulletin on the number of
cases, Smith said. The next one is due Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Mad cow disease first appeared in the mid-1980s when British
cattle began falling ill with a mysterious brain malady.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic was traced to protein feed supplements infected
with brain and nervous tissue extracted from sick cows. Since then,
more than 176,000 cows have died from the disease and 4 million
more were destroyed to prevent the disease from spreading further.
</P>
<P>
   But it soon turned out that the infection could spread from cows
to humans through eating contaminated beef products, a fact
confirmed scientifically only last year.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer to humans was first suspected in 1996, when 10
young people died with spongy holes in their brains. Until then,
such symptoms were found only in much older people who died from a
form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease not related to eating beef.
</P>
<P>
   But since the disease may have an incubation period of more than
25 years, the question remains how many Britons may be infected and
will eventually die from it. Millions of people probably came into
contact with infected meat, though it is not clear how many will
actually contract the disease, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   So far all those infected have possessed a particular genetic
trait that apparently predisposed them to the disease. At least 40
percent of the British population share that trait, which involves
a variation of the prion protein, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials announced last week that they had identified a
probable cluster of cases in Queniborough, a small village about
100 miles north of London. Four young adults from the area have
apparently died of the disease in the last two years, and fifth
person, who just turned 25, is near death.
</P>
<P>
   Epidemiologists are combing the village for clues to what the
victims had in common and to help them better understand how the
disease spreads from cows to people.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are handing out questionnaires to the village's
2,297 residents asking them what they ate 10 years to 15 years ago.
They are also investigating 10 local slaughterhouses where cattle
parts, including offal, were often turned into specialty meats.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that a locally slaughtered ``mad'' cow made its
way into sausages eaten by Queniborough's children, said Dr. Philip
Monk, who is an expert in communicable diseases at the
Leicestershire Health Authority.

A SIMPLY FRUSTRATING EARNINGS SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (Financial Commentary)  
 (Editors: Please note disclosure at end.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ This market must be driving the big boys crazy.
Time-honored patterns that made you money for years are totally
failing now, and the only people who can make money are those who
are so nimble and have so little religion that they are willing to
switch sides on a dime.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, during earnings week, I am huddled in the trenches,
checking on conference calls, listening to analysts and monitoring
the ups and downs on a minute-by-minute basis. This time I am
following it from afar, but I see something happening that is so
extraordinary that I have to pen a piece despite my vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, during the first week of earnings a whole set of
companies set the bar too high for the rest of the reporting
companies:
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! blows out numbers, so we figure America Online will blow
out numbers. Wrong!
</P>
<P>
   Altera hits it out of the park, so we guesstimate that Xilinx
will do the same. Wrong!
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsysystems advances so won't Hewlett-Packard? Not a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Unisys stumbles, so shouldn't we be short IBM? Really wrong!
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase ramps, so shouldn't Lucent? Nope, no way.
</P>
<P>
   Novellus looks great, so why not take some Teradyne or some
Applied Materials? Oops!
</P>
<P>
   For fund managers used to predicting what will happen based on
patterns of other companies, this summer is one of the most
frustrating periods in memory. You simply can't forecast. You can't
make a judgment right now from one company to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this forecasting problem is no big deal if you are an
individual who owns a handful of stocks for the long term. But it
is a nightmare if you are a mutual fund manager who owns millions
of shares of a company and have no hope of even remotely getting
out after one of these Xilinx-like disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, capital gets ground down and managers get
increasingly antsy. They can't seem to get it right. But they have
to be in, they have to own a lot of stocks, and they can't just
stay away from the casino.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot? We go nowhere. We don't have that surge of capital
that takes us to new highs. We don't have that exodus that takes us
to new lows. We just muddle along between highlight and
disappointment. Nothing great; nothing bad.
</P>
<P>
   In this environment you want to be a stockpicker par excellence.
You want to own only what you know is good, and you want to own
that big.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't extrapolate and you can't just buy based on an
industry's strong fundamentals, because there is no industrial
rising tide. Sun's ability to blow away the numbers can't help
Hewlett. Yahoo's strong quarter can't benefit AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, this is another one of those periods where it is
better to be an individual unconstrained by the need to own dozens
of stocks, because only a few stocks are really working. Count your
blessings, individuals, and be ultraglad you aren't on the
receiving end of the mutual fund flows right now.
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, I would rather be Sisyphus.

MERCK TOPS ESTIMATES BY 4 CENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Stock prices are not up-to-the-minute) 
 By CAROLYN KOO   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service)
</P>
<P>
   Merck (MRK:NYSE), the second-largest drug company in the world,
reported earnings on Monday that exceeded Wall Street's
expectations by 4 cents and sales that grew 18 percent, led by five
of its drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., also said it is
on track to surpass expectations for full-year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were pleased by the news, as shares of Merck rose 6
1/8, or 10 percent, to 69 7/8 in Monday midday trading. The shares
are trading at a 10 percent discount to the S&AMP;P 500 index, while
most drug stocks are trading at a 30 percent premium.
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter ended June 30, net income rose to $1.7
billion, or 73 cents a diluted share, from $1.5 billion, or 61
cents a share, a year earlier. The consensus estimate of analysts
polled by First Call/Thomson Financial was 69 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose to $9.5 billion from $8.0 billion a year ago, with
pharmaceutical sales rising 18 percent and sales from the
Merck-Medco managed care business also rising 18 percent. Sales of
arthritis treatment Vioxx, cholesterol treatment Zocor, high blood
pressure treatment Cozaar/Hyzaar, osteoporosis treatment Fosamax
and asthma treatment Singulair accounted for more than 50 percent
of Merck's worldwide sales of drugs for humans for the first six
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Those five drugs are in a ``growth phase and we expect that
trend to continue,'' said analyst Leonard Yaffe of Banc of America
Securities. ``They are well positioned for the next six quarters.''
He rates Merck a strong buy, and his firm has done no underwriting
for the company.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are worries that an upcoming proliferation of
expiring patents will hurt Merck's prospects. After all, $34
billion worth of drugs will go off patent between 2000 and 2005,
and Merck is the most exposed to the patent expiration cycle, with
it products accounting for $7 billion, or 21 percent, of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Merck's high blood pressure treatment Vasotec goes off patent
next month, but Yaffe believes that the company's five key drugs
are ``growing so rapidly that they will more than offset the
negative growth from Vasotec. We think the company is bulletproof
from now until the end of 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Prilosec, a proton pump inhibitor or new generation
ulcer drug, goes off patent at the end of 2001, Yaffe thinks the
company is secure because it has put growth mechanisms in place to
combat that loss. Merck does not break down how much it makes from
Prilosec royalties, but it did report that its equity income from
affiliates amounted to $212 million for the quarter and Prilosec
comprises most of that. (Merck receives royalties from sales of
Prilosec, manufactured by AstraZeneca (AZN:NYSE ADR).)
</P>
<P>
   Some of those growth mechanisms include an application for
approval to market a once-weekly Fosamax treatment and the addition
of enrolled members in the Medco business.
</P>
<P>
   Merck also said it is likely to beat the full-year 2000
earnings-per-share estimate range of $2.76 to $2.81, although the
``earnings growth rate for the first two quarters might be somewhat
stronger than the remaining two quarters.''

 By MARK DERR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
   EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK, Fla. _ On a clear, warm day recently,
Dr. Thomas Armentano picked his way through a stand of red
mangroves near the southern edge of the Florida peninsula and
stepped into a bone dry stretch of marl prairie littered with
scores of uprooted, sun-bleached buttonwood trees.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With tangled roots spanning six feet and trunks approaching
three feet in diameter, the weathered relicts were of a size seldom
found among living South Florida buttonwood.
</P>
<P>
   Not more than 100 yards from where he stood, the desiccated
trees faded into a tropical hardwood hammock, one of a vanishing
few coastal hammocks that exist only around Florida Bay in
Everglades National Park and parts of the Caribbean, including the
Yucatan.
</P>
<P>
   This particular hammock is unique in the United States because
of its size, its marl substrate and its orchids, said Armentano,
chief biologist for the South Florida Natural Resources Center,
located in Everglades National Park. Marl is a clay-like limestone.
</P>
<P>
   Covering just over 200 acres and lying less than a mile north of
Florida Bay, the hammock hosts a mind-numbing profusion of wild
bromeliads and orchids, some of breathtaking dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   To protect them from plant thieves, who have nearly stripped
other areas bare, Armentano asked that the hammock's precise
location be kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Hammocks _ basically forests of hardwoods rising on elevated
ground from among pines, marshes and old shorelines _ were once
common throughout South Florida, especially along the coasts. For
much of the past century, they fell to loggers, developers and
charcoal makers, who leveled vast stands of buttonwood. Nearly all
of the remaining hammocks are now found only in the region's parks
and preserves.
</P>
<P>
   Covered head to toe to guard against the sun, poison plants,
thorns and mosquitoes that define walking in the Everglades,
Armentano led a reporter and photographer on a tour of the fallen
buttonwood forest and its neighboring hammock to illustrate the
forces that threaten the survival of some of the nation's rarest
plant communities.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant of those threats, he said, pointing
to the bleached buttonwoods, are hurricanes that can remake whole
landscapes. ``These coastal hardwood communities are uniquely tied
to tropical storms,'' Armentano said. ``Storm effects in Florida
Bay have helped create them, and yet extremely violent storms can
also destroy them.''
</P>
<P>
   This buttonwood forest was toppled by the 1935 Labor Day
hurricane, a Category 5 monster with winds estimated at 200 to 250
miles an hour. That storm battered the Florida Keys, killing an
estimated 800 workers on the Overseas Highway, before churning
across Florida Bay into the Everglades. Hurricanes Donna in 1960
and Betsy in 1965 uprooted the trees left standing. Mature
buttonwood is so hard and dense it does not rot in the hot, wet
South Florida climate, and so the dried-out trees remain, dotting
what in the aftermath of those storms became a low-lying prairie of
cactuses and other succulents growing precariously from salty
ground and inundated for much of the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to hurricanes and their storm surges that can drive
saltwater, sand and mud far inland, other threats to coastal
hammocks are fire, invasion by exotic plants, sudden freezes and
rising sea level, Armentano said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists agree that the $7.8 billion plan to restore what
remains of the freshwater Everglades, the historic ``river of
grass,'' now under consideration in Congress, will do little to
save coastal hammocks. ``It's hard to put a finger on something,
like hydrological restoration, you can do to preserve them,''
Armentano said.
</P>
<P>
   Everglades hammocks are the region's uplands, standing high
enough that they escape flooding for much, if not all of the year.
In this flat and subtle land, high enough means anywhere from
several inches to about six feet for those on Indian middens, or
refuse heaps.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 164 woody species native to these forests, Armentano
said, 135 are tropical, of West Indian origin. The rest are
temperate North American trees and shrubs at the southern end of
their range. Many of the 14 distinct types of hammocks that
botanists have identified are named for their dominant vegetation,
like thatch palm, mahogany, gumbo limbo, live oak (a temperate
tree) or tropical hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   Most biologists believe that the Caribbean plants were brought
to the North American mainland by migrating birds, winds and tides.
They took root in the last 5,000 years, when the Florida peninsula
became warmer and wetter, and the Everglades were formed.
</P>
<P>
   The precious hammocks bordering Florida Bay occupy old sand
ridges, marine marl deposits, or dead coral that seldom stand more
than three-feet above sea level. ``Hammocks like this are only
found in Caribbean areas where the soils and moisture conditions
are similar,'' Armentano said. ``But the islands are overdeveloped
and there have been quite a few hurricanes in those areas in recent
years, so we don't know their condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way into the hammock, he pointed out that as the
land rose barely more than an inch, the vegetation began to change
from ground-hugging succulents to grasses growing under scrub
buttonwood and manchineel, a plant considered more noxious than
poison ivy. In the dappled shade also grew wild hibiscus, wild
cotton, wild cinnamon, limber caper and three types of rangy
cactuses.
</P>
<P>
   After a rise of another few inches, that vegetation faded into
full hammock, a nearly impenetrable, multilayered forest with vines
reaching high into the tree tops. A riot of Spanish stopper,
blolly, and various hardwood saplings formed a thick understory
beneath a canopy of Jamaica dogwood, mastic, sabal palm, mahogany,
gumbo limbo, pigeon plum and wild lime, including one Armentano
called the largest he had seen. The presence of many of these
plants, he said, showed that the hammock was free of the salt
permeating the marl prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical hardwoods usually have short trunks and vast canopies,
the better to shed limbs while remaining upright in hurricanes,
Armentano said, but here, because of past storms, there was a lack
of such big trees. Instead young trees rose straight for 20 feet or
more through the riotous tangle, seeking sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Armentano said that there were about a dozen canopy species
represented in the hammock, with another 20 or so found in the
understory and among the epiphytes, or air plants. The plants put
down horizontal roots, reaching no deeper than a foot, in the thin,
nutrient-poor soil, created from decaying hammock vegetation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Plants grew on top of and around other plants. A strangler fig
entombed a tall sabal palm, leaving only the fronds visible. On an
ancient buttonwood, its outstretched limbs covered with epiphytes,
a cactus grew out of a bromeliad. A shriveled resurrection fern lay
waiting for rain to revive it on a 20-foot-long limb of a Jamaica
dogwood.
</P>
<P>
   Bromeliads and orchids _ cowhorn, mule ear, dollar, ghost and
butterfly _ crowded dead and weathered but still living
buttonwoods, their favorite host, and spilled onto other trees.
Some of those epiphytes were three to four feet in diameter. The
flowers had dropped from most of the orchids, but after a search,
Armentano found a large mule-ear orchid with a long cascade of gold
and rust colored blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   This tropical hardwood hammock has remained remarkably free of
destructive exotics, like Brazilian pepper, a shrub that grows so
densely it crowds out all other vegetation, and Colubrina asiatica,
a vine that covers the canopy, shading out all plants beneath it.
But colubrina has already invaded nearby hammocks, and park
biologists fear its advance.
</P>
<P>
   For 35 years the hammock has also escaped freezes, like the two
in the 1980's that destroyed orchids in much of the park. But this
and other coastal hammocks that are already rare may ultimately
fall to hurricanes and rising tides, especially if, as many
scientists believe, global warming is accelerating sea level rise,
while intensifying hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Already, saltwater is undercutting sand ridges holding thatch
palm hammocks on the north shore of Florida Bay and has destroyed
mangrove and hardwood forests on several islands in the bay itself,
Armentano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tidal gauges in Key West have recorded a nine-inch rise in sea
level, since 1930,'' said Dr. Harold Wanless, professor of
geological sciences at the University of Miami. ``Even if you add
just one foot in the next century to what we have already _ and I
think that is a ridiculously conservative estimate _ you see that
these coastal hammocks are pretty well doomed.''

WEB SITES ARE THE TOMBSTONES OF THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID SIMS   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I found myself in the virtual cemetery of the future last week.
It was my first time, but it isn't likely to be the last.
</P>
<P>
   A friend and colleague with whom I worked for two years in San
Francisco died in his sleep a few weeks ago. He was relatively
young, but suffered from several congenital conditions that made
his death, although unexpected, not unexplained.
</P>
<P>
   He shared several groups of friends _ people from his
neighborhood, from his childhood, a Hollywood group he hung out
with, and the one to which I belonged, his Web friends and
colleagues. We reacted to his death in the only way we really know
how to acknowledge anything: We made a Web site:
www.garybrickman.com.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the site was live and we all added pieces to it
that I realized this was the tombstone of the modern age: A
memorial prominently marked and easy to find in a place where we
all work and visit every day: cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The stories, pictures and links we leave there are like the
flowers or messages our ancestors might have left on the tombstones
of their friends when they passed the churchyard on their way to or
from work.
</P>
<P>
   They are our way of showing our respect and reminding each other
that we are still thinking of him. Gary's memorial is bookmarked,
and any time I miss his wisdom or his humor, I know that his
knowing smirk is just a click away.
</P>
<P>
   I don't pretend that these memorial sites are permanent. But few
memorials are, with a few notable exceptions for pharaohs and
emperors.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and wind, those material agents of time, wear down stone
and metal. A change in operating systems or network infrastructure
may make Gary's site unreachable. But for now, in our time, it's a
solid marker.
</P>
<P>
   I can imagine that in the future there will be virtual plots of
friends and families, and that each of our memorial sites may
belong to several of these sites _ your family network, your
network of friends, your professional network. Each of these plots
may have a portal page linking the members' sites together, a
funeral portal, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   There may even be a business in hosting such sites in
perpetuity. Pay an extra $1 per month to your Internet service
provider, and the ISP will in return guarantee to host your site
for 99 years after your passing.
</P>
<P>
   The site MyFamily.com already has earned a position in the Top
20 most visited Web sites by making it easy for families to set up
intranets that help them share recipes or schedule time at the
family cabin. It's not too much of a stretch to imagine them
extending this service beyond the pale. (I know what you're
thinking, but don't bother: familyplot.com is taken.)
</P>
<P>
   I don't know where Gary's remains are today. But I know where
his memorial in cyberspace is. And I can visit it any time. I hope
someday someone does the same for me.

PROTESTANT GUERRILLA FREED FROM BELFAST PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Michael Stone, a Protestant paramilitary member who
killed three mourners in a Belfast cemetery during an Irish
Republican Army funeral in 1988, left prison Monday, the first of
88 guerrillas who will be freed this week in the last wave of early
releases mandated by the Northern Ireland peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Stone's solo gun and grenade attack during the burial service of
three IRA members who had been shot by British soldiers in
Gibraltar was captured on television and is one of the enduring
images of the sectarian violence that has cost more than 3,600
lives in the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   He served 12 years of six life sentences imposed for the three
murders and three others that he was convicted of in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The early releases of more than 400 men are meant to bring
guerrillas who fought for and against British rule in line with the
1998 peace settlement that has created a power-sharing government
in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   The provision applies only to fighters from groups that have
maintained cease-fires in recent years and whose crimes were
committed before the signing of the pact. The releases can be
revoked for any new criminal involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, 45, passed through a turnstile exit at the Maze prison
near Lisburn in County Antrim on Monday morning and was greeted by
50 cheering supporters carrying the gold and black flag of his
Protestant paramilitary group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters.
</P>
<P>
   He looked grim and said nothing outside the jail, but later at a
news conference at a Protestant prisoner rehabilitation center, he
expressed his commitment to the peace accord that had brought him
his freedom. He added, ``My war is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was sorry for his activities, he said: ``I was a
volunteer with the Ulster Defense Association involved in a 30-year
war, and it was not of my doing. They were military operations. I
was a volunteer.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone's release Monday touched a raw nerve with one victim's
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very bitter, because I think people look at him as a
hero, and to me he's a devil,'' said Sally McErlean, whose son
Thomas was one of three Catholics killed at the Milltown Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Among other prisoners being freed this week are Sean Kelly, an
IRA bomber responsible for the attack on a fish store on the
Shankill Road, the main street of the Protestant part of Belfast,
in October 1993 that killed nine people; James McArdle, who has
served two years of a 25-year sentence for the bombing of London's
financial center at Canary Wharf in February 1996 that killed two
and wounded 40; and Michael Caraher, an IRA sniper implicated in
the 1998 killing of Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick, the last
British soldier to die in the conflict, which is commonly called
the troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The Maze prison held some 800 paramilitary fighters during the
1980s, but by next week only 16 will remain. By year's end,
officials hope to close down the building, which was segregated by
religion and often commandeered by the prisoners themselves.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The dispute in Northern Ireland is a territorial and tribal one
rather than a purely religious one, but those people who want to
see Ulster united with Ireland, called republicans and
nationalists, are largely Catholic, while those who want to keep
the province British, called loyalists and unionists, are almost
all Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland was in the grip of systematic violence in 1988,
and the cemetery attack led to two more deaths days later when a
pair of British soldiers drove into the funeral cortege of Stone's
victims and were dragged from their car, beaten and taken to a
waste dump, where they were shot dead as they pleaded for their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   In a chilling reference to changing times in Ulster, Stone, a
father of nine, noted that Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein, the
political party representing the IRA, was now the Education
Minister in the new Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is in charge of my grandchildren, which is ironic,'' Stone
said. ``I tried to assassinate him as he took his own daughter to
primary school, but I didn't, because his daughter was holding his
hand.''

HIGHER PRICES, STRONG DEMAND BOOST ENERGY FIRMS' RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER BARRETT   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service)
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Higher prices and consistently strong consumer demand
helped several oil and gas companies exceed analysts' quarterly
earnings estimates, with Conoco (COC.A:NYSE) reporting that its net
income quadrupled and Enron(ENE:NYSE), the nation's largest trader
of natural gas as well as electricity, posting a 30 percent profit
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Conoco reported net income of $460 million, or 73
cents a diluted share, in its second quarter, up from net income of
$114 million, or 18 cents a share, in the comparable quarter a year
earlier. Conoco's second-quarter earnings per share were 3 cents
higher than the consensus estimate among analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   The integrated oil and gas company cited the increase in crude
oil and natural gas prices, a 6 percent jump in its global
production, and stronger demand for refined products for its
stellar revenue. Conoco's quarterly revenue rose to $9.5 billion,
up 50 percent from the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the results, Conoco's Class A shares were trading down
3/8, or 2 percent, at 21 13/16 in Monday afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, shares of Enron were little changed after the company
reported second-quarter net income of $289 million, or 34 cents a
diluted share. The Houston-based company, which markets and trades
natural gas, wholesale power and other commodities as diverse as
coal and fiber-optic bandwidth, reported net income of $222
million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. Its current earnings
top the Wall Street consensus estimate by 2 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Enron's $16.9 billion second-quarter revenue number was 75
percent higher than the $9.7 billion in revenue reported a year
earlier for the same period. The Houston-based company attributed
its strong earnings growth to a nearly 40 percent increase in its
wholesale energy business volume. Second-quarter earnings from the
wholesale group's commodity sales and services business ballooned
to $442 million, a fivefold increase from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Enron shares were up 1/16 at 73 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Independent power producer Calpine (CPN:NYSE) soared past
earnings estimates, with second-quarter net income of $51.7
million, or 37 cents a share, 13 cents above analysts' consensus
estimate. The company's quarterly earnings were more than double
last year's second-quarter earnings of $17.6 million, or 15 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose, Calif.-based company's revenue number rose to
$363.7 million, up nearly 80 percent from $196.6 million for the
same year-ago period. Calpine, which relies on natural gas-fired
power generation and is the nation's largest producer of renewable
geothermal energy, attributed the jump in its quarterly earnings to
increased power demand and higher energy prices in some of its U.S.
markets as well as recent acquisitions of geothermal steam fields
and energy facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But a bout of profit-taking sent shares in the company down
Monday. Shares of Calpine were down 3 5/16, or 5 percent, at 69
9/16. The stock hit a 52-week high of 77 1/2 Tuesday, but has since
slipped.
</P>
<P>
   Calpine also announced Monday that it plans to sell $800 million
of a two-part debt offering in a deal expected to be wrapped up by
next week. Proceeds from the debt sale will likely be used to
finance the construction, development and acquisition of more power
generation facilities, and to refinance existing debt, according to
company officials.
</P>
<P>
   One company that was unable to benefit fully from higher oil
prices in the second quarter was Oklahoma City-based OGE Energy
(OGE:NYSE), whose net income fell from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   OGE Energy's recently acquired subsidiary, natural gas operator
Enogex, posted a $1 million, or 20 percent, jump in net income for
the quarter, compared to a year ago. But Enogex's gains were offset
by increased operating expenses at OGE's electric utility
subsidiary, OG&AMP;E, and money spent on new retirement program
enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   OGE Energy's reported net income of $31.7 million for the second
quarter, $6 million less than the same year-ago period. It posted
net earnings per share of 41 cents, an 8-cent drop from the
previous year and 9 cents below the consensus estimate among Wall
Street analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   OGE Energy's quarterly operating revenue was $726.9 million, up
sharply from $450.9 million a year earlier. But a $31.6 interest
expense related to the company's acquisition of Enogex and
increased taxes cut the company's operating income by more than
half.
</P>
<P>
   Its shares were trading down 5/8, or 3 percent, at 19.

ANOREXIA IS NOT LIMITED BY GENDER

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An emaciated boy named Michael sits in a hospital bed, intently
playing a video game. Only 15, he looks like a wizened old man: the
color of his skin gray, his hair falling out and the his arm and
leg muscles all but melted away.
</P>
<P>
   He was referred for a possible diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.
Michael has a much simpler explanation: ``Really, doc, I'm fine. I
just don't want to eat anything that will corrode my arteries and
give me a heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   A most vexing eating disorder, anorexia results from
self-imposed starvation to the point it seriously harms one's
physical and mental health. Often linked to the powerful images of
impossibly thin women shown in the mass media, the problem was long
thought to be almost exclusive to affluent teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, physicians have begun to appreciate that anorexia has
many faces and is hardly restricted to one socioeconomic class or
gender.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age girls in search of the perfect body still make up the
majority of cases. But cases have also been reported among
teen-agers from the rural South, African-Americans from poor urban
centers, and even American Indians on reservations.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, it is not only girls who are at risk. Many boys
stop eating for a variety of reasons, including participating in
sports that require intense attention to weight, like wrestling and
track. Each year, about a million American teen-agers develop
anorexia, and anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 die from its long-term
ravages.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I have been seeing boys and girls who do not want to
eat because of a fear of the effects of fat and cholesterol on
their bodies. Michael's ``lipophobia'' (fear of fat) began six
months before we met when his beloved grandfather, an overweight
man who liked his steaks rare and his vegetables deep-fried,
dropped dead of a heart attack while the two were playing checkers.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Michael had studiously avoided all foods containing
fat. His diet now consisted entirely of water, slices of fat-free
turkey luncheon meat and _ his favorite _ pita bread.
</P>
<P>
   In the months before he was admitted to the hospital, Michael
lost over 45 pounds and stopped his pubertal development. He
suffered many other symptoms, including physical exhaustion, cold,
clammy skin, a slowed heart rate, low blood pressure causing
dizziness whenever he got up and severe constipation.
</P>
<P>
   During Michael's hospital stay a team of pediatricians,
psychiatrists, nutritionists and gastroenterologists worked to
fatten him up to prevent even more serious illnesses from setting
in. We managed to put some weight on Michael with high-caloric milk
shakes that we convinced him were cholesterol-free.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, however, we had to discharge him. After giving his
parents a menu of high-calorie foods for Michael to eat, I asked
him to keep a detailed diary of his daily diet. Within a few weeks
he produced an almost obsessively detailed and beautifully printed
document, showing a return to the pita bread. His parents said they
did not know what to do. ``After all,'' his mother noted, ``you
can't force a 15-year-old to eat, can you?''
</P>
<P>
   Each subsequent week Michael continued to lose weight. Advice
from eating disorder counselors, psychiatrists, and even
antidepressant medications did little to arrest the process.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to comprehend the complex dynamics that lead to
self-inflicted starvation, the vicious cycle begun by limiting food
intake to the point that the brain no longer senses hunger,
followed by the inexorable damage to the muscles, heart, kidneys
and other organs.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a better understanding of anorexia and other eating
disorders, early recognition and concerted efforts by physicians,
mental health professionals and _ most important _ family members,
this deadly disorder can be conquered. But some either come to
diagnosis too late or do not respond to treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Several months after Michael was discharged, a physician from
his hospital called and told me that the boy died that morning of a
cardiac arrest. Despite the boy's fears, an autopsy later revealed
clean and open arteries, with no cholesterol blockages. But the
heart was wasted and shrunken in appearance.
</P>
<P>
   I grieved for the loss of a young man no one could reach.
Neither medical knowledge nor pleading were powerful enough to get
him to perform the simple act of eating three meals a day.

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ American Express (AXP:NYSE) reported earnings on
Monday that exceeded Wall Street's expectations by a penny, largely
because the financial services giant garnered higher fee revenue on
money it manages for investors and because of increased usage of
credit cards.
</P>

   Shares of American Express fell 2 3/4, or 4 percent, to 56 1/2
in Monday afternoon trading after reaching a 52-week high of 59
3/4.
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter ended June 30, net income rose to $740
million, or 54 cents a diluted share, from $646 million, or 47
cents a share, a year earlier. The consensus estimate of analysts
polled by First Call/Thomson Financial was 53 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 16 percent to $5.6 billion from $4.8 billion a year
ago. Its travel-related services unit posted a 17 percent revenue
increase to $4.3 billion and its financial advisers unit posted an
18 percent increase to $1.1 billion, while the American Express
bank/travelers cheque unit recorded only a 1 percent gain to $262
million.
</P>
<P>
   The travel related services business, which reported net income
of $472 million, up from $411 million a year ago, benefited from a
12 percent increase of cards used and higher average spending per
card member. The American Express financial advisers business,
which reported net income of $275 million, up from $242 million a
year ago, gained because of increases in sales of mutual funds,
annuities and life and other insurance products.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the American Express bank/travelers cheque unit
reported net income of $40 million, up from $38 million a year ago,
because of greater commission and fee revenue. However, the unit
also experienced a decrease in net interest income because of
higher funding costs.

 &HT;    Is employee loyalty a thing of the past?
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Is employee loyalty a thing of the past? Several
publications look at this and other workplace issues, without
arriving at a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   In a Context (August/September) interview, former Labor
Secretary Robert Reich asserts that ``employers aren't loyal to
employees'' and ``employees aren't loyal to employers.''
</P>
<P>
   It's because of technology, which gives consumers more options _
including switching to other brands, Reich says. Since companies
must be ready to adjust as needed when they lose customers, ``they
cannot provide job security.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All their costs have to be variable. Inevitably, every
employee in the future is walking on very thin ice,'' Reich says.
</P>
<P>
   Barron's (July 24) says job-hopping has become ``a national
sport'' in the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   But contrary to Reich, Barron's finds that ``many chief
executives are beginning to care more about loyalty and are shaking
their heads at candidates who have a record of jumping jobs every
18 months or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart Money (August) looks at how one popular device adopted by
companies to build loyalty has backfired bigtime this year _ stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   An option to buy shares of the company you work for at a
discount to the market only works if the market price is higher
than the option price. In this year's down market, it hasn't worked
that way, to the dismay of thousands of rank and file workers. Some
$22.7 billion of options wealth was wiped out this year in Silicon
Valley alone, the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's nightmare
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is haunted by a threat
that ravaged the economy in the 1970s _ soaring oil prices, says
Business Week (July 31).
</P>
<P>
   ``An old-fashioned oil price shock could disrupt the otherwise
smooth running of the New Economy by pinching profit margins and
pushing up wages,'' says the magazine. Most of Greenspan's
colleagues think this is not a problem, since oil accounts for
about 1 percent of the economy now compared with 6.5 perncent at
the end of the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   But since it usually takes about 18 months for the full impact
of an oil price rise to be felt by consumers, Greenspan thinks it's
too early to conclude that the economy has weathered this year's
runup in energy costs, Business Week says.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning...
</P>
<P>
   Two magazines with ``personal finance'' subtitles, Kiplinger's
and Bloomberg, offer mutual fund advice in their August editions .
. . The newest Georgia Trend (July) is worth filing away for future
reference because of its annual list of Georgia-based public
companies. . . If there's a ``bubble'' on Wall Street, it's in U.S.
debt to foreign investors, says Forbes (Aug. 7), noting that
foreign holdings of Treasury bonds has risen 38 percent since 1960
and corporate bonds by 20 percent. Foreign ownership of sticks is
up 8 percent. . . A degree of sanity has returned to the stock
market, but as Worth (July/August) puts it, some stock valuations
``are still just nuts'' _ most of them in technology.

DEUTSCHE TELEKOM, VOICESTREAM DROP ON ACQUISITION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Stock prices are not up-to-the-minute) 
 By TIM ARANGO   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a deal that faces opposition from Washington
lawmakers, Deutsche Telekom (DT:NYSE ADR), majority owned by the
German state, agreed to buy U.S.-based VoiceStream Wireless
(VSTR:Nasdaq) for a $55.7 billion package of stock, cash and debt,
the companies said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in both companies plunged on the news. Deutsche Telekom's
American depository receipts were down 6 3/16, or 12 percent, to 45
5/16 in afternoon trading Monday. VoiceStream fell 18 5/8, or 12
percent, to 131 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the deal call for Deutsche Telekom to pay 3.2 of
its own shares plus $30 in cash for each VoiceStream share. Based
on Deutsche Telekom's closing price Friday of $51.50, the deal
represents a 30 percent premium to VoiceStream's closing price
Friday of $149.75.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also includes a $5 billion cash investment in the form
of convertible security. The investment would give Deutsche Telekom
a 10 percent stake in VoiceStream, even if the larger merger deal
fails.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would give Deutsche Telekom its long-sought presence in
the U.S. telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceStream, based in Bellevue, Wash., is still only a year old.
It is the country's eighth-largest wireless company, but has a
growing network with the potential to reach 70 percent of the U.S.
market, with licenses to serve about 220 million people in 23 of
the top 25 U.S. markets. Perhaps more importantly, it is the only
U.S. wireless company that uses technology similar to the GSM
standard that is used throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``American consumers will see an acceleration in the rollout of
state-of-the-art GSM technology,'' said Ron Sommer, chairman and
chief executive officer of Deutsche Telekom, in a statement. ``More
Americans will be able to have one phone, with one number, that
they can use virtually anywhere in the world _ whether they are in
Minneapolis, Munich or Melbourne.''
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the deal would mark the first time a U.S. telecom
was bought by a company in which a foreign government holds a
controlling stake. Some U.S. legislators _ citing anticompetitive
and national security concerns _ moved to block the deal last week
after rumors of the impending agreement flooded the market.
Deutsche Telekom is 58 percent owned by the German government,
although the new stock it plans to issue to complete the deal would
reportedly dilute this stake to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone and Data Systems (TDS:Amex), the second-largest
shareholder in VoiceStream, released a statement Monday giving its
blessing to the deal. TDS owns 14 percent of VoiceStream, a stake
it garnered through the May merger of Aerial Communications, of
which TDS owned 81.5 percent, and VoiceStream.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., drafted a bill that
would block the Federal Communications Commission from waiving
restrictions that apply to companies that are more than 25 percent
owned by foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings' opposition to the deal centers around anticompetitive
concerns, with national security issues playing a secondary role,
according to a spokesman at the senator's office. Under this
thinking, a company in which a government owns a significant share
would not be subject to the same competitive pressures of its
rivals, and thus would distort the marketplace. It would have
easier access to capital at lower interest rates, and the promise
of being bailed out by the government, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Art Poole, an analyst at Raymond James &AMP; Associates who covers
VoiceStream, said regulatory concerns and the lack of a collar on
the deal _ meaning there is no lower limit on the price of the
stock portion should Deutsche Telecom stock fall precipitously _
are weighing on VoiceStream's share price.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors are likely keying on some of the details of the
deal price, which values VoiceStream at about $20,000 per customer,
considerably higher than most recent wireless deals. However,
``That's not a relevant benchmark,'' he said. ``You have to look at
the growth potential of VoiceStream.''
</P>
<P>
   And with VoiceStream's customer base _ a potential 220 million
subscribers _ the growth potential is massive, he said.
``VoiceStream is still early in its life cycle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of the deal could be the creation of the first truly
global wireless company, where customers can take their phones
anywhere in the world and not have to pay roaming fees, he said. He
said that in time the company could launch the first global
one-rate wireless plan. ``That will have an appeal to a very
high-end mobile customer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceStream management waived its right to immediately vest its
stock options, as typically happens at the time of a merger,
meaning top executives will remain, Poole said. Poole has a buy
rating on VoiceStream, and his firm has not acted as an underwriter
for the company.

INDONESIAN PARLIAMENT AND PRESIDENT IN STANDOFF OVER DISMISSALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A surly standoff between Parliament and its
first democratically elected leader dragged on Monday as more than
200 members rejected President Abdurrahman Wahid's explanation for
why he had ousted two popular cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The members signed a petition demanding that Wahid go before the
House of Representatives again to explain his actions. Wahid
outraged the lawmakers in an appearance on Thursday, when he
refused to give an account of the dismissals, saying the House had
no right to interrogate him.
</P>
<P>
   The action Monday raises the heat in what has been a long summer
of discontent. The president is scheduled to face a pivotal meeting
of the People's Consultative Assembly on Aug. 7, in which he is
quite likely to face sharp questions about his often turbulent nine
months in office.
</P>
<P>
   As the supreme legislative body, the People's Consultative
Assembly could remove the president from office. Five hundred of
its 700 members are from the House.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, experts said, the lack of viable alternatives makes it
highly unlikely that the assembly will oust Wahid _ at least for
now.
</P>
<P>
   But the deeply poisoned atmosphere has stirred fears that
violence could mar the meeting next month. The government plans to
deploy 29,000 army troops and police officers in this capital.
</P>
<P>
   The tension has also hobbled the economic recovery. The
currency, the rupiah, has tumbled 25 percent since January and now
trades at levels reminiscent of the Asian economic crisis. Economic
policy is paralyzed, as domestic and foreign investors wait for
Wahid to reshuffle his economic ministers after the Assembly
session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless Wahid fixes the economy, he can't fix all these other
things, because they flow out of people's sense of well-being or
lack of well-being,'' said Gustav F. Papanek, a professor emeritus
of economics at Boston University who is advising the government on
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Wahid apologized to the House for his remarks and
pleaded with lawmakers to lay the matter to rest. But in a sign
that his quirky charm is wearing thin, 252 members rejected the
overture and mounted a scalding attack on his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president should not issue any more baseless or
controversial statements, because it could negatively affect the
stock market, cause recklessness or confusion or trigger disputes
among the public,'' the legislators said in their petition, which
was handed to Speaker Akbar Tandjung.
</P>
<P>
   Tandjung said the House would debate the petition after the
Assembly had ended its session in the middle of next month. That
all but guarantees that Wahid will remain under siege for the rest
of the summer, though few political experts here say they believe
that he is in danger of being ousted.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the sparks between the legislature and the
president are a symbol of how far Indonesia has come. Under the
country's longtime leader, Suharto, the House was a rubber-stamp
institution that did the president's bidding. Since Wahid was
elected, the lawmakers and the Indonesian people have begun to
demand openness and accountability from their politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, a Muslim leader with frail health but a whip-sharp sense
of humor, began his term with a wide-open style that suggested a
break from the past. But in the last several months, his
administration has been sullied by charges of corruption and
arbitrary rule.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Wahid abruptly dismissed two respected ministers,
Laksamana Sukardi and Jusuf Kalla. He appointed his brother to a
senior post at the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Authority. And his
masseur was implicated in a scandal that involved money stolen from
the State Logistics Agency.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with political leaders, Wahid has said the cabinet
ministers had been tainted by allegations of graft. But he has not
produced evidence to support those assertions. Indeed, Sukardi is
still mentioned as a possible candidate to be governor of the
central bank.

   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia _ The dream of a
Marxist-Leninist revolution remains improbably alive amid the
rolling cattle pastures and steamy coca fields of southern
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrillas in crisp, starched fatigues wear Che Guevara buttons,
strum old leftist jeremiads on guitars and pledge to bring Yankee
imperialism down to defeat once and for all. Three portraits of
Lenin grace the press office of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, in this boisterous small ranching town,
including one of the founder of the Soviet Union petting a kitten.
The pitted roads that run through the countryside are spruced with
signs that read ``No more torture'' and ``No More Gringo Military
Advisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Marxist guerrillas in nearby Central America laid down their
arms years ago, and those in neighboring Peru have been nearly
annihilated. As former guerrillas serve in the parliaments of
Venezuela, Bolivia and Uruguay and a Socialist serves as president
of Chile, the left has remodeled itself as a moderate, democratic
force throughout South America.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Colombia, Marxist guerrillas are fighting back
history, pushing around an established army, battling a right-wing
paramilitary force and prompting the United States to adopt a
growing military role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't read the book, but I have seen the movie, and we are
like the last of the Mohicans'' said Comandante Alfonso Cano, a
52-year-old member of the seven-man secretariat than rules the
FARC, the largest and oldest of several guerrilla groups still
operating in Colombia. ``There is a theory that socialism is dead
and history ends with capitalism. But have the people's problems
ended? No. With globalization, there's more poverty than ever, and
a crisis is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   A string of rebel military victories forced the Colombian
government in 1998 to give the guerrillas a demilitarized zone the
size of Switzerland as an enticement to negotiate, and the
guerrillas are using the zone to show what they can do even as they
stall at the talks.
</P>
<P>
   In what is dubbed ``Farclandia'' by some locals, the guerrillas
jawbone merchants to keep down prices of fuel and basic foods,
press workers to repair local roads and bridges, and mediate family
and property disputes in small claims courts they have organized
under military tents. They decree strict controls on guns and dry
laws to stop drinking late at night, and counsel prostitutes,
juvenile delinquents and husbands who abuse their wives.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the guerrilla territory are open to travelers and news
reporters and serviced by a commercial airline owned by the
Colombian air force. Over a weekend visit to this ranching town and
Los Pozos, which was not arranged with the FARC, the guerrillas
were in a carnival-like mood as they sponsored a youth conference
complete with clown acts and acrobatics.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas might seem quaint if it were not for their
efficiency at making war and dealing with cocaine traffickers.
Numbering more than 15,000 rebels, they have satellite phones that
give them a communications edge over the armed forces. They are
wily at wiretapping and cloning cellular phones, enabling them to
anticipate the government's moves. They even use computers at
roadblocks to check the bank accounts of drivers, allowing them to
pick out the richest for kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights and church groups accuse them of forcibly
recruiting young teenagers, kidnapping children as young as 4 and
executing suspected right-wing paramilitaries after secret trials.
</P>
<P>
   According to recent national polls, the guerrillas have the
support of less than 5 percent of the population and virtually no
support outside a few universities and coca-growing areas. But with
coca fields growing in their zones as bountifully as corn in
Kansas, they are surrounded by a lucrative cash crop. By their own
admission, the guerrillas ``tax'' narcotics traffickers and protect
coca growers from police eradication campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's logical that the revolutionary army has to finance
itself,'' said Comandante Mariana Paez, 37, who is a middle-level
commander. ``These coca growers are poor farmers, and the
traffickers exploit them. So the traffickers need to be taxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the winds of change blowing around the world, the
FARC's platform remains largely the same as when it broke from the
Colombian Communist Party to make war on the state in 1964, with
the group still demanding a radical redistribution of land and
wealth and a foreign policy that is independent of Yankee
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Socialists around the world supported perestroika, but we knew
better and criticized it,'' said Paez. Several young guerrilla
fighters, apparently parroting political lessons learned in their
daily indoctrination sessions, condemned Mikhail Gorbachev as an
undercover U.S. intelligence agent who single-handedly sabotaged
the entire Soviet bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The young rebels, many of them poor peasants who worked in the
coca fields before fumigation campaigns destroyed their livelihood,
admit that they know little of Marxist philosophy. But they praised
the guerrilla group for providing them with fresh clothes, good
food, free birth control, jewelry and self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   After the CIA, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the
Colombian police captured the top leadership of the Cali drug
cartel in the mid-1990s, smaller trafficking organizations took its
place and moved into the guerrilla group's zones for protection,
according to American and Colombian military and law enforcement
officials. The Colombian government estimates that the the
guerrilla group now earns more than $400 million a year as an
acolyte of the drug trade, even while it does not itself traffic in
narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial photographs of the region indicate that coca fields have
expanded and clandestine airstrips have multiplied since the rebels
were granted control of the area.
</P>
<P>
   With the FARC and a couple of small rebel groups now loosely
controlling 40 percent of Colombia's rugged territory, and coca
cultivation mushrooming, the Clinton administration persuaded
Congress last month to pass a $1.3 billion aid package for the
Colombian armed forces. Most of the aid will go to outfitting a new
anti-narcotics brigade with 60 attack helicopters, training and
intelligence tools to operate in the southern provinces of Putumayo
and Caqueta, a remote but extensive FARC stronghold and now the
center of the country's coca cultivation.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In several interviews last week at their headquarters in nearby
Los Pozos, guerrilla commanders said they would continue to protect
coca growers from the coming ``invasion'' even as they spread the
war to other regions. ``The FARC is not going to stop fighting,''
said Comandante Raul Reyes, a 50-year-old member of the group's
secretariat and main rebel negotiator at the talks with the
government. ``We don't have to live in the jungle. We are growing
in the population centers like Bogota, Medellin and Barranquilla.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the rebels speak boldly of future victories, the people
who live in their zone of control grumble and express fears of
trigger-happy guerrillas at road checkpoints as well as of the
knock at the door at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are cannon fodder to them,'' said Guillermo Lombano
Gutierrez, a 46-year-old rancher who lives here. Lombano said he
watched four guerrillas come to his door on April 16, 1999, and
take away his 16-year-old son at gunpoint, accusing him of being a
paramilitary. Breaking down in tears, Lombano said the accusation
was a lie. He said he had been writing letters to guerrilla
commanders to find his son, and had not received a reply. ``They
care nothing for us as people,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The local office of the congressionally appointed ombudsman has
documented 41 disappearances at the hands of the guerrillas in the
demilitarized zone since its creation a little more than two years
ago. ``But we don't know all the cases,'' said Alvaro Castel, the
local office director, ``because people are afraid to denounce.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, local Roman Catholic Church workers have documented
15 cases of child recruitment by the guerrillas in the
demilitarized zone, including one involving a 13-year-old girl who
was allegedly used for sex by a comandante before a nun persuaded
the rebels to release her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a lot of rule of law,'' Joanne Mariner, a deputy
director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch, said of
the guerrilla-controlled zone. ``We have documented four
disappearances and saw no evidence in any of the cases that the
people had ties to the paramilitaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the disappearances and forced child recruitment,
Reyes snapped, ``Is this an interview or an investigation?'' Then
he said human rights groups that charged the guerrillas with such
crimes were ``misinformed by black propaganda.''

AIR AND SEA LEND EARTH ITS WOBBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 By KENNETH CHANG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Earth wobbles because the atmosphere and oceans are pushing
it around.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the Aug. 1 issue of Geophysical Research Letters, Dr.
Richard S. Gross, a geophysicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, reports that a mysterious motion known as the
``Chandler wobble'' is caused by changing air pressure at the
Earth's surface and changing water pressure at the ocean bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   As first observed in 1891 by Seth Carlo Chandler Jr., an
insurance actuary turned astronomer, the Earth's axis sways back
and forth about 20 feet every 14 months. The Chandler is one of
several wobbles in the Earth's rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a famous problem in Earth rotation studies,'' Gross said.
``It's just taken so long to fully understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the simplest level, the dynamics of the Chandler wobble are
easy to understand. ``If you're not a good Frisbee thrower, it'll
be wobbly as it flies,'' said Dr. Clark Wilson, a professor of
geophysics at the University of Texas at Austin. ``That's the
Chandler wobble of the Frisbee.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Earth is not a perfect sphere _ squashed in slightly
at the poles and squished outward at the Equator _ it spins a bit
like the wobbly Frisbee. A Swiss mathematician, Leonhard Euler,
first predicted the wobble in 1765, but there has been a lingering
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The sloshing motion of the Earth's molten interior should
quickly damp out the wobble. According to recent calculations by
Wilson, the Chandler wobble should dissipate after only 68 years.
</P>
<P>
   Thus scientists now had to explain why a phenomenon they had
predicted _ and observed _ should actually exist at all. What force
was continually banging on the world to maintain the wobble?
</P>
<P>
   Changes in the pressure of air and water pushing on the Earth
were also candidates. ``That pushing down on the ocean floor is not
symmetrical,'' Gross said. Imagine a large beach ball with children
pushing on it from all directions. If some of the children pushed
harder and some less, the ball would tend to tilt. Because the
Earth is spinning, the tilt turns into a wobble.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 paper in the journal Nature by Dr. Rui Ponte, a senior
staff scientist at Atmospheric and Environmental Research in
Cambridge, Mass., found that the ocean and atmosphere pressure
changes were the primary causes of several of the Earth's wobbles.
</P>
<P>
   Gross refined the earlier analysis to focus specifically on the
Chandler wobble. Using the latest computer models of the atmosphere
and ocean, he calculated that two-thirds of the Chandler wobble is
caused by changes in ocean-bottom water pressure and the remaining
one-third by changes in atmospheric pressure. The results of the
computer models matched the observed wobble between 1985 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's certainly a plausible explanation,'' said Dr.
John M. Wahr, a professor of physics at the University of Colorado.
``My own feeling is that is what's probably doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping track of the Earth's wobbles is more than an
intellectual curiosity. ``It's needed in navigating interplanetary
spacecraft,'' Gross said. Like looking for a star on a rocking
boat, NASA needs to take the wobble into account when pointing
radio antennas on Earth at spacecraft hundreds of millions miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out one of the biggest sources of uncertainty in
navigating interplanetary spacecraft is not knowing how the Earth's
rotation changes,'' Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   Isolating the wobble's driving force will also allow for more
precise measurements of the period, and that will give geologists a
better idea of how viscous the Earth's interior is. ``The period of
the motion tells you about the interior structure of the Earth,''
Wahr said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as geologists have now nailed down the Chandler wobble,
there are still other mysteries of the Earth's spin. Besides the
wobbles, the rotation axis has moved about 30 feet since 1900,
probably because the Earth is still rebounding from the crushing
force of the glaciers that covered much of the Northern Hemisphere
during the last Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rotation axis is not at the North Pole any more,'' Wilson
said. ``It's drifted off toward Kansas.''

   Lanai seems to have made a smooth transition, and figures to
maintain its appeal to world-weary travelers. You're persuaded of
that on the return ride to Manele Bay across the Palawai Basin.
Pull up to an intersection. Look left. See nothing but a cow
grazing perhaps four miles off.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at night at the Manele Bay Hotel, it is blissfully still.
And dark. Low-level lighting is employed throughout the grounds,
and on an island of so little development, the night sky is a rich
exhibit of stars.
</P>
<P>
   As you drift off to sleep, you might permit yourself a smile at
the thought of cars stacked up at a light at Lahaina's Dickenson
Street, or of the wharf area choked with people, noise, music and
bright light.
</P>
<P>
   Lanai is nine miles of ocean and a world removed from that. &QL;

<P>
   The Hotel Lanai, in the center of the island, was built to house
visiting company executives during the heyday of the pineapple
plantation. Today, it offers 10 modestly priced rooms and a
cottage.
</P>
<P>
   (trvl-lanai 6)
</P>
<P>
   The golf course at the Lodge at Koele takes players deep into
forests of Norfolk pines. The course's signature hole is No. 8,
which features a 250-foot elevation drop from tee to green.
</P>
<P>
   (trvl-lanai 7)
</P>
<P>
   The Great Hall at Lanai's Lodge at Koele has the feel of a manor
home, with 35-foot ceilings and massive stone fireplaces. It's an
inviting place to unwind with a book or magazine.

   Along the eastern edge of Hulopoe Beach is a lava shelf with

<P>
   Casual golfers who don't want to take on the challenge of a big
course might be drawn to the 18-hole executive putting green at
Lanai's Lodge at Koele. _____ &QL; 
IF YOU GO &QL; 
GETTING THERE: Hawaiian Airlines and Island Air serve Lanai on an
inter-island basis, but the most popular way to reach the island is
probably by ferry from the Maui town of Lahaina. There are five
departures each way daily. Fare is $25 each way per adult, $20 for
kids ages 2 to 11. It is operated by Expeditions; (800) 695-2624.
Be prepared for a slow ride _ the distance to Lanai is only nine
miles, but the ferry ride, which advertises 45 minutes, took closer
to an hour. The scenery's great, though; several humpback whales
were spotted in late February. To park a vehicle in Lahaina for a
stay on Lanai, try the long-term lot behind the historic Baldwin
House (Dickenson Street between Front and Luakini streets). It's
$10 for 24 hours. A pay machine takes bills up to $10 and issues
tickets that you line up on your dashboard. For a day trip, either
ride the ferry over (Hulopoe Beach is within walking distance of
the landing) or shop around for an operator that offers snorkel or
beach excursions.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING AROUND: Shuttles operated by Lanai City Service meet the
ferries. The one-way fare for a ride to Lanai City at the center of
the island is $10. Guests of the Manele Bay Hotel, which is
adjacent to the dock, must pay $5 for a shuttle ride that lasts
about five minutes _ quite a gouge by the local business folk.
Thereafter, shuttle service between the resorts is free for guests.
Lanai City Service also operates a Dollar car-rental agency, with
four-wheel-drive vehicles available; (808) 565-7227 or (800)
533-7808.
</P>
<P>
   ACTIVITIES:
</P>
<P>
   --Rugged roads lead to two remote beaches on Lanai _ Shipwreck
on the northeast coast, Polihua on the northwest. Aptly named
Shipwreck Beach (a couple of rusting hulks are still stuck on the
shallow reef) is an eight- mile drive from Lanai City. Snorkeling
here is not advised because of shark danger. Polihua is a
beautiful, untracked beach 11 miles from Lanai City. These roads
are little-traveled, so it's advisable to carry food and water in
the event of a breakdown. The island measures only 18 miles by 13
miles, so at worst you'll just have a bit of a hike on your hands.
</P>
<P>
   --The concierge at the Lodge at Koele can provide a map for the
five-mile Koloiki Ridge Trail, which leads to an impressive
overlook of Maui and Molokai. Several trails and jeep roads
crisscross it, but orange posts mark the route.
</P>
<P>
   --The golf is superb on this island. In its recent rankings of
golf resorts, Conde Nast Traveler magazine ranked the Manele Bay
course (designed by Jack Nicklaus) the third best in North America,
the Koele course (co-designed by Greg Norman) the eighth best. The
signature hole at the latter course is No. 8, which features a
250-foot drop in elevation from tee box to green.
</P>
<P>
   --The Manele Bay Hotel features a Fisherman Coastal Trail along
the bluff, but sturdy shoes are a must, as it is extraordinarily
rocky.
</P>
<P>
   --The snorkeling is excellent at Hulopoe Beach, which is
adjacent to the Manele Bay Hotel. If you want to observe marine
life without getting wet, simply visit the tide pools on the
eastern edge of the cove.
</P>

LANAI CITY, Hawaii ... visible just beyond.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hotel's neighboring terrain is parched and uninviting, but
in that regard this resort is not unlike other temples of sun
worship found on the Big Island (Kohala Coast) and Maui (Wailea,
Makena). The Manele Bay has also followed form by laying in a lush
and colorful (if not particularly natural) tropical world on its
grounds. This includes waterfalls, ponds, shady palms, cascades of
bright-colored bougainvillea, and theme gardens, including one
cleverly devoted to bromeliads _ various flowering relatives of the
pineapple.
</P>
<P>
   The birds seem to have moved in and embraced the new look; their
songs will likely be the first thing to greet you in the morning.
(To encourage their presence, the hotel has constructed bird houses
at various points between the hotel and the coastal bluffs.) The
area is also popular with Monarch butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   Beach bums will exult in the hotel's positioning. It is at the
west edge of Hulopoe Beach, a lovely scallop of sand and clear,
blue water. This is the place to decompress with a book under one
of the hotel's canvas umbrellas, occasionally cooling off with a
dip in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The beach is graced with a fascinating shelf of tide pools along
its east edge. There are hundreds of natural bowls here, many
teeming with tiny tropical fish that dart for cover when your
shadow approaches. You can see entire schools in some of the larger
pools. The surf pounds toward this shelf, but is enfeebled the
instant it strikes the edge of the lava field. The footing is
excellent, but rubber-soled shoes are a must (sneakers, water
socks, reef sandals) because the surface is rough and jagged.
</P>
<P>
   Another view of marine life can be achieved in the cove itself,
which is an excellent snorkel spot. A coral bed stretches into the
cove from left to right on about a 45-degree angle (as you face the
water), and with a depth of 10 to 15 feet, this is like being in an
aquarium tank.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to stay on Lanai to enjoy this beach. A ferry
runs from Lahaina to Manele Bay five times a day ($50 round trip
for adults). From the dock, walk up the harbor road to a ``Y,''
take the left fork (a blue-and-white sign says ``Shoreline
Access'') and walk a couple hundred yards to the beach. There is a
pristine beach park here, with restrooms and picnic tables, some
under shady trees.
</P>
<P>
   Bring your own lunch, though. There are drawbacks to savoring
the remoteness of the Manele Bay Hotel, whether as guest or
visitor: You're a captive audience at meal time. During the day,
that means breakfast at the terrace restaurant and lunch at either
the poolside grill or the golf course. (At dinner, the terrace
restaurant serves an impressive array of fresh-fish items, with
main courses priced from $17 to $30; at the elegant Ihilani,
meanwhile, cuisine described as Mediterranean French gourmet is
beyond the reach of all but the most liberal budgets.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the real delights of a Hawaii visit, however _ especially
at breakfast and lunch _ is to find the out-of-the way cafes and
casual locals hangouts in towns such as Paia, Hanalei and Haleiwa.
To track one down in Lanai, you just have to work a little harder
and travel a little farther.
</P>
<P>
   For resort guests, a complimentary shuttle runs regularly
between the Manele Bay Hotel and the Lodge at Koele, with a stop in
Lanai City. Day-trippers can make the same trip for $10 each way on
shuttles that meet the ferry boats at Manele Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Lanai City looks like a company town that still has its sleeves
rolled up, even though Murdock urged a beautification program to at
least get some fresh coats of paint on the clapboard,
plantation-style houses, some of which date to the 1920s. Here,
you'll find front yards overtaken by colorful flower gardens,
Japanese glass fishing balls hanging from porches, chickens poking
around in front yards.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also find the Blue Ginger Cafe, where the red paint on
the concrete floor has nearly been scuffed off. A hearty breakfast
for two here will cost $11.90, and will fortify you for an
exploration of the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Lanai City also has the island's only modestly priced
accommodations. The Hotel Lanai, which James Dole had built to
house visiting company executives and other guests, features 10
rooms priced in the $100 range and a cottage (formerly the
caretaker's quarters) that rents for $140. The rooms are appointed
to reflect plantation life (at least for those who (ITAL)owned(END
ITAL) the plantation), including handmade quilts on the beds.
</P>
<P>
   It is here that you get a sense of Lanai's transition from
island-wide commercial farm to an enterprise of tourism
cultivation. We were shown around by hotel manager Mei Li Akana,
who said her mother was the housekeeper of the inn when the
plantation bosses lived here.

LANAI CITY, Hawaii _ You gain a greater appreciation for the
Hawaiian island of Lanai about the instant you leave it.
</P>
<P>
   When the ferry drops you in Maui's bustling town of Lahaina, you
pick your way through the crowds that clog the sidewalks of Front
Street, then fight through the traffic jams on Honoapiilani
Highway, where road-repair trucks play dodge ball with sub-compact
rental cars. And what's this up ahead ... a (ITAL)stoplight(END
ITAL)?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, to be back on that island that lies just nine miles west
across the Auau Channel. Lanai, the third-smallest of Hawaii's
eight islands, protrudes from the sea at 141 square miles, yet has
only 3,000 permanent residents, 30 miles of paved roads and 363
hotel rooms. You do the math.
</P>
<P>
   Only a tiny fraction of the island is developed, which means
delicious seclusion for any visitor who seeks it. If you find
Hawaii's high-rises and caravans of motor coaches slightly
depressing, Lanai offers the opportunity for four-wheel-drive
explorations of Shipwreck Beach and Mount Lanaihale, solitary hikes
to spectacular overlooks _ and even a few holes of golf in an
other-worldly landscape.
</P>
<P>
   This trip doesn't come cheap if you opt for either of the luxury
resorts that went in about 10 years ago. At the ocean-front Manele
Bay Hotel, rooms start at $350 per night, and if you want something
fronting the sea, it climbs to $600. Inland, at the stately Lodge
at Koele, rooms start at $375 nightly, with mini suites going for
$700.
</P>
<P>
   But solitude has its price. That's probably why this island has
become such a popular destination for those splurging on a wedding,
honeymoon, 25th wedding anniversary, retirement celebration _ or
even an I-earned-this retreat following a particularly brutal
stretch of work.
</P>
<P>
   First-time visitors to Lanai _ at least those enchanted by the
lush, tropical beauty of other Hawaiian islands _ might be in for a
bit of a shock. This island is tucked snugly into the lee of Maui's
twin peaks, Haleakala and Puu Kukui, such that Maui waylays and
expends most of the tropical storms before they can get here.
</P>
<P>
   Lanai registers only about 40 inches of annual rainfall on its
east side (a fraction of what slams into other islands in the
chain) and barely gets into double digits on its west side.
</P>
<P>
   This might account for Lanai's arrested development over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient Hawaiians believed the island was inhabited by evil
spirits, and it came to be known as the Forbidden Isle. In the late
18th century, seafarers probing the archipelago found this island
desolate and uninviting for settlement. It was used later for
ranching, with minimal success.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the early 20th century, James D. Dole bought the entire
island for $1.1 million and harnessed it for pineapple farming. The
plantation would become a vast one, ultimately earning the island a
new nickname, the Pineapple Isle.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, tycoon David Murdock acquired a major chunk of
Castle &AMP; Cooke, the Dole Food Co.'s parent company, and began to
guide Lanai in a new direction. Asian markets were undercutting
Hawaii's pineapple production. And in an era of escalating stress
in white-collar occupations, the resort industry was recognizing a
growing demand for away-from-it-all options. Preferably ones in
regions that are perpetually warm, sunny and dry.
</P>
<P>
   Murdock swapped pineapples for reclusive tourists, opening the
Lodge at Koele in 1990 and the Manele Bay Hotel a year later. The
capital outlays, much of it for island infrastructure, were
staggering. The cost of operation remains steep in so isolated a
locale. According to several reports, the red ink is being stored
in drums. But the island's niche market would seem to hold promise.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly didn't hurt matters when Microsoft chairman Bill
Gates chose Lanai for the site of his wedding on New Year's Day
1994. Then worth a paltry $7 billion, Gates was so determined to
maintain privacy for the event, he essentially rented the entire
island _ booking every hotel room and campsite on Lanai, reserving
nearly every rental car (he overlooked two jeeps), and hiring and
grounding every helicopter on Maui.
</P>
<P>
   Gates chose as the site of the sunset ceremony the 12th tee of
Manele Bay's Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course. It's an over-water
hole, wrapped around a precipitous bluff above the Pacific. This
choice was understandable enough _ most visitors to Hawaii can't
get enough of the view of an ocean that is dazzlingly blue here
just under the Tropic of Cancer.
</P>
<P>
   That is what makes the location of the Lodge at Koele so
intriguing, if not daring. It not only doesn't have ocean-front
rooms, you can't even see the ocean from its roof. It lies nine
miles inland of the ferry dock, at the very center of the island,
on the edge of the pineapple company town of Lanai City.
</P>
<P>
   It's new, but was constructed to look like a 19th-century manor
home _ the kind of place a plantation lord might have built as a
monument to his wealth and station. It has a Great Hall with a
35-foot ceiling and stone fireplaces, a library with
floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, a music room, a grand porch.
</P>
<P>
   It brings to mind the mansion built by Wild Whip Hoxworth in
James Michener's epic novel, ``Hawaii,'' after Hoxworth carved out
a pineapple plantation on remote Kauai. The ``magnificent house''
of fiction was said to have been built of massive timbers and
surrounded by exotic gardens, just as this is.
</P>
<P>
   Even the hotel's recreational offerings suggest aristocratic
amusements: croquet and lawn bowling, clay-pigeon shooting,
horseback riding, even an 18-hole putting green.
</P>
<P>
   The lodge sits at about 1,700 feet next to a grove of Norfolk
pines (planted in the early 1900s to catch fog drip and enhance the
island's precious groundwater reserves). It can get chilly at that
elevation, which accounts for the preponderance of fireplaces in
the lodge and extra blankets in the guest rooms. Doesn't sound much
like traditional Hawaii tourist lodgings, does it?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who like the tropics but don't like being
real warm,'' spokeswoman Gigi Valley said over lunch in a terrace
restaurant that overlooks a lake, hillside gardens and a thick
forest. ``The beach is only 15 minutes away, but this is totally
different. In Hawaii, there are not any other places like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The lodge's isolation is evident when you embark on the Koloiki
Ridge Trail. After crossing the golf course, you're in wilderness
within a few steps, wandering along dirt tracks through pine
forests, red-dirt gulches and Lanai's trademark scrubby terrain.
The real payoff of the five-mile loop hike is a sensational
overlook from which the islands of Molokai and Maui can be seen in
the distance.
</P>
<P>
   For visitors who seek a more traditional resort experience,
there is the Manele Bay Hotel. It sits on a slope above beautiful
Hulopoe Beach and is constructed in a style that has become the
beach-front standard in Hawaii _ a tiered, open-air lobby that
opens onto a sprawling pool area, with the ocean visible just
beyond.
</P>

JULIE BROWN KIDS THE VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cable comedy diva Julie Brown finds the makings of over-the-top,
absurdist humor in almost anything caught in her crosshairs.
</P>
<P>
   There's been Madonna (``Medusa: Dare to Be Truthful''), Tonya
Harding, Delta Burke, Carnie Wilson and, on the big screen, alien
invasion movies (``Earth Girls Are Easy''), for example.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time before this longtime San Fernando
Valley resident hit on that Southern California retail phenomenon:
the mini- mall.
</P>
<P>
   To many locals, the thousands of mini-malls here are eyesores,
architectural mistakes that exemplify everything wrong with zoning
laws, blights on the neighborhood to mutter about even as we are
pulling in to drop off our dirty laundry, get our nails retipped
and scarf a doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   To Brown, the mini-mall is the perfect setting for her newest TV
show, Comedy Central's ``Strip Mall.'' The series is a send-up of
prime-time soap operas, with a serial format involving murder,
intrigue, lust, betrayal, Chinese food and gift baskets.
</P>
<P>
   The strip mall in question, the fictional Plaza del Toro, is set
in Northridge, but Brown insists she didn't do that just to make
fun of the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Valley, I grew up in the Valley,'' she said during
a recent interview outside the Burbank mini-mall that's used for
the exterior shots. ``I was born in Burbank, so I don't feel that
I'm just picking on the Valley. I still live here, in Studio City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writers write about what they know, and to me, one of the
funny elements of growing up here is sort of the strip-mall
consciousness that's just come all over the Valley. It's just
everywhere,'' Brown said. ``I feel like this is a reality for me
that I'm finally getting to play out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Valley's this great sort of suburban place, but
the thing that's unique about it is it's right next to Hollywood,
so the element of Hollywood is in the consciousness of the Valley.
It's always been there.''
</P>
<P>
   It definitely is there in the plot of ``Strip Mall.'' Brown
plays Tammi (say it ``tah-MEE'') Tyler, a former TV child star who,
at the peak of her popularity on the `70s show ``Here Comes
Corky,'' stabbed her co-star, Cap'n Billy, to death after eating a
PCP-laced cupcake.
</P>
<P>
   Now a waitress in the strip mall's dive cocktail lounge, she
wears rhinestones by her eyes, right next to fake lashes that look
like carwash brushes. There's very little in her wardrobe that
doesn't involve maribou or spandex. Tammi still refers to the
bloody slaying as ``an accident.'' And she desperately wants to be
rich and famous again.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's that other Hollywood angle. One of the shops
is We Shoot You, a special-occasion videography shop that is a
front for a pornographic film production house.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that was one of the first story angles she came up
with when creating ``Strip Mall'' with her longtime writing
partner, Charlie Coffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to think of something for cable specifically that
was funny and sexy, and I knew that there's more porno shot in the
Valley than anywhere in the world,'' she said. ``And so I thought,
'That's sort of sexy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I always really loved `Mary Hartman,' the show, so the
idea of doing a soap opera that's set in a strip mall _ the most
normal place, we see a million of them _ that there would be this
much insanity, intrigue, sex, lust, bizarreness going on in a strip
mall just seemed funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she and Coffey started to brainstorm the other characters
and situations in their Plaza del Toro microcosm: Patty (Victoria
Jackson), the ditsy barmaid with a metal plate in her head; Harve
Krudup (Jim O'Heir), the obese owner of the Star Brite cleaners
whom Tammi marries impulsively in her quest for wealth; Rafe and
Bettina Bellingham (Maxwell Caulfield and Eliza Coyle), owners of
the failing Good Things gift basket shop; and Fanny and Althea (Amy
Hill and Loretta Fox), the sex-crazed lesbians who run the Wok
Don't Run Chinese restaurant. Sergei Solokov (Greg Itein) is the
porno king who hooks two recent film school grads _ Josh (Jonathan
Magnum) and Barry (Chris Wylde) _ to make his ultra-cheap movies.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't been with ``Strip Mall'' from the beginning last
month, have no fear. Each episode's intro can bring you up to speed
before you can say ``Erica Kane's getting married again?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the show has continued to evolve throughout its first
season. For instance, Blunt was Tammi's dull-witted, vain, ex-con
boyfriend whose character came and went in the pilot episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loved him and suddenly the character is dead, so while
we're shooting the pilot we decide we love him so much he has to
come back,'' she said. ``So we go, 'OK, what if he has a twin
brother?' _ a soap-opera convention. So he'll be a gay twin brother
named Blair. Then, what if he has another brother who's straight,
so now he's identical triplets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just evolved because we love Bob (Koherr) so much and
thought he was so funny, so we thought, 'What if we just keep
giving him more brothers to play?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tammi meets Blank, brother No. 3, while he's waiting in the
getaway car for his girlfriend, who is robbing Wok Don't Run. ``And
there's even a possible fourth brother we've thought of named Blurt
who has Tourette's,'' Brown said, laughing at her own joke.
</P>
<P>
   Brown started working with Coffey when both were studying acting
at San Francisco's prestigious American Conservatory Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have been a writer at all if I hadn't felt a
need for material,'' she said. ``Even when I was in high school, I
wrote material. I remember when I was a little kid doing shows for
my parents, thinking, 'What should I do?' feeling the need for
material always. Is that weird?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said she and Coffey, in creating ``Strip Mall,'' set out
to push the humor envelope.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you know you're doing a show for cable, you want to make
it outrageous because who's going to watch it if it's like
'Caroline in the City?' That's my model for what I don't want to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of network sitcoms that you go, 'I don't
understand this.' I think there are a lot of talented people on
those shows, but comedy by committee doesn't work very well. And
that's what it's a result of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had to go through it and it's really hard and it
doesn't come out funny, because comedy is a point of view. Is it
going to be 25 people's points of view? What is that? It's usually
watered down, people have taken the edges off it, and it's not that
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Strip Mall'' definitely has its edges. There's the time Tammi,
being interrogated by police, attempts to distract them by taking
off her underwear a la Sharon Stone and instead attracts the
attention of a bomb-sniffing dog. Or the time she is struck by a
tranquilizer dart and falls asleep in a dumpster, then awakens from
a lusty reverie with a rat nibbling her ear.
</P>
<P>
   Brown says now that she's a mother of a 6-year-old boy, there
are some things she won't do in the name of comedy, such as nudity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I guess some of this ('Strip Mall') stuff seems so
outrageous, people go, 'What's your son going to think when he sees
it?' I hope he thinks it's funny and he's proud of me for doing
something I want to do.'' &QL; 
---The show: ``Strip Mall.'' &QL;

Maxwell Caulfield, Greg Itein, Jonathan Magnum, Chris Wylde. &QL;

   ATLANTA - Get ready for an avalanche of Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and its cable partners will air 441 1/2 hours of coverage
from the Sydney Games _ surpassing by more than 100 hours the
coverage of the Barcelona and Atlanta Games combined.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to 162 1/2 hours on NBC, the network will put 214
hours on MSNBC and 65 hours on CBNC. It will be the first time
Olympic coverage has been offered on basic cable.
</P>
<P>
   The last time NBC went beyond network programming for a Summer
Olympics was the ill-fated pay-per-view Triplecast in 1992 at
Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   ''The financial disaster aside, editorially the Triplecast was a
terrific concept,'' said Molly Solomon, NBC Olympics Cable
coordinating produce, ''and we're kind of going back to that model.
The programming (on MSNBC and CNBC) will not be repeats of the
network broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   The two cable networks will provide start-to-finish coverage of
such sports as softball and soccer, which usually receive just
cursory coverage on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC's main event will be boxing. MSNBC's coverage will be built
around men's and women's soccer and basketball, women's softball
and equestrian. It also will have doses of baseball, beach
volleyball, rowing, tennis, water polo and weightlifting, and
limited air time for such virtually invisible sports as archery,
canoeing, field hockey, table tennis and team handball.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cable side will be for people who are enthusiastic about a
particular sport,'' Solomon said. ''It will definitely be more
event-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, the MediaOne cable system does not carry MSNBC.
However, its Channel 33 will pick up all of the MSNBC coverage,
which runs during daytime hours for the run of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's success, however, will be defined by the coverage on NBC,
specifically the 84 hours in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   The network paid $705 million for the rights to the 2000 Games,
57 percent higher than the fee for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought we would lose $50 million to $75 million,'' NBC
Sports chairman Dick Ebersol said. ''Due to advertising sales and
affiliates contributions, we're now looking at making a little
profit. We had a record $680 million in sales in Atlanta, but we've
already crossed $800 million in Sydney, and we may reach $900
million by September.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC, having met the challenge of the network's accountants,
still must produce ratings that will meet the expectations of
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The network concedes that the average rating of 21.6 for the
Atlanta Olympics is an unrealistic goal for Sydney. NBC is
projecting ratings of 17.5 to 18.5.
</P>
<P>
   The network never considered showing any of its coverage live,
because of the 15-hour time difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''An event at 8 p.m. in Sydney is taking place at 5 a.m. in New
York, and who's going to be watching then?'' Ebersol asked. ''To do
live coverage at that time of morning would dissipate what we're
doing. Also, the results will not be in most newspapers before
they're on our air. The Olympics are pretty expensive, and the only
way to justify that expense is to try and draw the widest possible
audience in prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's first week will be anchored by gymnastics, swimming and
diving, with an emphasis on track and field in the second week. The
network plans to devote less time to features than it did in
Atlanta,
</P>
<P>
   ''But our mantra is still story-telling,'' said David Neal, head
of production for NBC Olympics. ''It's the same principles Roone
Arledge used at ABC in the '60s and '70s. It's not enough to
present the competition, because the audience for the Olympics is
diverse. It's not just a sports audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's crucial to make a connection between viewers and
athletes, because it's not so much about sports as it is the human
drama.''
</P>
<P>
   According to NBC Research, the audience makeup for regular
sports programming is 54 percent male, 34 percent female and 12
percent children under 11.
</P>
<P>
   For the Summer Olympics, those numbers are 49 percent female, 39
percent male and 14 percent children.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that pattern, NBC thinks that televising an Olympics
during baseball pennant races and early weekends of football season
will not have a dramatic effect on its prime-time ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ''The football may draw away some of the male audience, in which
case we're only talking about an impact on a third of the Olympics
audience,'' Ebersol said. ''But to give you an idea of what the
Olympics mean, our competitors went to Nielsen and made sure the
new season would not begin until Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''That way the Olympics will not count in the overall average
for the new season. But on the other hand, it also means our
Olympics programming will not face any of the new fall programming
on the other networks.''

   As high tech spreads outward from Silicon Valley to American
society at large and people spend more and more time in cyberspace,
the journalist Paulina Borsook steps back to look at the digerati
and their view of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Her conclusions: that high-tech culture is ravingly
anti-government, anti-regulation and ``psychologically brittle,''
that it manifests ``a lack of human connection and a discomfort
with the core of what many of us consider it means to be human,''
and that its view of human nature ``reduces everything to the
contractual, to economic rational decision making'' and ``ignores
the larger social mesh that makes living as primates in groups at
least somewhat bearable.'' In short, Borsook argues that high-tech
culture promotes an Ayn Rand-ian view of the world, where the
strong in tooth and claw survive, and the meek and unmarketable
perish.
</P>
<P>
   Borsook does not write as a Luddite outsider but as longtime
observer of the tech world _ she was a contributing writer to Wired
magazine in its formative years _ and she has written a smart,
funny and irreverent book. ``Cyberselfish'' is both an engaging
companion to to ``Escape Velocity'' (1996), Mark Dery's provocative
study of cyberculture in the 1990s, and a bracing antidote to the
Pollyanna-ish cyber-utopianism of Esther Dyson's ``Release 2.0''
(1997).
</P>
<P>
   The dominant mind-set in high tech today, Borsook argues, is
libertarianism in its many manifestations, from laissez-faire
free-market economics to a more virulent form of
``anarcho-capitalism.'' It boasts an ugly, selfish code of behavior
and functions as a perfect mirror of the dark side of our
``winner-take-all casino society.'' Many techies also evince an
aggrieved, adversarial attitude toward the establishment or, in
tech-speak, TPTB, ``The Powers That Be.'' There is a tone of
adolescent paranoia _ reminiscent in equal parts of ``The X-Files''
and ``Falling Down'' _ to many techno-libertarian exchanges, a
sense, in Borsook's words, of ``testosterone-poisoned guys with
chips on their shoulders and too much time on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Borsook contends that many of the favorite arguments of
techno-libertarians come from ``bionomics'' _ that is, they like to
use metaphors drawn from biology to explain economic behavior and
endorse a decentralized free-market system. Reduced to a bumper
slogan, Borsook writes, bionomics states that ``the economy is a
rain forest.'' In other words, it suggests that ``no one can manage
or engineer a rain forest, and rain forests are happiest when they
are left alone to evolve, which will then benefit all the happy
monkeys, pretty butterflies and funny tapirs that live in them.''
</P>
<P>
   This social Darwinism not only fails to afford protection to
those less equipped to flourish in the jungle _ those
``hypersensitive maladaptive no-commercial-potential individuals''
_ but in Borsook's opinion also fails to ensure the triumph of the
best. ``It's a dirty little secret in high tech that superior
marketing and inferior technology will beat out superior technology
and inferior marketing every time,'' she writes, ``and that other
factors, aside from Darwinian fitness, determine which technologies
and which companies thrive or perish.''
</P>
<P>
   Borsook makes it clear that she shares many of the libertarians'
most fundamental assumptions _ ``What I most want is to be left
alone,'' she writes. ``I don't have that will to power that would
ever suggest that I know how to tell other people how to live their
lives.'' She also criticizes the United States government for what
she calls its ``mostly awful handling of free speech and privacy as
these relate to technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But while she comes down hard on federal efforts to curtail
digital privacy, calling them a violation of civil liberties and
due process, she is equally tough on those techno-libertarians who
extrapolate their anger at the feds' stand on cryptography
(encoding used for security purposes) to the government at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part,'' she observes, ``the government has made
Silicon Valley a fine and dandy, safe and regularized place to make
scads of money. A gargantuan infrastructure of suppliers and
educational institutions, directly and indirectly subsidized by the
government, nurtured the defense-electronics industry, which formed
the substrate for today's high-tech industry.''
</P>
<P>
   She is equally impatient with what she sees as high tech's
insular selfishness _ its gonzo individualism animated, she says,
by a crippling blindness to human frailty and imperfection. She
argues that techies' love of machines and rule-based programming
leaves them ill-equipped to deal with emotions and other
unquantifiable things, such as art,and that this is why the
digerati often prefer to escape the real world for a virtual one
and demonstrate little sense of civic responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   There are passages in ``Cyberselfish'' where Borsook's fervor
gets the better of her fair-mindedness. Her portrait of a former
Reagan speechwriter, George Gilder _ a hero to the conservative
wing of high tech just as the former Grateful Dead lyricist John
Perry Barlow remains the avatar of its neo-hippie wing _ turns into
an angry rant; and her assessment of high tech's philanthropic
record verges on the churlish, taking the digerati to task for the
sort of donations (often computer-based in nature) that they choose
to make.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, Borsook combines common sense with
an old-fashioned humanism to make sense of the current high-tech
gestalt. She has done a nimble job of tracing the digerati's
libertarian roots in the counterculture of the '60s and the
Reaganism of the '80s, and she proves equally adept at exploring
the social and political fallout of their cultural ascendance.

KIDS STEP RIGHT UP AT CIRCUS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For any kid who ever dreamed of running away with the circus,
the ultimate rush could come before the Greatest Show on Earth even
begins.
</P>
<P>
   Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey lets ``children of all ages''
get up close and take in the roar of the greasepaint and the smell
of, well, the elephants, through its hands-on, behind-the-scenes
preshow experience called Three Ring Adventure.
</P>
<P>
   It seems kids are losing their ability to ``ooh'' and ``aahh,''
unimpressed by stunts and spectacle as much as parents complain
they are being desensitized to violence. Three Ring Adventure is an
antidote to that problem.
</P>
<P>
   It gives circusgoers a chance to talk with and, in some cases,
play with some of the 100 or so performers, humanizing them and
making their acts later even more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Watching a band of clowns jump, bump, stumble, spray and slide
through a routine during the show itself is a pleasure. But meeting
them, watching them put on their makeup and being close enough to
see the stitches in their costumes and feel the spray from their
seltzer bottles _ that's great.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I took my daughter, Renee, and her friend, Talen
Weinman, both 6, to Long Beach Arena for the opening night of
Ringling's latest Southern California visit. (The troupe is in
Anaheim this week and Los Angeles next week.)
</P>
<P>
   They were excited but leery at first of our escort, a
bespectacled, red-nosed fellow with a bright yellow vest and huge
shoes. But this young clown, the appropriately named Josh Zehner of
Fullerton, knew instinctively how to handle them. He avoided
clowning for them and instead behaved like a regular guy who just
happens to wear funny clothes to work.
</P>
<P>
   They eagerly went wherever Zehner led them around the arena,
getting a personal introduction to Ringling's towering new
ringmaster, 30-year-old Michael James McGowan.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me this is kind of a highlight because you get to see up
close what I call `saucer eyes' on kids,'' McGowan said of the
preshow, ``because you get kids who aren't provoked by their
parents and they're just totally amazed. It's like they don't know
whether they should run up and hug you or run away because
everything is so amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also I think you can learn a lot about the animals, you can
learn about clowns, you can learn about how things are done in the
circus so then when you see the circus you have that much more
information with you,'' McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   We walked past an acrobat from China spinning plates on sticks,
then met Todd Zimmerman, a Clown Alley veteran who was painting his
face as passersby watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just baby powder,'' he said of the white cloud that hung
around his head. ``That's how we keep our makeup on.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was on to Ring Three for another introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to meet Karen? Do you know who Karen is? Karen is
one of our elephants. Come here,'' Zehner said, pulling Renee and
Talen along without giving them much chance to chicken out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaagghh!'' Renee shrieked, smiling all the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise you we'll stay back,'' Josh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' Renee replied. ``I'm not going to shake hands!''
</P>
<P>
   Karen's handler did not demand anything of the pachyderm _ she
was saving the best stuff for the show _ but Karen stood by docily
as the handler spouted information: At 31, she is the youngest
adult performing elephant in the troupe, weighs a dainty 8,500
pounds and packs away about 250 pounds of food each day.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the costume rack, where about a dozen pieces from past
productions wait on hangers for fans to examine, touch or try on.
It was a popular attraction, but not swamped by people.
</P>
<P>
   Talen, who already had adamantly refused to try on a rubber
nose, declined the invitation to wear a costume. But Renee, whose
passion for jewels, beads and sparkles knows no limits, put on a
sequin-covered tailcoat.
</P>
<P>
   Zehner explained that the costumes are hand-stitched and very
hefty _ this dancer's coat must have weighed about 20 pounds _
because of the demand for durability through hundreds of
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Ring Two had kids taking turns on the rola bola, a simply
designed balancing trick involving two boards with a cylinder in
between. They were given as much support as they required by two
Ringling acrobats. The idea, after all, is to have fun, not to get
bruised.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was back to Ring Three for trainer Hans Suppmeier's
demonstration with some of his liberty horses, which Talen was
eager to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you train an animal you must build up trust first,''
Suppmeier said in his German accent as he put the horses through a
limited routine. ``Once the animals are trusting you, you can teach
them anything.''
</P>
<P>
   After the horses stepped out it was time for Josh and some of
his Clown Alley colleagues to take the floor, with props ranging
from seltzer bottles and ragmops to plungers and toilet seats (the
latter serving as lances and shields in a mock joust). A pair of
clowns brought out two trained pooches, four-legged clowns
themselves, and enlisted a 12-year-old boy from the crowd for their
short act. Later one of the clowns got a ball spinning on her
fingertip and then had Renee and Talen take it on theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The kids loved watching their buddy Josh perform during the
Three Ring Adventure and delighted in spotting him several times in
the show.
</P>
<P>
   That, Zehner said, is the idea behind Three Ring Adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to personalize the show,'' he said. ``Our loyalty has
gone up. We have people who have come back and remember specific
clowns and specific dancers. And it makes it more fun for the
performers too.''
</P>
<P>
   Zehner, 21, was in the last graduating class of Ringling's famed
Clown College, which shut down in 1997 and may reopen in the future
after some reassessment of the program's goals.
</P>
<P>
   One problem Ringling faces is keeping its performers long enough
to warrant the nine-week intensive training. Career clowns like
Emmett Kelly are a rarity now. Zehner said there are some in Clown
Alley who have been with the circus as long as 10 years, but the
average endurance these days is one to five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking people to give up everything for at least a
year. No car, no home, you're living on a train,'' he said. ``One
thing I've found with circus life is you either love it or hate
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zehner was recruited by Ringling during his senior year in high
school after circus representatives learned of his improvisation
talents. He found out only after graduating from Clown College that
his great grandfather had been a Ringling clown as well, and his
great aunt was a daredevil circus performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a neat thing to brag about around the show if you have
circus blood,'' he said. Just the same, he's not sure how long
he'll continue in this line of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really enjoying myself right now. I'll stay with it as
long as it's still fun,'' Zehner said. ``No matter now emotionally
sound you are, you can't be happy every day. It might sound cheesy,
but when you get out there and start having fun, it makes you
happier.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? There may have been a few kids running and laughing
through Three Ring Adventure who will grow up to be Ringling
performers.
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to say whether Renee and Talen have what it takes.
But they aren't scared of clowns anymore. &QL;

PRIVACY EXPERTS QUESTION FBI E-MAIL MONITORING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: FILED in ``w'' and ``f'' categories.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Privacy advocates and technology experts on Monday
blasted a new FBI program to police the Internet, saying the system
allows agents to monitor e-mails of people who are not targets of
criminal probes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI asks you to trust them with unsupervised access ... to
literally millions of innocent communications,'' Barry Steinhardt,
associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union, told a
House subcommittee investigating the system. ``For me, that's an
enormous leap of faith that the public is being asked to take.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail-sniffing system, known as ``Carnivore,'' allows law
enforcement officials to sift a suspect's messages out of the full
stream of data passing through an Internet service provider (ISP),
like America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Once installed on the ISP network, Carnivore can monitor all of
the e-mail on that ISP, from the list of what is sent to the actual
content of the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt told the Subcommittee on the Constitution that
Carnivore differs significantly from traditional phone wiretaps.
With a phone wiretap, the FBI must obtain a court order to monitor
conversations of a specific phone. Then, the FBI contacts the phone
company, which installs the tap, and, when the investigation ends,
disconnects it. At no point in the investigation are agents able to
monitor any conversations other than those on the one phone.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Carnivore system, the FBI first gets a court order to
use the agency's software to tap into the lines of an ISP. Unlike a
traditional wiretap with access to only one phone, Carnivore has
access to every message being sent along the ISP's system. In
addition, the ISP has no control over or knowledge of what the FBI
is monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Sachs, president of ICONN, a New Haven, Conn.-based ISP,
said the Carnivore system violates the rights of every
``law-abiding'' citizen who uses the Internet to send e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this very moment, a government-controlled computer,
installed under court order at some ISP somewhere in this country
is busy reviewing all communications passing through that ISP,
including messages from and to you, the members of Congress,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs said the software used for Carnivore, which is secret,
also poses other threats to Internet users. First, he said, the
software could be vulnerable to hackers, who could break into the
system and view millions of e-mails. ``Since nobody in the Internet
community has seen how Carnivore works, we haven't been able to put
it through the massive testing that every other ISP software goes
to make sure it's safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, he said, is that the Carnivore already has
caused service problems for several ISPs, cause their to stop or
slow down.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Department and FBI officials defended the system,
saying they are not seeking new capabilities in the online world
but are simply trying to preserve their ability to monitor criminal
activity. They said that capability is being eroded by growing use
of new technologies such as encryption, cell phones and wireless
message devices.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin DiGregory, deputy associate attorney general, said
Carnivore actually protects privacy because it can be configured to
identify only the senders and recipients of the suspect's e-mail.
The system selects only the data related to the criminal suspect,
he said, so that human reviewers see only what the machine has
culled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a situation where, as I understand it, a rogue
FBI agent, for example, could broaden the coverage of the Carnivore
intercept and violate the court order,'' DiGregory said. ``In order
to do that, he would need to engage the aid of technical people,
perhaps even technical people at the Internet service provider.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Kerr, director of the FBI's computer lab division, said
Carnivore is used only when an ISP cannot provide the information
requested under a court order. ``The FBI would prefer to let ISPs
do this work, but sometimes that's not possible and in those cases,
we bring in Carnivore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, in later testimony, Sachs disputed Kerr's statement
that ISPs are not always capable of creating software that can
intercept any subscriber's incoming and outgoing e-mail messages,
to the exclusion of others. That statement was simply ``wrong,''
Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard this excuse, I asked my system engineer to create
a program to intercept all of my communications,'' he said. ``In
less than an hour, all of the words I sent or received via e-mail
appeared on his computer in plain, legible text.''
</P>
<P>
   Existing laws are ambiguous about what standards apply for
different kinds of Internet surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, the White House announced that the administration
will soon propose legislation that would ``harmonize'' the laws of
wiretapping as it affects the many technologies by which people
communicate _ such as telephone, dial-up modem and high-speed
broadband access.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under the proposed legislation, the same standards that apply to
wiretaps would also apply to intercepting e-mail messages.
Specifically, law enforcement agents would have to demonstrate that
they have probable cause of a crime in order to obtain a court
order seeking the contents of a suspect's e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also give federal magistrates greater
authority to review requests by law enforcement authorities for
so-called pen registers _ lists of the phone numbers called from a
particular location and the time of the calls.
</P>
<P>
   The magistrates now have no authority to question the request
for such lists.
</P>
<P>
   After the White House announcement, Congressional leaders said
they would be willing to consider the Clinton administration's
legislation.

slow down.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Department and FBI officials defended the system,
saying they are not seeking new capabilities in the online world
but are simply trying to preserve their ability to monitor criminal
activity. They said that capability is being eroded by growing use
of new technologies such as encryption, cell phones and wireless
message devices.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin DiGregory, deputy associate attorney general, said
Carnivore actually protects privacy because it can be configured to
identify only the senders and recipients of the suspect's e-mail.
The system selects only the data related to the criminal suspect,
he said, so that human reviewers see only what the machine has
culled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a situation where, as I understand it, a rogue
FBI agent, for example, could broaden the coverage of the Carnivore
intercept and violate the court order,'' DiGregory said. ``In order
to do that, he would need to engage the aid of technical people,
perhaps even technical people at the Internet service provider.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Kerr, director of the FBI's computer lab division, said
Carnivore is used only when an ISP cannot provide the information
requested under a court order. ``The FBI would prefer to let ISPs
do this work, but sometimes that's not possible and in those cases,
we bring in Carnivore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, in later testimony, Sachs disputed Kerr's statement
that ISPs are not always capable of creating software that can
intercept any subscriber's incoming and outgoing e-mail messages,
to the exclusion of others. That statement was simply ``wrong,''
Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard this excuse, I asked my system engineer to create
a program to intercept all of my communications,'' he said. ``In
less than an hour, all of the words I sent or received via e-mail
appeared on his computer in plain, legible text.''
</P>
<P>
   Existing laws are ambiguous about what standards apply for
different kinds of Internet surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, the White House announced that the administration
will soon propose legislation that would ``harmonize'' the laws of
wiretapping as it affects the many technologies by which people
communicate _ such as telephone, dial-up modem and high-speed
broadband access.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under the proposed legislation, the same standards that apply to
wiretaps would also apply to intercepting e-mail messages.
Specifically, law enforcement agents would have to demonstrate that
they have probable cause of a crime in order to obtain a court
order seeking the contents of a suspect's e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also give federal magistrates greater
authority to review requests by law enforcement authorities for
so-called pen registers _ lists of the phone numbers called from a
particular location and the time of the calls.
</P>
<P>
   The magistrates now have no authority to question the request
for such lists.
</P>
<P>
   After the White House announcement, Congressional leaders said
they would be willing to consider the Clinton administration's
legislation.

<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ With Mideast peace talks teetering somewhere
between triumph and disaster, President Clinton plunged into the
heart and soul of statecraft on Monday, rolling up his sleeves for
around-the-clock talks centered on nuts-and-bolts diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Just off of a 15-hour flight from Japan, Clinton dove into
hand-to-hand negotiations that stretched until 5 a.m. (ET) Monday
at nearby Camp David. He caught five hours of sleep and spent the
rest of the day trying to shepherd the talks through what appeared
to be a make-or-break moment.
</P>
<P>
   With Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat at loggerheads over the fate of Jerusalem, Clinton _
pen and notebook in hand _ held extended, detail oriented
negotiations with working-level officials from each side.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the two sides might be finding at least some
common ground, the White House released a photograph showing
Clinton and his top Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, seated around a
small black table in Clinton's cabin at the presidential retreat
with an Israeli negotiator and two members of the Palestinian
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the negotiators were all writing down notes, as Ross
looked on, a binder bulging with documents perched across his lap.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart cast the activity as evidence
that talks had intensified and were focused on specifics.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear, though, whether that was a sign of progress, an
attempt to rescue the talks from stalemate or an effort to
consolidate a partial agreement in preparation for an inconclusive
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the president is using his time to sit down and
work through each and every issue is a decision that he and his
team do not take lightly,'' Lockhart said. ``And as long as we're
here and discussing things, there is a prospect for reaching
agreement; but it's impossible to predict the likelihood of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart described the talks as both ``exhaustive and
exhausting,'' but added ``it remains to be seen whether exhaustion
will help the process or hurt the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks were expected to reach deep into the night Monday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was preparing to lead
the talks into their third week on Tuesday. Clinton was scheduled
to travel to Fayetteville, Ark., to attend memorial services with
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for a close friend of the couple,
Diane Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was expected to return to Camp David around midnight
Tuesday, said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton convened the summit July 11 in hopes of brokering a
treaty to end 52 years of often bloody Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators have been hacking away in the Catoctin Mountain
retreat at the core territorial and security issues dividing the
two parties, including the fate of Jewish settlers and Palestinian
refugees and the question of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most contentious issue in the talks, though, has
been the question of Jerusalem. Barak has sworn not to sign an
agreement that would divide the city. And Arafat has vowed to
secure Palestinian control over East Jerusalem, more than half of
the city and the location of many of the holiest sites in the
Christian, Muslim and Jewish worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has floated a proposal to share at least part of East
Jerusalem with the Palestinians, by, in at least one such plan,
extending the boundaries of the city to take in a number of
predominantly Arab communities already effectively under
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   With echoes of the Israeli-Palestinian interim accord Clinton
brokered two years ago at the Wye River Plantation in eastern
Maryland, Lockhart said that Central Intelligence Agency chief
George Tenet had spent at least one day at the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart declined to discuss the substance of Tenet's visit. The
CIA is closely involved in U.S. efforts to monitor security
arrangements in the region in connection with a series of previous
Arab-Israeli accords.
</P>
<P>
   The agency would almost certainly be involved in similar
activities to safeguard a comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian treaty,
should one be agreed upon here, and it's easy to imagine any number
of reasons why Tenet's input could be useful to both Arafat and
Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet, though, became a key figure during the Wye talks after
Israeli sources claimed that Clinton had given then-Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu assurances that he would release Jonathan
Pollard _ convicted in the United States of spying for Israel _
from prison in exchange for Israeli concessions to Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department denied the claim, Clinton said he had told
Netanyahu only that the Justice Department would review the case.
Pollard _ a former U.S. Navy intelligence officer _ pleaded guilty
in 1986 and remains in federal prison, serving a life sentence for
espionage. Tenet opposes Pollard's release and reportedly
threatened to resign if he were set free.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart suggested that the Pollard case has been up for
discussion at Camp David, though he stressed that there had been no
shift in the U.S. position on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has not come up that I know of, but I know it frequently
comes up when the president talks to the prime minister of
Israel,'' Lockhart told reporters gathered in this town five miles
from Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister raises it on a regular basis,'' Lockhart
said. ``We're certainly aware of what the government of Israeli's
view on this subject is.''
</P>
<P>
   Successive Israeli governments have pressed for the release of
Pollard, who is widely seen in Israel as a national hero.

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: We just received a nine-page resume from
an individual applying to work here. My manager said that this
resume alone should be enough to eliminate him from consideration,
but he has had some valuable experience, and I'd like to interview
him. What do you suggest? A.G.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: When an applicant sends you a resume that resembles an
epic novel, you are getting far more information than appears in
the text itself. Although it is difficult to draw any conclusions,
you can draw some hypotheses.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, perhaps this is just a thorough,
detail-minded, somewhat compulsive individual. If you are trying to
fill a research or analytical position, this applicant is certainly
telling you that he sweats the small stuff.
</P>
<P>
   However, his resume can also point to some less flattering
interpretations. For example, it seems to be showing that he has
not read or heard anything about the key steps in obtaining a job,
one of which is to have a brief and crisp resume. Perhaps this tome
was put together by a frustrated adviser who told the candidate
that this is the way to make a resume stand out. Unfortunately, it
has a much greater likelihood of making a resume that is thrown
out.
</P>
<P>
   The best step is to look carefully at the position and then look
back at this resume. If you see the makings of a match in this
tight labor market, you should interview him. However, there may be
another problem: If you think his resume is long, just wait until
the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I sit across from an obnoxious kiss-up. She works hard when
the boss is here but leaves me with our shared work when he is out.
I have had to confront this behavior a number of times. I am trying
to avoid telling my boss about how she behaves, but I have asked to
change workstations. I think my boss may be mad at me. Now what?
T.O.
</P>
<P>
   A: When dealing with a two-faced co-worker, you have to face the
fact that your boss needs to know what is going on. If you simply
go to your boss and ask to change stations without providing a
clear explanation as to why, he is likely to draw some inaccurate
conclusions. For example, he may think that you want to do less
work or cannot get along with others.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable that you do not want to run to your boss
and tattle. In many cases, that leads to little more than
name-calling and blame-calling, and since your co-worker majored in
managerial flattery, you may be the one named and blamed.
</P>
<P>
   In these types of situations, it is more effective to focus on
behavior. There must be times when you are unable to get everything
done because your crafty co-worker has dumped her share of the work
on you. When this occurs and your boss wants to know why, tell him.
Do not use any labels regarding this co-worker, but just present
the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps your boss will get the message and your co-worker will
get it too. However, if your boss lets this slide or blames you,
then the two of them deserve each other, and you deserve something
better.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am an independent contractor trying to land an important
project with one company for the past nine months. Most of my
correspondence is by e-mail, and the person I am dealing with keeps
saying that they are almost ready to make a decision, but they need
a few more weeks. I've met with him and everything is great, and
then it's back to e-mails and delays. Do you have any ideas? M.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: This is one of the real problems with being an independent
contractor: The independent part is great, but the contractor part
can pose some problems. Many independent contractors experience
exactly what you are going through, and that is why you should
pursue several projects simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that your prospect is stringing you along, but
frankly, if he is not interested in working with you, it would be
easier for him to say so. You should stay in touch and continue to
let the prospect see the value that your services add, while
focusing on the prospect's needs and the way that your services
will meet them. All of your contact with the prospect should
conclude with a commitment from him, such as for a future meeting
or decisions by a certain date.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, consider the following questions: Are you
actually dealing with the decision maker? Secondly, is this company
truly looking for what you offer, and can they pay for it? If the
answer to each of these questions is yes, then your yes should be
coming, hopefully soon.

   PRICING THE PRICELESS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some things in life are priceless, as that ubiquitous television
commercial for a credit-card company says. Take rain forests, for
example. Their environmental and ecological value to the world
would seem to be beyond measure.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the value of the rain forests to the people who
live in them? While some researchers have tried to estimate what
the forest is worth, a study led by an anthropologist at Brandeis
University has tried a more direct approach.
</P>
<P>
   The results, reported in Nature, indicate that the value to
local people is low, helping to explain why they might chop the
forests down to use the land for other things.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the researchers visited two villages in eastern
Honduras on 140 randomly chosen days in 1995 and 1996. They
identified, weighed and put a value on all the forest goods
entering households, including fish and game, wild plants and
firewood. They also recorded any sales of goods within the village
or to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers arrived at a range in annual value of about $18
to $24 per hectare (a hectare is about 2{ acres). This is lower
than even the low end of previous estimates, which ranged from
about $49 to $1,089.
</P>
<P>
   It is also far lower than the rain forest's global worth (which,
while seemingly priceless, does have some estimates attached to it,
in the range of $1,700 per hectare per year). ``Unless rural people
are paid for the nonlocal values of rain forests,'' the researchers
wrote, ``they may be easily persuaded to deforest.''
</P>
<P>
   E. COLI'S SICKLY EMBRACE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not all strains of E. coli bacteria cause sickness, but those
that do can get a strong grip on a person, particularly the young
and elderly, killing through dehydration or kidney failure. And it
is literally a strong grip: the bacteria function by attaching
themselves to cells on the intestinal walls.
</P>
<P>
   Now, using X-ray crystallography, researchers from the
University of British Columbia have shown what happens at a
molecular level when the bacteria bind to intestinal cells.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli's outer membrane contains a protein, called intimin,
that serves as the glue. But first, the bacterium must insert a
different protein, called a receptor, into the intestinal cell. The
two proteins then bind.
</P>
<P>
   The protein-receptor complex was difficult to analyze whole, so
the researchers broke it down into functional crystal fragments,
which were then analyzed through crystallography (in which the
pattern of X-ray diffraction through a crystal is analyzed to
determine structure). Their work was reported in Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how two proteins bind in this way is a step toward
designing a drug that will inhibit the binding.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggested that their work might eventually help
in the development of a vaccine against E. coli infection.

   BOON FOR ASTRONOMERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers face constant battles against light and radio
frequency pollution, so delegates to the World Radiocommunication
Conference in Istanbul this spring provided some welcome news. The
conference, which allocates parts of the radio spectrum for various
uses, approved measures to protect a significant swath of high
frequencies, above about 70 gigahertz, for astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   Radio astronomers are increasingly using this part of the radio
spectrum, known as the millimeter wave region, to detect the
spectral lines of molecules in space.
</P>
<P>
   But commercial satellite projects under development also plan to
use frequencies in the same range. The new measures make sure that
future satellite transmitters operating in the range stay away from
those frequencies that are useful to astronomers. Without such
protection, the faint signals from space would be easily
overwhelmed.

NEARLY A MILLION MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES TO LOSE HMO COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Department of Health and Human Services
reported Monday that managed care providers plan to drop coverage
for 934,000 Medicare recipients, most of them senior citizens, next
year.
</P>
<P>
   That represents 200,000 more Medicare patients scheduled to lose
coverage than the managed care industry forecast last month. In a
dire warning in June, the American Association of Health Plans
(AAHP) said that low federal Medicare reimbursement rates would
lead its members to drop coverage for a record number of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors who lose managed care coverage still qualify for
Medicare's traditional fee-for-service program. And according to
the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), a unit of HHS that
oversees Medicare, 83 percent of those affected live in areas where
other health plans offer service.
</P>
<P>
   About 6.8 million of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries get
their health coverage through managed care programs, also known as
HMOs, according to the HCFA.
</P>
<P>
   The number of seniors affected by the HMO cuts for the 2001
calendar year is almost three times the number that lost coverage
this year. Last year at this time, health plans announced coverage
cuts for 2000 that affected 327,000 Medicare beneficiaries. The
year before that, 407,000 beneficiaries lost coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president of the AAHP, said the number for 2001
``reinforces the magnitude of this crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, she added: ``It's time for Congress and
the administration to put aside partisan politics, to commit $15
billion to fully fund this program, and to end the rhetorical
gamesmanship that has come to substitute for real action.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the tactical sparring over their separate Medicare
prescription drug plans, neither the Clinton administration nor the
Republican-led Congress is anxious to commit big dollars to raise
reimbursement rates for HMOs this year.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drug coverage is one of the main attractions of
Medicare HMO plans. About 63 percent of beneficiaries in Medicare
HMOs receive drug coverage, which dramatically lessens the
skyrocketing cost of medications. Regular fee-for-service Medicare
does not offer prescription coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care under Medicare is similar to the coverage offered
in the private sector. Patients are limited in terms of selecting
doctors and hospitals but receive treatment at a reduced cost.
</P>
<P>
   Under current Medicare rules, senior citizens may choose to join
an HMO or retain fee-for-service coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Under fee-for-service, patients may choose the doctor or
hospital they want and Medicare pays a set rate. Patients pick up
the balance either through extra ``Medigap'' insurance or out of
their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, HCFA Administrator Nancy-Ann DeParle attributed
the high dropout number to ``the volatility of the Medicare managed
care market.'' She downplayed the effect of the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   About 775,000 Medicare HMO beneficiaries _ some 83 percent of
the 934,000 slated to lose coverage _ live in areas where there are
alternative HMOs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle used release of the numbers to urge passage of President
Clinton's Medicare prescription plan, saying it would ease the
financial burden on HMOs that insure purchase of expensive
medications.
</P>
<P>
   Losses of Medicare HMO coverage are nationwide. In San
Francisco, 1,948 beneficiaries will be affected. The health plans
and the numbers of dropped patients are: Aetna U.S. Healthcare of
California Inc., 1,219; Blue Cross of California, 272; AND
California Physicians' Service Corp., 457.
</P>
<P>
   In Beaumont, Texas (Jefferson County), 5,088 beneficiaries will
be affected. The health plans and the numbers of dropped patients
are: Cigna Healthcare of Texas Inc., 603; Humana Health Plan of
Texas, 998; Methodistcare Inc., 100; Nylcare Health Plans Inc.,
3,387.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio (Bexar County), 3,319 beneficiaries will be
affected. The health plans and the numbers of patients dropped are:
Nylcare Health Plans Inc., 2,986; Prudential Health Care Plan Inc.,
333.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle (King County), 15,738 beneficiaries will be affected.
The health plans and the numbers of patients dropped are: Aetna
U.S. Healthcare Inc., 8,175; First Choice Health Plan, 2,268;
Healthplus, 3,527; Regencecare, 1,768.

HYPERLINKS FOR HYPOCHONDRIACS: OLD MALADY IN A NEW WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
 By EMILY YOFFE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recently, an article in a newspaper stated that ``at least 60
million people visit Internet health sites each year.'' This is not
entirely accurate. I visit Internet health sites 60 million times
each year.
</P>
<P>
   Until the development of the Internet, I kept my unhealthy
interest in check by limiting my medical library to a few essential
texts. That's the same principle that keeps me from bringing a
deluxe Whitman's sampler box into my house: I would eat it all in
one sitting. But now, it is as if my computer were spewing mocha
cremes at me.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, the Wonderful World of Diseases _ a real Web
site, found at www.diseaseworld.com _ is available 24 hours a day.
With a few clicks, I arrived at my own escalating diagnoses for a
hoarse voice, starting with seasonal allergies and moving quickly
to hypothyroidism and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The more I
read, it seems, the sicker I can get.
</P>
<P>
   Using Hegelian dialectics: thesis, antithesis, I-feel-sick, I
decided to see if the Web could help me understand my case of
Internet invalidism. So I typed ``hypochondria'' into a search
engine and immediately found the Whiteley Index, a test for
hypochondria. Here are some questions from the index and my
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think there is something seriously wrong with your
body?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, especially when I shop for bathing suits.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you worry about your health more than most people?
</P>
<P>
   A. Naturally; most people don't worry about my health at all.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you feel ill and someone tells you that you are looking
better, do you become annoyed?
</P>
<P>
   A. I wouldn't, but no one ever has.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If a disease is brought to your attention (through the radio,
TV, newspapers or someone you know), do you worry about getting it
yourself?
</P>
<P>
   A. I believe that a disease being brought to my attention is a
sign that I already suffer from it.
</P>
<P>
   According to the index, I am not a hypochondriac, which raises
the even more alarming possibility that I really am sick. For
further treatment, I began surfing health sites and came up with
this possible diagnosis: Internet addiction disorder. I could get
online counseling to help cure it. But this seemed a little like
getting advice on anger management from Bobby Knight.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the Internet has only exacerbated my problem, it
did not create it. For that, I blame my childhood. Google and
Excite might call themselves search engines, but they could never
command enough gigabytes to match the knowledge of things that
could go wrong that my beloved grandmother amassed in her 90 years.
If you are raised hearing that the germs on everything you touch
are ``going right to your brain,'' aren't you entitled to spend
wads of time perusing brainnet.org?
</P>
<P>
   As with any malady, hypochondriacs supposedly find comfort
knowing about celebrities who suffer from the same condition. At
least all of the hypochondria Web sites I found had lists of famous
people who were convinced that they were sick, including Proust,
Poe, Tolstoy, Kafka and Darwin. Notice that all of these supposed
hypochondriacs are dead. This brings to mind the chilling story of
Moliere, which I also discovered on the Web. He was an actor as
well as a playwright, and after writing the hypochondriac's
manifesto, ``The Imaginary Invalid,'' he starred in the title role.
It was a short run, however, because Moliere died the night of the
fourth performance.
</P>
<P>
   It has been consoling to find out that many of my friends,
instead of improving their well-being by, say, taking a walk, are
sitting around looking up their ailments. One, who seems remarkably
healthy (possibly because he treats his home as a Biosafety Level 4
containment site), does not search for symptoms; he looks up
causes. He is a slave to the Environmental Protection Agency's Web
site (www.epa.gov). He uses it to keep track of the chemical
contaminants that, he is sure, are killing him. Another friend said
that she stopped looking up her medical problems after she kept
discovering that she was either pregnant, menopausal or had ovarian
cancer. Instead, she has switched to hypochondria-by-proxy,
spending hours on the Internet diagnosing deadly diseases of other
people.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail messages have also made it possible to be a passive
recipient of freshly minted medical discoveries. For example, I
read that antiperspirants cause breast cancer by blocking the lymph
nodes. Of course, I stopped using antiperspirant. After a few days,
I came to believe that this information was being spread by the dry
cleaners of America.
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing what to do, I asked a breast surgeon about it. She
said that several patients had raised this issue, but that she
could find nothing in the literature to support the thesis, and
anyway, it did not make scientific sense. But what does she know?
She is just a doctor, which means she is too busy to spend her
entire day looking up medical information on the Web.

PRIME MINISTER'S CONFIDANT SPINS INTO THE BRITISH SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LONDON _ Alastair Campbell, the press spokesman for Tony Blair,
has a job that has traditionally been cloaked in anonymity, but the
onetime ``source close to the prime minister'' has now gone high
personal profile. He is the subject of a book, the focus of probing
newspaper articles and broadcast pieces and the star of a BBC
documentary that has just aired.
</P>
<P>
   As the voice of the most information-management-minded British
leader in history, Campbell has become a closely observed public
figure and is credited with such influence that he is commonly
portrayed in the press as the second most important official in the
government. He is the first spokesman to sit in on cabinet
meetings, and no one in the Blair administration spends more time
with the prime minister on a daily basis. His partner and the
mother of his two children, Fiona Millar, is the personal aide to
Blair's wife, Cherie.
</P>
<P>
   So dependent on his favor are the reporters who regularly cover
10 Downing St. that one of them, George Jones, political
correspondent of Blair's Conservative tormentor, The Daily
Telegraph, this month wrote a personal essay of complaint headlined
``Alastair Campbell stops me from doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   A specialist in labels and sound bites, Campbell likes to call
himself ``his master's voice,'' but to the growing number of
government critics, he is a master ``spin doctor.'' The distinction
is a crucial one now since Blair's popularity is falling, and much
of the decline is being ascribed to the manipulation and massaging
of news to give it a twist favorable to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has always advocated keeping the message simple and
succinct and repeating it with numbing frequency to make sure it
lodges with the public. Blair used the strategy effectively in
constantly tagging the scandal-ridden previous Conservative
government with the word ``sleaze,'' but his opponents have turned
the tactic on Blair and Campbell with equal success, and the word
that has become their mantra is ``spin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Real people in pubs and on buses really do believe that spin
is a dastardly business and that its practice is New Labor's
downfall,'' said Sion Simon, associate editor of The Spectator. ``I
find it bizarre that the nation should be gripped by a common
hatred and fear of spin doctors when hardly anybody has ever met
one, nobody really knows what they do and the reality of what they
do is actually so mundane. But such is the power of the press.''
</P>
<P>
   The press is enjoying exercising that power now after three
frustrating years of trying to break free of the grip of Campbell,
43, who uses his athletic six-foot presence and a brash and
intimidating manner to cow reporters and their editors. He is a
former political writer for The Mirror who once did a
much-commented-upon turn as an author of soft-porn fables for a
magazine under the nom de plume Riviera Gigolo.
</P>
<P>
   One of Campbell's first steps on taking office was to cull the
senior civil servant information officers in government departments
and install political appointees in key spots. The number of these
``special advisers'' has doubled to 79 since Labor took power, and
the cost of the unit devoted to policy promotion and swift rebuttal
has risen tenfold.
</P>
<P>
   Employment rules were recast to free him from strict civil
service neutrality, and his resultant salary, $150,000, brings
weekly protests from Conservatives on the floor of the House of
Commons.
</P>
<P>
   The language of apology or admission of error does not figure in
Campbell's vocabulary, and his habit of responding to lapses and
criticism by going on the attack long protected the government from
being harmed by bad publicity. But now that same practice has
earned the government a reputation for smugness and insensitivity
to public opinion at a time when the number of blunders has been
increasing. It has put his relations with the press on a war
footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had _ and I particularly had _ got myself into a situation
where combat was the only language that was being spoken, which is
not necessarily terribly sensible either way,'' Campbell told
Michael Cockerell, the filmmaker who made the BBC documentary shown
this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out to get the government's voice heard properly as it
is,'' Campbell said. ``I'm out to make sure the public understand
the reality of this government and this P.M. That's what I'm out to
get, and the political press often _ not always, but often _ are
the barrier to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The British press is highly aggressive and competitive, with 13
national dailies selling a startling 14 million copies. Front pages
are unblushingly partisan, and proportionality can get lost in the
headline emphasis on ``clashes'' and ``storms'' and ``rows,'' which
are always ``bitter'' ones.
</P>
<P>
   The conduct that has drawn the most scornful comments about 10
Downing St. in recent months is the tendency of people in the
government to say damning things about their internal rivals. These
dismissive comments get widespread circulation because of the
willingness of the press to report them promptly and hide the
accuser's identity with vague sourcing.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell argues that the press is obsessed by trivia, spats and
personalities, that it treats politics as soap opera and neglects
what the government is really doing. ``He believes that he is more
spinned against than spinning,'' said Cockerell.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Prescott of The Sunday Times protested that view in the
film. ``We're not spin doctors; we are professional decoders,'' he
said. ``Politicians speak a strange language, and it's for us to
decode it. That leads to clashes with Campbell.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked on camera whether he thought his spokesman was doing a
good job, Blair said, ``I like to think I have hired the best in
the business.'' But apparently recognizing the level of mutual
abuse that has arisen, he said he had decided to relieve Campbell
of the daily briefing chore so he could devote his time to
behind-the-scenes preparation of the government's message.
</P>
<P>
   Much as the journalists have complained about him, though, they
did not welcome word that they would cease having their combative
encounters with him every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Alastair is not there with that kind of access that he has
that reflects the prime minister's instincts and personality as
well as the policy lines,'' said Robin Oakley, the BBC's chief
political correspondent, ``then we simply don't believe we're
getting the voice of Downing St.''

   PITKYARANTA, Russia _ You could scour the earth from Beaver
Cleaver's hometown to this northern burg of 15,000, a pinprick on
the vast shores of Europe's largest lake, and be hard put to find a
more typical-looking housewife than Lena.
</P>
<P>
   Lena has two adorable little towheaded boys. She wears a loose
cotton housewife's dress, properly mid-calf. She has an innocent
young mother's face set in long honey-colored tresses and framed
with an almost prim pair of glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the still in her kitchen, you might not be
surprised if Lena had the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.
</P>
<P>
   But to be perfectly frank about it, she is not even a good
housekeeper. Lena is a bootlegger. She makes, bottles and sells
illegal booze.
</P>
<P>
   When you sell up to 400 half-liter bottles of hooch every month,
you do not have much time to keep house, not that anyone would want
to visit. The living room is so redolent of eau de hooch that you
can almost get tipsy just sitting there, provided you don't choke
first.
</P>
<P>
   But the aroma would never be mistaken for cologne. It could well
be mistaken for the bag of kitchen scraps you forgot to dispose of
before leaving on a two-week vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very simple recipe: sugar, yeast, water,'' Lena said as
she chatted in her spectacularly cluttered living room, in a
clapboard apartment house on what might be called Pitkyaranta's bad
side. ``People come and make orders for weddings, birthday parties,
funerals _ we had a lot of orders for the New Year's celebration.
People know what I sell, and they know it's strong.''
</P>
<P>
   These people do not seem to include the militia, which is
supposed to arrest her, fine her and confiscate her still should
they stumble across her enterprise. ``We know the stoolies who
inform the police, and we just tell them `No, we don't sell it,' ''
Lena explained, as if that answered all questions.
</P>
<P>
   Though she told her story on condition that her last name not be
used, this reporter nevertheless managed to find Lena by getting
into a car, asking the driver where he could buy some hooch and
sitting back contentedly as he was driven there.
</P>
<P>
   Russians don't call it hooch, of course. They call it samogon, a
piece of slang that literally translates as ``run by myself,''
which is just how the business is run.
</P>
<P>
   They make a lot of samogon in Pitkyaranta. In fact, a lot is
made nearby. Lena's girlfriend, who lives upstairs, is a
competitor. Across the courtyard, a maze of footpaths tramped
through unmown weeds, another family sells bootleg vodka from
another clapboard house.
</P>
<P>
   Why is a good question, seeing as Russia has no shortage of
legal alcohol. Bootlegging is a risky business, and bad samogon has
been known to kill people _ thousands, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be that flouting the samogon law is an entrenched
habit. Stephen White, a University of Glasgow scholar and author of
the sad and fascinating book ``Russia Goes Dry'' (Cambridge
University Press, 1996), suggests that the samogon craft gained in
the mid-1980s, in Mikhail Gorbachev's furious anti-alcohol
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet authorities closed thousands of liquor stores and razed
distilleries, breweries and vineyards, leaving truly dedicated
drinkers scrambling for alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   People drank cologne and even brake fluid in search of
refreshment. Air force pilots took to drinking the exceptionally
pure alcohol used as a de-icer in MiG-25 jets, White noted, a
practice so popular that the MiG-25 acquired the nickname ``the
flying restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Some covered up their tippling by replacing the de-icer alcohol
with water. This worked until their jets iced up in flight.
</P>
<P>
   Samogon, however, became the overwhelming choice of drink.
Soviet militia made great shows of wrecking stills and hauling away
bootleggers. But it eventually became clear that wiping out samogon
would mean locking up much of the nation, including party officials
and members of the All-Union Voluntary Society for the Struggle for
Sobriety, the government's anti-booze organ.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the industrial-size packages of yeast Lena regularly
buys contain instructions for making samogon, under the discreet
heading ``A recipe for Russia's traditional national beverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before communism collapsed in 1991, distilling samogon for
home use became legal, and production skyrocketed again. That
selling it remained illegal made little difference: by 1994, one in
every six drinks downed in Russia was samogon.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the fact that the Soviet Union's demise has left
millions jobless and frantic for money, and it is not hard to see
why bootlegging still thrives.
</P>
<P>
   Pitkyaranta, about 75 miles east of Finland on the glacial Lake
Ladoga, was hit by Russia's economic woes. Until the local paper
mill began cranking up to meet a growing export market a year ago,
many were desperate. Lena's family was among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved here in '95 to this barracks of a house,'' she said.
``My husband worked on the railroad. We had our second kid, and in
a year, the railroad shop shut down without any warning _ not even
severance pay _ and my husband lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I was with two kids, 1 and 4, and no income. My husband
found a job at the paper mill, but the pay was very bad. So I tried
the shuttle trade _ go to Moscow; buy some goods; come back here
and sell them. But then came the '98 crash, and I lost everything.
We didn't have food _ just a pot of fried potatoes. My oldest son
would say, `Mama, is that for me?' '' and I'd have to tell him,
`No; it's for the whole family.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``And so I came to this business.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lena's inspiration was across the courtyard, where bootleggers
were buying pure alcohol, diluting it with water and selling it as
vodka for 80 cents a bottle. ``But it was weak stuff, only 30
proof, and the quality was bad,'' she said. ``Sometimes they'd add
sleeping pills, so it would knock you out quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   She figured she could do better. So she bought a small still _ a
pot, roughly wastebasket-sized, with a curlicued pipe sprouting
from the top _ and began making real samogon. Today an ordinary
bottle sells for 80 cents, a bottle spiced up with a skin-peeling
combination of herbs and orange peel, among other things, costs 90
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important to her clientele, Lena's samogon is
considerably stronger than the watered-down vodka across the way.
She tested a batch for a visitor, using a thermometer-like device
that floats at varying levels determined by the amount of alcohol,
and announced proudly, ``Forty-six proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Word soon spread, and now Lena has a supplier of clear glass
bottles and six distributors who take most of the orders in
exchange for a small cut.
</P>
<P>
   In a good month, she takes in $325 or so. An average month's
gross is closer to $225 _ a handsome income in a small Russian
town, compared with her husband's $100.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may take in 6,000 rubles,'' she says. ``A nurse makes 425.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the cost of raw materials must be deducted from that.
Lena usually buys yeast and sugar with a wink and a nod from a
grocer who can use the business himself.
</P>
<P>
   It takes more than 6{ pounds of sugar and three ounces of yeast
to make a quart of samogon. The water, fortunately, is free, though
Lena must pump it from a well a few hundred yards away. Her house
has no running water.
</P>
<P>
   It does not take Julia Child to make samogon. Mostly, it takes
patience. The stew of sugar and yeast, called braga, must sit and
ferment for at least a week, changing from stomach-churning brown
to crystal clarity, before it is ready for distilling.
</P>
<P>
   The still itself must be heated, to turn the braga to steam, and
then cooled so that distilled samogon condenses and drips into a
container.
</P>
<P>
   Lena takes a certain pride in her work, though she confesses
that she does not particularly like it. She says she is assiduous
about keeping the mixture clean, though one look at her kitchen
will cast that into serious doubt.
</P>
<P>
   She says she will sell no samogon before its time. ``I don't
want to poison anyone,'' she said. ``If we drink, we drink our own
homemade stuff,'' Lena said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But thank God,'' she added, ``we don't drink much.''

MOVEMENT GROWS IN IRELAND TO RESURRECT AN ANCIENT LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: In two grafs bgng, `But a taste ...,' sub single brackets for
double parenthesis; developments occurred after reporter left
dateline.)  
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALLINAHOWN, Ireland _ From this isolated region of rock and bog
on the wind-blasted western edge of Ireland, there rises a
television tower more than 100 feet high. Its purpose is to make
the ancient Irish language ready for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   The adjacent building _ so modern for this setting that it
stands out like a NASA station planted on the moon _ is the
headquarters for TG4, a government-financed television station
whose purpose is to promote and celebrate Gaelic. Spliced between
the classic movies and top-40 music shows broadcast in English,
there are cartoons, news, soap operas and even a situation comedy
in Gaelic, the lilting language that continues to fight for its
life.
</P>
<P>
   The station, with a staff whose average age is 23, has brought a
certain edge to an ancient language. Perhaps as a result, the
number of its viewers has doubled in the last year, to about 2
percent of a market that includes the BBC and the dominant national
station, RTE.
</P>
<P>
   On a larger scale, the station's modest success reflects
Ireland's recent warming to a language that had been in sharp
decline over the last two centuries. Once perceived as the tongue
of the poor and uneducated _ those from the ``back of beyond'' _
Gaelic is coming to represent the self-confidence born of recent
economic and cultural success.
</P>
<P>
   Gaelic, it seems, has become chic. At the very least, said
Cilian Fennell, TG4's programming director, ``resistance is
lowering.''
</P>
<P>
   Pubs and shops are rechristening themselves with their Irish
names. Men once known as Patrick now call themselves Padraig
(pronounced POH-rig); women named Mary now prefer Maire (pronounced
MOY-ra). Thirty years ago, Ireland had about a dozen primary
schools that taught in Gaelic; now it has 134 all-Gaelic schools
with a total of 21,000 students, including many from the
working-class and middle-class neighborhoods of Dublin and its
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a confidence thing,'' said Eamon O Cuiv (o CWEEV), the
Irish government's junior minister overseeing the growth of the
language and the grandson of one of modern Ireland's founding
fathers, Eamon De Valera. ``More and more people are realizing that
it is a functional language, as much as English is.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Europe has largely been moving in the direction of
removing national boundaries and standardizing rules and practices,
local cultures and languages have been reasserting their strength
over the last several years. Historians say that more people appear
to be interested in protecting minority languages and asserting
local differences than at any other time in the last 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Programs supporting the use of local or regional languages have
been growing in France, Spain, the Netherlands, Wales and Finland,
among other places.
</P>
<P>
   When the Irish Free State was established in 1922, its
Constitution designated Gaelic as the national language. Since
then, the government has tried, more diligently at times than at
others, to resurrect a once-dominant language that had been
sidelined by English, emigration and the potato famine of the
mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The success of those efforts was modest. Although taught as a
mandatory course in the country's schools, the language came to be
seen as a hindrance, particularly to those who immigrated to the
United States and England during lean economic times. English was
perceived as the language of power, Gaelic as the language of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Gaelic, or Irish, came to be used more often as a symbol than as
a means of communication. For some it was associated with Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, and the
nationalist movement; for others it was a battle cry for those who
felt that the country's rural nature was being subsumed by
development. Some even came to view Gaelic as a statement, used by
people who wanted to flaunt their devotion to Irish custom.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, proponents of the language do not entirely trust
figures from the 1996 census indicating that 43 percent of the
people in Ireland claim to have some competence in Gaelic _ up from
about 33 percent in 1991. They say that people who understand
Gaelic do not necessarily speak it with any regularity. Besides,
they say, the language will never flourish when the best textbooks
are published only in English, when even government forms written
in Gaelic are hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   There is also concern that Gaelic is waning in the corners of
Ireland where it has traditionally been the language used at home.
Development of those rural areas _ which include this stretch of
County Galway called Connemara _ is coming at the expense of
Gaelic.
</P>
<P>
   The affluent who are buying summer homes here bring their
English as well as their BMW's. Natives who left during the
recession of the 1980s are returning with spouses who speak only
English. And, of course, English-language television continues to
seduce.
</P>
<P>
   The government has several agencies dedicated to cultivating
Gaelic, and it recently set up a commission to determine the extent
of its decline in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   ((But a taste of the task before the government came on July 20
when a witness in a high-profile corruption case exercised his
right to respond in Gaelic to questions put to him in English. The
judge became so frustrated with the young interpreter's
misinterpretations that he began to translate the testimony
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ((Nor is everyone enamored of the continuing obsession with
Gaelic. ``After 80 years of concerted linguistic social
engineering, we are probably seeing the last generation of native
Irish-speaking children in those few and fast-shrinking Gaeltacht
areas,'' Kevin Myers, a columnist for The Irish Times, wrote on
July 21. ``Irish will soon be spoken as Latin was in medieval
Europe, a learned language of a cultural elite.''))
</P>
<P>
   Gearoid O Tuathaigh (GAR-od o-TOO-hig), a professor of modern
Irish history at the National University of Ireland, Galway, and a
leading advocate of Gaelic, said that while the language continues
to struggle for its life, the recent signs of resurrection are
encouraging _ and very much deserved.
</P>
<P>
   First there is the beauty of the language itself, he said, so
rich in metaphor and natural wonder. Terms of endearment include
``macushla,'' which means ``my colt,'' and ``machree,'' which means
``my heart.'' Instead of saying ``I love you,'' a Gaelic speaker
would say, in effect, ``I am melting for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaelic is also seen as a key to decoding the history of Ireland,
starting with the very names of villages and parishes, which
sometimes amount to little more than a few farms. An an example, O
Tuathaigh offered the village of Geesala in the west of County
Mayo. In Gaelic, its name means ``the breeze with salt upon it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, he said, Gaelic ``has established a living
presence in the information technology world and in
communications.'' One example is TG4, which sees itself not as some
kind of symbol or as the manifestation of government guilt but
simply as a television station broadcasting in Gaelic.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, for example, the station showed ``The Seven
Year Itch,'' the 1956 comedy starring Marilyn Monroe, in English.
Immediately after the movie, there were several programs in Gaelic,
including a blind-date game show in which parents cross-examine
potential dates for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup reflected the elementary tactic of hooking an
audience with a tried-and-true program, explained Paul Gallagher,
the station's chief executive. ``And then we try to hold on to
them.''

A HUNK OF STARRY DYNAMITE BURNS IN CYGNUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Science Times) 
 By KENNETH CHANG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The future appears to be very bright, though brief, for a star
known as KPD1930+2752, in the constellation Cygnus. According to
astronomers at the University of Southampton in England, the
peculiar star is destined to explode in a supernova.
</P>
<P>
   Located within the Milky Way galaxy about 2,000 light-years
away, KPD1930+2752 is distant enough not to pose any danger to
Earth but close enough that it would provide a dazzling display.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it went off now, it would be easily visible in the daylight
sky,'' said Pierre F.L. Maxted, a postdoctoral research assistant
at the University of Southampton and one of the researchers whose
report on the doomed star will be published in Monthly Notices of
The Royal Astronomical Society.
</P>
<P>
   KPD1930+2752 is an unusual star that consists almost entirely of
helium, not hydrogen, the most common element in the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The observations of the University of Southampton astronomers
turned up another oddity: telltale wobbles in the frequency of
light that are caused by the gravitational pull of an unseen
companion, the burnt-out core of a Sun-like star known as a white
dwarf.
</P>
<P>
   From the quickness of the wobbles _ one full orbit lasts only
137 minutes _ the astronomers calculated that the two stars were
less than a million miles apart and would eventually crash into
each other in about 200 million years. On cosmic time scales, that
is the very near future. The Sun, by comparison, is expected to
live about 4 billion years.
</P>
<P>
   Because the combined mass is too great for a stable star,
astronomers say, a supernova will be the result.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of this double-star system could result in an
explosion known as a type Ia supernova. Type Ia supernovae have
been immensely useful to cosmologists as cosmic candlesticks,
because they all burst at roughly the same brightness. Just as one
can calculate how far away a 60-watt light bulb is by how bright it
appears, astronomers use type Ia supernovae to calibrate cosmic
distances.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is sure exactly what is exploding in a type Ia
supernova. The spectrum of light emitted is devoid of signs of
hydrogen, which is odd since stars are generally made almost
entirely of hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, astronomers hypothesize a type 1a supernova may
be the explosion of a white dwarf that has exhausted its hydrogen
fuel. But a white dwarf cannot explode by itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a hunk of dynamite,'' said Robert P. Kirshner, an
astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in
Cambridge, Mass. ``It's perfectly OK as long as you don't detonate
it.''
</P>
<P>
   One idea for how the white dwarf detonates is that it siphons
off gas from a Sun-like companion until it becomes gravitationally
unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is that the white dwarf collides with another star
_ which is the fate of KPD1930+2752 _ and then blows up.
</P>
<P>
   Kirshner, for one, is not convinced that a supernova is
inevitable. The collision could eject some of the mass, leaving
behind a stable star.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logic there is not perfect,'' Kirshner said. ``On the
other hand, it's a very intriguing system.''

   You know this movie is in trouble when you find yourself rooting
for the killer cockroaches. The humans in this insufficient
melodrama warrant neither sympathy nor interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They Nest,'' which USA is allowing to escape tonight, does
have the germ of an idea and a few scenes of squirm-inducing
tension that may remind you of those dependable 1950s horror
movies. But these few scraps of the old formula don't add up to
successful story.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins on a dark and stormy night out on the Atlantic,
where a poor seaman is thrown overboard by his shipmates. It then
moves to a Boston hospital, where Ben Cahill (Thomas Calabro), a
surgeon who has some ill-defined competency issues, is dispatched
on a forced leave. Ben retreats to the creepy house he recently
bought on a creepy island in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   He probably should have made other travel plans. See, the body
of that unfortunate sailor has washed up on that very same island,
containing a colony of hardy African bugs. The bugs nest in the
guts of people, who then vomit larvae and die. This is graphically
depicted, over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Ben, who is rather smug for a surgeon with ill-defined
competency issues, gets off on the wrong foot with several of the
islanders, especially Jack Wald (John Savage). He's the drunken
dolt who operates the island's electrical system and harbors a
gnawing grudge against Ben because that creepy house was his family
homestead before the bank foreclosed and sold it. There are lots of
other dolts on the island, and a few OK people as well, principally
the levelheaded Sheriff Hobbs (Dean Stockwell) and the pretty,
witty storekeeper, Nell (Kristen Dalton). These two actors deserve
better vehicles. But then, so do the roaches.
</P>
<P>
   The bugs soon start multiplying like there's no tomorrow,
turning unfortunate island dwellers into roach motels. Jack is one
of the first victims. But when, on another dark and stormy night,
Ben drives into Jack's body on the road, some locals don't believe
that Jack was already dead.
</P>
<P>
   You can gauge the level of the film's wit from what the sheriff
tells Ben: ``The good news is you weren't drinkin'. The bad news is
the entire town thinks you killed Jack on purpose. Either way,
you're in a heap o' trouble, son.'' By the time everybody becomes
aware of the bugs' appetite, the island is in a heap of trouble,
too. . The film hurtles to a conclusion that makes even less sense
than the beginning. If you are, unaccountably, still watching this
film when the credits roll, tip your hat to the special-effects
people (and one insect wrangler). They, at least, seem to have met
their challenge.

CHENEY HAS AMASSED A FORTUNE FROM OIL INDUSTRY JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG and STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Richard Cheney, Texas Gov. George Bush's reported
choice to be his vice presidential running mate, has amassed $41.1
million in stock in the Halliburton Co. of Dallas, his corporate
employer.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has served as an executive of Halliburton, the world's
largest oil and gas services company, since 1995 and is currently
chairman and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Cheney drew a $1.28 million paycheck and was awarded
options on 300,000 shares of Halliburton stock. The year before,
Cheney received a salary of $1.18 million, bonuses worth $2.6
million and options on 100,000 shares of stock, according to
company filings with the Security and Exchange Commission. In 1997,
Cheney earned $1.1 million in salary and $1.9 million in bonuses
and options on 100,000 Halliburton shares.
</P>
<P>
   He also received other Halliburton compensation over those three
years totaling $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to an April 3 company filing with the SEC, Cheney held
1.08 million Halliburton shares. He then sold about 100,000 shares
last month when the stock price edged over $50 a share before
slipping back into the $40s, according to a document filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The remaining shares are worth
$41.1 million at Monday's closing price of about $42 per share.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has had an up-and-down ride over the last
year. Last September, the stock traded at around $50 a share but
dipped to $35 by October. It peaked again at around $50 this May
when oil prices began climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also serves on the boards of several other firms,
including Union Pacific Corp., Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. and Electronic
Data Systems Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's reported selection of the former Wyoming congressman
would put two oil industry veterans on the GOP ticket, a fact that
is likely to attract criticism from Democratic opponents. Bush got
his start after graduate school in the oil fields of West Texas
where he founded an exploration firm.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aide Karl Rove defended a Bush-Cheney ticket against
suggestions that it represented ``Big Oil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see Dick Cheney's leadership in running a construction
and oil service company to be a problem at all when compared to
this (Clinton-Gore) administration's failure to have a
comprehensive energy policy,'' Rove said on CBS News' ``Face the
Nation'' over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is telling voters that he has ``never
been afraid to take on big oil.'' Gore says that Bush ``comes out
of the oil industry'' with experience as an oil company executive
and has offered proposals that in effect would foster ``higher oil
prices to boost the oil companies' profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in turn, blames the Clinton-Gore administration for
skyrocketing gasoline prices. Gasoline prices jumped in early June
in key Midwestern states when new Environmental Protection Agency
regulations required low-pollution gasoline to be sold in 15
metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``seems to forget who's been in office for seven years,''
Bush says to counter Gore criticism, adding: ``This is an
administration that's been in charge and the price of gasoline has
risen steadily.''
</P>
<P>
   While with Halliburton, Cheney has supported Republican
campaigns and causes across the country.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents filed with the Federal Election
Commission, since 1997 Cheney has donated a total of $10,000 each
to two political action committees associated with the company that
in turn wrote checks to numerous GOP campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney and his wife Lynne contributed another $20,000-plus
directly to Republican campaigns and political action committees
since 1997, including $2000 each to George W. Bush's campaign.

WASP MAKES SPIDER SPIN A WEB OF INTRIGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Science Times) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are few things more creepy than alien possession, the
notion of one creature taking over another's body and bending it to
different purposes. Though this may happen every day on other
planets, an egregious example has come to light on earth too, and
as close to home as the forests of Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Here lives an orb-weaving spider, so called because of the
perfect roundness of the web it industriously rebuilds every day. A
serious hazard of the spider's busy life is that it is hunted by an
ichneumon, or parasitic wasp. If the wasp's attack is successful,
it temporarily paralyzes the spider and lays an egg on the tip of
its abdomen, where it is out of reach. For two weeks the spider
spins its web and catches insects every day as if nothing were
amiss, except for the growing larva that clings to its belly and
sucks the juices that drip through small punctures it makes in the
spider's body wall.
</P>
<P>
   So far this is just the usual grim script of parasitism. But
then comes a strange twist. The night before the wasp larva kills
its host, it somehow induces the spider to build a most unusual
web.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of its delicate orb, the zombified spider constructs two
stout silk cables with thick cross-braces in between. This durable
platform stands up to wind and rain better than the spider's
ephemeral web. The wasp larva then kills the spider, and spins its
cocoon on the platform constructed for it, safe from the ants that
patrol the ground below.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William G. Eberhard, the spider expert at the University of
Costa Rica who first noticed the bizarre phenomenon, says the wasp
larva manipulates a particular subroutine in the spider's
web-building program. The subroutine, an early part of constructing
the web's frame, usually has five steps. Under the larva's
direction, the spider just performs the first two steps over and
over again.
</P>
<P>
   This reprogramming of the spider's routine is presumably
achieved by some chemical the wasp larva injects into its host.
Eberhard has found that if he removes the larva from the spider on
the final evening, the spider will build a platform-style web that
night and the following night, but will revert to making its usual
orb thereafter, as if recovering from some strong drug.
</P>
<P>
   He has no idea what the chemical might be, but hopes first to
identify what gland in the larva might be secreting it. The wasp's
behavior is described by Eberhard in a report in last week's
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jay Rosenheim, an expert on parasitic wasps at the
University of California at Davis, said many parasites were known
to shape their host's behavior in various ways. ``But what is
really amazing and wonderful about this example is that the host's
behavior is manipulated in such a detailed way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As another example he cited the case of a wasp, Cotesia
glomerata, that parasitizes the Large White butterfly. When the
larvae emerge from the caterpillar, they spin their cocoons right
next to it, and the stricken insect then stands guard by weaving a
web over the cocoons and threatening attackers, behavior that is
presumably induced by the larvae.
</P>
<P>
   The Costa Rican wasp discovered by Eberhard preys on an
orb-weaver called Plesiometa argyra. The wasp, a new species, is
awaiting a name from Dr. Ian Gauld, a wasp taxonomist at the
Natural History Museum in London.
</P>
<P>
   Gauld said this is the first time he had seen a wasp with the
ability to manipulate its host's behavior in such a way, and that
nothing is known about how the manipulation is accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think biology is one of the last great frontiers,'' he said.
``We have got no idea about what there is on earth with us, let
alone what it is doing or how it does it.''

A PARENT'S PLEA: MY SON'S MURDER DEMANDS JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM SEGAL  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It was every parent's worst nightmare: the phone call
in the middle of the night. Saturday night. November 1998. A voice,
saying: ``I'm sorry. Your son. Bludgeoned by assailant. Skull
cracked open. Not expected to live. Come quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   As out-of-towners, while the hours, weeks and months unfolded,
we came to see San Francisco in awesome and awful shades of good,
bad and ugly.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Good.
</P>
<P>
   Our 28-year-old son, Anton, had come to San Francisco only
months earlier, full of confidence and capability. A National Merit
Scholar, a Harvard honors graduate, a Junior Olympics medalist,
fluent in Arabic, Japanese, French, Italian and English, Anton was
a world traveler, an adventurer/writer.
</P>
<P>
   He'd worked in Japan, dived among hammerheads in the Red Sea,
vagabonded across land-mined Cambodia and Vietnam, hitched through
war-torn Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest satisfaction lay in working with the needy, the
underprivileged, the handicapped; from kids in Boston's inner city
to paraplegic divers in the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
   When Anton finally returned to the safety of the States, he
could have lived anywhere. He had friends everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   He chose San Francisco. Now he lay dying in San Francisco
General Hospital, slowly going brain dead.
</P>
<P>
   Grief-struck, we marveled even then at the tender care and
concern shown him by the doctors and staff of one of our nation's
best trauma centers.
</P>
<P>
   There was virtually no hope for Anton, right from the beginning.
His head had been staved in by a car club, and the blow had not
only ripped open his skull but had driven the brains from his right
hemisphere into the left.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary Dr. Martin Holland and his neurosurgical team
tried everything, including drilling a hole to relieve pressure in
the brain. It was to no avail. But for the compassionate care given
him by complete strangers, we say thank you, and bravo, San
Francisco!
</P>
<P>
   More of the Good.
</P>
<P>
   As the tragedy unfolded, the question was not whether our son
would die, but when. Enter more heroes _ and heroines: Genie Kozak
and Monique Gillett of the California Transplant Donor Network.
</P>
<P>
   Anton had wanted to give his organs and tissues to others, so
that, with his death, others might live. The transplant team, in
the gentlest of ways, explained the procedures; gathered our
consent; contacted the recipients, from San Francisco north to
Alaska; arranged for various teams of surgeons to harvest Anton's
different organs, then transport them to where other surgical teams
were waiting.
</P>
<P>
   We all waited three days for that fragile moment, that blink of
God's eye, when our son's brain finally died but his heart and
other organs still, momentarily, lived. Even in death, Anton gave
all he had to others.
</P>
<P>
   To the transplant teams, we say thank you, and bravo, San
Francisco!
</P>
<P>
   Heartfelt thanks as well to your often-unsung cops. Within days
of the assault, Inspectors Kervin Silas, Napoleon Hendrix (now
retired) and John Hennessey (now a lieutenant) had gathered
evidence, interviewed witnesses, located the suspect's vehicle,
found the murder weapon and arrested the suspect as he was working
at the San Francisco airport where we had arrived only days
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Bad.
</P>
<P>
   The man who is accused in the murder of our son must also be
someone's son. So I can't help but wonder: Who read him ``The Cat
in the Hat''? Who played rubber ducky with him in the tub? Did
anyone drive him to piano lessons on Tuesdays and Thursdays after
school? Check his homework every night?
</P>
<P>
   How do these wild things grow up, where and when does evil take
root? The suspect is alleged to have struck Anton while our son's
back was turned _ an act both murderous and cowardly.
</P>
<P>
   More of the Bad.
</P>
<P>
   I understand that beat patrolmen, the linchpins of street crime
prevention, had been recalled shortly before Anton's murder. In an
apparent effort to save money, the walk-the-beat cops had been
replaced by fewer, cheaper, less intensive patrol-car drive-bys,
and this on a Saturday night in a high-crime area. Which brings us
to . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Ugly.
</P>
<P>
   In a city of as much beauty and promise as San Francisco, I've
been warned to stay away from certain blocks of Sixth Street and
Seventh Street. Stretches of Geary and Polk in the Tenderloin. The
seedy, seamy side to your city. I would add yet another street to
the list: Broadway near Columbus Avenue in North Beach. That is
where our son was murdered. In front of a strip club. It is an area
of high crime _ of money, drugs, sex, booze and young people: a
lethal mix.
</P>
<P>
   But it is generally considered an entertainment section, a red
light district to which San Francisco gives a green light.
</P>
<P>
   The same week Anton was fatally bludgeoned, another young man
was shot dead at a nearby club. The murders made headlines for a
couple of days. Then the smell of money and the sound of coin swept
away remembrance of things past.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the ugliest stain of all is the way police, press,
politicians and people doing business in that area will blink, wink
and turn away until another young person dies there. Then another
round begins.
</P>
<P>
   It's been almost 20 months since our son's murder. Justice
delayed is justice denied.
</P>
<P>
   Anton's mother and I wait for another phone call from San
Francisco, telling us again to come quickly, this time for the
trial. We ask you, San Francisco, wait with us. Follow the trial
with us. Through it, you will discover for yourselves your good,
your bad, and your ugly.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks ago Tuesday, at 10:20 a.m., the Northridge earthquake
struck again.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of Northridge, a suburb north of Los Angeles, the
epicenter this time was a house 140 miles to the south, in a
laboratory at the University of California, San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of temblors have struck this house since January, all
inflicted by an earthquake simulator as part of research to
understand how earthquakes shake wood-frame houses, which account
for more than 90 percent of Southern California homes.
</P>
<P>
   Because most wood-frame buildings are just one or two stories
high and because wood can bend without breaking, the conventional
engineering wisdom has been that wood buildings survive earthquakes
better than other types of construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a lot of attention to wood structures,''
said Dr. John Hall, a professor of civil engineering at the
California Institute of Technology and manager of the house-shaking
project.
</P>
<P>
   The wood-frame construction of a typical California house is
simple: a skeleton of two-by-four studs with a plywood shell, an
outer skin of stucco and an inner skin of drywall. But the dynamics
of a wood-frame house in an earthquake are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are complicated beasts, a lot more than you would
think,'' Hall said. ``Wood is a kind of messy construction to deal
with. You have all these components interacting.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 Northridge earthquake inflicted considerable damage to
wood-frame buildings and showed that the conventional wisdom
required some updating.
</P>
<P>
   While most wood-frame buildings survived without significant
damage, the earthquake, with a magnitude of 6.7, was centered in a
residential area and caused about $10 billion of damage to homes,
or about a quarter of the quake's total damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northridge was really the first time that showed the
vulnerability of wood frame,'' said Dr. Andre Filiatrault, a
professor of structural engineering at San Diego and the project's
principal investigator.
</P>
<P>
   For the last six months, a consortium of universities has been
building, shaking and rebuilding a house atop a hydraulic ``shake
table'' that simulates earthquake movements.
</P>
<P>
   In the July 11 test, the shake table faithfully reproduced 20
seconds of ground movements recorded during the Northridge
earthquake 10 miles from the epicenter.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the fully furnished two-story, 600-square-foot test
house, appliances toppled and shelves that had not been anchored to
the floor or a wall fell. The structure, built in accordance with
the latest construction codes, came through with just a few small
cracks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lessons learned appears to be the power of stucco.
Like most houses in Southern California, the test house's exterior
wall is a layer of stucco mounted onto a wire mesh attached outside
the plywood sheathing. Stucco is stiff, adding strength, but
brittle. Before the test, most of the engineers expected the
shaking to break the stucco apart.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier test, without the stucco and drywall interior
walls, the top of the house swayed back and forth five inches
relative to the bottom. In the latest test, the top swayed only one
inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those materials have the potential of providing a lot of
earthquake resistance,'' Hall said. ``The building was quite a bit
stronger than when we previously tested it.''
</P>
<P>
   The revised 1997 building code downgraded stucco's effectiveness
rating in resisting the shaking of an earthquake because in the
Northridge quake, the outer stucco layer literally peeled off many
homes, perhaps because of poor construction.
</P>
<P>
   There was ``a lot of evidence'' in the real quake that it didn't
do well and that more testing needed to be done, said Nicolino
Delli Quadri, assistant chief of the engineering bureau in the Los
Angeles Department of Building and Safety.
</P>
<P>
   The simple box shape of the test house may have also made it
more durable.
</P>
<P>
   The tests, financed with $5 million from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, will shape guidelines to help insurance
companies determine when, for example, a crack in the stucco is
cosmetic and when it signals structural damage.
</P>
<P>
   Patching stucco costs a few hundred dollars; replacing it costs
tens of thousands. ``The insurance agencies in California are very
interested in this second question of what extent repairs are
necessary to repair structures to their original condition,'' Hall
said.

 PRELIMINARY WTO RULING UPHOLDS FRANCE's IMPORT BAN ON CANADIAN By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A recent ruling by the World Trade Organization that
upholds France's ban on Canadian asbestos imports has caught the
attention of environmentalists and labor rights advocates, who say
it indicates the global trade group may be growing more sensitive
to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which affirmed the validity of a French law
prohibiting imports of hazardous materials, is also another blow to
the global asbestos industry. Other WTO members might now use the
ruling as a precedent to justify similar bans.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos, a fibrous mineral, was once widely used in building
materials such as insulation and floor coverings, but demand for it
has shrunk drastically the last few decades because of scientific
studies that show it causes cancer and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictions on the use of asbestos have been in effect for
years in the United States, where billions of dollars in
health-related claims by workers exposed to asbestos have long
clogged the court system. The European Union, following France's
lead, is soon expected to outlaw asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by a three-person WTO dispute panel is the first time
the Geneva-based trade group has upheld a member nation's trade
restriction to protect human health.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time that they supported common sense, not
narrow-minded, short-term corporate interests,'' said Remi
Parmentier, a spokesman for Greenpeace, the environmental activist
organization. The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
has also welcomed the WTO ruling as a victory for worker safety.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups, which are prominent critics of the WTO, share
concerns with a broad alliance of activists who disrupted the WTO's
meeting last December in Seattle with demonstrations accusing the
trade group of favoring business interests over the environment and
workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   WTO officials have declined to comment on the asbestos ruling
because it is not final. The final ruling is expected next month or
in September, after both sides submit their comments.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian and French missions to the WTO have also declined
to comment. But no interim ruling has ever been reversed in the
trade group's five-year history, and it is expected to be
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The asbestos case was filed two years ago by Canada on behalf of
its mining and export industry against France, which two years
earlier had banned asbestos and asbestos products as hazardous to
humans. Canada has long been a leading exporter of asbestos, most
of it mined in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Canada had sent nearly 30,000 metric tons of asbestos yearly to
France before the 1996 ban, said Denis Hamel, a spokesman for the
Asbestos Institute, a Montreal-based trade group.
</P>
<P>
   In arguments at the WTO, the Canadians said newer, safer forms
of asbestos did not release fibers into the air as older products
did. They argued that France could have adopted controls less
restrictive than a ban.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the WTO ruling will lead to restrictions
on asbestos by other member nations. Some of the initial approval
of the ruling by WTO critics has also tempered a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Lucien Royer, health and safety officer for the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions, said the asbestos ruling
provided little guidance to how the WTO might rule in similar cases
where the safety of an export is challenged because the trade
organization's dispute-resolution process is not public
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``How the panels select and incorporate information in these
rulings is very, very murky,'' Royer said.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the ruling might actually be more confusing than
helpful in resolving other trade disputes arising from health and
environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Parmentier said it was ``too early to say whether this ruling
will affect other cases or the EU's precautionary principle.'' He
was referring to the European Union's effort to establish a
principle to justify bans on imports considered harmful to the
environment or public health.
</P>
<P>
   The test of that principle has been at the center of the
continuing trans-Atlantic trade fight over hormones in American
beef.
</P>
<P>
   The trade organization has ruled that the beef is safe and the
union's ban is illegal. But the union says that its scientific
studies establish that the beef represented enough danger to human
health to warrant not complying with the organization's ruling.

 HMOs TO DROP NEARLY A MILLION MEDICARE CLIENTS  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than 900,000 elderly and disabled people will
soon be dropped by health maintenance organizations pulling out of
the Medicare program, the Clinton administration said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The number, which is substantially greater than estimates last
month by the HMO industry, underlines the turbulence and
instability of the market in which Medicare beneficiaries seek
private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   After a preliminary survey last month, the American Association
of Health Plans, the chief lobby for the industry, predicted that
health plans would cancel insurance coverage for 711,000 Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's count, 933,687, is almost a third greater;
it represents nearly one-sixth of the 6.2 million Medicare
recipients in HMOs. Altogether, 39 million Americans are enrolled
in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare beneficiaries being dropped by HMOs have until Jan. 1
to make new arrangements for their health insurance. They can
enroll in other managed care plans, if any are available in their
area, or return to Medicare's original fee-for-service program.
</P>
<P>
   Most HMOs offer prescription drug benefits and other services
not provided in the fee-for-service program.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people affected by the new withdrawals far exceeds
the number in either of the last two years. In those years, HMOs
pulled out of more than 400 counties in at least 33 states,
directly affecting 734,000 Medicare beneficiaries _ 407,000 in 1999
and 327,000 this year. The withdrawals have touched or will touch
27 percent of all beneficiaries enrolled in managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for the pullouts are a subject of debate. While the
administration says current payment rates are adequate, or more
than adequate, it says Congress needs to approve President
Clinton's proposal to pay HMOs for providing prescription drug
benefits. Under current law, health plans do not receive an
explicit or separate payment for drug benefits, though many offer
such coverage, sometimes for an additional premium.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the new figures, Nancy-Ann Min DeParle,
administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, which
runs Medicare, said, ``The volatility of the Medicare managed care
market underscores the need for Congress to enact the president's
legislative proposal to modernize and strengthen Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   But Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of
Health Plans, said HMOs were pulling out of Medicare because they
were ``over-regulated and underpaid'' by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Ignagni said the administration underestimated the problem for
two years, but now ``shows a growing recognition of its urgency.''
She said Congress should increase direct payments to HMOs by $15
billion over the next five years _ an increase of 5.5 percent. That
sum does not include the billions of dollars that HMOs would
receive for providing drug benefits under Clinton's plan and most
congressional proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people being dropped by HMOs varies greatly from
state to state because companies typically do business in some
states, but not others, and they may withdraw from selected
counties or states. Texas, for example, will see almost three times
as many Medicare recipients dropped as New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The government figures show the withdrawals will affect 24,327
people in Arizona, 52,464 in California, 51,185 in Connecticut,
87,727 in Florida, 18,144 in Illinois, 53,038 in Maryland, 21,781
in Massachusetts, 12,411 in New Jersey, 64,329 in New York, 65,617
in Ohio, 89,641 in Pennsylvania and 180,749 in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Financing Administration said that 65 HMOs chose
not to renew their Medicare contracts next year, while 53 health
plans decided to withdraw from selected counties.
</P>
<P>
   About 775,000 of the affected beneficiaries, or 83 percent, live
in areas served by other HMOs and could enroll in them if those
health plans were accepting additional Medicare patients. About
159,000 beneficiaries, or 17 percent of those being dropped by
managed care plans next year, will be left without any HMO options.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it expected to pay HMOs an average of $573 a
month, or $6,876 a year, for each Medicare beneficiary they serve
next year. Payments are somewhat lower in counties from which HMOs
are pulling out. In those counties, Medicare will pay an average of
$541 a month, or $6,492 a year, representing 94 percent of the
national average.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare payments to HMOs vary from county to county, reflecting
differences in the cost of care provided by doctors and hospitals
in the fee-for-service program. The administration said that people
in high-paid urban areas as well as low-paid rural areas would be
affected by the HMO withdrawals.

ARMSTRONG WILL DETERMINE HOW LONG THE CELEBRATION CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Lance Armstrong celebrated his second successive Tour de
France victory in ways expected _ a glass or two of Champagne, a
party with hundreds of his closest friends and sponsors; and in
ways unexpected _ with nine other cancer survivors, he signed the
Paris Charter Against Cancer, an information service.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is how long this annual celebration will
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stop a lot earlier than people expect,'' the
leader of the U.S. Postal Service team said even before he wrapped
up his latest success. ``I don't want to stretch out my career.
When it's time to stop, I'll know it, the people around me will
know it, and I'll just go and quit.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Although the 28-year-old Armstrong has many peak years left in
principle, he sounds dubious about trying to match the record of
five Tour victories held by Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard
Hinault and Miguel Indurain, the dominant riders of the 1960s,
'70s, '80s and '90s.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For that matter, Greg LeMond, with three Tour victories, still
outranks him among Americans. ``That's a great accomplishment,''
Armstrong said of LeMond's record, adding that it was no motivation
to him to try to match him.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I don't know if I have the desire to try to win five because
I now have a wonderful family that ultimately I want to spend a lot
more time with,'' Armstrong said during the Tour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``It would be crazy for me to think I can win five in a row
because there are many talented people in the sport. So that would
mean that if I were to win five, I would have to do a total of
seven or something like that. You can't win every year _ you have
accidents or somebody comes along that's better than you.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have the motivation for all of those years, then I'll try
to do it. The way I ride, the way I train and race, is based all on
motivation and love of the sport. If I love the sport and love what
I do for five more years, then I'll try.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can't guarantee it. When you put so much into it, pack
so much into it, I don't think it's good for longevity.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Longevity is a major concern in his recovery from cancer and
his campaign, as head of a foundation, to increase awareness of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``It's still my main objective,'' he said. `'I need to prove
not only that I came back one time but that I'm surviving the
illness for another year, for another five years, for however many
years I can survive _ that's the issue I like to push forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year that I come back to the Tour de France is another
year that I survived this illness.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that not finishing first would not discourage him. ``If
I don't win next year, I think I'll still come back and try again
the following year. That won't drive me from the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his domination, Armstrong still has room to grow
stronger, said Chris Carmichael, his trainer for the last 10 years
and a former rider himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's about 2 percent stronger this year over last year, based
on tests before the Tour,'' Carmichael said, ``but 2 percent is
enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael thought the Texan was 10 percent stronger now than
before his testicular cancer was diagnosed in 1996. ``That doesn't
sound very much, but it's an awful lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael also tried to explain his protege's power in the
mountains the last two years. Before then, Armstrong was not
regarded as a leading climber.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all subtle things,'' he said. ``Now they look
glaringly different, but they're really not. His pedal speed and
things like that _ that's work that's been taking a long time to
get to the point where he is now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Alps and Pyrenees during the last two Tours, the Texan
has been using a smaller gear and more pedal strokes a minute to
push it than he did before. ``Most of it is between 85 to 90
revolutions per minute when he's climbing,'' Carmichael said,
``which is about 10 r.p.m. more than is traditional, what he used
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who said Monday that he would enter both the time
trial and the road race at the Olympics in Sydney, Australia, in
September, also credits his increased time spent training on the
hills near his home in Nice and improved eating habits to bring his
weight down to 73 kilograms (161 pounds) from 82 kilograms in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do eat some red meat, but not a lot,'' he said. ``I eat a
lot of fish in Nice, more fish than I eat chicken. They catch the
fish right there in Nice, fresh out of the water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of tricks to losing weight,'' he said,
including his occasional habit of weighing his portions down to the
gram before they are cooked.
</P>
<P>
   So, after his autobiography was published this spring, will his
next effort be ``The Lance Armstrong Diet Book''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he said, laughing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Anxious to cobble together pieces of an
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, President Clinton worked
through the night after his return from Japan and then resumed
negotiations Monday with small groups on the most difficult issues
dividing the sides.
</P>
<P>
   On the 14th day of the summit, in talks that are now longer than
the original Camp David negotiations in 1978, White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart portrayed Clinton standing in the vortex of the
negotiations, saying that the president would press on unless the
proceedings collapsed.

<P>
   Lockhart refused to say whether the negotiators were writing
parts of a document, saying only that the negotiators had been
taking notes. But he confirmed that all issues, including the
potential dealbreaker of Jerusalem, were being hashed out Monday in
``exhaustive and exhausting'' discussions.
</P>
<P>
   With pressure mounting against a peace agreement from right-wing
Jewish and Islamic factions in the Middle East, Clinton met
separately late Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, and then held discussions with
their top aides from midnight until 5 a.m Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After five hours' sleep, he reconvened the small group in his
Aspen Cabin for four more hours of discussions. Sometimes Clinton
met with both sides, sometimes with one side alone. After a
midafternoon break, he again brought together the sides Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat were kept abreast of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   As long as ``the president believes that discussions are
substantive and have the potential of leading to an agreement, he
will remain here, and he will keep the parties here, to keep
working,'' Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``I think the fact that he was up until 5 a.m.
working through the issues should lead you to believe he thinks
staying here for the time being is worthwhile.'' But ``it's
impossible to predict the likelihood'' of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The president is scheduled to attend a memorial service for a
family friend in Arkansas Tuesday, leaving Camp David around noon
and returning at midnight, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   That means two things: Either the talks break up before Clinton
leaves, or nothing substantive will be announced until Wedneday at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 24 hours after his arrival from Japan on Sunday, the
president was neither more nor less hopeful for a deal, Lockhart
said. ``I think he's right where he was when he left Japan,'' the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Two US officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
the US negotiators were upbeat about returning to talks following a
15-hour flight from Japan, where they had attended a Group of Eight
summit. But the officials said it did not mean that the US team was
optimistic about their chances of pulling out a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea, obviously, is that with the pressure, the
exhaustion, and the sheer proximity will get them to make
compromises, to start horse-trading,'' said one of the officials.
``If the deal wasn't so difficult, it would be more sane to allow
them to go out. But we're not going to allow that here. It's really
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Former US ambassador to Israel Samuel Lewis, one of the ten US
negotiators assisting President Carter at the 1978 Camp David
summit that led to an Israeli-Egyptian peace deal, said Monday that
signs pointed toward an eventual agreement _ partial or complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer it goes on, the more difficult it is to leave
without anything,'' Lewis said. ``They have been there two weeks
now, so I think there will be something, barring second thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   While a news blackout has kept a lid on the substance of the
talks, it has been clear from officials in the Middle East who have
talked with negotiators that the main problem at Camp David has
been the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israel captured and annexed East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967
and now insists on a unified Holy City, under Israeli control. The
Palestinians are demanding sovereignty over East Jerusalem, under
which they would allow unfettered access to holy sites for Jews,
Christians and Muslims. Israel now permits free access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question was whether Arafat was going to begin to
negotiate about a partial arrangement on Jerusalem,'' Lewis said.
``A few clues have slipped out that maybe that's been happening. If
it does happen, in around three or four days they will break up
with a deal, or they'll break up (Monday) without a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   One clue came from the travels of Arab leaders around the Middle
East, notably Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who visited Saudi
Arabian King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah on Sunday. Mubarak, a
strong US ally, also was expected to talk in coming days with
Syria's new President Bashar Assad and Jordan's King Abdullah II.
</P>
<P>
   Many US analysts believe that Mubarak is attempting to rally
support for Arafat around a partial sovereignty deal for east
Jerusalem. But Lebanese political commentator Hisham Melhem said
Arab leaders would not advise Arafat on his decision regarding the
fate of the city, which contains the third holiest site in Islam
behind Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Arab world, this issue is extremely emotional and
combustible,'' Melhem said. ``If word got out that the Egyptian
leaders, or the Jordanian leader, or any of the Arab leaders,
counseled Arafat to be flexible, it would cause great domestic
trouble with the Islamists.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, too, faces intense domestic pressure not to give up any
part of Jerusalem to the Palestinians. Likud leader Ariel Sharon
said Monday that no Israeli prime minister had the power to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The only deadline looming over the talks was next Sunday's
presidential elections in Israel, which Barak has said he wants to
attend. To make the vote, Barak would have to leave by midday
Thursday to land in Israel before the beginning of Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the lack of a firm deadline, Lockhart said that the
president has told both sides that they would only stay if they
made progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot give you a precise formula, except to say that the
president has got this very issue foremost in his mind and he will
remain here as long as he believes we have some prospect of
success,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   Robert H. Giles, a veteran newspaper editor, will be the next
curator of Harvard University's Nieman Foundation for professional
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Giles confirmed Monday that Harvard President Neil L.
Rudenstine had told Giles last week of the appointment to head the
62-year-old program, which brings 24 United States and foreign
journalists to the university for a year's study. The appointment
was first reported by Editor &AMP; Publisher magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment follows weeks of uncertainty that followed a
strong union challenge to the candidacy of Giles, whose actions as
editor of The Detroit News earned him the contempt of striking
journalists. A wave of letters to Harvard in June, from union
representatives arguing that Giles slanted the News' coverage, was
followed by a second wave from editors and newspaper executives
from around the country vouching for him. One called him ``an
innovative and ethical journalist and leader throughout his
distinguished career.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles will replace Bill Kovach, who served as curator for the
past decade. He becomes the second journalist named this summer to
a highly visible academic post. In June, Jim Bettinger, a former
city editor at The San Jose Mercury-News was named director of
Stanford University's Knight Fellowship Program.

COMPUTER PROGRAM LEARNS TO WIN AT CHECKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Science Times) 
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since an IBM computer defeated Garry Kasparov, the world
chess champion, in 1997, much of the suspense has gone out of the
old battle of man versus machine: the machine won. But the lessons
of a much humbler game have again made that battle fascinating. The
game is, of all things, checkers.
</P>
<P>
   Two computer scientists have leveled the playing field by asking
a computer program called a neural network to do something much
more difficult than beat a defenseless human at checkers. Knowing
only the rules of checkers and a few basics, and otherwise starting
from scratch, the program must teach itself how to play a good game
without help from the outside world _ including from the
programmers.
</P>
<P>
   The program did just that, using the electronic equivalent of
natural selection. A sort of colony of the programs, each slightly
different from all the others, played checkers against one another
_ quite ineptly at first _ and chronic losers were killed off.
Slightly mutated versions of the winners were allowed to reproduce.
After hundreds of generations, blind evolution produced an expert
checkers player, but not an infallible one.
</P>
<P>
   The work was described last week in San Diego at the 2000
Congress on Evolutionary Computation by Dr. David B. Fogel, a
computer scientist at Natural Selection Inc., a company in La
Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the work, which Fogel did with Kumar
Chellapilla, a doctoral student in electrical engineering at the
University of California at San Diego, goes well beyond checkers to
a question that has dogged computer science for decades: Can
computers be designed to solve problems under circumstances that
their human programmers never envisioned?
</P>
<P>
   The question is relevant for circumstances that vary as widely
as an interstellar probe that loses contact with Earth and must
adapt to unforeseen problems, and an automated factory scheduler
attempting to deal with unexpected shortages or breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   All this from a good, but not perfect, game of checkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point here is that it learns to play by itself,'' said Dr.
Christopher Welty, a professor in the computer science department
at Vassar College.
</P>
<P>
   Because any particular version of Deep Blue, the IBM program
that defeated Kasparov, was based on strict rules and specific
strategies given to it by humans, Welty said, ``the way it played
chess was very predictable. Given the exact same game, it would
play the same way twice.'' But Fogel's program can adapt without
intervention by humans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The program made short work of about two dozen casual players at
last week's conference, winning 25 timed ``challenge matches,''
losing none, and battling one player _ Dr. Edmund Burke, a
professor of computer science at the University of Nottingham in
England _ to a draw.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Fogel's best checkers program can improve beyond its
current skill level is uncertain; it can hold its own with
expert-rated players in official rankings but is generally blown
off the board by players in the higher echelons of master and grand
master players. The question of just how far such an adaptive
algorithm can progress is a matter of intense debate among computer
scientists, Welty said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Ali Zalzala, a computer scientist at Heriot-Watt
University in Edinburgh, Scotland, and the principal organizer of
the conference, said that just by taking on such questions, Fogel's
work may be shedding light on much deeper issues. Zalzala called
the research ``a very serious attempt to understand the operation
of biological evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The neural networks that Fogel has bred into checkers players
exist as software programs on his personal computer. To understand
them, however, it helps to visualize the physical structures that
the software is modeling. Those structures consist of a rather
crude representation of the interconnected networks of neurons in
the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Living neurons are sometimes called ``integrate-and-fire''
structures. A neuron somehow integrates, or adds up, all the
electrical stimuli it receives from other neurons that are
connected to its receptors. If the sum rises above a certain
threshold, it fires off its own electrical pulse, stimulating yet
another set of neurons that behave in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The threshold for firing can be different for each neuron; so
can its own firing intensity compared to the amount of input
stimuli it receives, an amplification factor sometimes called the
connection strength. At one end of the network might be sensory
input from a pair of ears, for example, and at the other a
conclusion like, ``That is Bob's voice'' or ``That is not Bob's
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Any small part of the network might have connection strengths
and thresholds to recognize one particular feature, like average
pitch or the way a single vowel is pronounced. Because all parts of
the network are interconnected, it can put all of these clues
together almost simultaneously to draw a conclusion about whose
voice is being heard.
</P>
<P>
   Humans learn; no one is born able to recognize Bob's voice.
Likewise, the thresholds and connection strengths in Fogel's
network, which are geared toward recognizing sequences of moves in
checkers rather than voices, can change as the program learns.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a human being, you are a pattern-recognizing device,'' said
Fogel, who added that his simple network could do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not give away the game by telling the network how.
The network begins with 32 ``sensory'' inputs, one for each
possible position on the board. Those inputs take on different
values depending on whether a square is occupied by nothing, by an
ordinary red or black piece, or by a king.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Neurons'' carrying those signals cross in a complex pattern of
nested connections, reminiscent of a switchboard. Each neuron has a
variable connection strength and each connection has a threshold.
For a given configuration of checkers, the output of the network is
a single number.
</P>
<P>
   That number is in some way the network's evaluation of the
pattern on the board, a sort of output of pleasure or pain. At each
point of the game, the computer evaluates it for the existing
configuration and for possible ones it could create by making
certain moves. Based on that information, it maximizes the number
and makes moves, plays games.
</P>
<P>
   Fogel began by creating several variants of his program, each
with random connection strengths and thresholds. They played each
other, and the regular losers _ those for whom ``pleasure'' was not
a reliable guide to playing a good game _ were eliminated. The
others, with random ``mutations'' that could allow better players
to evolve, were given offspring. Eventually, he arrived at an
expert player, a fact he verified by matching the program against
ranked human players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The performance is remarkable,'' said Dr. Michael Conrad, a
professor in the computer science department at Wayne State
University. ``I'm still sort of surprised how good it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from getting beat by some humans, however, the program is
not in the same league as Chinook, the computer checkers player
devised some years ago by Dr. Jonathan Schaeffer, a professor of
computing science at the University of Alberta in Canada. Chinook
does not have a human equal at any level, Schaeffer said. But he
said his program, like Big Blue, was infused with human expertise
from the beginning rather than learning on its own.
</P>
<P>
   How good Fogel's program might someday become, and whether it
could ever approach something like Chinook, is unknown. But Dr.
Silvano Colombano, a computer scientist at the NASA Ames Research
Center in California, said the same sort of evolutionary strategy
could be built into computers aboard spacecraft that range too far
from Earth to stay in contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``By analogy with the checkers game,'' Colombano said, ``the
computer can play games with itself and become smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing such a spacecraft would have plenty of, he said,
is time. In the long night of space, it might even decide to hone
its checkers game.

NO PILOTS YET BUT TWO NEW SITCOMS STILL FLY FOR FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Actor Michael Richards is reed thin. Actor
John Goodman is not. But the two have something very much in
common: Each has a new sitcom on the fall schedule, and neither had
much to bring to show-and-tell at the TV critics' press tour in
Pasadena. After shooting pilot episodes, each has scrapped the
first draft and gone back to the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, who will play private detective Vic Nardozza in ``The
Michael Richards Show'' on NBC, is still casting the series after
he and his co-producers, all former ``Seinfeld'' writers, decided
it should be an ensemble effort instead of a star-driven comedy.
Tim Meadows is leaving ``Saturday Night Live'' to join the cast.
William Devane is also on board.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, whose show for Fox remains untitled, will play William
``Butch'' Gamble Jr., a gay man who returns to his hometown in
Ohio, where his adult son and ex-wife still live. Aside from the
son, to be played by Greg Pitts, the Goodman show is still casting
about for the ex-wife, as well as for Butch's sister and her two
children.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's not unprecedented for a show to be pilotless in
July, it's often not a good sign. Fall-series production begins
just about now, so a show that's still trying to decide what it
wants to be has only a few weeks to set a course. Fortunately, the
fall season is late this year because of the summer Olympics,
pushing the premiere of Richards' show into October at the
earliest. Goodman's will be even later _ Nov. 1 _ because of Fox's
commitment to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, whose private persona is completely unlike the manic
Kramer he played on ``Seinfeld,'' seemed almost apologetic when he
asked critics to be patient. ``I'd like to say just stick with us.
We're working hard here, and I think you'll see something quite
special this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, meanwhile, remains ever sarcastic, with nary a clue
about what producers Bonnie and Terry Turner have in mind. ``I'm
right now kind of a hired-gun guy,'' he said. ``I'm waiting to see
how it shapes up before I start screwing up.''
</P>
<P>
   As they say in TV, stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   Olympia, Wash., native Sonja Christopher, the first contestant
to be voted off the island in ``Survivor,'' is a little dismayed by
what she experienced in her short time on Pulau Tiga in the South
China Sea and by what she has seen of the program on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm a little naive,'' she confessed. ``I don't know
whether it's the younger generation or certain people in my tribe
or whatever, but I didn't do the `outwit' part of it very well. I
didn't even think of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher, who is 63, was referring to the three basic tenets
of ``Survivor'': to outwit, outplay and outlast the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled by the creation of power alliances on the island and
outright deception by at least two contestants when asked if such
alliances exist, she looked at producer Mark Burnett and said: ``I
hope the program doesn't teach the young people in America that the
way to win is to be duplicitous and dishonest. That's a concern of
mine.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESANING, Mich. _ Lia Lopez walked through the doorway of her
old room and stepped into her childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Goofy, girlish memories sprang from all sides -- the crevice in
the closet where she'd hid her secret letters; the deep-pile,
burgundy carpet where she'd clumsily spilled countless bottles of
Coke; the lamp clamped to her brass headboard, whose bulb had
warmed her always-cold hands.
</P>
<P>
   It had been years since Lopez, 30, had visited the family home
in Chesaning, a farming town 100 miles northwest of Detroit. But
the house where she grew up had drawn her back. Her parents had put
the tri-level home up for sale, and Lopez wanted to soak in the
surroundings one last time.
</P>
<P>
   When parents sell the family home, their adult children might
feel a twinge, a sense of loss. A childhood home lets you cling to
younger days, more playful days, a time when you didn't have the
faintest clue about credit card statements or stress headaches.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a confusing and uneasy transition on various levels.
It can nudge you into realizing that your parents are aging, or
make you believe that you're forfeiting your childhood. The hardest
part may be figuring out how to feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing a home which is so much a part of our past can be
discomforting, because in a sense losing this concrete and visible
reminder of our past symbolizes the loss of opportunity to go back
in time and reminisce,'' said Joseph Tecce, a Boston University
psychology professor. ``Not being able to stroll through our old
bedroom or the back yard where we played or had family celebrations
is tantamount to diminishing the reality and significance of these
special times.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez's parents, Bob and Kerry Laney, both teachers, retired
this year. In their mid-50s, they're itching to build a custom home
in an active retirement community in the Smoky Mountain foothills
of eastern Tennessee. The couple will have golf courses, 40 miles
of lake shoreline and all sorts of diversions within easy reach.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, older Americans stay put. A U.S. Census Bureau
report released in July says that between March 1998 and March
1999, just 6.7 percent of people ages 55 to 64 moved and only 4.5
percent of people 65 and older did. (People in their 20s moved the
most -- 32.4 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of homeowners 65 and older have lived in
their homes for at least 10 years, and about half the owners in
that age group have lived in the same house for 20 or more years,
census figures say.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that her parents planned to sell their house, Lopez
wanted to show her husband, Jose, where she grew up. The two
recently made the trip from their home in Pensacola, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez recalled sneaking out with her friends at night to spook
each other at a nearby cemetery, walking for miles beside her
mother amid the wheat and soy fields surrounding the house, and
watching the progress of an evergreen tree she helped plant outside
her window.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny how a place can make you remember certain times in
your life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Until they put their house on the market, the Laneys had left
their children's rooms untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Their son, Rob Laney, said it was bizarre knowing that his
boyhood room would be gone. With its brown shag carpet, National
Geographic world map and shelves of comic books and Hardy Boys
paperbacks, the surroundings always felt familiar and natural to
the 33-year-old now living in a Detroit suburb -- an easy fit.
</P>
<P>
   About his parents' move, he said, ``It hasn't really sunken in
yet. I try not to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adult children react in every which way to the selling of their
childhood home, said Tony Morganti, a real estate agent in Cuyahoga
Falls, Ohio. Some are eager to get their parents out of the house,
especially if the parents are ill. Others feel so strongly about
the house, they'll buy it to keep it in the family.
</P>

   As she cleared out the house, Holan, 32, found precious tokens
of the family -- love letters her parents wrote to each other in
their native Romanian, crude pot holders she and her siblings
fashioned at summer camp, report cards, old photos.

   Judith Levy, a Minneapolis psychotherapist, said that losing the
family home can represent a further separation from your parents, a
step toward becoming more of an individual. The loss also can make
children realize how much they had depended on their parents to
store childhood memories, she said.

<P>
   ``My generation of yuppies are mobile, in the moment,
ambitious,'' said Levy, 53. ``It's been a reliance on the parents
to maintain the homestead and the past and the history.''

<P>
   Adults can become devoted to their childhood homes ``the way
kids get attached to blankies,'' she said.

   Levy speaks from experience. When her parents sold the beige
stucco house in which she grew up on Long Island, she didn't know
how to react.

   Sparago knew that her parents needed a smaller place. Her father

   WASHINGTON _ Imagine millions of pills bouncing back and forth
across U.S. borders like tennis balls.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has consumers of prescription drugs anticipating deep
savings and the pharmaceutical industry fearing a wave of cheap and
possibly dangerous imports of their own products flooding the U.S.
market.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate last week approved legislation that would allow
pharmacies and drug wholesalers to ``re-import'' U.S.-made
pharmaceuticals that have been exported to other countries --
Canada, for instance -- that have price controls to restrict the
cost of drugs to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates, including many in Congress, argue that the
legislation will force reductions in both drug prices and border
crossings by Americans who buy drugs in Canada and other countries
in which U.S. drugs are discounted.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure, led by the pharmaceutical industry,
believe lifting the ban would create health risks by exposing
Americans to drugs that have been outside U.S. control.
</P>
<P>
   They also argue that there is no guarantee that pharmacies and
drug wholesalers would pass savings along to consumers and that
profit margins must be maintained to fund expensive research toward
the next generation of miracle drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate's action may be well-intended,'' said Alan F.
Holmer, president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America. ``But the (legislation) could jeopardize patient safety
and would not ensure any savings for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmer said re-importation of drugs is just as dangerous now as
it was in 1988 when the Congress voted to prohibit the practice as
a safeguard for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, innovative prescription medicines can be cheaper in
Canada than in the U.S., primarily because the government of Canada
controls their prices. But importing medicines from Canada would
pose unacceptable health risks to Americans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry is not alone in questioning the
safety of re-imported drugs. In testimony this year to the Senate,
former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Jane Henney said
allowing re-importation could cause Canada ``to somehow be used as
a front for counterfeit products becoming available.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The trackability of a pedigree of a drug is more than in
question. Where did the bulk product come from? How was it
manufactured? You're just putting yourself at increased risk when
you don't know all of those things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another former FDA commissioner, David A. Kessler, wrote in a
letter to Congress last year that the Internet has increased the
risks of importation of ``adulterated and counterfeit products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Repealing the prohibition on re-importation of drugs would
remove one of the principal statutory tools for dealing with this
growing issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for every voice predicting that repealing the ban on
re-imported drugs will lead to new dangers, there are dozens, if
not hundreds, of voices decrying the high cost of drugs in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is long overdue that people in this country are able to get
drugs at the much more affordable prices that they are available in
Canada, Europe and elsewhere,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of
Public Citizen's Health Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that the industry keeps charging price-gouging
prices to afford research is a major-league lie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major step towards making the basic right to
affordable prescription drugs for all Americans a reality,'' said
Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., a key sponsor of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``By improving competition and promoting free trade, we can
lower drug costs in this country while still making sure that the
drugs are safe and effective. ... It's time to end the
pharmaceutical industry's rip-off of American consumers,''
Wellstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher T. Rhodes, a professor of applied pharmaceutical
sciences at the University of Rhode Island, said the FDA and other
agencies ``possess the necessary personnel, equipment and expertise
so that samples of re-imported products could be subjected to
appropriate laboratory testing should such action be thought
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of using re-imported prescription drugs in the
U.S. need not place the American public at any increased risk of
ineffective or dangerous products,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The measure still faces a variety of hurdles, first in Congress
and then in the administration before any savings could be felt by
consumers, particularly the elderly at which the measure is aimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very difficult,'' said Richard Tarplin, assistant
secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, referring
to the language inserted into the bill at the last minute to
require HHS to certify that re-importation poses no additional
risks to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate the additional protections, but they're only
workable if Congress provides additional resources to implement
them,'' he said.

   CONFEDERATE (Mesa, Ariz.) - The nationwide Confederate Air
Force, which has a museum in Mesa, is attempting to change its name
because of the stigma now connected with the word ``confederate.''
Corporations have begun cutting back on donations because of the
name. Actually, the group of about 9,000 members has nothing to do
with the Civil War but is dedicated to preserving old military
aircraft. The group was founded in the mid 1950s and acquired the
name as sort of a joke. It will probably take at least two years
for a name change because bylaws require a countrywide election,
with 75 percent support for a name change. By BETTY BEARD. Story
will move in the ``A'' category.

GORE FINDS `RUNNING MATES' IN SIERRA CLUB, UNIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Vice President Al Gore's campaign has known for some
time that it would have to come up with something pretty good to
dampen the bounce Texas Governor George W. Bush hopes to get from
the GOP convention next week.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Democrats' convention doesn't begin until Aug.14, they
will probably try to contain Bush's expected gain in the polls by
announcing Gore's running mate, shifting focus from the governor to
the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats might not have counted on the phenomenon
confronting them right now: Pre-convention bounce, fueled by the
wild speculation and eager anticipation about Bush's running mate,
who is expected to be named Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   All weekend long the pundits and the public have been all over
the Republican guessing game: Friday's front-runner fever for
Senator John McCain gave way to Saturday's for former Pentagon
chief Dick Cheney, followed by another wave, for former Senator
John Danforth, who by Monday was succeeded yet again as
front-runner by Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   So, to compete for airtime on issues, like the Sierra Club's
endorsement of Gore, Gore and his aides, ever adaptable, seem to
have simply siezed on the Republican vice-presidential brouhaha to
help make their case against Bush, working it in at every
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A word about running mates,'' Gore began as he stood by the
Grand River in Grand Rapids, Mich., accepting the Sierra Club's
endorsement. But he wasn't going to give anything away. ``Right
now,'' he said wryly, ``I just want to say how proud I am to be
running with the Sierra Club.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland later in the day, Gore used the same technique,
except this time his ``running mates'' were union workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talk these days about running mates,'' he
told a group of construction workers at the site of the New Federal
Courthouse in Cleveland, his shirtsleeves rolled up. ``I'm proud to
be running with the construction trades and working men and
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his unscheduled show of solidarity with the workers on
his way to a Democratic National Committee fundraiser with almost
50 supporters at the English Oak Inn. It netted $200,000 for the
party.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsing Gore at the Grand River, Sierra Club president Dr.
Robert Cox said Gore, if elected president, would be ``the most
pro-environment president in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You and I know that in the long term there really is no such
thing as a prosperous economy ringed with pollution,'' Gore told
supporters. ``Our opponents still claim that somehow pollution is
the inescapable price of prosperity. They cling to the old way of
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke of his longtime commitment to the environment, which
began when he was a child on his family's farm in Carthage, Tenn.,
and his mother gave him a copy of Rachel Carson's ``Silent
Spring,'' which warned of the dangers of pesticides. He pledged to
fight global warming and pollution as president, and to create jobs
while doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wove the topic on most people's minds throughout his
speech, sometimes more gracefully than others:
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm told in these days leading up to the Republican
convention, Copies of `Earth In the Balance' are selling quite well
in Philadelphia,'' Gore said, referring to the book on the
environment he authored in 1991. ``And I know that the polluters
and the special intersts are coming after me, and I wear their
attacks as a badge of honor!''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has also taken shots at Bush for failing to
conduct his running-mate search with dignity. The frenzy over
Bush's selection of a running mate, Gore spokesman Chris Lehane
said, demonstrated both that Bush was having trouble finding a
suitable partner, and that he lacked sufficient discretion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't turned the process into a sound bite, a photo-op
and a parade,'' Lehane said. ``Bush's (search) is like a frat party
rush. There are different names everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   That point was made less directly by Gore himself, in an
interview with a Grand Rapids Television Monday: ``I have tried to
handle the process in a different way,'' he said. ``And keep it
private.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett dismissed the criticisms Monday as
``more silly attacks from a campaign that can't stop attacking.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Republican convention, Gore will disappear from view.
On Thursday, he heads for the seaside near Wilmington, N.C., for a
weeklong vacation with his family. The Vice President's campaign
workers will make themselves scarce, too _ each campaign usually
allows the other to have its moment in the sun with little
distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Their usual public activities will be taken up by surrogates
coordinated by the Democratic National Committee. The DNC is
currently coralling a slew of members of Congress and other
prominent democrats from around the country to form a kind of rapid
response team, or a ``truth squad'' in current campaign parlance.
They'll be ready to pepper reporters with counterpoints to
Republican messages during the convention, just as the Gore
campaign does the rest of the time.
</P>
<P>
   After the fundraiser, Gore met with members of steelworkers'
unions from swing states across the Midwest, and vowed to protect
their rights to organize and strike. His support among unions is
not unanimous: the United Auto Workers, for one, have withheld
their outright support, flirting instead with Green Party nominee
Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, as he has been saying for over a week, that he
understands voters' disillusion with government, and that he thinks
he can remedy it. He asked the union members to ``take a chance''
on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to ask you to allow yourself to believe, without
reservation, that we can do the right thing in this country and be
the better for it, and not stay back, not stay at arm's length,''
Gore said. ``Don't be afraid and disapointed about being let down _
I will not let you down.''

   BOULDER, Colo. _ After seeing the movie ``Babe'' at age 9 and
realizing the source of what was on her plate, Lauren Pierpoint of
Boulder decided to stop eating meat. At age 6, Nathan Kessel of
Boston was given a choice by his parents between a vegetarian diet
and eating meat regularly; he has been a vegetarian for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   With a finicky toddler who would spit out any type of meat,
Heidi Feldman of Norcross, Ga., decided ``almost overnight'' to put
her entire family on a vegetarian diet. School lessons about
endangered species combined with a visit to the zoo persuaded
7-year-old Laura Grzenda of Boulder to stop eating meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I put a piece of meat in my mouth, I felt like the
animal was talking to me,'' Laura, now 12, said. ``It was saying
`Moo, don't eat me.'''
</P>
<P>
   For Feldman, the choice was a compromise. ``Eating became a
battleground and it was difficult for me to cook two different
meals _ one for the three of us who ate meat and a vegetarian meal
for Nicole,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetarian diets for children have become more accepted in
recent years by some parents, pediatricians, nutritionists and even
the renowned child care authority Dr. Benjamin Spock.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh edition of ``Baby and Child Care,'' published
shortly after his death, in 1998, Spock recommended that a
vegetarian diet begin at age 2, with fortified foods, drinks and
daily vitamin and mineral supplements. Spock believed his own
health improved after he switched to a vegetarian diet late in
life.
</P>
<P>
   Although Spock's push for a nearly lifelong vegetarian diet
generated some controversy among his peers, it did not settle the
matter of whether a meatless diet was ideal at any age,
particularly in children and adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   Yet pediatricians in Colorado and elsewhere said in recent
interviews that they were seeing more children and adolescents
choosing vegetarian diets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say there is definitely a trend toward meatless
diets,'' said Johanna Dwyer, a professor at Tufts University School
of Nutrition and the director of the Frances Stern Nutrition Center
at the New England Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   But Dwyer noted that it was difficult to track the exact number
of vegetarians, and therefore not easy to spot a trend.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll in September 1999 found that 6 percent of adult
Americans considered themselves vegetarian. But an earlier poll
commissioned by Vegetarian Times magazine went a step further to
look at the families of adult vegetarians.
</P>
<P>
   In that poll, conducted in 1992 by Yankelovich, Skelly and
White/Clancy Schulman, 37 percent of the 12.4 million people who
described themselves as vegetarians had children under 18. Of
those, 24 percent had at least one child at home who was also a
vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for choosing a vegetarian diet are varied and
include picky eating, animal rights and environmental activism and
the desire to be ``hip'' within certain peer groups. Parents
sometimes choose the diet for their children, in an effort to
reduce risks of certain illnesses or to adhere to religious or
spiritual beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Pierson, the author of ``Vegetables Rock! A Complete
Guide for Teen-age Vegetarians'' and the mother of a 17-year-old
vegetarian, said she noticed a ``hipness'' factor for many kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to work on a million different levels _ there are
health reasons and animal rights, just a concern for the planet,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The term vegetarian generally means a person who does not eat
meat, and instead favors a diet of foods from plant sources. A
lacto-vegetarian is someone who eats dairy products but no eggs,
meat, fish, poultry or seafood; an ovo-vegetarian eats eggs but no
meat, fish, poultry or seafood; a pesco-vegetarian will eat fish
but no other meat; a pollo-vegetarian eats chicken but no other
meat. One of the more strict diets is the vegan (pronounced
VEE-gun), in which someone eats food only from plant sources and
may also avoid eating honey or taking animal-based supplements and
immunizations or wearing leather clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson's daughter, Phoebe, became a vegetarian at 13 after
seeing an animal rights movie, where she learned the origin of
veal. ``I called it `veal to zeal' and immediately I expected it to
last maybe a week,'' Pierson said.
</P>
<P>
   At Pierson's house in South Salem, N.Y., meal times can be
chaotic with a pot roast for her husband and stir-fried rice with
tofu for her daughter. ``Everybody in the family eats different
stuff, but I try to have some sit-down meals together,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson said her daughter ate a lot of hummus and pita bread, as
well as rice and beans, veggie burgers and noncheese pizza for
meals and bagels, guacamole and fresh fruit for snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts believe these types of healthier eating choices
with low-fat, high-fiber foods should be introduced early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising children as vegetarians has the advantage that we as
adults tend to continue the diet we're raised on,'' said Dr. David
Levitsky, a professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell. ``I
find it almost impossible to make a nutritional argument against
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is some concern that fat or sugar may replace meat in
some children's diets.
</P>
<P>
   The American Dietetic Association has taken the position that
``appropriately planned vegetarian diets are healthful, are
nutritionally adequate and provide health benefits in the
prevention and treatment of certain diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger the children are, the more careful the parents need
to be with their diets, said Dr. Nancy Krebs, co-director of
Coordinated Nutrition Services at Children's Hospital in Denver.
``Growth can easily be impacted, along with energy and nutritional
requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern lies with those who do not get enough protein, vitamins
B12 and D, iron, calcium and zinc in their diets. All of these
nutrients are found in animal sources, in which they are more
easily absorbed by the body. Children need all of those elements
for energy, cognitive thought and achieving maximum growth
potential with proper tissue and bone density. When children are
lacking essential nutrients, they can develop malnutrition,
rickets, anemia and lack of menstruation in girls. They could also
be susceptible to osteoporosis later in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of vegetarian kids who shouldn't be vegetarians,''
said Dr. Johanna Riley, a naturopath who practices in Boulder.
``I'm not seeing swollen abdomens, like you would in Africa or
Kosovo when there is malnutrition, but I'm seeing who kids who are
not vital. I see kids who are really pale, they get sick a lot with
colds, they're tired and don't have good muscle tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Adequate caloric intake is an issue in any diet for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big risk for growing children is getting enough calories
in,'' said Dr. Nanci Grayson, a nutritionist in Boulder, who is
raising her two children as vegetarians. ``Because children have
smaller stomachs, and they need to eat a great deal more bulk of
legumes, nuts, grains, soy, beans and other foods. They might get
full faster and, therefore, be eating less than their bodies
need.''

</P>
<P>
   Vegetarian diets are typically high in fiber, increasing the
risk that nutrients will pass through the body before they are
fully used, and weight loss may occur.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Grzenda of Boulder said she tried to prepare vegetarian
meals for the whole family, but added that she, her husband and
their son looked forward to ``burger nights'' when their vegetarian
daughter, Laura, had a sleepover at friend's house.
</P>
<P>
   Laura acknowledged she was a picky eater, but said she liked
``tofu in soups, pasta, guacamole, burritos'' _ and chicken fingers
with honey.
</P>
<P>
   She said she noticed when she was 8, about a year after going
vegetarian, that she felt weak and tired more often. She and her
mother introduced some fish, chicken and turkey back into her diet.
``Someday I'd like to be a strict vegetarian,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents worry that, unsupervised, their children will fall
back on pizza and bagels.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest unknown, the lunches,'' said Kim Pierpoint
of Boulder, whose daughter has been a vegetarian for four years
now. ``Lauren's favorite things on the school lunch menu are pizza
or nachos.''
</P>
<P>
   To reduce fat in school lunches, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture recently lifted restrictions on how much soy could be
used in federally subsidized lunches. Soy, a popular protein source
in vegetarian diets, can be found in tofu; soy cheese and milk and
other soy foods are also available. Sloppy joes might be replaced
by veggie burgers or tofu-filled ravioli in school lunches.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is the choice of the parent or the child not to eat
meat, there seems to be increasing support, in children's books
with vegetarian characters, in restaurant and school cafeteria menu
choices and in Internet chat rooms. The Vegetarian Resource Group
has recently started a parents' network on its Web site where
people can exchange recipes and advice.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among parents, nutritionists and doctors is that
children need balanced and varied diets, whether they includes meat
or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Data show that young adults who consume a vegetarian diet are
just as healthy or more so than those who are not, and the key is
sufficient variability,'' Levitsky said.

SPORTS COLUMN: ABC'S DEDICATION TO WOODS PAYS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC Sports' broadcast of the British Open provided ample
evidence that it devotedly followed the hitherto secret ``Official
Network Guide to Covering Golf When Tiger Woods Leads the
Tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Rule 1: Don't worry about fairness. Being unfair means showing
him as frequently as possible, and that's why we're in this
business, isn't it? During his final round on Sunday, ABC cut to
Woods 247 times, totaling 69 minutes and 19 seconds of Tiger
face-time. It would have been more but ABC wasted time enduring the
four shots David Duval needed to depart a pot bunker at 17.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 2: It is not impolite to talk about the strategy for
another golfer while the camera stays on Tiger. On the 10th hole,
while ABC's Judy Rankin and Steve Melnyk analyzed the upcoming
second shot for Duval, the camera remained on Woods for 43 seconds
as he sipped water and walked. Perfect execution.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 3: You can dump any golfer, no matter what he's doing, to
go to Tiger. Thomas Bjorn was just starting his backswing _ in an
attempt to blast out of a pot bunker _ when ABC cut to Tiger
marking his ball on the fourth green. Woods then talked to his
caddie, ambled about and watched Duval walk. We never learned what
became of Bjorn.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 4: If Tiger's partner is putting _ or clipping his
fingernails _ include Tiger in the shot. Four times, BBC cameras
used by ABC zoomed out to keep Tiger in the frame with Duval even
though Tiger was walking away and it was Duval's turn to putt.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 5: Avoid showing any other golfer walking. Oh, Duval
occasionally slunk into the shot if it was wide enough. But
invariably, ABC closed in on Tiger as he walked heroically from
green to tee and tee to fairway. When Tiger birdied 10 to extend
his lead to four strokes, ABC followed Woods solo for 25 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ABC/BBC brilliantly followed this rule on the 18th, when a
nearly crazed mob almost overran the fairway, interrupting Woods'
march to the green. It was a dangerous scene. But for a stretch of
1 minute 53 seconds, ABC showed Tiger patiently making his way. For
one brief moment, Duval appeared in the corner of the screen. After
that, he could have been buried up to his goatee in a pot bunker.
Duval was next seen, thankfully healthy, from a high shot taken
from the Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 6: Anything Tiger does is of paramount importance. On the
13th, Duval was lining up his putt. For 19 seconds, ABC believed
his protracted analysis of the green was of secondary importance to
Woods reading his yardage chart. Excellent decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 7: Cut to other golfers, risk your job. A heretic brazenly
felt that a birdie try by Ernie Els on the 10th hole superseded the
importance of a a short Tiger putt on 7 _ an unnecessary gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 8: Do not pre-empt Tiger shots for updates. Don't worry
that Duval's tee shot on the 13th (into a bunker) was shown on tape
when ABC reported on Lance Armstrong's victory in the Tour de
France. Be fortunate that a Tiger shot was not sacrificed to an
update.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's dedication to the Tiger rules contributed to Sunday's 7.5
overnight Nielsen rating, up 32 percent from last year's final
round. When the national rating is calculated, it will rank as the
highest rated British Open since 1972 and will likely have been
seen by more TV households than have ever watched it.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods won the U.S. Open last month, the final round rated
an 8.8, owing in part to the late afternoon broadcast time. The
British Open on Sunday started at 9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, NBC showed 89 minutes of Tiger Face-Time over a
similar four-hour time period, which could have tipped the balance.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMERALL NOT REALLY RETIRING
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to industry reports and a press release by Fox Sports,
Pat Summerall is not retiring from Fox's National Football League
broadcast booth in two seasons. Monday, Summerall and Fox said the
announcer has signed a one-year extension through the 2001 season,
which will let him call the 2002 Super Bowl in his 50th year in pro
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't mean it's a retirement,'' said David Hill,
chairman of the Fox Sports Television Group, refuting a Fox press
release, which said Summerall's ``remarkable and legendary NFL
broadcasting career'' will end with Super Bowl XXXVI. Even
Summerall was quoted as saying his ``NFL broadcasting career is
coming to a close.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is it? It will be up to Summerall to stay in the booth
with John Madden past 2002, take an unspecified job at Fox, or
retire.
</P>
<P>
   By conference call _ not press release _ Summerall said, ``More
than anything, 50 years meant a lot to me.'' He added: ``If I don't
have any health problems, and I feel as good as I feel now and I'm
as enthusiastic as I am now, I may continue.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, Summerall had his left knee replaced, ending years of
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't affect my thinking, but things weren't getting
better, they were getting worse,'' he said. ``That's a
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   HYPE EQUALS RATINGS
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's much anticipated 200-meter race showdown between
Maurice Greene and Michael Johnson at the U.S. track and field
Olympic trials fizzled when both runners pulled hamstrings. But the
hype yielded a strong 7.8 rating from 8:30 to 9 p.m. ET, its final
half-hour, up from a 6.4 for the previous half-hour.

AIRBUS, BOEING ANNOUNCE ORDERS FOR JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle for supremacy of the skies heated up in Britain
Monday when Airbus Industrie announced it had received an order for
its super jumbo jet, the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Co., however, also announced a spate of orders for its
777, the 300- to 350-seat airplane officials at the Seattle-based
company believe will keep the need for 550-seat aircraft low
because the airplane will fragment the market by flying between new
city pairs, like Boston-Tokyo, rather than established trunk routes
like Tokyo-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But when Airbus Industrie announced Monday at the Farnborough
International Air Show outside London that it has orders for 17 of
the A3XX, it signaled the end of Boeing's monopoly of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus said Emirates, the international airline of United Arab
Emirates, placed an order for seven aircraft and options for five
more, for the 550-seat double-deck A3XX. Airbus also announced that
Air France signed a letter of intent to purchase 10 A3XX airplanes,
with options for more. The first A3XX are scheduled to be delivered
in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, Airbus and Boeing have orders worth about $15 billion.
Of those orders, about $11 billion goes to Boeing, including 33 777
models to International Lease Finance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ILFC and Airbus have scheduled a press briefing for Tuesday,
which will likely include new orders for Airbus aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly turning out to be a better year than
anticipated,'' said Mike Bair, Boeing vice president of marketing
management for airplane programs. ``The simple reason is the
economy is doing well and air travel is almost entirely linked to
how well economies around the world are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And Boeing officials also unveiled their annual market forecast
that indicates the market for new planes in the next 20 years will
be worth some $1.5 trillion. Boeing estimates about 55 percent will
be for regional jets and single-aisle aircraft, while the need for
super jumbos represents 6 percent of the total market.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the small demand, Boeing has said it cannot afford to
invest anywhere near the $12 billion to $15 billion that Airbus
will need for developing a new aircraft model.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Boeing plans on offering a derivative of the 747, which
will seat up to 522 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feedback to our future 747 models has been extremely
positive,'' said John Roundhill, Boeing's vice president of
Commercial Airplanes Product Strategy and Development. ``With our
customers, we have developed a wonderful large airplane solution.''
Boeing expects the first 747 derivative to enter service in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the first year that Airbus, the European
consortium, sold more airplanes than Boeing. But the 747
represented a market for which Airbus had no plane to match Boeing.
Now, with the A3XX, that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Emirates said it planned to use the A3XX to accomodate passenger
growth on routes from Dubai to London, the Far East, and North
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The A3XX will also enable us to carry more passengers to and
from congested airports with limited take-off and landing slots,''
said Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum, in an
Airbus press release.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The first spacecraft to probe Mars ended up shattering ages of
myths and delusions. This was no sister planet to Earth lush in
lakes, canals and vegetation, as some astronomers had imagined
after seeing elusive dark patches and white ice caps that seemed to
change with the seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mariner 4, which flew past Mars 35 years ago this
month, snapping 22 close-up photographs, revealed a wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   Scars from cosmic bombardments riddled its surface, implying
that Mars had undergone no erosion by air, seas and churning rock
over the eons. It had no detectable magnetic field, meaning its
core was cooler and less dynamic than Earth's and that its surface
was lashed by radiation. Its atmosphere was found to be so thin
that any liquid water would quickly vaporize.
</P>
<P>
   ``In jarring contrast with our expectations, we had just
discovered a Mars incredibly inhospitable to life,'' recalled Bruce
Murray, then a young planetary scientist and later director of the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, which engineered the
interplanetary trek.
</P>
<P>
   Other probes suggested that eons ago Mars was warm and in some
places wet. But the planet's white poles today turned out to be
mainly dry ice, not water. Slowly, grudgingly, the planet came to
be seen as dead geologically and probably devoid of living things.
</P>
<P>
   Now, rather suddenly, Mars is showing new signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement last month that the orbiting spacecraft known
as Mars Global Surveyor had photographed regions said to have been
cut in modern times by running water is but one of the surprises
emerging from recent detective work.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists, examining Mars rocks hurled to Earth in upheavals,
have found signs that moving water changed the chemical makeup of
the surface terrain in recent eras, and they have concluded that
the Martian crust harbors up to three times as much water as
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Provocatively, experts scrutinizing the close-up photographs of
Mars have also discovered hints of modern volcanism and fiery
eruptions. That suggests the interior of Mars is warmer than
previously thought and might help explain how deep ice could
suddenly melt to form surface flows.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this opens up a much more interesting and diverse planet
than people expected,'' said Dr. William K. Hartmann, an astronomer
at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz. It was his
nine-person team that reported evidence of recent volcanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the discovery,'' he added, ``of an active Mars.'' The
implications of the new findings are being debated, and scientists
urge caution because the assessments are often tentative. Some
doubt flowing water explains the yawning cuts, for instance, and
instead suggest other fluids or flows of mud or hot gas.
</P>
<P>
   But most agree that Mars is showing new signs of heat and
vitality, as well as posing a new set of riddles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence now says it's not dead,'' said Dr. Bruce M.
Jakosky, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado. ``But
we don't comprehend what we're seeing yet, even though we know it's
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Like fuzzy visions of Mars through early telescopes, the hints
of flowing water and heat are fueling dreams of the ultimate
discovery: aliens, not fossils from some long-departed era, but
living ones prospering in secluded habitats, perhaps underground,
tiny and microbe-like.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not crazy to ask if there's oases where life might still
exist'' close to the Martian surface, said Dr. Andrew H. Knoll, a
Harvard biologist who studies early life on Earth and its
possibility elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautions that hunting for such oases will be difficult
because Mars is so far away and the exploratory agenda of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration is already so full
and slowed by recent setbacks. ``It takes time to do these
things,'' Knoll said. ``It has to be step by step.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth H. Nealson, an astrobiologist at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, said aliens were rising on the Mars agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had pretty much given up on life near the surface,'' he
said. ``I was skeptical about whether in my lifetime we could
access any area that would have any possibility of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The new findings, he said, ``change the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shallow drilling is now something we should look into,'' he
added. ``It's a very exciting debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mars is the most Earthlike planet in the solar system and a
close neighbor, being the next world out. It gets less sunshine
than Earth and is relatively cold. Its polar caps and changing
seasons, resulting from an axial tilt like that of Earth's, have
long made it a world of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomer Percival Lowell claimed he had found evidence of
artificial canals and intelligent life, even though his telescopes
showed Mars as little more than a blurry dot. In 1894, he founded
the Lowell Observatory near Flagstaff, Ariz., and for more than a
decade charted dark markings he saw as waterways enveloped by dense
foliage, somewhat like the Nile.
</P>
<P>
   In the century since then, Mars probes like Mariner 4 have let
scientists make millions of close-up observations and discoveries,
including dry river beds hinting at past torrents.
</P>
<P>
   The $300 million Mars Global Surveyor, built by NASA, has been
studying and photographing the remote world for more than two years
even as two sister probes last year vanished while approaching the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   The probe has found dust devils, carbon dioxide snow and signs
of old magnetic fields suggesting the early core was highly active.
</P>
<P>
   The findings have tended to come out piecemeal in papers and
forums, often with little fanfare, so that even Mars experts are
struggling with the tide. ``I can't keep up with it,'' said Dr.
Maria T. Zuber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who is
on a global surveyor science team.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hartmann of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson
and eight colleagues at Cornell, the U.S. Geological Survey and
other institutions reported that Mars was apparently alive
geologically, based on the freshness of some surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   The team examined close-up surveyor images of volcanoes and lava
flows and found that some had a distinct lack of cratering. All the
solar system's planets and moons exhibit impact craters from a
steady rain of cosmic debris, with Earth's scars mostly erased by
ages of erosion. On any body, the absence of craters implies active
resurfacing.
</P>
<P>
   For Mars, the team focused on the extraordinarily wide mouth of
a very young volcano, Arsia Mons. The huge peak, located just south
of the Martian equator, is one of the largest known volcanoes, its
summit 5.6 miles higher than the surrounding plains and its summit
crater, or caldera, 68 miles wide.
</P>
<P>
   The team found that craters were far rarer in the caldera than
on the volcano's outer flanks, suggesting that Mars had been active
as recently as 40 million years ago _ a snap in the planet's life
of five billion years _ and perhaps even more recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crater statistics that we report here suggest that
volcanism is continuing on Mars in current geological time,'' the
scientists wrote Feb. 18, 1999, in the journal Nature. The team
included Dr. Michael H. Carr, one of the world's top Mars experts.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Hartmann said the finding overturned what had
been the conventional view for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people who thought all the volcanism died
out two or three billion years ago,'' he said, adding that molten
rock near the surface might explain the evidence of recent water
flows.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on June 22 in Washington, NASA made public
the signs of flowing water, previewing a paper in the June 30 issue
of Science by Dr. Michael C. Malin and Dr. Kenneth S. Edgett of
Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego, which built the surveyor
camera.
</P>
<P>
   Images of 120 gullies, pits and valleys, they said, suggested
that flows of water had occurred in recent geologic time, perhaps
just hundreds, thousands or millions of years ago, instead of the
planet's early days. The springlike seeps and flows, they added,
``could even be contemporary.''
</P>
<P>
   Close-up images of steep hillsides show gullies and channels
ending in fanlike deltas of soil and rocks, suggesting the flows
formed the deposits. These features are young, the scientists said,
because their surfaces are smooth and light in color, compared with
old regions pocked with craters and covered with dark dust.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists found no link between the sites and known
volcanic regions of Mars. Most flows lie in southern latitudes,
some not far from the south pole. The provocative sites are seen as
having no relationship to warming from sunlight since they often
lie in shadows, making them very cold.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, scientists had estimated that the planet's lingering
internal heat might have kept water liquid in rocky strata a mile
or more below the dry Martian surface. In contrast, Malin and
Edgett said the new evidence suggested that liquid water might lie
as close as a few hundred feet down.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laurie A. Leshin, a geologist at Arizona State University,
recently came to similar conclusions by analyzing a Mars meteorite.
She measured the concentration of the hydrogen isotope deuterium, a
component of so-called heavy water, in the meteorite and concluded
that the Martian crust had two to three times the amount of water
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tiny meteorite with big implications,'' she said in an
interview. ``There's every reason to think we could find water in
the Martian crust today.''
</P>
<P>
   In a different Mars meteorite, Dr. Timothy D. Swindle of the
University of Arizona and seven colleagues found evidence that
water had changed the rock's composition in relatively recent
geologic times. ``It's the youngest evidence for water,'' he said,
adding that all the emerging signs suggest it now lies close to the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the new findings are increasing the possibility that
Martians of one sort or another may be clinging to life on the
dying planet.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade or so, as scientists have discovered a
remarkably rich microbial fauna dwelling deep in the Earth's
interior, miles down, they have theorized that Mars may be similar.
After all, its interior is thought to be wet and warm, potentially
a kind of microbe heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Gold, a distinguished space scientist at Cornell, has
proposed that the solar system might harbor as many as 10 alien
biospheres hidden in deep rocky strata, with Mars at the top of his
list. The problem for human explorers is that such regions are
frustratingly out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the new evidence of surface water and heat is stirring
excitement about the prospect of more accessible habitats and of
humans' some day making contact with living Martians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can imagine episodes in which water comes to the
surface and stays for a while, then you have the possibility that
any life would have a chance to grow and express itself,'' said
Nealson of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``To me as a biologist,
that's very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists agree that the discovery of even a single
extraterrestrial microbe would be a watershed, shedding light on
how life began and the odds of its arising elsewhere in the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exciting,'' Jakosky of the University of Colorado said
of the water evidence and its life implications. ``This is big
news.''

BRUSH FIRE THREATENS INDIAN CLIFF DWELLINGS IN COLORADO
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Colo.)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Five hundred firefighters struggled Monday to get in
front of a blaze that had already burned some 20,000 acres of brush
in the Mesa Verde National Park and was closing in on the park's
famous ancient Indian cliff dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   Fierce winds had already pushed the fire to within four miles of
the 1,000-year-old cliff homes. And Justin Dombrowski, information
officer with the Rocky Mountain Incident Command Team, which is
overseeing the operation, said, ``Even if the flames don't touch
the sites, there is concern for damage from the scorching heat of
the fire.'' The authorities are also concerned about erosion now
that thousands of burned acres lack the brush to soak up rain.
</P>
<P>
   The fire at Mesa Verde _ a 52,000-acre park in far southwestern
Colorado _ was touched off by lightning Thursday. All visitors to
the park, some 700 people, and many park employees were evacuated
that day. But about 50 remaining employees and their families did
not leave until early Monday, after the blaze jumped the access
road, which fire crews felt was safe to use again.
</P>
<P>
   The fire tripled in size on Sunday when a huge plume of smoke
could be seen for miles around and ash rained down on surrounding
towns. By Monday it was nine miles long.
</P>
<P>
   The fire has generally moved to the west, in the direction of
the cliff dwellings. But the wind has been so erratic, and the fire
so dangerous, that the crews have had a hard time getting in front
of the flames to try to halt them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is that it's a very explosive fire, and it's at
the point where they can't do much in front,'' Dombrowski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire is so intense,'' he added, ``that it generates its
own weather, creates its own wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the hardship confronting the crews is the weather:
temperatures there have been in the 80s and 90s, and there is no
rain in the forecast.
</P>
<P>
   After a fire approached the Indian dwellings in 1996, park
workers removed overgrown brush around them. Dombrowski said the
hope now was that this preventive measure would slow the fire and
allow it to be contained.
</P>
<P>
   Park archaeologists learned after the fire in 1966 that there
had been some advantages to it: previously unknown archaeology
sites were uncovered when the pinyon and juniper bushes were burned
away.
</P>
<P>
   But at those sites ``they aren't discovering anything to the
extent'' of the cliff dwellings, Dombrowski said.

MANAGEMENT SHAKEUP AT IBM 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARMONK, N.Y. _ In the seven years since he took over IBM, Louis
V. Gerstner Jr. has led a striking revival in the fortunes of the
world's largest computer company. Yet Gerstner, the chairman and
chief executive, has decided that what the company most needs now
to accelerate its growth and achieve its goal of being the leading
supplier of technology and services for the Internet economy, is a
good shakeup.
</P>
<P>
   So IBM Corp. announced a sweeping management overhaul Monday
that includes elevating Samuel J. Palmisano, a senior vice
president, to president and chief operating officer. The move seems
to make Palmisano, 48, the heir apparent to Gerstner. The
58-year-old Gerstner, who joined IBM in 1993, when the company was
reeling, has an employment contract that calls for him to remain in
charge ``at least until he turns 60 years of age,'' or until March
2002.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy interview here at the company headquarters,
Gerstner acknowledged that the announcement was certain to focus
attention on the issue of management succession at IBM. But he
noted that the elevation of Palmisano was just one of several
promotions of younger executives in the reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new generation of leaders is starting to emerge at IBM,''
Gerstner said. ``And certainly Sam is part of that, but so are a
lot of other people here.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Gerstner noted, he has no intention of stepping back
anytime soon. ``I'm still here,'' he said. ``I'm not going
anywhere, and my job hasn't changed. And the board has not chosen
my successor as CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot you should read into this about me
leaving,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, IBM named John M. Thompson, another senior vice
president, to become vice chairman of IBM. Under the new setup,
Thompson will guide the company's efforts in promising new areas of
growth like wireless communication, network storage systems, life
sciences and Internet software. Yet Thompson is 57 and, given the
IBM tradition of having senior executives retire at about 60, seems
to be a less likely successor to Gerstner than Palmisano. Gerstner
praised Thompson as ``a rare talent,'' and a gifted manager of
technical workers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company promoted five other executives, all in
their 40s.
</P>
<P>
   While Thompson focuses on the future, Palmisano will be in
charge of daily operations in all the company's product and service
businesses. In an e-mail memo to IBM's senior management team
Monday, Gerstner wrote of Palmisano: ``Sam has consistently
demonstrated the aptitude perhaps most critical to leadership
success: He sets tough targets and then meets them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Gerstner said that the reorganization had less
to do with succession than with retooling the company's management
structure to execute its Internet strategy more effectively.
Indeed, the lingering question about the transformation at IBM
under Gerstner's leadership is whether, despite all the progress to
date, it is moving into the future quickly enough to offset the
decline in some of its traditional businesses, like mainframe
computers.
</P>
<P>
   In its second-quarter financial results, reported last week, IBM
beat the earnings estimates of Wall Street analysts, but its
revenues declined.
</P>
<P>
   For the IBM success story to be complete, it must deliver
growing sales. In a bulletin last week to the firm's clients,
Steven Milunovich, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., wrote that
the key to IBM's future as an investment was ``figuring out if IBM
is a new technology or an old technology stock. It's some of both
now.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gerstner's view, the table is set for growth at IBM, based on
its strategy of being a leading supplier to companies trying to
make the transition to e-commerce, which IBM calls ``e-business.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Gerstner noted that revenues for its
e-business consulting grew 78 percent, that its specialized
microchips for cell phones and other wireless communications were
sold out and that it was straining to keep up with demand for the
big hub computers, called servers, that shuttle data from and to
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The company's e-business strategy, set in place over the last
few years, was working as planned, he said. ``The business is
exploding underneath us,'' he said. ``And we need to have a very,
very focused execution capability within the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerstner called Monday's announcement the ``third turn of the
wheel'' in terms of corporate strategy since he took over in 1993.
The first stage he characterized as the survival stage, and the
second involved putting the e-business strategy in place. The
third, he said, was the execution stage. Gerstner, once a partner
at McKinsey &AMP; Co., explained that one of the most important lessons
he learned from ``my McKinsey days'' was the crucial ``linkage
between structure and strategy, and that you really don't implement
an effective strategy without a structure that reinforces and
compliments that strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the shakeup, Gerstner says, was also influenced in part by
one of his more instinctive beliefs about corporate management. ``I
am a big believer in forcing change on large institutions just for
the sake of forcing change,'' Gerstner said. ``The longer an
organization stays intact, the less successful it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been absolutely convinced that you've got to blow things
up and start over again every few years, and that puts a whole new
face on people's jobs. It gets people focused externally rather
than internally.''
</P>
<P>
   The management organization, he explained, is intended to
``sharply delineate'' the two major tasks facing IBM: ``The
execution of today's e-business strategy, which will be led by Sam
Palmisano, and that development _ the rapid development _ of the
new e-business world that John Thompson will lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he joined IBM, Gerstner said that the company,
given its dire straits at the time, did not need a grand technology
``vision'' for its future, a comment that brought waves of
criticism and ridicule from industry analysts. He said he had been
widely misquoted, and that what he had tried to emphasize then was
that the company most needed to right itself before gazing toward
the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   But there seemed to be plenty of talk about vision at the top on
Monday. Gerstner spoke of Thompson's job as helping to guide IBM's
``billions upon billions of dollars'' of investment in
next-generation ``intelligent infrastructure'' for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's networked world is primitive compared to what it's
going to look like in three to five years,'' he said.

   IF CONSIDERING ONLINE THERAPY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Decide whether the Internet is the right setting. If you're in
a crisis or considering suicide, call a mental health hotline
immediately. People who seem to benefit the in writing and who may
feel inhibited by face-to-face meetings.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Always perform a check on any therapist found online. Be sure
the therapist provides you with his or her name, address, telephone
number and credentials. Depending on whether the therapist claims
to be a licensed psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker or
counselor, check the state licensing organization or professional
group for proof (for psychologists, the Georgia Psychological
Association: www.gapsych.org).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Your Web browser should inform you when you are about to enter
a secure or insecure area. If not, ensure that the counselor
informs you of any limits in the security of correspondence and
whether the information is secured by encryption. Remember, your
e-mail at work can be legally read by an employer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Try to find a therapist licensed in your state and whose
liability insurance covers the services provided over the Internet.
This protects both parties.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Prices and methods vary. Know what you're paying and what
you'll get for your money. Most payments are made by credit card.
Make sure the site is labeled secure before you provide a card
number.
</P>
<P>
   USEFUL WEB SITES
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  www.dotcomsense.com. The American Psychological Association
has developed a new site in response to a sharp increase in queries
about Internet mental health sites. The resource provides visitors
with help in assessing online mental health resources and making
health-related privacy decisions on the Net, from sharing personal
information to understanding ``cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  www.metanoia.org. Metanoia, which means ``change of mind,'' is
a private, nonprofit advocacy site that lists dozens of online
therapists and provides guidance on how to pick one and what to
expect. Also offers a ``credential check'' service in conjunction
with mentalhelp.net.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  www.ismho.org. The International Society for Mental Health
Online is a nonprofit professional and consumer group founded in

of Internet therapy. The society recently released guidelines
dealing with such issues as privacy, disclosure of a therapist's
credentials and the promptness of e-mail responses. The group also
created an ongoing online conference devoted to case studies of
Internet therapy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  www.mentalhelp.net. Developed by Internet mental health
pioneer John Grohol, Psy.D., this is one of the most comprehensive

VOICESTREAM'S ANTICIPATION OF GROWTH RIPE FOR DEUTSCHE TELEKOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also VOICESTREAM-DEUTSCH-REACT)

<P>
   As much as anything in Deutsche Telekom's $50.7 billion offer
for the VoiceStream Wireless Corp., the German company is betting
on John Stanton's legacy of building a wireless company with
national reach.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton, VoiceStream's chairman, is a former protege of Craig
McCaw, the creator of the first nationwide cellular network, and
his effort to transform VoiceStream from a relatively small,
money-losing company into a national player will be a key factor in
Deutsche Telekom's effort to expand in the United States as new
wireless technologies come into play.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton's success in attracting a bid for his company that is
nearly five times more than what AT&AMP;T paid for McCaw Cellular
Communications in 1994 has largely been based on going against the
grain of wireless strategies championed by corporate giants like
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   By almost any measure, VoiceStream's short history is indicative
of the window of opportunity in the wireless industry for
executives who know how to leverage a company's strengths. In
VoiceStream's case, its strengths had to do with a prescient bet
made by Stanton on the importance of having enough space to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 30,000 people in the U.S. each day are getting a cell
phone,'' said Mark Lowenstein, head of the wireless practice at the
Yankee Group, a telecommunications research and consulting firm.
``Stanton's being rewarded for his opportunistic efforts to put the
right pieces into place before this type of growth began to
occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar to McCaw Cellular in the late 1980s and early 1990s,
when Stanton was the company's chief operating officer and vice
chairman, VoiceStream was cobbled together from a varied network of
properties that, in a way, resembled a vast jigsaw puzzle. Only in
VoiceStream's case, the growth was more mercurial.
</P>
<P>
   Until May of last year, the company did not even exist. That was
when Stanton spun off digital properties he had begun acquiring
since 1995 from Western Wireless, his other company, into
VoiceStream. Stanton had formed Western Wireless in 1994 in
Bellevue, Wash., his home city, by merging two other companies,
Pacific Northwest Cellular and General Cellular.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton then embarked on an acquisition spree, buying the
OmniPoint Corp. of Bethesda, Md., for $2 billion, and Aerial
Communications of Chicago, for $3 billion. After a few months,
VoiceStream nearly had the national reach to compete with companies
like Verizon, the largest wireless carrier in the United States,
and AT&AMP;T Wireless.
</P>
<P>
   Although VoiceStream is only the nation's eighth-largest
wireless carrier, with about 2.4 million subscribers, it has
licenses to potentially provide service to about 70 percent of the
population. Some of this reach came through its two takeovers last
year, but a substantial part was generated by Stanton's acquisition
of licenses since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the foresight to bid in auctions other people
ignored,'' said Tom Alberg, a former executive at McCaw who worked
with Stanton and now heads the Madrona Investment Group in Seattle.
``He excelled at all the details involved in planning strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise when Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the
world's largest telephone company, sought out VoiceStream with the
intent of acquiring a minority stake. The Japanese company would
have joined Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. of Hong Kong and Sonera of
Finland as minority partners in VoiceStream.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Deutsche Telekom, second only in size only to NTT
among the world's telephone companies, that succeeded in courting
VoiceStream, despite the fact that the company has yet to post a
profit. VoiceStream lost $203 million in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the allure of the company is its choice of technology.
Unlike most other United States wireless carriers, which use
standards like TDMA, or time division multiple access, and CDMA, or
code division multiple access, VoiceStream operates under a
standard called GSM, or global system for mobile communications.
</P>
<P>
   GSM is the predominant standard in Europe, where wireless
services provided by companies like Deutsche Telekom are more
widespread than they are in this country. So, although GSM operates
on a different frequency in the United States, Deutsche Telekom
will have an easier time integrating the company with its network
in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   While the ability to provide subscribers with the opportunity to
``roam,'' or travel from one region or continent to another with
the same cell phone, is undoubtedly important for the companies,
their future clearly lies with next-generation wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   As the wireless Internet becomes more common, companies are
scrambling to provide services beyond the bland applications now
available, like receiving a stock quote or a short text message.
Over the next year or two, faster, more visual applications are
expected to come to the market.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like VoiceStream need additional spectrum that provide
them with the bandwidth needed for such applications. Part of the
deal with Deutsche Telekom would provide it with $5 billion to bid
in coming spectrum auctions to be held by the Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceStream still has gaps in its network in places like
California and the Southeast, so resources from the Deutsche
Telekom deal could also allow it to buy other companies with
operations in those areas. Powertel Inc., which is based in West
Point, Ga., has been mentioned as one takeover target.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the jigsaw puzzle now on a broader basis,''
said Stanton, who would head Deutsche Telekom's mobile operations
in the United States, in a telephone interview. ``I think the goal
now is to be global and wireless.''

 &HT;    Psychotherapy has gone online _ and critics say that's
depressing
 &HT;    By Kirk Kicklighter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the ether of the Internet, you can find friends, have sex or
day-trade, all from the comfort of your home via computer. Now you
can talk to somebody online about your problems, too.
</P>
<P>
   Online counselors and therapists increasingly are providing help
to clients over the Internet, trading face-to-face voices and
gestures for words on the World Wide Web. Known as Internet
therapy, ``e-therapy'' or ``e-counseling,'' the practice seems to
capture the essence of online communication _ anonymity,
convenience and uninhibitedness _ in a therapeutic bottle.
</P>
<P>
   David Stone, a clinical psychologist in San Antonio, swears by
it. He cites the case of a religious man from Indiana who wanted to
save himself for marriage but instead contracted genital warts
while having sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was embarrassed and ashamed, and convinced God was
punishing him for his sin,'' says Stone. ``He didn't know anyone he
could turn to for help.'' Severely depressed, the man logged onto a
Web site, www.concernedcounseling.com, typed in his credit card
number and, within no time, was chatting privately with Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met four times online,'' says Stone, a licensed therapist
for 10 years, who eventually helped the man find traditional
therapy. ``It didn't matter where he was from or where I was from.
What mattered was that he needed support and privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say ``Internet therapy'' is an oxymoron. They define
therapy as the physical act of two or more people gathering in its
name and argue that e-therapy poses too many ethical and legal
problems to be legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really torn about it,'' says Linda Buchanan, clinical
director of the Atlanta Center for Eating Disorders. ``We
definitely wouldn't do it now, because it's so unproven. I'm uneasy
about the lack of physical contact, but I can envision scenarios
where it might work. We'll have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Such questions are why David Nickelson, director of technology
policy and projects for the American Psychological Association,
advises people to first seek face-to-face therapy. ``We still need
research,'' Nickelson says. ``And it may find that there are just
some things therapists and their patients can't do over the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say that 500 to 1,000 Internet ``therapists'' are
chatting with up to 10,000 clients a week worldwide. About.com
estimates that 160 Web sites, from Chicago to Hong Kong, offer
e-counseling. These would-be e-shrinks range from psychiatrists and
social workers to licensed professional counselors and quacks,
which is why would-be clients are advised to first check
therapists' credentials with state licensing offices.
</P>
<P>
   Says Linda Campbell, a psychologist and University of Georgia
associate professor who teaches mental health ethics: ``It's so new
that we haven't come up with any way to regulate it or judge its
efficacy yet. And there are definitely so-called professionals on
the Web who are walking a fine line. They say they aren't
technically doing therapy, but I'll bet it seems that way to the
client.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say e-therapy erases barriers that keep people from
physically visiting a therapist. About 30 percent of people who
make a first appointment for traditional counseling never show up
or never return after one visit, says the APA. Others may live in
isolated areas, be disabled, travel often or fear the stigma of
seeking therapy. The distance of cyberspace also creates a sense of
safety that can lead to a kind of intimacy, advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Williamson, a New York-based Internet communications
specialist, says she contacted an online therapist for depression
in 1995. They exchanged e-mails for two years, an experience she
calls ``profound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit like writing in a journal, except
nformation to therapists. She uses her own voice and body as well,
softening her tone or emphasizing a point while leaning forward.
``How would I do all that on the Internet?''
</P>
<P>
   Also, e-therapists usually don't have access to patient
histories or medical files.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's payment for such services. Online services vary
in format and price, from $25 for a question to $50-$90 for an hour
of chat to $150-$300 for a month of unlimited e-mails. Most clients
pay by credit card. Stone says he makes $45 every half-hour from an
upfront credit card payment, without worrying about insurance
company approval. He chats online with 10 clients a week, in
addition to his office practice. By comparison, an hour of fned to
run from Helen to Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Growth landscape
</P>
<P>
   changing in Forsyth
</P>
<P>
   Forsyth County's planning commission will get together Tuesday
for the first time since its county commission was revamped by
voters last week. In replacing bickering politicians, voters in one
of the nation's fastest-growing counties were apparently sending a
message that someone needs to get the pace of construction under
control. The chairman and a post commissioner lost to political
newcomers. Ironically, an initiative passed by the sitting
commission in May will likely delay a couple of rezoning proposals
from a scheduled hearing this week. Forsyth commissioners voted to
require developers to make an effort to work out differences with
nearby residents. Developers are supposed to file a plan for the
discussions when they apply for rezoning. And 10 days before a
planning commission hearing, they're supposed to file a progress
report on those discussions. Marrett Properties, which plans a
223-acre mixed-use project on Browns Bridge Road, didn't make the
deadline, and its hearing will probably be put off a month. Ditto
for Riverbrooke Properties, which wants to build 246 houses on 209
acres on Old Atlanta Road. These are the first rezoning
applications to get bounced by the new rule.

 &HT;    Die-hard Limp Bizkit fans toe the line for free concert
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Morning commuters to downtown got a surprise Monday:
Thousands of suburban teens and twenty-somethings snaked around
nearly four city blocks, in chairs, on blankets or just sitting on
the sidewalks. Each wanted to be in the crowd Monday night for Limp
Bizkit's just-announced free concert at the 2,500-capacity
Tabernacle.
</P>
<P>
   Free?
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Napster, the online music-file-sharing software
company, the entire tour _ which started July in Detroit and ends
Aug. 14 _ is free. Part payback to its most faithful users and
reward to its most vocal spokesmen, the event is being paid for
primarily by Napster (to the tune of a reported $1.8 million) and
the Firm (Limp Bizkit's management). It's also perfectly timed to
build the buzz for the rapcore quartet's scheduled fall release,
``Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water.''
</P>
<P>
   When the band's frontman, Fred Durst, announced the tour on MTV,
he offered one rationale behind the convergence of Napster and Limp
Bizkit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could care less about the older generation's need to do
business as usual,'' Durst stated. ``We care more about what our
fans want, and our fans want music on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how it's been working: The tour's venues are announced
24 to 48 hours in advance on Napster's Web site and a local radio
station (in Atlanta, it was modern rock station 99X). Wristbands
are given away the day of the show _ one per customer. Atlanta fans
got the word Thursday and started queueing Saturday afternoon. By
Monday morning, the line snaked from the Tabernacle on Luckie
Street, down Spring and back to Cenntennial Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   Servicemen Chris Stiles, 22, and Victor Morales, 21, took time
off from the Naval Air Station in Smyrna to be first in line. They
arrived about 4 p.m. Saturday and waited while two other shows _
Kottonmouth Kings on Saturday and the Spitkicker Tour on Sunday _
came and went. ``We've been living on Vienna sausage and Beenie
Weenies,'' said Stiles on Monday morning, ``and going to the
bathroom anywhere we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Campers brought coolers, blankets, towels, folding chairs,
pillows and even a removable car seat. Tim Evans and Tracy
Nicholson of Smyrna got to the Tabernacle at 5 a.m. Sunday, set up
camp near the front of the line and survived a Sunday afternoon
downpour. ``We had a tent,'' Nicholson said, ``but we took it down
because it was drenched.''
</P>
<P>
   A big fan of the band's rap-rock hybrid _ the couple have seen
the band twice _ Nicholson was nevertheless a minority. There were
women in line, but they were far outnumbered by young men, Limp
Bizkit's core audience. (At Woodstock '99, thousands of Bizkitheads
turned the band's rendition of their anarchic anthem ``Break
Stuff'' into a melee.)
</P>
<P>
   In the hour before the wristbands were handed out, some in the
crowd were getting a little bit rambunctious _ but closer to the
front, folks were mostly looking haggard. ``I tried to sleep,''
said Corey White, 17, of Dunwoody. ``But this place is like a trash
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right about the mess. When the gaps in the line closed
up, the streets looked like a tornado had torn through a garbage
dump. City cleanup crews had the streets back to normal by noon.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans would find that their experience wouldn't be as free
as they thought. Wreckers were lining up, towing away illegally
parked vehicles, as the crowd vainly chanted, ``Give it back!''

NORTEL PLANS TWO MAJOR PLANTS IN MASSACHUSETTS

 STATE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world leader in the red-hot optical networking market is
investing $1.9 billion to stay out in front of rivals, and a large
part of that investment will be spent in the Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's Nortel Networks Corp. said Monday it will build two
major facilities in Wilmington and Billerica and hire about 1,800
workers to staff them. The plants are part of a massive worldwide
expansion by Nortel, aimed at locking down its lead in the market
for systems that use pulses of light to transmit information much
faster than traditional copper wires.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion will build upon recent Nortel investments in
Massachusetts. Nortel picked up its Billerica site as part of its
1998 acquisition of Bay Networks Inc. for $7.2 billion in stock.
And just last month, the company paid out $1.43 billion in stock to
acquire CoreTek Inc. of Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Chahram Bolouri, president of global operations for Nortel, said
that the company will build a 100,000-square-foot addition at the
CoreTek plant, which will employ 775 people. CoreTek manufactures
tunable lasers that are capable of sending multiple frequencies
along the same fiber. In addition, it will build a new ``optical
system house'' in Billerica to put together entire systems that
will employ 1,050 people.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, Nortel presently employs about 2,500 people in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   When the 18-month expansion is complete, Nortel expects to have
doubled its production of optical networking systems. ``We are
fueling much of the demand for optical components and have been an
industry leader in this market for some time, so it makes sense for
us to aggressively pursue growth opportunities,'' said Nortel CEO
John Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Those opportunities have grown in tandem with the rapid increase
in Internet use. ``Electrical systems don't have the capacity to
handle the kind of traffic the Internet has created,'' said Thomas
Valovic, who studies the optical networking market for
International Data Corp. ``All of the big pipes need to get
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nortel equipment achieves this through a technology called
dense wavelength division multiplexing, or DWDM. With this process,
a pair of optical fibers, each the width of a human hair, can
transmit 10 billion bits of data every second.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies offer similar technologies, but Nortel has
managed to secure a dominant position in the marketplace. According
to the investment firm of Robertson Stephens, the market for
optical networking equipment will grow to $23.6 billion this year,
and Nortel is expected to garner about 46 percent of this market.
The company's nearest rival, New Jersey-based Lucent Technologies
Inc., will hold just a quarter of the market.
</P>
<P>
   News of the Nortel expansion campaign came as the Wall Street
Journal reported that the company is in talks to combine its
optical networking product line with that of Corning Inc. The
combination could be worth more than $100 billion, the newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts cited concerns that Corning shareholders emerge with
just a minority stake in the new firm, and said that could be a
major obstacle to a deal. ``I would evaluate the probability of
such a transaction occurring at less than 50-50,'' analyst Lawrence
Harris of Josephthal &AMP; Co. said.
</P>
<P>
   Some expect a merger between Corning and Nortel might be driven
by other consolidation in the industry. Earlier this month, for
instance, optical-components maker JDS Uniphase Corp. said it would
pay $41 billion for another Silicon Valley company, SDL Inc.
Corning lately has emphasized the production of fiber-optic cables
using thousands of strands of glass. Wall Street has been
enthusiastic about the shift, driving up Corning's shares sharply
since last year to give it a market capitalization of nearly $70
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Using that currency, Corning has spent more than $5 billion,
mostly in stock, to buy Massachusetts fiber firms. Since last year
it has taken control of Oak Industries in Waltham, NetOptix of
Natick, and NZ Applied Technologies of Woburn.
</P>
<P>
   It also plans to expand manufacturing capacity at its Bedford,
Mass.-based Lasertron unit to create 1,150 more jobs, though
Corning hasn't determined where those positions will be located.
</P>
<P>
   But Corning competitors like Lucent and Italy's Pirelli still
make more of the high-margin equipment used to transmit data
signals across fiber lines; some analysts see the gap as an
appropriate opportunity for a deal between Corning and Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's much more value if either of these companies can
deliver these optical products as an end-to-end business
solution,'' said Sanjay Mewada, director of Yankee Group Inc.'s
telecom e-business practice. Depending on its final structure, he
said, for Nortel a deal could ``fill out the gaps in its
portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, Nortel shares fell
81.25 cents to close at $80. The shares have more than tripled in
the past year. Corning shares tumbled $34.75 to close at $249.

   ATLANTA - Twenty-seven years ago, offense was in such decline
that the American League stooped to instituting the designated
hitter. But here in Atlanta, the Braves put on a three-man
pyrotechnic demonstration that endured almost the rest of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   Davey Johnson, who never before or after the 1973 season even
reached 20 homers, Hank Aaron, who broke Babe Ruth's record early
the next year, and Darrell Evans all reached 40 home runs that
season.
</P>
<P>
   Their mark, equaled in Colorado in 1996 and 1997, is being
threatened by several teams this year, and surprisingly, the Braves
are one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a chance,'' objected Andruw Jones, the Braves
home-run leader with 25. ``Now, Toronto, they have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   As does Anaheim. But the Blue Jays have an opportunity to become
the first club with four players with 40. Toronto is destined to
put up the best four-man totals in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying back in spring training that we got five guys in
the lineup that can hit over 30,'' said Galarraga, part of both
Colorado clubs that matched the Braves' mark. ``Guys can do it
anytime. They can go on line drives, solo shots, opposite field.
It's more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1973, only five Atlanta players have reached the 40-homer
mark _ Chipper Jones, 45 in 1999; Dale Murphy, 44 in 1987;
Galarraga, 44 in 1998; Jeff Burroughs, 41 in 1977; and David
Justice, 40 in 1993. ``We have the ability to manufacture runs,''
Chipper Jones said. But I think the three guys we have up in the
20s right now, they're more concerned with picking up runners in
scoring position, regardless of how they do it, whether it be a
homer or a bloop single.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, if you had two guys hit 40 in the whole league,
that was a big deal,'' said Braves coach Glenn Hubbard. ``That was
just one of those seasons. The other guys were going to hit theirs,
but (Johnson) didn't miss one of his pitches. He hit every ball
you're supposed to hit.'' ``I don't think anybody on this team has
a goal that they want to hit 40 home runs,'' Andruw Jones said.
``Whatever home runs we hit, when the season's done, that's what we
get.''

<P>
   CINCINNATI - The scar on the inside of Mark Wohlers' right elbow
is about five inches long. The emotional scars that helped plunge
his baseball career into an abyss were even bigger. Now, both
appear to be fading as Wohlers' future brightens.
</P>
<P>
   A year after undergoing ligament-replacement surgery and two
years after mysteriously losing his ability to throw strikes,
Wohlers is back in the major leagues. This time, batters are
swinging and missing, rather than ducking.
</P>
<P>
   Once out of control on the mound and a nervous wreck at times
off it, Wohlers is on target physically and emotionally. The former
Atlanta Braves closer, in a comeback with the Cincinnati Reds, is
getting batters out and smiling again. It has been a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say I'm all the way back, because who knows
what's in the future,'' Wohlers, 30, said. ``Right now, it feels
good to be out there pitching again like I knew I could. It's been
a long road.''
</P>
<P>
   On and off the field. Wohlers was going through a difficult
divorce when his control problems began with the Braves in 1998.
Now, his personal life is a source of joy. He will be married to
Kimberly Serrone in November. His daughter, Austyn, who turns four
years old next month, visits him frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I love baseball, and worked to come back, the game
isn't my whole life anymore,'' Wohlers said. ``I don't live and die
with it like I did. Nothing on a baseball field can compare with
the pain of not being able to see your daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball isn't the only thing that makes me happy now. I get
fulfillment out of being a good father and, eventually, a good
husband. My life is so much better. I could live without baseball
now.''
</P>
<P>
   But it looks as if he won't have to. Pitching in the majors for
the first time in 15 months, Wohlers struck out the first two
batters he faced and pitched two perfect innings in Houston on
Thursday. He followed that up with two more scoreless innings at
home against Arizona on Saturday, when he worked out of a
bases-loaded jam. When Wohlers misses the strike zone now, it's by
inches, not feet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Wohlers says he almost gave up his comeback attempt last
fall, when he stopped his rehab for about a month. Then he thought
about the message that quitting would give his daughter eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want her to learn it's never OK to quit,'' Wohlers said.
``You can be at the bottom. If you don't get back, that's one
thing. If you don't try, it's another.''
</P>
<P>
   Placed on the disabled list because of ``anxiety disorder''
after he was acquired from Atlanta in April 1998, Wohlers blew out
his elbow that June while on a rehab assignment in the minors. He
had more than his control to worry about. Pitchers usually take 12
to 18 months to make it back from so-called Tommy John surgery..
</P>
<P>
   But when Wohlers reported to training camp with the Reds this
spring, the change was apparent immediately. From the beginning, he
threw naturally again. It was just a matter of rebuilding the
strength in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   He made 20 appearances in the minors, 17 of them at Class AAA
Indianapolis. The results were not always what he had hoped, but
his control was good and his fastball hit 97 mph at times. Few in
the majors threw harder. He is also regaining command of his slider
and splitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark has worked really hard,'' Reds pitching coach Don Gullett
said. ``He's having fun again, and he deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   With Scott Williamson now in the rotation, Cincinnati could use
someone to help Danny Graves close games. Wohlers, whose last save
came more than two years ago, might be the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been great so far,'' Reds manager Jack McKeon said. ``A
year ago, no one wanted to take batting practice against him. Now,
everything he throws is right around the plate. It makes you wonder
if part of his problem wasn't the elbow all the time. Maybe it
wasn't just his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he is careful not to think too much about his painful
past, Wohlers also can't help but wonder when his elbow problems
began and how they affected his control problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long, a lot of people said, `It's in your head. It's in
your head.' Eventually, after you keep throwing the ball 45 feet or
145 feet, certainly nowhere near 60 feet, it's going to get to your
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think a quick trip to an orthopedic surgeon, instead of
a head doctor, where the Braves were sending me constantly, might
have stopped the bleeding a little bit sooner. But that doesn't
really matter now.''
</P>
<P>
   After his successful return to the majors in Houston, the first
person Wohlers called was his fiancee, Serrone, a real-estate agent
in metro Atlanta. She and Austyn were in Cincinnati on Saturday
when Wohlers made his first appearance for the Reds at Cinergy
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to have them both here,'' Wohlers said. ``My
fiancee is a very special person, and my daughter means so much to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the past, I had the approach that if I did well, I would be
in a good mood, and if I did poorly, I would be in a bad mood,'' he
said. ``Now, it's just part of my life. I mean I love baseball
dearly. It has been with me since I was six years old. But it's not
everything. I understand that now. I'm not just a baseball
player.''

 &HT;    Woods continues to amaze, with endless possibilities in sight
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Too often in the wake of one or the
other of his fabulous shows, it seems the Tale of Tiger Woods is
written against the backdrop of history or the vagaries of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   How strange.
</P>
<P>
   That he is, after Sunday's stunning British Open victory at St.
Andrews, in possession of all four of golf's major championships is
amazing. That as a 24-year-old he is the youngest holder of the
career Grand Slam _ victories in the Masters, U.S. Open, British
Open and PGA Championship _ is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   And comparison of Woods' record at this stage of his life to
Jack Nicklaus' records at the same stage of his is fun. So is
extrapolating what Woods has done in his sport's headline events
and measuring the possibilities opposite the pace Nicklaus set on
the way to winning a monumental 18 professional major titles.
</P>
<P>
   What gets lost in all of that is what's happening right now. Not
so much what's happening to Woods, but to the poor souls trying to
compete against him in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Woods stands with Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and
Nicklaus as the only men to win golf's four most important
tournaments? Wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Woods could demolish the standard of excellence established by
Nicklaus? Again, wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   But how about an examination of Woods vs. his peers?
</P>
<P>
   Woods has won each of the majors once, and is currently holding
the title in all of them except the Masters. How dominant is he?
There are by my count only four players 35 or younger who have won
more than one major _ Lee Janzen, John Daly, Jose Maria Olazabal
and Ernie Els.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen turns 36 next month, and Daly and Olazabal are both 34.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen's two majors have both come in the U.S. Open. The same is
true for the 30-year-old Els. Olazabal's two majors have both come
in the Masters. That leaves Daly (PGA Championship, British Open)
as the only player under 35 with major titles in different
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   More startling still is the fact that 28-year-old Justin
Leonard, with a single British Open title, is the only player under
30 other than Woods to win even one major.
</P>
<P>
   The players generally regarded as the three best who haven't won
a major championship _ 28-year-old David Duval, 30-year-old Phil
Mickelson and 37-year-old Colin Montgomerie _ must realize by now
how drastically Woods' presence reduces their chances of ever
getting one.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus frequently has made the point that Woods' greatest
challenger might well turn out to be someone yet to make any mark
on professional golf. He should know. Nicklaus is the only player
to have won each of the four majors more than once (he has a career
Grand Slam triple), and was 26 when he completed the first series
with a victory in the 1966 British Open.
</P>
<P>
   The two players who subsequently became the greatest threats to
Nicklaus' reign were Johnny Miller and Tom Watson.
</P>
<P>
   In that summer of 1966, Miller and Watson were teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither ever conquered Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to imagine anyone doing it to Woods, either.

 &HT;    Circumstances in '92 Senate election have similarities to today
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Before taking off full-wing into the race to succeed
him, it's worth recalling the unusual circumstances under which
Paul Coverdell got to the Senate in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He'd been weakened, seemingly, by a bitter primary battle with
Bob Barr, and came up about 35,000 behind incumbent Democrat Wyche
Fowler on the same day Georgia voted, by a narrower margin, for
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In another state, that would have been the end of the story, but
the presence of three other candidates in the race meant Fowler was
forced into a runoff with Coverdell, right before Thanksgiving,
when the Democrats were shopping for turkey and the Republicans
were just getting their mad on about the new administration.
Coverdell won a low-turnout race by 17,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Here we are in another presidential year, with a non-partisan
primary to succeed the late Republican senator.
</P>
<P>
   If this were a regular Senate race, the winner would need to get
only 45 percent, because the rules were changed after the Coverdell
upset.
</P>
<P>
   But non-partisan primaries still require a runoff if no one gets
a majority.
</P>
<P>
   This makes the political task ahead for Zell Miller pretty
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has everything going for him in this race: Gov. Roy
Barnes' blessing, speedy access to campaign money, a potentially
divided Republican field, perhaps the most recognizable political
name in the state.
</P>
<P>
   He is the one Democrat who might figure to win an outright
victory on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   He had better do that, or he will have to come back and win a
runoff on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, when there will be no
Democratic get-out-the-vote effort on the scale of the presidential
election. And when whichever Republican is left standing will be
shouting, ``Remember '92.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have a mechanism, through Barnes's appointment,
for arriving at a nominee in this race which is nonpartisan in name
only. The Republican do not, and there is high anxiety over the
ripple effect if more than one GOP House member decides to get in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   The upside to Miller's appointment, said state Republican
chairman Chuck Clay, is that his presence may cause the Republicans
to gel more quickly around a single candidate _ something he
devoutly wishes will come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Unifying behind a single Republican is ``the only way we will
hold on to that seat. No ifs, ands or buts,'' Clay said.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP isn't going to get national financial help if it can't
focus on one candidate, Clay said. On the other hand, the greater
the number of Republicans on the Nov. 7 ballot, the harder it could
be for Miller to capture a majority.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Republicans defy expectations and field just one
candidate, we have not yet heard from the Greens, the Reforms or
the Libertarians. Or from some maverick Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger the field, the larger Miller is going to look
standing in it. But any combination that denies the former governor
an outright majority raises the dread specter of a
post-Thanksgiving rematch - which is how we got here to begin with.

GORE URGES UNITY AMONG UNIONS AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ohio, Ill.)   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. _ With three weeks left before the
Democratic National Convention, Vice President Al Gore turned his
focus Monday to uniting two important Democratic groups that have
at time been at odds: environmentalists and labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   At an event on the tree-lined banks of the Grand River, Gore
picked up the endorsement of the Sierra Club, one of the most
politically potent environmental groups in the country. But the
audience was filled with union workers, and Gore devoted much of
his speech to assuring them that strong environmental policies
would not necessarily hurt companies and their workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here today to tell America that as we move toward a
cleaner, safer healthier environment, we are going to create more
jobs, not fewer jobs for American families,'' Gore told the crowd
of nearly 200 people. ``A stronger economy and better environment
go together.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is trying to win the endorsement of the United Auto
Workers, a political powerhouse in this closely contested state.
The group's leaders have been angry with the vice president over
his strong support for global trade. And some union leaders also
worry that administration policies intended to reduce air pollution
and slow global warming could drive up the cost of cars and hurt
the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, Gore has had several conversations with
Stephen Yokich, the UAW president, to try to work out their
differences, Democratic officials said. Gore's aides are hoping
that the union's executive committee will vote to endorse him at
its next meeting, on Aug. 8, six days before the Democratic
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, Gore also took a poke at Gov. George W. Bush,
his Republican opponent, for attracting intense media attention to
his efforts to choose a running mate. Gore suggested that the Texas
governor had played out his deliberations in public to build
excitement about his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've handled my process differently than the Bush campaign has
handled theirs,'' Gore told reporters. ``I've kept it private and,
I hope, dignified out of respect for the individuals, the men and
women, who are under consideration. And I am going to continue to
approach it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   But just minutes before, in what seemed like a clear attempt to
stoke interest in Gore's own deliberations, the vice president's
aides notified reporters that he would be meeting on Tuesday
morning with Warren Christopher, who is helping Gore cull his list
of potential running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what qualities he was looking for in a running mate, Gore
replied, ``I'm going to pick the person who I believe can become
the president on a moment's notice, if necessary. Who also has a
good working relationship with me, or the prospect of one. And who
shares my values, someone who's willing to fight for people and not
the powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he was still considering announcing his pick
immediately after Bush unveiled his, but added that he was more
likely to reveal his choice several days before the Democratic
convention, which begins on Aug. 14. He added that his list was
``short,'' but he would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   After his Sierra Club event Monday, Gore flew to Ohio, where he
campaigned at a construction site and then met with steelworkers
and the head of the state's police union in Cleveland. On Tuesday,
he will give a speech in Washington hailing the Americans With
Disabilities Act. And on Wednesday, he flies to Chicago to address
the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Robert Cox, the president of the Sierra Club, picked
up on a theme Gore has been sounding recently, arguing that Bush's
record as governor of Texas proved that he would support federal
policies that would help corporate polluters and ruin the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fail to elect Al Gore, if George Bush becomes president,
we could face a very different America,'' Cox said. ``We could face
what the people of Texas face now. Air pollution, water pollution,
toxic waste, record numbers of violations of our clean air and
clean water standards. Environmental laws unenforced and corporate
polluters unchecked and out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks at the Sierra Club event, Gore said he had been
ahead of his time in understanding environmental problems, having
learned about the dangers of pesticides and soil erosion as a boy
on his father's farm in Tennessee and about global warming as a
college student.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Gore said, ``If you believed in global warming,
people thought you were part of the flat earth society.''

NEW YORK GRAND JURY INDICTS 16 IN BASEBALL TICKET-SELLING SCAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They may not patrol the outfield like Bernie
Williams, or strike out batters like Mariano Rivera. But the ticket
agents at Yankee Stadium have some raw power of their own: Their
kiosks are the first stop for fans who want to see their World
Series winners in action.
</P>
<P>
   And as the Yankees have prospered in recent years as the
dominant team in baseball, so, too, have some of the ticket agents,
according to prosecutors, who say agents capitalized on the huge
demand for tickets to divert some to scalpers in return for bribes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, at some of the most popular games _ including
opening day and Old-Timers' Day _ the agents at the kiosks told
fans the games were sold out. But while some fans went home
disappointed, others were able to buy tickets at four times the
regular price from scalpers who hustled them nearby or in the
stadium parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the scheme, the ticket agents went home richer,
Manhattan and state prosecutors said Monday, one driving an
eight-cylinder BMW, another sinking money into a Hamptons beach
house, though they only earned about $30,000 a year in their
regular job.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that seven ticket agents employed by the
Yankees, and one who worked for the Mets, were involved in the
scheme, in which they diverted blocks of tickets to unscrupulous
scalpers. In some cases, $35 playoffs tickets were scalped for
$140, while $150 World Series tickets were scalped for $1,000,
according to investigators, some of whom posed as brokers and
bought the tickets from agents involved in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exactly the unholy, illegal alliance between box-office
workers and unlicensed brokers which conspires to shut out the real
fans from being able to get a ticket to a playoff game,'' said
Eliot L. Spitzer, the state attorney general, whose office worked
with the Manhattan district attorney on its investigation. ``It
doesn't matter how long fans wait on line or how many times they
call. Thanks to bribery at the box office, the tickets are gone
even before they go on sale.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, 16 people have been indicted in the scheme, 10 of whom
were arrested at Yankee Stadium on Sunday before and during the
home game, investigators said Monday. Among the tickets agents
arrested were the president and a senior officer of Local F-72 of
the ticket agents' union. There is no evidence the union itself was
involved in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees and Mets officials, who said the teams were cooperating
fully with the investigation, referred questions Monday to the
Manhattan district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' chief operating officer, Lonn Trost, added that the
team had appointed a new acting ticket supervisor and planned to
overhaul its system of ticket sales. ``We will be working
internally, with professionals and with Ticketmaster, to make sure
that fans are adequately protected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Through the loosely organized scalping ring, which prosecutors
say operated for more than five years, ticket agents sold thousands
of tickets to unlicensed brokers in blocks under false group names.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that the scheme's ringleader, Stephen Mootoo,
41, bribed one Yankees ticket agent to sell him blocks of season
and partial-season tickets, which then guaranteed him a large
number of seats to scalp at the most popular games, including those
against traditional rivals like the Boston Red Sox and the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Mootoo, who lives in Manhattan, bought a total of $300,000 in
tickets, charging them to the credit cards of his girlfriend and
others, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a ticket agent sold 300 season tickets under the
name of Linden's Cookies Inc., a company in Congers, N.Y., that
bought no tickets and employs only 30 people. ``We could bring all
of our families and we wouldn't need that many,'' said John Kramer,
the company's sales manager. ``I guess these guys weren't as smart
as they thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the ticket brokers, known by the group as the ``Three
Amigos,'' worked out a deal with ticket brokers that allowed them
to return any tickets they couldn't scalp. As a result, tickets for
some games that were supposedly sold out ``magically'' appeared,
said one person who was briefed by investigators.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Monday about the difference between a reputable
ticket broker and an unlicensed one, Daniel Castleman, chief of
investigations for the Manhattan district attorney said, ``Most
reputable brokers work out of their office and not their station
wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that the investigation resulted from complaints
by a fan, who before a game bought a ticket from a scalper who was
selling them near one of the kiosks at Yankees stadium. After the
game, the fan returned to the advance ticket window to buy tickets
for subsequent games, and found that the ticket agent behind the
window, James Hirsch, was the same scalper who had sold him a
ticket just hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The fan testified before a grand jury and made the jurors ``so
angry'' about the scalping, recalled the person who was briefed by
investigators. ``He told stories about how obnoxious Hirsch was,
how he berated people at the window who wanted tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his lawyer could not be reached for comment, Hirsch
pleaded not guilty Monday and his bail was set at $25,000,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors characterized the tickets agents as young and
brazen, in some cases cold-calling brokers to offer their services
in diverting tickets for a price. They said that some pulled in
``tens of thousands'' in profits through the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Handwerker, a lawyer representing one of the ticket
agents, called the prosecutors' allegations ``overblown'' and said
that the investigation was actually started two years ago by
Yankees' officials, who hired private detectives to examine
allegations of fraudulent ticket sales by one ticket agent in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Why why did the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M.
Morgenthau, handle a case involving Yankee Stadium, which is in the
Bronx? Morgenthau said Monday that the home plate at the Bronx
stadium fell within his jurisdiction, because it is less than 500
yards from the water mark that divides the Bronx from Manhattan.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Reinventing or in some cases abandoning the
rituals of party gatherings past, the Republican National
Convention that begins on Monday will more than ever amount to a
lavish multimedia spectacle that pushes controversy to the
sidelines in favor of an unabashed celebration of the goals and
vision of the party standard-bearer, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Those expecting angry debate on issues like abortion, gun
control and school prayer will be sorely disappointed. In its
place, the convention will beam ``compassion videos'' onto three
high-tech screens hanging over the stage in the First Union Center
here. They will document the healing power of social programs in
places like Cleveland and El Paso, Texas, that were developed with
little or no government support.
</P>
<P>
   Missing, too, from the rostrum will be the usual parade of
elected officials introducing other elected officials for the kinds
of lengthy speeches that act as television-audience repellent. A
few politicians will still have oratorical roles, and it will still
be the remarks by Republican stars like former Gen. Colin L. Powell
and Sen. John McCain of Arizona that are likely to dominate the
window of network news coverage that on most nights will open at
about 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But most other speeches will be five minutes or less and mere
embroidery for each evening's elaborate ``story line'' modeled on
Bush's proposals for education, defense and Social Security and
featuring ordinary Americans talking about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Officials even say the Republican whipping boy, President
Clinton, may rarely be invoked. ``This convention really is about
George Bush,'' said Andy Card, general co-chairman and chief
conceptualizer of the $63 million event. ``Other conventions were
more about the party and less about the candidate. This on every
single night is about Governor Bush. It's about what he stands for.
It's about people who symbolize what he stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   If political conventions long ago stopped picking nominees and
started selling them, the Republicans are intent this summer on
refining the tone of the sales pitch and imposing an unparalleled
degree of message discipline on the proceedings. They are able to
attempt this thanks to an extraordinary level of solidarity this
year. The Republican base is so firmly in Bush's corner, organizers
say, that they have less worries than the Democrats about
reassuring party regulars.
</P>
<P>
   That has freed them to tailor their appeal during the four-day
convention more directly to Democrats and independents. Though Card
says that some speakers will pointedly contrast Republican and
Democratic policies, the accent will remain on the positive. Even
the convention's slightly abstract theme _ ``Renewing America's
Purpose. Together.'' _ has the ring of gentle, communal
housecleaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense that one thing was to make this not about
the party, but about the issues the party stands for,'' said
Russell Schriefer, a Bush media consultant who produced the videos
for the convention. ``To make it broader, and more inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   The unanswered question in this serving up of politics on a
satin pillow is whether anyone beside the delegates, the news media
and Bush's extended family will pay much attention. Lacking any
``story line'' with inherent conflict, the Republican proceedings
are in danger of being dismissed as irrelevant by much of the
public. In a recent poll by Harvard's Vanishing Voter project, 43
percent of respondents said they would not tune into the political
extravaganza here, while 38 percent said they would not watch the
one staged by Democrats in Los Angeles next month.
</P>
<P>
   In unorthodox ways, the organizers, aware of the public's waning
enthusiasm, are trying to turn the four-day convention into better
television. It is a strategy that Card, an ebullient Massachusetts
Republican who served as transportation secretary under Bush's
father, himself calls ``high risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great challenges,'' Card said, ``is to get people
to pay attention to the convention who were turned off by past
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The language of television seeps into almost every conversation
about what will transpire in the First Union Center, where workers
are affixing the stars-and-stripes motif to the stage and finishing
the installation of 330 speakers, 650 lights and 6,600 miles of
fiber-optic cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view this as a mini-series that has to be told over four
nights,'' Card said, referring to the themes that will roll out in
nightly installments, like ``Strength and Security with a
Purpose,'' on the second night, which also happens to coincide with
the 10th anniversary of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the impetus for
Operation Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the evening will include a remote transmission from the
deck of the USS New Jersey, anchored on the New Jersey side of the
Delaware River, where former Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf will talk
by satellite to the conventioneers. The episode has an added
potential advantage of reminding voters of the high-water mark of
the senior Bush's term in the White House. The second night will
also play off the notion of America's strength in other areas, like
trade policy.
</P>
<P>
   Card said the nightly themes were enlargements of signature
issues for Bush, as derived from his stump speeches. Monday's theme
is ``Opportunity with a Purpose: Leave No Child Behind''; on
Wednesday, ``Prosperity with a Purpose''; and Thursday, when he
delivers his acceptance speech, ``President with a Purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of doing `bio' just on one night, we're doing `bio'
throughout,'' is how Schriefer put it.
</P>
<P>
   The look of the convention hall itself, a four-year-old sports
arena, will give the proceedings more of a variety show feel. The
old-fashioned dais has been banished, replaced by a wide stage with
a podium that retracts into the floor. More speakers will be
announced by an offstage voice, and musical interludes will occur
more frequently. ``We're trying to be a little bit more
entertaining, a little faster-moving,'' said David J. Nash, the
convention's executive producer and once the producer of Radio City
Music Hall's Easter and Christmas productions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will be the program's roving eminence, broadcast into the
hall each night by satellite from somewhere on the campaign trail.
His speech _ alone now on Thursday night, the vice presidential
nominee's having been moved this year to Wednesday night _ will be
the de facto keynote address, as Card and the other organizers
opted not to designate one. Thus far, McCain is the only one of
Bush's opponents from the primaries who has been invited to give a
prominent address.
</P>
<P>
   To a minority of viewers, who watch the proceedings unfiltered
on, say, C-Span, which is supplying the pool coverage, or on one of
the cable networks that will often be concentrating on the stage,
the gist of the Republican story might be apparent. Everyone else
may have a hard time following the script, and those in charge of
creating it say the problem is unavoidable. In fact, the odd
reality of the conventions is that the harder the parties work to
woo network coverage the less the old line networks are apt to put
them on the air.
</P>
<P>
   And that, the organizers say, has compelled them to become even
wilier about the electronic tricks of television _ the satellite
feeds and the narratives on video, for example _ to sell their
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Academy Awards,'' Schriefer said. ``You go to
the clips.''

COMMENTARY: CENSORS BEWARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., double parens in next-to-last graf should be set as

 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ I witnessed a wild debate in Jordan the other
day.
</P>
<P>
   It went like this: A Syrian recently tried to hijack a Jordanian
jetliner flying to Damascus. A security guard shot the hijacker,
who almost set off a grenade. The public was outraged at the
security lapse, and none other than Prince Ali bin Hussein, the
brother and security chief of King Abdullah, was called on the
carpet by Jordanians who wanted to know how this lapse could have
happened, with some even calling the king's brother by his first
name, Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Where was this debate? It wasn't in the Jordanian Parliament or
media. It all happened online on Jordan's biggest Internet portal,
Nets.com.jo, where Jordanians, using their real names, raked Prince
Ali over the coals over the Web, and Ali came online to personally
defend ``against all those who trash our Armed Forces and Security
Services.''
</P>
<P>
   Message: While all eyes are on the Arab-Israeli peace process,
there is a whole other process _ democratization _ percolating in
the Arab world, in which the Internet and globalization are acting
like nutcrackers to open societies and empower Arab democrats with
new tools. But don't kid yourself, anti-democratic countertrends
are also flourishing, and there's no telling who will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   But at least now there's a lively battle. Check out the Web site
of The Cairo Times, a feisty new English-language Egyptian paper
published out of Cyprus. The Egyptian government censors The Cairo
Times when it comes into Egypt. And what do the editors of The
Cairo Times do? They now print in bright red letters on their Web
site (cairotimes.com) everything the government takes out, in a
section entitled: ``The Forbidden File _ See what the censor has
cut from our print edition. ... These articles were chopped apart.
. . .'' You can then call up the original of, say, ``A Sweetheart
Economy? Just How Bad Is Corruption in Egypt?'' and see just what
the censor didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's new young King Abdullah, who understands globalization
better than any Arab leader today, recently decided to privatize
the Jordanian press because he felt his kingdom could never
modernize without newspapers with real news. While Arab Internet
sites are still confined to the elites, in most Arab countries
today 70 percent of the populations are under age 30, and they are
getting wired remarkably fast.
</P>
<P>
   But Arab democrats have their work cut out for them. In a
shameful move three weeks ago, Egypt arrested an American
University of Cairo democratization specialist, Saad Eddin Ibrahim,
on some nonsensical charges. Even worse, several Jordanian
commentators wrote editorials supporting Ibrahim's arrest _ because
he was funded by the European Union in his election monitoring and
because he had supported normalization with Israel. Some Arab
pundits still hate Israel and the West more than they love
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news was that Rami Khouri, a courageous Jordanian
columnist and democrat, wrote that for Egypt's regime _ which lives
off U.S. aid _ to be arresting an Egyptian intellectual for
receiving foreign funding for election monitoring was the height of
hypocrisy. Khouri denounced the ``Arab states' moral drift,
self-serving judicial thuggery and political heavy-handedness'' and
denounced his colleagues who supported the Ibrahim arrest as
``confused and insecure.''
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, Palestinian democrats are now resisting Yasser
Arafat. Palestinian journalists have started a Web site, Amin.org,
to publish all the articles censored by local editors or Arafat
goons. As the Palestinian intellectual Khalil Shikaki put it: With
Yasser Arafat ``we have a one-man ruler, who won't share power or
recognize civil society. ((His attitude is)) `I will give you a
state and you run it as you like. When I die, take my thumb and
sign whatever you want, but until then let me get a state.' So we
need a state to end the legacy of the PLO _ its legacy is
authoritarianism, secrecy, security courts and lack of
accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century, the Arab states thrived by developing oil.
In the 21st century they will thrive only if they develop their
people, and the only way to do that is by democratizing. The battle
is on, and thanks to the Internet and globalization the Arab
democrats finally have some artillery.

A PORTRAIT OF HEROISM IS REDRAWN, WITH THE SUBJECT'S HELP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating)   By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PADUCAH, Ky. _ He was the teen-age hero who turned a
horrifying school shooting into a parable of good against evil. His
name is Ben Strong, the gregarious son of a preacher who was said
to have displayed remarkable courage when he disarmed Michael
Carneal, the 14-year-old killer who opened fire on a prayer group
at Heath High School here on Dec. 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the shooting, Strong, an appealing high school
senior, was a regular on national television, where he was
portrayed as a symbol of hope. His inspirational story of
confronting the killer was repeated in newspapers across the
country, including this one. Since then, he has been the subject of
cover articles in magazines and has traveled the country preaching
to young people. Now 20, and working at his father's Assembly of
God Church, he is often introduced as the hero of Heath High.
</P>
<P>
   But as new information about the events that morning is starting
to emerge because of a civil lawsuit, some people here are openly
challenging the portrait of Strong as a hero who rushed up to a
killer as he was firing and persuaded him to drop the gun he had
used to murder three girls and wound five other students. In a
brief interview recently, even Strong acknowledged for the first
time to a reporter that the heroic picture of him might have been
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he said in the interview, ``people get the wrong
idea.'' In terse answers to questions, he agreed that he had not
taken the gun away from Carneal, as he sometimes suggested after
the shooting, and he agreed that he might not have influenced
Carneal at all in his decision to stop shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Ben Strong story shows how chaos and panic can distort the
accounts that witnesses give of the rampage killings that
periodically horrify the country. It may show, too, how the stories
of the killings are often shaped by the powerful desire of
reporters and everyone else involved to find some good news, even
signs of heroism, in horrible, inexplicable events.
</P>
<P>
   A striking finding from a New York Times examination of rampage
killings, published in April, is that long after the news media
depart, a different story of the events often emerges. Usually, the
first accounts present inaccurate information about the killer, the
crime, the victims or the roles of bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   After the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, for example,
one student, Cassie Bernall, was widely described as having
answered ``yes'' when one of the two killers asked her whether she
believed in God. She was killed, it was said, for her faith.
</P>
<P>
   After that account put her in the realm of martyrdom and spawned
a best-selling book, some news accounts last year reported that the
``yes'' most likely came from another student, Valeen Schnurr, who
survived.
</P>
<P>
   At Heath High School, the news media took their lead from Bill
J. Bond, the principal at the time of the shooting. Bond was the
first person to tell reporters that a prayerful senior who was a
football player, Benjamin Scott Strong, had probably saved lives,
including Bond's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world wants a hero,'' Bond said in a recent
interview. ``It is natural to look for some goodness in a tragedy
and I probably contributed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony filed in McCracken County Circuit Court here this
spring, Strong said he had won praise for his bravery ``because of
what people said, how things were portrayed'' after the shooting,
not what really happened.
</P>
<P>
   In the deposition for the civil suit filed by the families of
the three murdered girls, Strong testified this winter that the
killer had discarded the gun on his own. ``He just got done, and he
dropped it,'' Strong said. His testimony has received little public
notice.
</P>
<P>
   Carneal, who is serving a life sentence after pleading guilty
but mentally ill to murder, also testified in the suit. When a
lawyer asked whether Strong had stopped him from shooting he
replied, ``No sir.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bond was told in a recent interview about Strong's newly
released testimony, he said information about Strong's actions had
come from Strong initially and had always been somewhat imprecise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him what he did,'' Bond said, ``and he said, `I told
him to lay the gun down,' and I took that at face value.''
</P>
<P>
   With scores of reporters pressing around the school the
afternoon of the shooting, Bond said, the story of Strong's actions
may have been exaggerated and ``it probably developed a life of its
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong helped the story along. Within hours of the shooting, he
was giving interviews and standing by as reporters described him as
the leader of the prayer group, a title he no longer claims.
</P>
<P>
   His descriptions of the shooting varied in the early interviews.
But in some accounts he suggested there had been a tug-of-war over
the gun. ``And then I went for him and I grabbed him, you know,''
he said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' the day after the
shootings, ``and he put down the gun and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he simply stood by or denied he was a hero, which
some of his new admirers took as humility. On CNN's ``Larry King
Live'' a week after the killings, Strong listened silently while
another guest, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, called Strong a ``major
hero'' and repeated the widespread story. Falwell described how
Strong ``literally walked right up to the young man in the face of
a firing gun and said, `Give me the gun.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Strong's deposition, on Jan. 20, a transcript shows, the
lawyer for the victims' families, Mike Breen of Bowling Green, Ky.,
read him a Time magazine article published the week after the
shooting. Time, which had interviewed Strong, said that Strong
``turned his eyes'' on the killer ``and, forcefully said, `Put down
the gun.''' In his deposition, Strong said he could not guarantee
that he had actually said any of that out loud. ``Now the
forcefully part,'' he added, ``that was written by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong was questioned under oath by the lawyer for the victims'
families, partly because they had sued him, as well as school
officials and many other people here who they said could have
prevented the killings. Strong has always acknowledged that Carneal
warned him not to come to the prayer group that Monday because
something was going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   But Strong has denied that he had any reason to suspect that
Carneal would commit murder. The judge dismissed the case against
Strong and most of the other defendants.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is clear from the deposition testimony that Strong did
eventually go to Carneal while some other students ran away. He
might have reached Carneal at the same time as Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Carneal, according to the testimony, had by then stopped
shooting, discarded his gun and was slumping to the ground, perhaps
in tears. It is undisputed that when Strong and Bond arrived,
Carneal was distraught and asked Strong to ``kill me, please kill
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Carneal said in his testimony that Strong did speak as he
approached. He quoted Strong as saying: ``What are you shooting
people for?'' Then, Carneal said, Strong groaned, gritted his teeth
and took Carneal by the shoulders and shook him.
</P>
<P>
   Strong ended two brief interviews recently by saying that he was
not comfortable talking about the subject any longer. But he was
accepting of the idea that the story of what happened the day of
the shooting might be different from the one that is widely known.
``Truth is truth,'' he said very quietly. ``That's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, Strong suggested that he wanted to be brave.
But in shock, he said, ``Your body doesn't function like it
normally does.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first days, the story of Strong as a hero may have
been beyond his ability to control it. In large ways and small, the
story was being used by other people who wanted a hero in a
tragedy, including the news media. But in West Paducah, the
families of the murdered girls seethed because they believed Strong
was profiting from their daughters' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's got some problems, some reason he has to think of
himself as a hero,'' said Joe James, whose daughter Jessica was
killed in the shooting. The parents of the three girls who were
killed all said they were infuriated by a Web site, bstrong.com,
that advertised a CD with a song by professional artists titled
``BStrong'' and included remarks from Strong. In the recent
interview, Strong said he had not received any proceeds from the
sale of the CD. The producers of the CD have said it was a
fund-raising effort for the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever part Strong played in perpetuating his story, his
public image has quietly divided people here. To some, he remains a
young man who, no matter what, represents positive values in stark
contrast to those of the killer.
</P>
<P>
   But some here say the Ben Strong story has overshadowed the
tragedy itself and they are bitter about him. In May, about 30
students from a parochial school near here, Christian Fellowship
School, traveled to an intramural event at Oral Roberts University,
the Christian college in Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   In a large meeting for all the high school students, a speaker
told the assembled crowd that teen-agers today should be more like
Ben Strong, the student who confronted the killer in West Paducah,
said Cathy Davis, a parent from here who was with the group as a
chaperone.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, the parochial school group rose and left the room, said
people who were there. ``Some of the kids were terribly offended,''
Davis said, ``because they know Ben Strong is not the hero he was
played up to be.''

AUDITORS CLEAR RUSSIAN EXECUTIVE OF EMBEZZLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRINA TAVERNISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Boris Berezovsky, the top Russian executive and
one-time insider, who has denounced a Kremlin crackdown on rich
businessmen, received a measure of vindication Monday when
international auditors exonerated one of his companies in a
long-running investigation into embezzlement and money-laundering.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities here intend to press ahead with the
investigation anyway, one of several that reflect an intensified
scrutiny under President Vladimir Putin of the wealthy oligarchs
that control much of the business in post-Soviet Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which has been pursued by officials in Switzerland as
well as Russia, centers on whether companies including the
Swiss-based Forus Services embezzled at least $200 million from the
Russian airline Aeroflot. Forus, a company Berezovsky helped found,
hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to examine its transactions with
Aeroflot.
</P>
<P>
   The auditor said Monday it had found no evidence that funds were
illegally funneled to the Swiss company.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of former President Boris Yeltsin, Berezovsky wielded
tremendous influence in the Kremlin and boasted that he controlled
decisions at high levels. But since Putin succeeded Yeltsin at the
turn of the year, Berezovsky has been pushed out of
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Berezovsky resigned from Parliament, forfeiting the
immunity from prosecution the post provided. The step was
interpreted as a final break with the new Russian leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has brought some of the country's richest men under
scrutiny, part of his campaign promise to loosen the grip of big
business on government policy. He is scheduled to meet with a group
of top Russian businessmen on Friday. Berezovsky is not on the list
of those invited, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   A special investigator, Nikolai Volkov, will travel to
Switzerland on Wednesday to obtain documents on the case from Swiss
authorities, Reuters reported. Last year, Swiss prosecutors raided
the offices and froze bank accounts of Forus and another company
linked to Berezovsky, Andava SA, which have provided Aeroflot with
cash management, loans and other financial services.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Swiss high court rejected a request by
Berezovsky's lawyers to unfreeze the companies' bank accounts,
Reuters said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian prosecutor's office has been investigating the case
for more than a year. A criminal case against Berezovsky was opened
under former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who sought to reduce
the businessman's influence in government. The case was later
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky has vast business holdings, though their size remains
sketchy. Companies he controls own stakes in the Russian television
channel ORT. He is also linked to the Sibneft oil company and owns
a car dealership, Logovaz.

A WILY DIRECTOR ENERGIZES RUSSIAN THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
   By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a city that takes theater very seriously, Kama
Ginkas was arguably the most successful director of the season that
just ended. He certainly was the busiest.
</P>
<P>
   Five of his plays were staged through the year, each one in its
own way a hit. His ``Pushkin.Duel.Death'' was considered the best
original work to come out of last year's nationwide Pushkin
extravaganza. This spring he picked up a Golden Mask prize for `'A
Room of Laughter,'' a popular one-act play that he directed for
Oleg Tabakov's studio. And the premiere last fall of `'The Black
Monk,'' a striking dramatization of Chekhov's mystical short story,
dazzled even Moscow's jaded critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is that Ginkas has hit his peak,'' said John
Freedman, an American scholar and critic of the Russian theater.
``He is racing to keep up with his abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   By early summer Ginkas, 59, was rehearsing another play, based
on Oscar Wilde's ``Happy Prince.'' Watching Ginkas in rehearsal is
like watching his actors perform: the process begins and ends with
an intensity that radiates both heat and clarity. No detail, no
object, no movement is too small to escape his attention; every
prop, every gesture, takes on meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your fingers!'' he shouted during one rehearsal, pointing
accusingly to an actress' right hand. ``Your fingers are moving.
That makes it a mise en scene, a fact. It could mean many things.
It could mean you are bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Boredom is not something Ginkas usually worries about. His plays
are not the kind that let the audience off the hook. For one thing,
audience and actors are typically packed into small spaces. In
``The Black Monk,'' the stage is put on the theater's upper
balcony, with the audience wrapped around three sides. Two of his
other plays are staged in a rehearsal room, with the audience
acting as a prop. ``A Room of Laughter'' takes place on the main
stage, but in a box.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly it is a very human drama that keeps the audience's
attention riveted as Ginkas works his way in and around the
emotionally dense landscape of his characters, some of them drawn
from masterpieces of Russian literature and moments of Russian
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plays arouse catharsis, shock, even hysteria, but there are
viewers who would rather not be touched,'' he said. ``I can't say
that I am speaking to the whole of humanity, or even all of Russia,
or Moscow, but I am speaking to the audience of those people for
whom these things are interesting.'' Whether it is the tortured
tragedy of the Dostoyevskian character of Katerina Ivanovna in
``K.I. From Crime,'' or the complex mesh of grand and petty motives
that drove Russia's greatest poet to his death in
``Pushkin.Duel.Death,'' his plays ensnare the spectator the way a
spider's web catches a fly. In ``The Black Monk'' the audience is
left poised on the edge of a balcony, gazing into the blackness of
a theater that becomes the haunt of a mysterious creature who is
either a source of genius, of madness or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Ginkas, indifference is a catastrophe,'' says Anatoly
Smelyansky, a scholar of the Russian theater, who is head of the
Moscow Arts Theater school studio. ``He has been playing this game
for many years. It is always a bit of a game: some naturalism, some
aspect of real life, and characters that he stretches to their
limit. For all of this love of theatrics, jokes and games, he has a
taste for reality, for the raw stuff of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginkas' characters are intense but they are also nuanced, which
he says is one of the legacies he inherited from his first teacher,
the great Leningrad director Georgi Tovstonogov. ``He found humor
in tragic moments,'' Ginkas said. ``There was realism, but the
eccentricities were all inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Jewish in Lithuania on the eve of the Nazi occupation,
Ginkas was one of a handful of children who were saved from being
shipped off to Auschwitz. He is also a cultural survivor, one of
the few members of a generation of Soviet theater directors who
came of age just as the Khruschchev-era ``thaw'' was coming to an
end, and who managed to stick it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation started work at the end of the 1960s, at the end
of the thaw,'' he said. ``We were not shot; we were not sent into
exile, but we were battered by shrapnel. Many simply left the
profession and did something else. Many were so strongly poisoned
that they never worked to their potential. Those before us managed
to accomplish something during the `thaw,' before getting hit on
the head. We were like idiots. We rushed right out, stuck our necks
out, and wham _ we got hit before we even had a chance to do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child Ginkas survived because his parents managed to hide
him in a Roman Catholic convent. As an individualist in the
Brezhnev era, he also lay low, ducking the radar of Soviet cultural
orthodoxy. For a time, he was a director of a state theater in
Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, but even there his free spirit was more
than the authorities could tolerate. He returned to Leningrad,
where he staged shows in private apartments and built a reputation
as a theatrical dissident.
</P>
<P>
   At the first glimmering of cultural liberalization in the early
1980s, he was lured to Moscow, where he was invited to the Moscow
Art Theater and Mossoviet, before settling at the Young Spectators
Theater where his wife, Genrietta Yanovskaya, was made artistic
director.
</P>
<P>
   As a student of Tovstonogov, Ginkas is firmly fixed in the great
Russian tradition of psychological theater, which began with
Konstantin Stanislavsky and Vsevolod Meyerhold. Their photographs _
together with portraits of Joseph Brodsky and Andrei Sakharov _
adorn the office at the Young Spectators Theater that he shares
with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stanislavsky, Meyerhold, Vakhtangov, they were the titans,''
he said. ``Then there were the gods: Tovstonogov, Yuri Lyubimov''
(director of the Taganka Theater). ``The task of the gods was
different. The titans had to create the foundations, to create
heaven and earth from the cosmos. Our generation is the heroes: our
job is to conserve and refine, make it more usable, combine the
uncombinable.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending several years abroad, mostly in Helsinki, Ginkas
returned to Moscow in 1994 with a production of ``K.I. From
Crime,'' a disturbing and moving play about a character in ``Crime
and Punishment.'' In 1997 it won a prize at France's theater
festival in Avignon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are watching what happens to a person,'' Ginkas explained.
``It is not clear whether she is insane or if the actress is
provoking the audience. There are circuslike movements, but she is
no clown. There is an element of the game, but it is nuanced and
paradoxical.''
</P>
<P>
   Having survived its long bout with Socialist Realism, Russian
theater is now emerging _ battered but not defeated _ from its
first decade of laissez-faire capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100 theaters in Moscow alone _ and another 400 in
the rest of the country _ Russian theater has survived, in large
part because Russians refuse to let it die. ``There were several
times when Russian theater should have fallen flat on its face, but
it has survived every crisis with flying colors,'' said Freedman,
who is the theater critic for the English-language Moscow Times.
``Russians cannot imagine themselves without theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginkas describes theater as one of Russia's few ``brand-name''
products. ``Theater is one of the few things we can still export,''
he said. ``Russian theater is like Sony. It is still the real
thing.''

 &HT;    Cheney has a wealth of experience inside the Beltway
 &HT;    By Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Dick Cheney, at 59, is only five years older
than Texas Gov. George W. Bush. But the former defense secretary
for Bush's father would bring a quarter of a century of Washington
D.C. experience with a wunderkind resume: congressional aide, Nixon
staffer, chief of staff for President Ford at 34, and a
congressional career with the credentials to reassure the GOP's
right wing.
</P>
<P>
   But like his prospective boss, Cheney would bring a genial
personality that makes his conservatism more palatable in the halls
of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheney is absolutely first class,'' said former U.S. Rep.
Charles Wilson, D-Lufkin, who served on the House Intelligence
committee with Cheney in the 1980s. ``If you went through Congress,
you'd find it hard to find someone who doesn't like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Rep. John Bryant, one of Congress' most liberal
members, is less charitable. ``The impression I got, he was a very
intense guy who internalized a lot of anger at the Democrats.''
Bryant sizes up Cheney: ``He's as conservative as any one in the
(Republican) party, but he wasn't a screamer like the (Newt)
Gingrich crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of Congress from Wyoming from 1979 until 1989,
Cheney opposed the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion rights while
supporting a balanced budget amendment and prayer in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you view his voting record, it's rock-ribbed
conservative,'' said U.S. Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who has known
Cheney since they started out 30 years ago in President Nixon's
Office of Economic Opportunity, the remnants of Lyndon Johnson's
War on Poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very conservative,'' Leach said. ``But he believes you've
got to make government work. He's not mean-spirted about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Rothenberg, a political consultant, agrees:
``Stylistically, he's moderate.'' That could fit with Bush's claim
of working well with Texas Democrats _ a bipartisanship he has said
he'd like to take to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Among Washingtonians, Cheney is also considered an intellectual.
He finished all his requirements for a doctoral degree in political
science at the University of Wisconsin except his dissertation.
With his wife, Lynne, he co-wrote a book about U.S. House Speakers,
``Kings of the Hill.'' He is known as a quick study.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the smartest guy I ever worked with,'' said John B.
Torinus Jr., a former journalist who was a congressional fellow
with Cheney in 1968. ``I was a news guy, so you are not going to
hear me get euphoric about many politicians. But he was head and
shoulders above the rest in that crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush, who only made a ``gentleman's C'' at Yale, is
intimidated by Cheney's academic reputation, he can remind Cheney
of his brief stint at Yale. He flunked out. ``I had a lack of
direction,'' Cheney told Business Week in 1998. ``But I had a good
time.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Yale, Cheney returned to Casper, Wyoming, climbing
utility poles for the local power company. That encouraged him to
get serious about school, graduating from the University of
Wyoming, before pursuing his doctoral degree at Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The careers of Cheney and Bush have come from different
directions. While Cheney was quickly rising through the ranks of
Nixon and Ford administrations as a young man, Bush was in Texas
pursuing his fortune, first in oil and later as a baseball team
owner.
</P>
<P>
   When Jimmy Carter defeated President Ford, Cheney returned to
Wyoming to begin his congressional career. It was during that first
campaign in 1978 that Cheney had the first of three heart attacks.
Some have speculated that Cheney's ambitious drive contributed to
his health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques B. DePuy, who was a graduate student in political
science with Cheney at the University of Wisconsin before both
became Congressional Fellows, says Cheney's friendly demeanor
covered a very hardworking intensity even then.
</P>
<P>
   DePuy said that when Cheney was working at the White House, ``we
used to hear that he would sometimes spend the night on the couch _
that he worked so hard he wouldn't get home some nights. That kind
of fit with my recollection of how intense he was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, citing a recent health exam, says Cheney is
healthy enough to serve if asked.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, President Bush tapped Cheney as his secretary of
defense. He oversaw Desert Storm _ the defeat of Iraq and the
high-water mark of Bush's presidency. After Bill Clinton defeated
the elder Bush in 1992, Cheney worked in a Republican think tank
for a couple of years before _ like George W. Bush _ he sought his
fortune in Texas and in oil.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Cheney became CEO of Halliburton Company, the world's
largest oil services company based in Dallas. He led the company on
a growth spurt his first two years, but in the first quarter of
this year the company has suffered a 12 percent drop in revenues as
the oil and gas industry struggled. Last year, Halliburton paid
Cheney $1.9 million. Last month, Cheney sold nearly half of his
interest in Halliburton stock for about $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush began looking for a running mate, Cheney was the Bush
family loyalist picked to screen the candidates. He knew the
stakes. After all, in 1992 when some questioned whether Vice
President Dan Quayle was hurting the Republican ticket, Cheney was
briefly considered as a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   However, his longtime friend, Leach, said Cheney did not expect
to return to national politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he assumed public service was behind him,'' Leach
said. ``But when a potential president asks you, you are obligated
to consider it.''

   ATLANTA - Two marches. One goal.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Farrakhan, Martin Luther King III and Al Sharpton were in
Atlanta on Monday promoting the ``Million Family March'' and
``Redeeming the Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 26, Sharpton, the president of the National Action
Network and King, president of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, will stage ``Redeem the Dream,'' to fight racial
profiling. On Oct. 16, Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of
Islam, will hold the Million Family March, to strengthen the
family.
</P>
<P>
   The three were in town promoting their marches independently
before banding together to seal the alliance and unite their
causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not draw away from each other,'' said Farrakhan. ``We
will complement each other and not let the forces of division
obscure the real cause of both of the marches.''
</P>
<P>
   They each agreed there is no coincidence the marches will be
held before the November election and Farrakhan hinted that he may
use it as an opportunity to endorse a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsing a politician is part of a new Farrakhan, mellowed
since his life-threatening bout with prostate cancer. He said he
feels about 85 percent, and while he is cancer-free, radiation
treatments still weaken him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank God for the prayers that I have received,'' said
Farrakhan. ``That is why I have recommitted my life not only for
black people, but for all people who struggle. The message has
evolved and the man has evolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan said he hopes to visit Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, who is
in jail and has been charged with the shooting death of Fulton
County Deputy Ricky Kinchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It grieves me that anyone's life is lost,'' Farrakhan said of
Kinchen. ``But we need to find the facts and judge brother Jamil.
If Jamil is in error, then he must pay the price of his error. If
Jamil is an innocent victim, he must be allowed freedom.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CONE SOLD HIS SOUL TO THE DEVIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
   Like Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, Mo., David Cone from Kansas
City, Mo., sold his soul to the devil. There is simply no other
explanation.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The suspicion arose initially last season and has heightened
with each of Cone's starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone thought anything of it at the time, but Cone
himself provided the critical clue in the aftermath of the perfect
game he pitched a year ago against Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a 1996 performance in which he pitched seven
hitless innings but was not allowed to remain in the game, he said:
``I've wondered if I'd ever get a chance again. Going into the
latter innings today, that was running through my mind, about how
many times I've been close and how this might be the last chance I
get.''
</P>
<P>
   And so sometime in the seventh or the eighth, maybe even the
ninth inning of the game against Montreal, when Cone could taste
not just his no-hitter but his chance at perfection, he did it. He
made the pact, and he has been paying for it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In 31 starts since his perfect game, Cone has won three times
while losing 14. The Yankees have staggered to an 11-20 record in
his post-perfection starts. This is no way to gain another chance
to win another World Series.
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless George Steinbrenner made a similar pact a few
years ago but with different terms over a much longer period. In
coveting the perfect game, Cone was looking only at the moment. Had
he to do it over again, he undoubtedly would give more
consideration to the future.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, on the other hand, doesn't think in small steps.
Don't settle for one World Series championship when four
championships are better. Don't settle for one all-star when three
all-stars are available. Don't settle for success for yourself when
you can guarantee failure for someone who's getting too close for
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Is anyone so naive to think it was just a coincidence that Ken
Griffey Jr. and Barry Larkin both declined to be traded to the
Mets? It's possible that Larkin would have been amenable to the
idea, but after Juan Gonzalez said no to the Yankees and they
wouldn't pay the ransom the Chicago Cubs wanted for Sammy Sosa, no
way was Steinbrenner's satanic playmate going to allow the word
``yes'' to pass Larkin's lips.
</P>
<P>
   As for the messy Sosa business, notice that Ed Lynch is no
longer the Cubs' general manager and that Andy MacPhail, the club
president and chief executive officer, has had to regress in his
career and play general manager. Think maybe a fuming George called
ole Beelzebub and said, ``And one more thing ... ''?
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud has gone to Seattle, Rey Ordonez is out for the
season, Robin Ventura is on the disabled list and having a poor
season to boot _ no more ``best infield in baseball'' for the Mets.
Roger Clemens hits Mike Piazza in the head, says he didn't mean to.
Maybe he didn't. Maybe the hand of Steinbrenner-induced fate guided
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees trade for David Justice, Denny Neagle and Glenallen
Hill. They don't refuse to come to New York. The Braves trade for
Andy Ashby. He happily moves to Atlanta, the Mets' personal hell.
</P>
<P>
   Every other contender wants to shore up its corps of starting
pitchers. The Braves and the Yankees already have the best
rotations in their respective leagues, but they secure the best
starters available. As soon as they join their new teams, Ashby and
Neagle each win two games. One of Ashby's victories, a 1-0
decision, comes against the Mets in a game that has a two-game
swing in the standing. No surprise there, bub.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, meanwhile, struggle to bolster their chances of
reaching the playoffs. Mike Bordick to play shortstop and steady
the infield? Manny Ramirez to play the outfield and drive in a ton
of runs? Curt Schilling or Mike Mussina to solidify the starting
rotation?
</P>
<P>
   Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, shouldn't be
surprised if just as he is about to complete one of those deals,
his telephone goes dead and the other team turns elsewhere.
Baseball is a game of inches and timing. This is Steinbrenner time,
even if it might be the end-of-Cone time. When Clemens was on the
disabled list last month, Steinbrenner supposedly told Clemens what
he needed to do to start winning. Steinbrenner has refused to say
what he said, but Clemens won his first four starts after leaving
the disabled list, the first time he had won four straight starts
in a season and a half with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner obviously put the fear of the devil in him.

MEMORIES OF THE RAJ   AT A LAVISH NEW SPA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Winds thrashed the lush, towering
sal trees, thunder rumbled over the Himalayas and the rains rushed
across a broad clipped lawn where British aristocrats once thwacked
a tennis ball. In the shelter of a Raj-era, colonnaded musical
pavilion, a yoga teacher showed me how to twist, stretch and
balance myself in the ancient poses, or asanas, of the cobra, the
tree, the cow face and the dead man.
<TEXT>
<P>
   We enacted this ritual of guru and disciple on the grounds of a
palace built around the turn of the century by the Maharajah of
Tehri Garhwal as a playground for the British viceroy. With its
Victorian balustrades and Mughal archways, the palace now furnishes
the public rooms for an opulent, new $50 million spa that spills
across 100 acres in the foothills of the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
   As the yoga session proceeded, the rains built to a lashing
fury, making a curtain that enclosed the pavilion in a watery
intimacy. Then they were gone as quickly as they came. While I lay
back on the white marble floor, clearing my mind of thought and
relaxing each body part, the only sounds were of frogs, crickets
and birds.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was an escape from the heat and dust, the noise
and the teeming cities of India, this is surely it. Perched 3,280
feet above sea level, with majestic views of the town of Rishikesh
and the mighty Ganges River about 160 miles northeast of New Delhi,
Ananda in the Himalayas offers austere luxury for the sybarite,
hiking, squash and rafting for the athlete and yoga, meditation and
Ayurvedic massage therapies _ among many other treatments _ for the
stressed out.
</P>
<P>
   The spa's construction was still in the final stages of
completion when I was there last month _ and plenty of
imperfections were yet to be sanded away. The water in the showers
and the Jacuzzi bath was not hot enough. The restaurant menu was a
jarring mixture of light fusion cooking and spicy Indian meats and
curries. The staff was sometimes overly solicitous when all you
wanted was to be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Ananda's designers have managed to graft a modern,
well air-conditioned, 21,000 square-foot spa and 75-room hotel,
decked out with minibars, walk-in closets and cable television,
onto a terrain haunted by India's ancient and colonial history.
</P>
<P>
   The spa sits in a region of the Himalayas that for millenniums
has been a place where sadhus _ the ascetic, bearded holy men of
Hinduism _ wandered the forests, meditated in caves and practiced
Ayurveda and yoga.
</P>
<P>
   The maharajah's personal palace still stands sentinel at the
entrance to the Ananda in all its decayed splendor, and the current
maharajah, Manbendra Shah, retains a staff there. But he has leased
the adjoining Viceregal Palace and 100 acres to a group of
hoteliers and investors for at least the next 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   The spa was developed by a joint venture of Indian Hotels and
Health Resorts on one hand and Rafael Group Hoteliers on the other.
The Rafael group is an international operator of luxury hotels, but
it recently merged with the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group and the
Ananda is expected to become one of its properties. Mandarin
Oriental runs hotels of that name in Hong Kong, Jakarta, Manila and
London, as well as the Mark in Manhattan, among many others.
</P>
<P>
   In the viceroy's palace at the Ananda, guests will be able to
play billiards on an antique pool table made in Calcutta, take yoga
in a grand ballroom where the children of the British colonialists
went roller-skating and _ when the hotel obtains a liquor license _
sip Cognac in an Art Deco-inspired lounge lined with autographed
photographs of royals and viceroys.
</P>
<P>
   What struck me most when I arrived at the Ananda, however, was
not the history, but the quiet and serenity, which are elusive
qualities in this nation of one billion people _ and in my life,
for that matter. My husband, Barry Bearak, and I are raising two
young sons and covering a fifth of humanity here in South Asia as
correspondents for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   When I picked up the lucky penny of this spa assignment, I
wanted to find a way of getting there that gave me a head start on
attaining that rarest of states: relaxation. So I chose to fly.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   But in this part of the world, travel is anything but
predictable or easy. I boarded a 40-minute Indian Airlines flight
to Dehra Dun one sultry afternoon, flies buzzing in the cabin of
the 20-seat propeller plane, and buried my nose in the Ananda's
brochures.
</P>
<P>
   I had never been to a spa before, never had a facial or a body
wrap, never taken yoga. I spent the flight selecting the ways I was
going to pamper myself. Would it be the Detox Papaya Body Polish?
The Seaweed Hydrotherapy Bath? Or maybe Pizhichil, an Ayurvedic
treatment in which two therapists pour warm oil all over your body?
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   At one point, I looked up and saw that we had entered what
appeared to be an endless cotton ball. Unconcerned, I went back to
reading. When I glanced up again, I saw the pilot waving to a
stewardess and felt the plane bank sharply. My shoulders squeezed a
notch tenser as I realized we were turning back to Delhi.
Visibility was zero because of premonsoon rains.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the evening in Delhi was spent scrambling for a
ticket on the train, scarce this time of year because so many
pilgrims and people seeking escape from the capital's beastly heat
head for the hills. But I managed to get a first-class seat on the
Shatabdi Express at 7 the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   The station swirled with travelers. Coolies threaded through the
crowds with stacks of luggage balanced on their heads. As I walked
down the platform, I choked on the stench of human excrement that
was heaped along the track. Toilets aboard are just stainless steel
holes that empty onto the ground rushing beneath you.
</P>
<P>
   Once I settled into the air-conditioned first-class cabin,
though, with its wide, comfortable seats, the five-hour ride was
quite pleasant. As the train gathered a gentle, rocking momentum, I
watched rain-drenched fields flash by. At the Saharanpur station, I
looked across the tracks into a car without air-conditioning where
a beautiful little girl, her hair shorn like a boy's, her dark eyes
outlined in thick smudges of kohl, swung gaily on the bars of an
open-air window.
</P>
<P>
   Images such as this one are the unbidden pleasures of a journey
through India. I felt myself letting go of the need for a tight
schedule. Travel here teaches a kind of fatalism: accept the
slippage of time, or sacrifice all peace of mind.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A faith-based welfare reform program pushed by
Gov. George W. Bush has crossed the line into evangelical Christian
proselytizing, a lawsuit filed Monday claims.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of Christian churches in the Brenham area of
Washington County used state tax dollars last year to buy Bibles
and urge the poor to build a relationship with Jesus, according to
the complaint of the American Jewish Congress and the Texas Civil
Rights Project.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in Travis County district court against the
Texas Department of Human Services, is believed to be the nation's
first constitutional challenge asserting that a faith-based welfare
reform program violates separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of Texas does not pay for religious training or
religious materials or proselytizing,'' said Bush spokesman Mike
Jones. ``The state of Texas has a long history of contracting with
faith-based organizations for a wide range of services, everything
from nursing homes to child care.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which also names DHS Commissioner Eric Bost as a
defendant, asserts otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   It says the churches in Washington County that run a local jobs
program for the needy used state taxes to ``promote religious
doctrine'' and ``subsidize religious discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit includes documentation showing that an August 1999
state evaluation of the program makes clear Biblical instruction
was central to the Job Partnership of Washington County's work
readiness lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biblical references are used to teach subjects such as
self-identification, relationships, authority, attitude, integrity,
communication, conflict resolution, stewardship of time/money, and
excellence in all things,'' the DHS ``Texas Works'' program report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another court exhibit in the lawsuit is entitled ``Biblical
Curriculum: Keys to Personal and Professional Success.''
</P>
<P>
   It shows God as a central figure in the classes. The lesson for
week five asserts ``to work is to serve God and man'' while the
next week students learn that ``all authority comes from God.''
</P>
<P>
   DHS officials said late Monday that the program's state contract
expired in December 1999 and was not renewed. The consortium had
received $666 a month from the state or up to $8,000 a year,
however.
</P>
<P>
   By turning state tax dollars over for such purposes, the lawsuit
suit contends, DHS is violating the Bill of Rights, the Texas
Constitution and the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit asks the court to declare the state's contract with
the jobs program unconstitutional. It also asks the court to
prohibit public support of the program in the future and to order
the jobs program to return the money it received.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Bost pointed out that participation in the program is
not mandatory, since those moving from welfare to work can chose
instead a secular program sponsored by the Texas Workforce
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Bost added that DHS earlier looked into the program but found no
evidence for the complaints in the lawsuit. He said he would be
highly concerned if the allegations are true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware of any of those allegations,'' he said. ``If
indeed after we get the lawsuit and I see what it says, we will
thoroughly talk with (the churches) and investigate and make some
determination of what exactly is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   On the presidential campaign trail, both Bush and Vice President
Al Gore have embraced the concept of religious groups administering
government programs for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Texas ``has made the most deliberate attempt to
push charitable choice,'' said Marc Stern, assistant executive
director of the Jewish American Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contends that the program taught students, many who
have been forced off the welfare rolls, that they need to ``change
from the inside out, rather than from the outside in, and that can
only be accomplished through a relationship with Jesus Christ.''

Undated: peace of mind.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A white-suited driver from the Ananda met me at the Haridwar
station with a cold face cloth. We drove through town, past
jangling horse and buggies, pushcarts loaded with mangoes, ragged,
bearded sadhus and hawkers selling ripe cherries in twists of
newspaper. The drive to the hotel took about an hour, much of it
through the Rajaji and Chilla national parks, with a final snaking
ride up a mountainside to the Ananda.
</P>
<P>
   As a golf cart took me down a steep, densely forested incline to
my room, I breathed in the cool, fresh air, scented by pine trees
planted to make the British overlords feel at home. The hotel
itself curved along a ridge that afforded spectacular views of
Rishikesh. The town was laid out in the valley below, along the
banks of the Ganges, which was the color of milky masala tea.
</P>
<P>
   To an American, the hotel and spa, with their red-tiled roofs
and cream-colored stucco exteriors, looked Mediterranean. But Ingo
R. Schweder, one of the hoteliers who conceived this project in
1997, said at the end of my stay that the design was characteristic
of the Himachal region of India.
</P>
<P>
   My quarters _ standard in the hotel, which I visited anonymously
_ included a medium-sized, uncluttered bedroom, decorated with
soft, muted fabrics, hardwood floors and hand-painted tantric art.
It had a wall of glass with a gorgeous view of mountains and
valley. The commodious bathroom had its own striking picture window
above a big bathtub. On the balcony, the only reminder of the
hurly-burly below was the occasional growl of a truck grinding up
the mountainside. Yellow butterflies fluttered in the updraft like
pieces of tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch on a teak deck high in the treetops, I enjoyed a tangy,
refreshing banana lassi _ a yogurt drink _ a salad of greens with
roasted eggplant from a nearby organic farm, and a modest, zesty
bowl of linguine with a roasted tomato sauce. It was the first in a
series of meals that were not all as satisfying as this one.
</P>
<P>
   But for a hard case like me _ whose mind churned with a
phantasmagoria of other things I ought to be doing _ the Ananda
provided a respite, as it appeared to as well for the
multigenerational Indian families who were enjoying its pleasures
while I was there. It has many beautiful spots in which to sit and
read, a first-rate gymnasium and separate areas for men and women
that offer a sauna, Jacuzzi bath, steam room, foot bath, chilling
plunge pool and relaxation room.
</P>
<P>
   My most memorable experiences, though, were in the hands of the
Ayurvedic therapists, Vidya Mohan and Shetcy George, and the yoga
instructor, Rishi Bharadwaj.
</P>
<P>
   Mohan and George, who were recruited from the southern state of
Kerala, gave me an extraordinarily sensuous couple of hours one
afternoon in one of the spa's 13 treatment rooms. I lay on a long
wooden table made from a neem tree. For an hour, the two of them _
the Esther Williamses of massage _ kneaded me from head to toe in
synchrony. The treatment is called Abhyanga. The cost is $22.50.
</P>
<P>
   For the following 45 minutes, I underwent the Pizhichil therapy
(cost: $40). Mohan continuously poured warm sesame oil, earthily
scented with 23 herbal essences, through the spout of a brass cruet
all over my body, gently rubbing it in, while George reheated the
oil that flowed off the table for reuse.
</P>
<P>
   For someone like me, who is always chiding my sons, Max, 10, and
Sam, 5, to eat over their bowls of salad so they don't drip
vinaigrette on their shirts, submitting to this oil bath took some
getting used to. But I did it, and it was unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   I came back the next day for another session with Mohan and
George, but did not like the Shirodhara treatment at all, though
they performed it beautifully. I was nearing the end of my stay,
and perhaps I had had enough pampering.
</P>
<P>
   For half an hour, they poured a steady stream of herbal oil on
my forehead. Cost: $40. This is supposed to pacify the mind and
body, but I felt restless and kept wanting to leap from the table
and dance when a particularly catchy Hindi movie tune came on the
stereo. I also felt as if my head was turning into a mop, with my
hair absorbing huge, gooshy quantities of oil.
</P>
<P>
   But you never know what you'll like unless you try it. Yoga, I
liked. Schweder, the hotelier, found Bharadwaj, the yoga
instructor, in Bombay, where he was a favorite of the city's rich
socialites. This lithe young man, age 25, has big ears, a clean-cut
look, a direct, understated manner and a hypnotic voice that
resonates like a tuning fork when he says ``ohm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rishi is very popular among the rich and famous of Bombay,''
Schweder said. ``He has a huge sensitivity to teaching different
levels of yoga.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: He makes out-of-shape, middle-aged people feel
good.
</P>
<P>
   Most mornings and evenings, Rishi gave a class at the musical
pavilion and all but once I was his only pupil. He calmly explained
the positions, the breathing techniques and the philosophy of yoga
and meditation.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the hour, when I lay on my back in the dead man
pose, he padded around me in his white pajama and bare feet,
telling me to concentrate on the tip of my nose or my breathing. At
these moments, I felt an emptiness of mind and a welcome stillness
of spirit.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   As Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush prepare to
frame their messages at the upcoming national conventions, most
Americans say they already perceive pronounced differences on how
they would handle health care, taxes, the environment and the
selection of Supreme Court justices, the latest New York Times/CBS
News Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   For all the focus on how both contenders are dashing toward the
center politically, and in some cases sounding alike, more than
seven out of 10 Americans say there are genuine contrasts between
them. More than half of the public thinks those differences are
more over issues than the contenders' personal qualities.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, 58 percent of Americans say that if Gore is
elected president, he would make health care more affordable for
everyone; 36 percent say that of Bush. Forty-four percent say Bush
would be more likely to reduce taxes; 25 percent say that of Gore.
Seventy percent say Gore would be likely to make real progress in
protecting the environment; 44 percent say that of Bush. Sixty-two
percent say Gore would likely pick Supreme Court justices who would
vote to keep abortion legal; 43 percent say Bush would do the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest split came on the issue of abortion. Sixty-two
percent say Gore would likely pick Supreme Court justices who would
vote to keep abortion legal; 43 percent say Bush would do the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   But while the impressions of the candidates seem to be taking
shape, voters are far from having made up their minds. Several
signs, in fact, point to a fiercely competitive contest. About a
third of voters say they could switch their loyalties before
Election Day. And significant portions of each candidate's
supporters say they have reservations about their current favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Bush continues to lead Gore among all registered voters, but his
advantage falls just within the poll's margin of sampling error. If
the election were held today, and it were a two-person race,
registered voters say they would back Bush over Gore by a margin of
46-to-40 percentage points. In a four-way competition, with Ralph
Nader, the Green Party nominee, and Pat Buchanan, the expected
Reform Party nominee, Bush would draw 44 percent; Gore, 38 percent,
Nader, 5 percent and Buchanan, 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide telephone poll was taken Thursday through Sunday
with 953 adults, including 743 registered voters. The survey has a
margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points
in either direction. The margin of sampling error among registered
voters is plus or minus four percentage points for each candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out with this campaign,'' Samuel Hathaway,
36, a poll respondent from Vancouver, Wash., said in a follow-up
interview. Explaining that he plans to back Gore but could change
his mind, he added, ``I just want to hear more from the campaign
itself. Right now I usually vote Democratic. Al Gore has been
around for eight years as vice president so I'm sure he knows how
to do the job. But I also like the Reform Party and I want to hear
them out as well.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll respondent who backs Bush, Kay Wimberly, 47, also said
her leanings are by not means irreversable. ``The primary reason I
might change my mind is because it's so early on in the campaign,''
said Wimberly, a graphic designer from LaCrosse, Wis. ``A lot of
things can come to the surface between now and then. The candidates
will make their positions more well known as the election draws
nearer. Education is an important issue to me and to the future of
this country. I'm not entirely sold on Bush's position because I
feel some of his claims are somewhat vague.''
</P>
<P>
   In another finding that carries significant implications for the
battle for control of Congress as well as the presidential
campaign, the poll found that the Republican Party has mounted a
successful recovery from the negative standing it had after the
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a heartening sign for Gore as both candidates compete for
independent and moderate voters is that the public's impression of
Bush's ideology _ while once equally divided between moderate and
conservative _ is increasingly conservative. By contrast, the
perception of Gore is that he is moving more from liberal to
moderate.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Americans, 54 percent, now hold a favorable
opinion of the Republican Party. During the impeachment
proceedings, only 33 percent held a positive view of the party.
Democrats had hoped to use public distress over the Republicans'
handling of the impeachment as a campaign issue in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also underscored that critiques that Republicans and
Democrats have made about their opponents may not be convincing to
the American public. Efforts by Republicans to link Gore to the
scandals of the Clinton administration do not seem to have worked.
A plurality of voters say the coming election is not about Clinton.
And majorities give Gore high marks for personal integrity and
character _ something they never did for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The argument of many Democrats that Bush lacks sufficient
command of issues does not seem to be working either. Despite
Gore's eight years of intimate involvement in policy at the White
House, that has not convinced voters that he is any more prepared
for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-six percent of Americans say Bush has strong qualities of
leadership; 55 percent say that of Gore. More people think Gore
understands the complicated problems a president has to deal with,
but the difference is not especially significant. Eighty-four
percent say Gore understands those problems; 73 percent say that
about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And while even Bush has acknowledged that ``my foreign affairs
experience is Mexico,'' voters say they have as much confidence in
him as they do in the vice president's ability to deal wisely with
an international crisis. For both candidates, voters were roughly
split on whether they were confident or uneasy about how they would
handle foreign crises.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's biggest strengths is that people still see hin as
eminently likeable, while one of Gore's best assets is that he is
seen generally as being on the right side of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush drew high marks for straight talk, leadership and
trustworthiness, while Gore was viewed as caring more about the
needs and problems of voters.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, the differences were largely of degree. For
instance, both men were seen by a majority of voters as pandering _
saying what they think voters want to hear. But Gore was viewed so
by a larger majority.
</P>
<P>
   Bush continues to be seen favorably by a majority of voters who
have formed an opinion of him. Gore is seen equally favorably and
unfavorably, but that is a small improvement from the primary
season.
</P>
<P>
   While the Times/CBS Poll shows no appreciably tightening of the
race, other national polls have shown that Gore has made some
progress recently in reducing Bush's advantage. For example, the
most recent Gallup Poll measured 48 percent for Bush and 46 percent
for Gore. Earlier in July, the margin was nine percentage points.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gore's supporters say they are marginally more certain about
sticking with the vice president than Bush's backers. But four in
10 of each candidates' supporters say they have reservations about
their candidate. One bright spot for Gore is that he has made
significant inroads in the Northeast since May, when the last
Times/CBS poll was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Gore cannot seem to shake a nagging perception that he
is the inevitable loser. Only 29 percent of the voters polled said
they expected him to win, compared to 49 percent who said Bush
would triumph.
</P>
<P>
   For all the differences between Bush and Gore, the one issue
where the public sees them both as responsible is on the economy.
Roughly three-quarters of Americans think either Gore or Bush would
likely make sure that the country's economy remains robust.
</P>
<P>
   The public continues to put health care, Social Security and
Medicare at the top of the list of problems they want the next
president and Congress to work on. Those issues are all viewed as
Democratic strong points.
</P>
<P>
   But taxes, an issue Bush has championed for months, is beginning
to make its way on to the public's list of most pressing concerns.
</P>
<P>
   While the survey found that the Republican Party has rebounded,
Democrats, too, are held in high esteem, with 56 of those polled
registering a favorable view of the party.
</P>
<P>
   More people said they would vote for the Democratic House
candidate in their district than said they would vote for the
Republican. But the spread _ 41-to-37 percent _ is well within the
margin of error. And national polls cannot predict an election in
an individual district. But they can provide some insight into the
general trend.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party continues to hold the advantage on many
issues that voters say they are concerned about, including Social
Security, making the tax system fair, improving education,
providing affordable health care, protecting the environment and
caring about the average person. The Republican strengths,
according to those polled, are keeping the military potent and
preserving family values.
</P>
<P>
   The two political parties that have not fared well are the
Reform Party and Green Party. Both are seen negatively by most
people.

MARKETPLACE: BEAR STEARNS RALLIES AMID TAKEOVER TALK

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Let the bidding begin for the last free-standing
properties on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of UBS AG's agreement this month to buy the
PaineWebber Group for $12 billion, executives of the few remaining
independent financial-services firms are worrying about being left
alone at the dance. Monday, shares of Bear Stearns Cos. leaped 7.7
percent, to their highest level in almost two years, on an
analyst's report that the firm might be for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns officials have not publicly announced an interest
in selling the firm, and the analyst's report, which was published
Monday, said no deal appeared to be imminent. Neither James Cayne,
the firm's chief executive, nor the author of the report, Guy
Moszkowski, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, responded to phone
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some traders and investors bought shares on the hope that
the management of Bear Stearns would be willing to listen to
offers. The firm's shares rose $3.4375, to $49.75, on the New York
Stock Exchange. More than 3 million shares changed hands, about
five times normal daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that it's a very cheap stock apart from whether
there's a deal or not,'' said Larry Sondike, a portfolio manager
with the Mutual Series funds in Short Hills, N.J. ``We think we're
getting the possibility of consolidation for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Sondike would not say whether the Mutual Series funds, formerly
run by the activist investor Michael Price, had put any pressure on
Bear Stearns management to improve returns on the firm's lagging
stock. ``I trust that Bear Stearns management and board will do
what's right for all Bear Stearns shareholders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the report that lighted the fire under shares of Bear Stearns
on Monday, Moszkowski broached the subject of a buyout, saying that
Cayne seemed more receptive than ever to the idea. But he added
that Cayne had thrown out a minimum purchase price of four times
the firm's book value, the value of its assets minus liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   That amounts to about $120 a share, or about $19 billion, for a
firm whose stock had not traded above $50 in almost two years. UBS
snapped up PaineWebber for 3.5 times book value, and some boutique
investment banks have sold for steeper prices.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts said they doubted Bear Stearns would command a
premium like those even from a foreign bank seeking an instant
presence on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on the outside looking in and want to gain an
investment-banking footprint, it gets you into the game but you're
still a notch below'' the biggest investment banks like Goldman
Sachs Group, said Dean Eberling, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP;
Woods. ``Four times book is unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the wave of mergers and buyouts that has swept the
securities industry over the last several years, Bear Stearns has
been viewed as an iconoclastic holdout. A midsize investment bank,
it makes a lot of money in some businesses that other Wall Street
firms shun. Most notable among them is the clearing, or processing,
of trades for other, usually smaller, brokerage firms and hedge
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing is perennially profitable for Bear Stearns, which has
one of the biggest clearing operations, but it has taken on more
risk in recent years as regulators have sought to hold firms like
Bear Stearns responsible for the actions of the small brokerage
firms that make up their clearing clientele. Processing trades is
also much less alluring than the high-fee investment banking
practices of underwriting stocks of new companies and advising
corporations on mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Cayne ``believes strongly that the
firm's biggest problem is its image.'' It alluded to the firm's
role as clearing broker for A.R. Baron, a defunct brokerage firm
that prosecutors charged with bilking investors, and a recent court
order that the firm pay $111 million to a former customer.
</P>
<P>
   After that judgment reduced Bear Stearns' second-quarter
earnings by $96 million, Eberling lowered his rating on the firm's
stock from ``buy'' to ``market outperform.'' Eberling said he was
troubled by the firm's plan to spend heavily to build its
investment-banking operation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Moszkowski, in contrast, rates Bear Stearns a ``buy'' and says
he expects its price to rise to $60 within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth far, far more than $50 a share,'' said Sondike, who
manages the Mutual Shares fund and co-manages the Mutual Beacon
fund. Together those funds own about 4 million shares, or about 1
percent of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bear tends to really not get any respect,'' Sondike said.
``People erroneously tend to think it's a trading shop taking a lot
of risk. These are smart, risk-averse, profit-seeking people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was also attracted by the high level of inside
ownership of the firm. Cayne, he noted, owns about 4 million
shares. Monday, the value of those shares rose nearly $15 million.

   (UNDATED) _ ``This is really, really hard,'' groaned President
Bill Clinton in the early hours of July 20, as he left Camp David _
a day late _ for the weekend G8 summit in Okinawa. For nine days
Clinton had been talking around the clock with Israelis and
Palestinians in one final pursuit of a Mideast peace treaty. One of
the greatest obstacles yet to overcome is the future status of
Jerusalem _ the deeply symbolic, coveted stone-built city which is
claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians as their capital. &QL;

jury decided on July 14 that America's largest tobacco companies
should pay $145 billion _ yes, folks, that's billions, not millions
_ in punitive damages to thousands of Florida smokers for damaging
their health. By awarding such an absurd figure, the jurors _ quite
inadvertently _ sent an important message: that it is high time
Americans abandon their misguided attempt to ``punish'' the tobacco

   NEW YORK _ The Big Apple's media are easily bored, and the
Senate race between Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton was in
danger of being written off as the mother of all snores. So it was
with relish that they seized on reports that Hillary had once
called somebody a ``(expletive) Jew bastard.'' The New York Times
suggested that racist obscenities were unlikely to have been
uttered by ``one of the most politically correct people on the
planet,'' even if she has a foul temper. But Hillary still has
plenty of reason to worry: before the recent controversy, polls
showed her winning only 54 percent of the Jewish votes to Lazio's
34 percent. &QL;

   LA PORTE, TEXAS _ The Texas Independence Trail, a dreary stretch
of road on the outskirts of Houston, is lined with some of the
state's largest oil refineries and petrochemical plants. The trail
ends in the murky town of La Porte at the monument to the Battle of
San Jacinto. In the smog that hangs over this hallowed ground, it
is hard to conjure up images of 1836, when Texas soldiers crying
``Remember the Alamo!'' defeated the advancing Mexican army. If Al
Gore has his way, this place will generate a new rallying cry in
the closing the months of the 2000 presidential campaign:
``Remember La Porte!'' In its bid to undermine George W. Bush's
record as governor of Texas, the Gore campaign is painting a grim
picture of the state's environmental woes on Bush's watch. &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although America remains, on average, a cheap
place to live by European standards, it has pockets where the
dynamism of the economy has fuelled not only tremendous growth in
wealth, but also steep inflation in the cost of living. The
sharpest price rises have come in the heartland of the new economy,
California's Silicon Valley. The average monthly rent for a
one-bedroom apartment in Palo Alto is $1,900, and the prices in
some complexes have jumped from $1,550 at the beginning of the year
to $2,200 in June. Buying is just as daunting: the median house
price in San Francisco's Bay Area is $370,000, compared with
$135,000 for the country at large. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ A ghost at Camp David has been America's Congress.
This week, as musing turned to the monetary rewards for peace, the
speaker of the House of Representatives, Dennis Hastert, wrote to
President Bill Clinton, tartly reminding him that Congress is the
sole authority for spending money. ``We expect to be kept fully
apprised of all aspects of the negotiations prior to entering into
any commitments,'' he warned. America bankrolled the first Camp
David agreement, between Israel and Egypt in 1978. If there should
be a second deal, might Congress scupper it? The possibility seems
real. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ This year's powwow of the rich world's leaders _
the G8 summit _ is taking place between July 21 and 23 on the
Japanese island of Okinawa. Since all the world's big economies,
except for host-nation Japan's, are in relatively good shape, there
is no real impetus for the economic navel-gazing and criticism that
has long characterized these get-togethers. So, with little chance
of big breakthroughs on big international controversies, the
summiteers will try to divert attention away from their differences
by talking grandly about development. The hot new topic will be the
``global digital divide.'' &QL;

showed cool restraint in the way she spoke and the way she ran. She
did not blow up on the track or at any of her competitors. Instead,
she assuredly dominated the sprints, won the long jump and emerged
clearer than ever as the focus of the 2000 Summer Olympics in
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Carl Lewis in 1984 had any American won three events
at the Olympic trials. Because Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene
both cramped in the 200-meter final, eliminating themselves from
Olympic eligibility in the event, Jones became the only American
who will seek to win multiple gold medals in individual events in
Sydney. Regina Jacobs won the women's 1,500 and 5,000 at the
trials, but said she intended to run only the metric mile at the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's all over,'' Jones said Sunday after winning the
women's 200 in 21.94 seconds, the fastest time in the world this
year and an indication that she is in form to attempt to become the
first female track and field athlete to win five golds in one
Olympics. ``Now I can go home and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still some things to learn, and the trials provided
valuable experience. Jones admitted to putting so much emotion into
the 200 semifinals _ when her main competitor, the world champion
Inger Miller, was in an adjacent lane _ that by the final, she felt
drained. ``I feel pooped,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She asked Johnson why the sprinters were being forced to run the
semis and the final in less than two hours, and he replied: ``Get
used to it. That's how it will be in Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Smartly, she stayed off her feet between rounds and drank plenty
of fluids to keep her legs from seizing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was really difficult,'' Jones said. ``I've always said
it's not going to be easy in Sydney. I'd be the first to tell you
it's going to be quite difficult. But the fact that I can come here
and get through all three of these is motivating for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Johnson and Greene, she refused to be drawn into any
verbal jousting with her opponents. She said nothing more
controversial than that her husband, the world-champion shot-putter
C.J. Hunter, always says that he will take out the garbage but
inevitably leaves it to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never hear me say a bad word about anybody,'' Jones said
after the 200-meter preliminaries. ``What I want to do is run fast.
I'm tired of all this talking. If you're going to talk, put up.
Come to the track and be ready to run. That's all I ask.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, neither Johnson nor Greene was ready to run.
Their cramping episodes pointed out the peculiar state of track and
field in which many of the top stars seldom compete against each
other. Instead of building rivalries, they seem to avoid them.
Johnson and Greene had raced only twice previously. When a matchup
does occur, the event becomes magnified so greatly that result is
often one of disappointment or unfulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the cramping raises the question of whether the use of
nutritional supplements like creatine, which is perfectly legal but
which can cause dehydration, helped cause the stunning, grimacing
withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a list of what supplements he has been taking,''
said Emanuel Hudson, Greene's agent. Brad Hunt, Johnson's agent,
could not be reached for comment. Greene is expected to see a
doctor on Tuesday, Hudson said, adding that Greene feels he can
return to competition in two to three weeks. But Greene's coach,
John Smith, feels he may be sidelined until a meet in Berlin on
Sept 1.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has now pulled up lame in two visible races _ the 200 at
the Olympic trials and a 1997 match race against Donovan Bailey of
Canada, the reigning Olympic champion at 100 meters. Curiously,
both times Johnson seemed to grow distracted by the trash-talking
beforehand and injured himself, as if pressing with his legs to
validate what he had promised with his words. He is normally
taciturn, assured without being boastful or critical, and both
times he has drifted out of character he has met painful
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson seemed certain that his injury was nothing more than a
cramp and that he would begin running again soon. He will not be
able to repeat as Olympic champion at 200 meters, but he will
defend his title at 400 meters, where he is so dominant that he has
lost only three times in his last 78 races.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps only Tommie Smith has ever possessed the kind of speed
and endurance in the long sprints that Johnson does, and no one but
Johnson has won the 200 and 400 at the same Olympics. While some
will question his brittleness in important races, he does hold
world records in the 200 (19.32 seconds) and the 400 (43.18
seconds); his place in sprinting history is assured. The world
record in the 200 may be the greatest achievement in track and
field besides the startling long jump of &QC; 29 feet 2{ inches by Bob
Beamon at the 1968 Summer Games in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl Lewis, having nine gold medals, is someone to be
respected above all,'' said Ato Boldon of Trinidad, who won bronze
medals at 100 and 200 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and who
has frequently raced against Johnson. ``But I know enough about
what Michael has done and what he has overcome in his career. He's
taken on all comers and done very well. I place him a very close
second behind Carl.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, too, will be compared with Lewis, who won four gold
medals at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The difference
is that Lewis was an assured long jumper. He won four gold medals
in the event, and while Jones finally breached 23 feet this season
at the trials, her form is awkward and her jumping is erratic. She
nearly failed to qualify for the last three jumps in the final.
Mike Powell, who finally broke Beamon's record in 1991, said he had
again offered to help Jones refine her technique before Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's a crapshoot with Marion,'' said Powell, who has
watched her jump since high school. ``Carl did not have to worry
about the long jump. With Marion, it's, `Am I going to qualify for
the final or win the gold medal?'''

   ``This is really, really hard,'' groaned President Bill Clinton
in the early hours of July 20, as he left Camp David, a day late,
for the weekend G8 summit in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis and Palestinians were to stay on and keep talking.
Nobody could fault the negotiators for failing to give peace their
best try. Neither side wanted to be the first to give up.
</P>
<P>
   For nine days they had been talking around the clock, without
reaching a conclusion. They had not yet found a way past the main
obstacles that have for so long barred Israelis and Palestinians
from equably sharing their tiny, deeply symbolic, bit of the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most enduring obstacles has been Jerusalem, the
beautiful stone-built city resting in the hills, central to
believers in the three monotheistic faiths, which is claimed by
both Israelis and Palestinians as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   For Jews, it is where the Temple was built to hold the Ark of
the Covenant. For Muslims, it is where the Prophet left his
footprint on earth when he ascended. For Christians, it is where
Jesus redeemed mankind on the cross.
</P>
<P>
   The religious monuments of all three faiths are mostly within
the walled Old City. But the future of the Old City is probably the
easiest part of the Jerusalem story to resolve. Control over the
Holy Places can be shared out; freedom to worship is an
uncontroversial doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Far trickier problems _ to do with sovereignty, demography and
politics _ haunt the city that spreads out beyond the ancient
walls.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 20 years, between 1948 and 1967, Jerusalem was
divided. A mantra, often repeated by Palestinians as well as
Israelis, is that it should never again have a formal, impassable
line running through it.
</P>
<P>
   The splitting, after Israel's war of independence, was ugly.
Palestinians, who may have owned the greater part of West
Jerusalem, were driven from their homes; Jews were unable to
worship at their holy sites in East Jerusalem, which came under
Jordanian control.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1967 war, Israel reunited the city, annexing its
eastern part. In 1980, it declared Jerusalem to be its eternal,
undivided capital.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel did not only annex East Jerusalem. It also extended
it to about three times its original size, designing careful new
boundaries that maximized the land area while minimizing the number
of Palestinians who lived within the city's extended borders.
</P>
<P>
   It then built residential colonies for Jews which, together with
their linking roads, became fortresses between the West Bank and
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The policy of successive Israeli governments was to increase the
population of Jews in East Jerusalem until they outnumbered the
Arabs. They nearly succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis and Palestinians in East Jerusalem are now roughly
equal at about 200,000 each. This has been achieved partly by a
factory-line of Israeli houses, partly by making it intensely
difficult for Palestinians to accommodate their growing families by
enlarging their houses, let alone building new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Netanyahu, when he was prime minister, tried to hurry
the process along by banning ``absentee'' Jerusalemites, but this
backfired as Palestinians hurried home to preserve their
residential status.
</P>
<P>
   The current Israeli government hoped that the Palestinians might
be satisfied with control over their (Muslim and Christian) holy
places, plus a capital in Abu Dis, an Arab suburb just beyond the
municipal border, where Yasser Arafat is in fact building himself a
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians insist on East Jerusalem, not Abu Dis, being
their capital, drawing the scattered parts of their putative state
together, giving it a solidity and resonance that it otherwise
lacks.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, many outsiders think, is a second redrawing of the
city's boundaries, no less creative than the first.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem, capital to both peoples, would be open to both; a
joint council would take care of joint affairs. A Palestinian-run
East Jerusalem, including some of the excluded Arab villages, such
as Abu Dis, would be devised.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-run Jerusalem would be expanded to include the vast
settlements just outside municipal limits _ and the Israelis would,
at long last, obtain international recognition that their cherished
city was indeed their capital.
</P>
<P>
   These are not impossible thoughts. But they have not, as yet,
been accepted by the tired negotiators at Camp David. &QL;

<P>
   Even the judge could hardly believe his eyes. ``A lot of
zeros,'' he chuckled. True enough: this was the largest
civil-damages verdict in history.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-year trial, a Miami jury decided on July 14 that
America's largest tobacco companies should pay $145 billion _ yes,
that's billion, not million _ in punitive damages to thousands of
Florida smokers for damaging their health.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors chose this staggering amount to send a message that
could not be ignored. They certainly succeeded in doing that,
capturing headlines that broadcast far and wide their anger with
the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   But by choosing such an absurd figure, they also _ quite
inadvertently _ sent a more important message: that it is high time
Americans abandoned their misguided attempt to ``punish'' the
industry through lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they should be formulating a rational scheme for
regulating a product which, however bad for health or noxious to
some, is never going to disappear. And the right way to do that is
through legislation, not litigation.
</P>
<P>
   There is little chance that the tobacco firms will ever have to
pay a penny of this award, which is why tobacco shares barely
responded to the news. The eccentric way the trial was conducted,
as well as the colossal damages, means that the verdict will almost
certainly be overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this case is significant. It underlines what a
wrong turn the United States has taken on the question of tobacco
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   With their irresponsible verdict, the Miami jurors were doing no
worse than following a path pioneered by politicians since 1998,
when state governments forced a $246 billion settlement on the
industry by threatening endless litigation aimed at recovering
costs to state health schemes of smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has filed a giant, and similarly
misconceived, federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind these lawsuits is indefensible. Yes, tobacco
is addictive and damages your health. Yet every smoker for the past
34 years has known this, because each packet of cigarettes sold in
the United States has carried a warning to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Long before that, most people knew that smoking was not the
healthiest of pursuits. Neither is drinking lots of alcohol,
driving fast or eating junk food.
</P>
<P>
   Many of life's pleasures, unfortunately, are both unhealthy and
habit-forming, but people do have a choice about whether to take
them up in the first place. This obvious fact is why, until
politicians began using the courts to bully the industry, tobacco
firms won nearly all of the lawsuits filed against them by
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the states' settlement with the industry is also
perverse. Tobacco firms are paying for the settlement by raising
prices, and will do the same to pay damages in any other lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Most smokers, remember, are addicted. So most will feel
compelled to pay these government or court-imposed price hikes. In
effect, this is taxation without representation.
</P>
<P>
   If the Miami verdict were ever implemented, smokers in 49 states
would end up paying billions to current and past smokers in
Florida, an outcome impossible to justify.
</P>
<P>
   It may make sense to tax tobacco more heavily, or to restrict
its marketing and distribution more strictly. But voters in a
democracy _ who include millions of smokers _ are supposed to have
some say in these decisions through their legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Courts can punish and deter wrongdoing, but they are
ill-equipped to weigh the complex trade-offs involved in regulating
a widely used product such as tobacco. The resort to litigation
carries another cost that is rarely recognized.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States could succeed, through democratic debate
and legislative action, in agreeing a way to regulate tobacco, it
would also take a giant step towards finding a way to decriminalize
scores of other addictive and widely-used, though illegal, drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco regime most likely to emerge from such a debate _
``tax, control and discourage'' _ promises to be an effective
antidote to America's general drug problem, unlike its present
``war on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   That misguided policy has put millions of people behind bars,
cost billions, encouraged crime and spread corruption while failing
completely to reduce drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   As with tobacco, it is high time to take the courts out of the
equation, and for America to put aside its obsession with
punishment. &QL;

firms won nearly all of the lawsuits filed against them by
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the states' settlement with the industry is also
perverse. Tobacco firms are paying for the settlement by raising
prices, and will do the same to pay damages in any other lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Most smokers, remember, are addicted. So most will feel
compelled to pay these government or court-imposed price hikes. In
effect, this is taxation without representation.
</P>
<P>
   If the Miami verdict were ever implemented, smokers in 49 states
would end up paying billions to current and past smokers in
Florida, an outcome impossible to justify.
</P>
<P>
   It may make sense to tax tobacco more heavily, or to restrict
its marketing and distribution more strictly. But voters in a
democracy _ who include millions of smokers _ are supposed to have
some say in these decisions through their legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Courts can punish and deter wrongdoing, but they are
ill-equipped to weigh the complex trade-offs involved in regulating
a widely used product such as tobacco. The resort to litigation
carries another cost that is rarely recognized.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States could succeed, through democratic debate
and legislative action, in agreeing a way to regulate tobacco, it
would also take a giant step towards finding a way to decriminalize
scores of other addictive and widely-used, though illegal, drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco regime most likely to emerge from such a debate _
``tax, control and discourage'' _ promises to be an effective
antidote to America's general drug problem, unlike its present
``war on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   That misguided policy has put millions of people behind bars,
cost billions, encouraged crime and spread corruption while failing
completely to reduce drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   As with tobacco, it is high time to take the courts out of the
equation, and for America to put aside its obsession with
punishment. &QL;

<P>
   Russia has long thought of itself as a singular power. At the G8
summit of rich, democratic nations, which opens in Okinawa on July
21, it will indeed be the odd one out.
</P>
<P>
   While the other seven leaders from North America, Europe and
Japan fret about the digital divide, and the poor health and bad
debts of the world's hard-up nations, Russian President Vladimir
Putin, by his own admission, knows he is struggling to avoid his
country's relegation from the big-power table to the ranks of the
Third World.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing this week, on his way to Japan, Putin made a lot of
Russia's much-vaunted strategic partnership with China, their
shared determination to build a multi-polar world (read, to limit
America's influence) and their opposition to America's plans for
limited national missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   In North Korea, he staked his claim to a part in the diplomacy
after last month's historic summit between North and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian officials warn westerners, with varying
degrees of bad temper, that they have plenty of other friends _
China, India, Iran, Iraq, former Yugoslavia _ if NATO and the
European Union again overlook Russia's interests in places like
Kosovo and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   So far, not so different from the later Yeltsin years, when
Russia went into a deep sulk over its loss of empire and influence.
It saw the world as a 19th-century power game: a gain for the West
meant a loss for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, any spanner Russia could toss into western works _
protecting Iraq despite its flagrant disregard of U.N. disarmament
resolutions, selling weapons to China for use in regional rows or
for browbeating Taiwan, or helping Iran with its longer-range
missiles _ disguised Russia's great decline.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble was that it did nothing to reverse it. Putin
recognizes that. Despite the week's rhetoric, there have been some
welcome hints of a new realism about where Russia's real interests
lie.
</P>
<P>
   It is reflected in Putin's travels in Europe, and Asia, in
speeches at home and in a new foreign-policy doctrine published
last month.
</P>
<P>
   It comes in three bluntly expressed parts. First, Putin has no
illusions about reversing Russia's imperial decline; the burdens of
empire helped drag it down.
</P>
<P>
   He looks forward to rebuilding Russia's influence, but with
qualms. Economic weakness, he points out, has been Russia's
undoing, not dastardly western plots.
</P>
<P>
   Russia needs to pull itself up by its own bootstraps, reforming
its tax system, defending property rights, if it is to break its
harmful dependence on either fortuitously high oil prices or
western handouts.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the qualms: without reform, Russia will fare just as badly
in the new information-based economy as it did in the old
industrial-based one.
</P>
<P>
   Second, says Putin, in these straitened times Russia needs to
rethink its foreign ambitions. He claims he will keep talking, even
at difficult moments, and tackle problems collectively, for example
at the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is encouraging; the test will be whether he still
uses Russia's influence there to coddle dictators such as Iraq's
Saddam Hussein and Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he could explain the new realities to his generals,
who are fighting over whether Russia needs more soldiers or more
nuclear missiles, when in truth it needs fewer of both.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Russia's annoyance at the West and its need for
cash from arms sales have driven the search for friends in
unhelpful places.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the third element in Putin's rethinking needs to
get most bluntly realistic: Russia's past tactics have often harmed
its long-term interests.
</P>
<P>
   Though it makes sense for a country with as many neighbors as
Russia has to be on good terms with as many as possible, China
included, Putin knows that, if Russia is to grow strong again, it
needs to link its future with the world's rich democracies _ the
folk around the G8 table _ not the world's few surviving dictators.
</P>
<P>
   His generals know that the fancy weapons Russia sells to China
may some day be turned against them.
</P>
<P>
   Obliquely, Putin acknowledges that Russia's past missile and
nuclear help to countries like Iran and Iraq has helped to spur
what could be a destabilizing search for new missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   And Russia is slowly recognizing that, if it is to be friends
with the EU, the price may be to get on better with Balts,
Ukrainians and others around its rim.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has so far put these new thoughts only on paper. They will
be hard to put into practice. If he managed it, Russia would indeed
deserve the respect it earned. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Republicans and Democrats are not the only people
who are feverishly preparing for next month's conventions in
Philadelphia and Los Angeles. For the first time in American
political history, the two main party conventions will each have
their shadows.
</P>
<P>
   These are parallel conventions designed to highlight issues that
the establishment would rather sweep under the carpet _ above all,
inequality, money politics and the ``war on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The shadow gatherings are the brainchildren of an unlikely
parent, a former Republican activist, Arianna Huffington, and have
attracted an equally unlikely collection of supporters, including
Peter Hirshberg, an Internet entrepreneur, and financier George
Soros.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will these shadow conventions be the end of it. The motley
crew of protesters who exploded onto the political scene in Seattle
last November will be out in force. They include members of the
Direct Action Network, United for a Fair Economy, the Ruckus
Society and a host of other obscure organizations.
</P>
<P>
   This second bunch have the same agenda as the first _ they want
to fix America's broken political system _ but they are prepared to
go to much more extreme lengths to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   The police expect about 10,000 people to turn up in Philadelphia
and perhaps three times as many two weeks later in Los Angeles,
where there are no fewer than seven alternative conventions on the
cards, including a homeless convention and an anarchist gathering.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to guess who will win the battle for the media
spotlight. This year's conventions are likely to be about as
interesting as a software manual.
</P>
<P>
   The ``themes'' for the Republican effort, for example, range
from ``Opportunity with a Purpose'' through ``Prosperity with a
Purpose'' to ``President with'' _ wait for it _ ``a Purpose.'' No
wonder the President with a Purpose is not bothering to show up
until the thing is almost over.
</P>
<P>
   Party conventions have been declining as a political art form
for 40 years. Until 1960 they actually decided things, complete
with platform fights, back-room deals and occasional fisticuffs.
Now all the key decisions are taken during the primaries and every
banal utterance is carefully scripted.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it looks as if America is even going to be denied the
one thing that lends a little excitement to these dismal events:
the candidates unveiling their choice for vice president. Which
leaves about 15,000 journalists looking for a story. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Arianna Huffington is a story in her own right. A few years ago
she was a hard-line Gingrichite who goaded her (now ex-) husband
into spending $30 million to run for the Senate from California.
(He has since come out as both homosexual and a Democrat.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, in her left-liberal salon in Brentwood, Calif., she
communes with Warren Beatty on the evils of inequality. But she has
also worked hard to provide the press corps with red meat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   John McCain will open the shadow conventions on July 30 with a
speech on campaign-finance reform. (``It's more than a slap in the
face,'' says one Republican senator about McCain's decision to
speak at the forum, ``it's a thumb in the eye.'')
</P>
<P>
   Gary Johnson, the Republican governor of New Mexico, will
discuss the drawbacks of drug prohibition. Celebrities will put in
appearances. The radicals on the fringe plan to make their own
news, with plenty of topless dykes and giant puppets.
</P>
<P>
   But what is really arousing interest is the threat of disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The big fear is a repeat of the Democratic Convention in 1968,
when the Yippies went to Chicago with the intention of producing,
in Abbie Hoffman's words, ``a huge orgasm of destruction atop a
giant media altar'' _ and Mayor Richard Daley's policemen made sure
they got what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The police forces in both Philadelphia and Los Angeles are
taking the threat of disorder seriously (as is Vice President Al
Gore, who has already decided not to stay in the downtown Biltmore
Hotel).
</P>
<P>
   They are tapping the FBI to provide details on radical
organizations. They hope to be able to confine the protesters to
``protest pits'' some distance from the conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials in Philadelphia are even planning to reopen the
disused and ``dungeon-like'' Holmesburg Prison to deal with a surge
in arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Should the anti-conventioneers be left in their protest pits and
forgotten? Or do they have something to say?
</P>
<P>
   The core of their argument is that American politics is
fundamentally broken: corrupted by big money and managed to death
by professional political handlers. Money politics not only gives
inordinate power to vested interests, they argue, it also
discourages ordinary people from exercising their democratic
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, fewer than half of the eligible voters turned out _ and
only a third of those aged between 18 and 24.
</P>
<P>
   This is overstated, of course. Low turnout is not necessarily
proof of alienation: a survey for the League of Women Voters found
that non-voters are no more mistrustful of government than voters
are.
</P>
<P>
   A new report published by the Pew Research Center points to a
paradox. Voters are more disengaged from politics than they have
ever been in the recent past. But they are also more satisfied with
their choice for president than in either 1996 or 1992, and less
critical of the way the campaigns are being conducted.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is hard to look at the process that is symbolized by
the forthcoming conventions without a feeling of unease.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain insurgency showed that there are widespread
misgivings about the ``iron triangle'' of money, politics and
influence. And the influence of money has been more pervasive this
year than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Common Cause study suggests that politicians will raise
a record-breaking $500 million in soft money (unregulated
contributions) in the current election cycle _ 80 percent more than
in the scandal-ridden 1996 cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-conventions include more than their fair share of silly
people, from revolting students to overexposed celebrities. (``The
reaction we've had at cocktail parties is that people are really
excited,'' says Anne Biondi Simonds, one of the organizers of the
shadow conventions. ``It's like, `Hey, you're concerned, so am
I!''')
</P>
<P>
   But America should pay at least a little attention to what is
being said outside the convention halls in Philadelphia and Los
Angeles. The oddest messengers can bear important news. &QL;

speech on campaign-finance reform. (``It's more than a slap in the
face,'' says one Republican senator about McCain's decision to
speak at the forum, ``it's a thumb in the eye.'')
</P>
<P>
   Gary Johnson, the Republican governor of New Mexico, will
discuss the drawbacks of drug prohibition. Celebrities will put in
appearances. The radicals on the fringe plan to make their own
news, with plenty of topless dykes and giant puppets.
</P>
<P>
   But what is really arousing interest is the threat of disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The big fear is a repeat of the Democratic Convention in 1968,
when the Yippies went to Chicago with the intention of producing,
in Abbie Hoffman's words, ``a huge orgasm of destruction atop a
giant media altar'' _ and Mayor Richard Daley's policemen made sure
they got what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The police forces in both Philadelphia and Los Angeles are
taking the threat of disorder seriously (as is Vice President Al
Gore, who has already decided not to stay in the downtown Biltmore
Hotel).
</P>
<P>
   They are tapping the FBI to provide details on radical
organizations. They hope to be able to confine the protesters to
``protest pits'' some distance from the conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials in Philadelphia are even planning to reopen the
disused and ``dungeon-like'' Holmesburg Prison to deal with a surge
in arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Should the anti-conventioneers be left in their protest pits and
forgotten? Or do they have something to say?
</P>
<P>
   The core of their argument is that American politics is
fundamentally broken: corrupted by big money and managed to death
by professional political handlers. Money politics not only gives
inordinate power to vested interests, they argue, it also
discourages ordinary people from exercising their democratic
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, fewer than half of the eligible voters turned out _ and
only a third of those aged between 18 and 24.
</P>
<P>
   This is overstated, of course. Low turnout is not necessarily
proof of alienation: a survey for the League of Women Voters found
that non-voters are no more mistrustful of government than voters
are.
</P>
<P>
   A new report published by the Pew Research Center points to a
paradox. Voters are more disengaged from politics than they have
ever been in the recent past. But they are also more satisfied with
their choice for president than in either 1996 or 1992, and less
critical of the way the campaigns are being conducted.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is hard to look at the process that is symbolized by
the forthcoming conventions without a feeling of unease.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain insurgency showed that there are widespread
misgivings about the ``iron triangle'' of money, politics and
influence. And the influence of money has been more pervasive this
year than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Common Cause study suggests that politicians will raise
a record-breaking $500 million in soft money (unregulated
contributions) in the current election cycle _ 80 percent more than
in the scandal-ridden 1996 cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-conventions include more than their fair share of silly
people, from revolting students to overexposed celebrities. (``The
reaction we've had at cocktail parties is that people are really
excited,'' says Anne Biondi Simonds, one of the organizers of the
shadow conventions. ``It's like, `Hey, you're concerned, so am
I!''')
</P>
<P>
   But America should pay at least a little attention to what is
being said outside the convention halls in Philadelphia and Los
Angeles. The oddest messengers can bear important news. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Republicans and Democrats are not the only people
who are feverishly preparing for next month's conventions in
Philadelphia and Los Angeles. For the first time in American
political history, the two main party conventions will each have
their shadows.
</P>
<P>
   These are parallel conventions designed to highlight issues that
the establishment would rather sweep under the carpet _ above all,
inequality, money politics and the ``war on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The shadow gatherings are the brainchildren of an unlikely
parent, a former Republican activist, Arianna Huffington, and have
attracted an equally unlikely collection of supporters, including
Peter Hirshberg, an Internet entrepreneur, and financier George
Soros.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will these shadow conventions be the end of it. The motley
crew of protesters who exploded onto the political scene in Seattle
last November will be out in force. They include members of the
Direct Action Network, United for a Fair Economy, the Ruckus
Society and a host of other obscure organizations.
</P>
<P>
   This second bunch have the same agenda as the first _ they want
to fix America's broken political system _ but they are prepared to
go to much more extreme lengths to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   The police expect about 10,000 people to turn up in Philadelphia
and perhaps three times as many two weeks later in Los Angeles,
where there are no fewer than seven alternative conventions on the
cards, including a homeless convention and an anarchist gathering.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to guess who will win the battle for the media
spotlight. This year's conventions are likely to be about as
interesting as a software manual.
</P>
<P>
   The ``themes'' for the Republican effort, for example, range
from ``Opportunity with a Purpose'' through ``Prosperity with a
Purpose'' to ``President with'' _ wait for it _ ``a Purpose.'' No
wonder the President with a Purpose is not bothering to show up
until the thing is almost over.
</P>
<P>
   Party conventions have been declining as a political art form
for 40 years. Until 1960 they actually decided things, complete
with platform fights, back-room deals and occasional fisticuffs.
Now all the key decisions are taken during the primaries and every
banal utterance is carefully scripted.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it looks as if America is even going to be denied the
one thing that lends a little excitement to these dismal events:
the candidates unveiling their choice for vice president. Which
leaves about 15,000 journalists looking for a story. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Arianna Huffington is a story in her own right. A few years ago
she was a hard-line Gingrichite who goaded her (now ex-) husband
into spending $30 million to run for the Senate from California.
(He has since come out as both homosexual and a Democrat.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, in her left-liberal salon in Brentwood, Calif., she
communes with Warren Beatty on the evils of inequality. But she has
also worked hard to provide the press corps with red meat. &QL;

 &HT;    Postal Service makes Web push
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Patrick deVerona would seem to be a promising recruit
to the U.S. Postal Service's drive to supplement its longtime cash
cow, first-class mail, with an online bill-paying service.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Georgia State senior and his five housemates
share a high-speed digital subscriber line at their duplex, and
even order most of their groceries online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pay my bills online,'' says deVerona. ``The only check I
write each month is for rent.''
</P>
<P>
   But deVerona says he probably won't be paying the Post Office to
pay his bills any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be no reason for me to go to their service,''
deVerona says, because he can use his bank's and credit card
company's equally secure services for free.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service is spending millions of dollars on
television, print and direct mail advertising and offering six
months of free service to entice customers to try its new eBillPay
service, which allows customers to receive and pay bills online.
</P>
<P>
   After six months, the monthly charge is $6 for up to 20
payments, or $2 a month plus 40 cents per bill payment.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Atlanta-based CheckFree Corp., the Postal
Service launched the service in April in a bid to replace part of
its first-class postal service. Last year, first-class mail
accounted for almost 56 percent of the Postal Service's $62.7
billion in operating revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But the postal service's cash cow has been looking skinny lately
because of growing competition from e-mail and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   According to a General Accounting Office report released this
year, first-class mail volume is expected to peak in 2002 and show
``substantial declines'' this decade. About $17 billion spent on
mailing bills and return payments _ about half of first-class
revenues _ is ``at risk'' of being displaced by e-commerce, the GAO
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Postal Service develops some new services, the GAO
warned, it may once again face financial and performance strains
after years of operating surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service hopes its move into e-commerce will
capitalize on its well-recognized brand and a tradition of private,
reliable deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bring our brand and all the trust and security that
Americans have come to expect'' over 225 years of service, says
Greg Frey, a Postal Service spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service is one of the 10 most recognized brands in
the world, according to Young &AMP; Rubicam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think our offering is very competitive and brings a whole
series of attributes that are unique to our service, including
trust,'' he says. ``That clearly is missing from some of these
companies that have brand-new names.''
</P>
<P>
   But a six-month free promotion and nods to its long history may
not be enough to set the Postal Service apart in the crowded world
of e-commerce, say industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the Postal Service doing anything all that
innovative. They're just another service provider,'' says Avivah
Litan, research director for payment systems at Gartner Group, a
Stamford, Conn., consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   She suggests the Postal Service spend less money on advertising
and more on free e-mail, a longer introductory promotion and other
incentives to draw people online.
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics are needed, she argues, because a majority of banks
already offer online bill paying. About 60 percent waive fees for
such services for their most valuable customers, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the head start, customers haven't exactly swamped banks
with demands to pay their bills online, says Litan. Only about 4
million to 5 million people pay at least some bills online.
</P>
<P>
   The main holdups seem to be customers' concerns over the cost of
the services and about the privacy and security of their accounts
and financial information.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Gartner Group survey of Internet users, almost half
said they didn't want to receive their bills online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe this application will roll out over the next
5 to 10 years. It just makes too much economic sense,'' she says.
But companies have a ``long, long way to go to convince
consumers,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Neither banks nor the Postal Service will be able to reduce
costs until more billers join the system, says Chris Musto, vice
president of research for Gomez, an e-commerce consultancy in
Lincoln, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Postal Service, most banks also contract out to
CheckFree to operate their bill payment services.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the time, CheckFree must cut and mail paper checks
to pay billers that haven't contracted with it.
</P>
<P>
   But that proportion is constantly dropping as CheckFree reaches
agreements with more billers, says Matt Lewis, a CheckFree
executive vice president. The firm says its collection of billers
that accept payments electronically has doubled during the past
year, to 121, while its subscriber base has grown by almost 1
million, to 3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis predicts that number will swell rapidly thanks in large
part to the Postal Service's heavy marketing push, which he thinks
will goad banks to become more aggressive as well.
</P>
<P>
   Between the banks' and the Postal Services' efforts, he predicts
that about 30 percent of consumers will be paying their bills
online within three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a very similar adoption curve to ATM usage,''
he says.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Big Apple's media are easily bored, and the
Senate race between Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton was in
danger of being written off as the mother of all snores.
</P>
<P>
   Recent claims in a book about Rudolph Giuliani _ vexed love
life, father in the Mafia, etc. _ only reminded journalists what
fun they would have had if the mayor had not dropped out of the
race.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with relish that they seized on reports that Hillary
had called somebody a ``(expletive) Jew bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that she said it in 1974, if she said it at all? A
new book about the Clintons, ``State of a Union,'' describes Mrs.
Clinton hurling this abuse at Paul Fray, then manager of President
Bill Clinton's unsuccessful campaign for a seat in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Fray is a Baptist who claims only a Jewish great-grandmother,
and has often provided reporters with embarrassing details about
the Clintons. The First Lady denied this particular accusation
emphatically at a tearful press conference. (Needless to say, she
is scheduled to appear at a synagogue this weekend.)
</P>
<P>
   Not entirely helpfully, just as Mrs. Clinton was saying that she
did not even remember the argument with Fray, her husband took time
out from trying to negotiate a Middle East peace deal to say that
she ``never said it,'' though ``she might have called him a
bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to accuse the Republicans of character assassination.
This allowed his wife's Republican opponent, Lazio, to remind
voters of the Clintons' tendency to shift blame swiftly to others.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can Mrs. Clinton have been wholly pleased by some other
attempts to defend her. A former
presidential-adviser-turned-troublemaker, Dick Morris, who is
Jewish, said that Mrs. Clinton is not anti-Semitic, though she
would keep serving him pork whenever he turned up for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times suggested that racist obscenities were
unlikely to have been uttered by ``one of the most politically
correct people on the planet,'' even if she has a foul temper.
</P>
<P>
   At least Giuliani was unequivocally nice, saying ``I'm willing
to accept her at her word.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Paul's Road-to-Damascus moment had nothing on Rudy's. Mrs.
Clinton's desire to disown this ancient profanity is
understandable. In New York's 1998 Senate race, Alfonse D'Amato's
chances of re-election were dealt a mortal blow when he called his
Jewish opponent, Chuck Schumer, a ``putz-head.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Yiddish scholars said this was a serious penis-based
obscenity, and not, as D'Amato claimed, the innocent twin of
schmuck.
</P>
<P>
   Before he used the word, polls showed D'Amato winning more than
a third of New York's 1.2 million Jewish votes; in the end, he took
only a fifth, which may have caused his narrow loss.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Jews have long tended to support Democrats. However,
even before the recent controversy, polls showed Hillary winning
only 54 percent of the Jewish votes to Lazio's 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jews have long regarded Mrs. Clinton as weak on Israel, and
thoroughly dislike her public embrace of Palestinians and her calls
for the establishment of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has worked for compensation for victims of the Holocaust,
and several prominent and wealthy New York Jews, who supported
Schumer in 1998, have publicly backed him.
</P>
<P>
   The current controversy is also playing to the perception of
many voters (Jewish or not) that Mrs. Clinton says one thing in
public _ usually a platitude _ while holding very different, even
vitriolic, views in private.
</P>
<P>
   The real Mrs. Clinton has been so well hidden from the voters
that it is easy for them to speculate that she may do all manner of
nasty things.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everything is going against Mrs. Clinton in a race
that is still too close to call. She has been cleared, albeit
halfheartedly, of having played an inappropriate part in the
Travelgate affair.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's failure to march alongside Hillary and Rudy in the
gay-pride parade may have cost him some homosexual votes, despite
his claim that only previous engagements kept him away.
</P>
<P>
   And there remains the awkward possibility that he will be
prosecuted for insider dealing by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, over his purchase in 1997 of options on shares in Quick
&AMP; Reilly, a brokerage, shortly before it was acquired by Fleet
Financial at a big premium.
</P>
<P>
   The voters might be prepared to forgive him; but, if the SEC
were to charge him, could he stay in the race? &QL;

   He went on to accuse the Republicans of character assassination.
This allowed his wife's Republican opponent, Lazio, to remind
voters of the Clintons' tendency to shift blame swiftly to others.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can Mrs. Clinton have been wholly pleased by some other
attempts to defend her. A former
presidential-adviser-turned-troublemaker, Dick Morris, who is
Jewish, said that Mrs. Clinton is not anti-Semitic, though she
would keep serving him pork whenever he turned up for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times suggested that racist obscenities were
unlikely to have been uttered by ``one of the most politically
correct people on the planet,'' even if she has a foul temper.
</P>
<P>
   At least Giuliani was unequivocally nice, saying ``I'm willing
to accept her at her word.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Paul's Road-to-Damascus moment had nothing on Rudy's. Mrs.
Clinton's desire to disown this ancient profanity is
understandable. In New York's 1998 Senate race, Alfonse D'Amato's
chances of re-election were dealt a mortal blow when he called his
Jewish opponent, Chuck Schumer, a ``putz-head.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Yiddish scholars said this was a serious penis-based
obscenity, and not, as D'Amato claimed, the innocent twin of
schmuck.
</P>
<P>
   Before he used the word, polls showed D'Amato winning more than
a third of New York's 1.2 million Jewish votes; in the end, he took
only a fifth, which may have caused his narrow loss.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Jews have long tended to support Democrats. However,
even before the recent controversy, polls showed Hillary winning
only 54 percent of the Jewish votes to Lazio's 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jews have long regarded Mrs. Clinton as weak on Israel, and
thoroughly dislike her public embrace of Palestinians and her calls
for the establishment of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has worked for compensation for victims of the Holocaust,
and several prominent and wealthy New York Jews, who supported
Schumer in 1998, have publicly backed him.
</P>
<P>
   The current controversy is also playing to the perception of
many voters (Jewish or not) that Mrs. Clinton says one thing in
public _ usually a platitude _ while holding very different, even
vitriolic, views in private.
</P>
<P>
   The real Mrs. Clinton has been so well hidden from the voters
that it is easy for them to speculate that she may do all manner of
nasty things.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everything is going against Mrs. Clinton in a race
that is still too close to call. She has been cleared, albeit
halfheartedly, of having played an inappropriate part in the
Travelgate affair.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's failure to march alongside Hillary and Rudy in the
gay-pride parade may have cost him some homosexual votes, despite
his claim that only previous engagements kept him away.
</P>
<P>
   And there remains the awkward possibility that he will be
prosecuted for insider dealing by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, over his purchase in 1997 of options on shares in Quick
&AMP; Reilly, a brokerage, shortly before it was acquired by Fleet
Financial at a big premium.
</P>
<P>
   The voters might be prepared to forgive him; but, if the SEC
were to charge him, could he stay in the race? &QL;

SPACE STATION LINKUP TODAY 
 
 

</HEADLINE>
 STATION-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks after its launching, the Russian-built module designed
to house future residents of the U.S.-led international space
station is ready to link up with the other components of the slowly
developing orbital outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The automated linkup is scheduled for today just before 8 p.m.
CDT, while the unpiloted crew module and two components launched
and joined together in late 1998 sail more than 220 miles above
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Since its lift off from Central Asia July 11, the 43-foot-long
crew module has circled the Earth solo more than 200 times,
allowing experts in Russia's mission control to carefully assess
its guidance, propulsion, computer and power systems before they
attempt the docking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The module is in excellent shape,'' NASA spokesman Kyle
Herring said Monday from the control facility in suburban Moscow.
Christened ``Zvezda,'' Russian for ``star'' before its lift off,
the spacecraft is also known as the service module, its technical
name.
</P>
<P>
   With three modules joined together, the outpost will grow to
nearly 120 feet in length and gain sleeping and working quarters, a
galley, toilet and working space for three resident astronauts and
cosmonauts. In addition to its life support systems, the new module
brings more capable guidance, propulsion and computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The crew module's winglike solar arrays will give the outpost a
width of nearly 100 feet. The total mass will rise from 68,000
pounds to 110,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Russian economic problems and recently overcome technical
difficulties with the Proton rocket that launched the crew module
delayed the lift off by 27 months. As a result, all major assembly
of the station ground to a halt after the first two large modules
were joined in Earth orbit by a U.S. and Russian space shuttle crew
in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If tonight's operation is successful, the station will be ready
to accept its first resident crew later this year, American
commander Bill Shepherd and cosmonauts Sergei Krikalev and Yuri
Gidzenko.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, a successful linkup will trigger a flurry of 15
construction and supply missions in the next 12 months, adding an
American science laboratory, solar power generators as well as an
airlock to ease the many spacewalks that will be necessary to build
and maintain the outpost. The shuttle Atlantis is currently being
readied for an early September mission that will equip the station
for the arrival of Shepherd's crew in November.
</P>
<P>
   If the linkup attempt is unsuccessful, the two older modules are
equipped with sufficient fuel to make at least one more automated
docking attempt. With a second failure, though, the Russians will
be prepared to launch a Soyuz capsule with two cosmonauts to the
crew module.
</P>
<P>
   Once aboard Zvezda, the two cosmonauts would be prepared to
activate a second guidance system that gives them a video link to
steer the modules together manually.
</P>
<P>
   The launching of the Soyuz rescue crew would probably occur
around Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Successive failures would force the station's 16-nation
partnership, especially the United States and Russia, to seriously
re-evaluate the future of the project.
</P>
<P>
   NASA estimates it would take the Russians two to three years to
fabricate another crew module if they chose to remain a member of
the alliance. The United States could forge ahead with some
assembly but it currently has no plans to launch its own crew
habitat until 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The American-led partnership envisions that when the station is
fully assembled, it will sprawl to the size of two football fields
placed side-by-side and house a crew of seven.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting astronauts and cosmonauts will use at least three
laboratories for physics, medical and biological experiments as
well as to test hardware for future human exploration of the moon
and Mars.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Over the weekend, Zvezda successfully completed the last of a
series of post-launch maneuvers that raised the altitude and
position of the module for the rendezvous and docking. The
activities prepared the crew module to become the target for the
linkup operation.
</P>
<P>
   Russian guidance and propulsion systems will steer the two
previously joined station modules toward the mating with Zvezda. At
a separation of just over 30 yards, the operation will pause until
the orbiting spacecraft move over Russia.
</P>
<P>
   After assessing signals relayed to the ground by the spacecraft,
Russia's mission control will command the modules to close and
impact at a velocity of just over one foot per second. A series of
two dozen latching mechanisms will lock the two modules together. &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The good life isn't what it used to be. Silicon
Valley headhunters report that executives from New York think twice
about multimillion-dollar offers when they compare the tiny place
they might afford in the Bay Area with the pile they live in in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Although America remains, on average, a cheap place to live by
European standards, it has pockets where the dynamism of the
economy has fuelled not only tremendous growth in wealth, but also
steep inflation in the cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest price rises have come in the heartland of the new
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Palo
Alto, in the heart of Silicon Valley, is $1,900, and prices in some
complexes have jumped from $1,550 at the beginning of the year to
$2,200 in June.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Sunnyvale, rents have climbed 25 percent since
the beginning of the year, and the vacancy rate has dropped to a
negligible 0.03 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Buying is just as daunting: the median house price in San
Francisco's Bay Area is $370,000, compared with $135,000 for the
country at large.
</P>
<P>
   For the well-off, this provides a chance either to moan or
gloat, depending on when they bought their house. They are unlikely
to be shut out altogether; they simply pay more or live in a
smaller space. The less well-off end up being displaced.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus of working-class residents is creating both
commercial problems and political strife. Nurses at Stanford's
hospital were followed by those at ten other Bay Area hospitals
when they went on strike last month to demand wages that would
allow them to live closer to where they worked, rather than
enduring a commute of several hours.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of the positions in the Los Altos police force are
empty because officers, unable to live near the town, have
resigned, and the force expects to be down to half-strength by the
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure extends to the vacation resorts where the new
wealth goes to play. Median house prices around Lake Tahoe, a ski
area on the eastern border of California, have risen 60 percent in
the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The chambermaids and ski-lift attendants are being priced out.
In Truckee, the small main town of the resort, the Safeway
supermarket has resorted to advertising on television to attract
staff.
</P>
<P>
   One river-raft tour organizer has prepared for the summer season
by importing 12 assistants from eastern Europe and housing them in
tents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pressure is cyclical; the Bay Area has seen housing
bubbles before, and this one too wil eventually burst. But the new
economy has permanently changed some patterns of life.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Kotkin of Pepperdine University in Los Angeles, author of a
forthcoming book on the geography of the information age, sees the
favorite cities of the Internet economy, such as San Francisco and
Seattle, as boutiques for the young, single and rich.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, for example, has the lowest density of children of any
city in America. Just 10.8 percent of its residents are aged
between five and 17.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural and ethnic mix that used to characterize inner
cities is increasingly found in suburbs. Yet even boutiques _ or
the mountain resorts that Kotkin calls ``Valhallas'' _ need a
mixture of people in order to function, including manual laborers,
police, nurses and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the cry in America's rental hot-zones for more
``affordable housing'': subsidized accommodation reserved for those
who work nearby and cannot afford the market rates.
</P>
<P>
   In California's budget, passed this month, $570 million has been
allocated just for this. In Aspen, a particularly chic resort town
in Colorado where the median price of a house is now over $2
million, ``affordable housing'' is needed even for people who
would, in most places, be the prosperous upper-middle class.
</P>
<P>
   To live in America's most sought-after enclaves, you need not
only to find your own house; you also need to help provide one for
your poor local lawyer. &QL;

 &HT;    Judicial referee urges Bailey disbarment
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ Lawyer F. Lee Bailey violated half a dozen
ethics rules during an international drug-smuggling case and should
be disbarred for life, a Florida Supreme Court referee reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it is difficult for this referee to conceive of a
more egregious set of circumstances than those which Mr. Bailey has
brought upon himself,'' Collier County Circuit Judge Cynthia Ellis
wrote in a biting, 23-page report.
</P>
<P>
   Any of the charges made against Bailey by the Florida Bar _
misappropriating and misusing $6 million of his client's stock,
trying to influence a judge, lying in court _ would be enough for
disbarment, Ellis wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, she said, they ``plainly warrant permanent
disbarment.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Supreme Court follows her recommendation, it would end
the career of one of the 20th Century's most famous defense
lawyers. In 40 years, Bailey has seldom been out of the headlines _
or trouble _ as he fought for clients such as Dr. Sam Sheppard,
Patty Hearst, the Boston Strangler and O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   If he's ousted in Florida, Bailey also would face disbarment
proceedings in the federal court system and in Massachusetts, where
he was admitted to the Bar in 1960. He was admitted in Florida in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   The disbarment recommendation adds another bump in a bad stretch
for Bailey, personally and professionally. His wife and mother both
died within the past year, he underwent hand surgery and he faces a
contempt of court charge in another high stakes case in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, 67, who lives in Manalapan and has an office in West
Palm Beach, said in a statement he would fight to keep his license.
</P>
<P>
   ``Objections as extensive as the rules may allow will be filed
in the Supreme Court of Florida,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's statement noted that the recommendation isn't a
judgment and that he's free to practice law until the Supreme Court
acts, which could take months. He said he'll give his clients a
copy of the recommendation so they can decide whether they want a
different lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall continue to represent my existing clients with all
appropriate vigor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In classic Bailey style, he used the statement to complain that
Ellis refused to admit results of polygraph tests taken by himself
and one of his witnesses, and that a witness and two lawyers on the
other side of the case had refused to take such tests.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey tried to persuade Ellis during a weeklong hearing in June
that he and federal prosecutors had a ``sneaky deal'' to
out-maneuver the French government in the 1994 case of Claude
Duboc, kingpin of a $600-million drug-smuggling ring. Bailey was to
turn over $100 million of Duboc's assets _ houses in France, a
yacht, cash and stock _ to the U.S. government in exchange for a
lighter-than-life sentence for Duboc.
</P>
<P>
   For his services, Bailey said, prosecutors agreed to let him
keep 607,000 shares of pharmaceutical company stock, then worth $6
million. When it went up to $18 million in early 1995, he said, the
government reneged, said he was only keeping it ``in trust'' and
demanded it back.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bailey had borrowed against the stock and sold some.
A federal judge in Gainesville jailed him for 44 days until he
could borrow enough to repay the difference. Bailey has sued Duboc
_ who got a life sentence _ in the U.S. Court of Claims to try to
reclaim the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis was merciless in her condemnation of Bailey's actions and
his behavior during the Duboc case and in his own defense
afterwards. She said he had compromised his client by writing to
the federal judge before sentencing in a ``brazen attempt'' to
protect his financial stake in the case and prevent Duboc from
hiring another lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   His ``statements, assertions, claims and testimony about these
matters are patently false,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said the violations were made worse by aggravating
factors, which she listed as Bailey's long experience in practicing
law; a pattern of misconduct; a dishonest or selfish motive;
multiple offenses; making false statements, and refusing to admit
he'd done anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time ... did (he) either personally or through counsel
acknowledge the wrongful nature of any aspect of his behavior ...
`` she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Bailey had been censured in Massachusetts and
suspended for a year in New Jersey 30 years ago, Ellis quoted from
the findings of judges who had disciplined the young lawyer then.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is unwilling to concede that he could have been wrong,''
the Massachusetts judge wrote. ``He studies rules and judicial
orders with a purpose of evasion rather than with a will to comply
with their spirit for the general good.
</P>
<P>
   ``These attitudes bespeak a self-esteem of such proportions as
to challenge description ... a philosophy of extreme egocentricity
for the defense of criminal cases involving the use of news media
... ``
</P>
<P>
   It's plain that ``very little has changed'' in the 30 years
since that was written, Ellis said.

HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ELECTION-POLL) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone
interviews conducted Thursday through Sunday with 953 adults
throughout the United States. Of these, 743 said they were
registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected
by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active
residential exchanges across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a
complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed
and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was
designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to account for household size and
number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for
variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race,
age and education.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 out of 20 cases, the results based on such
samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in
either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out
all American adults.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger.
For registered voters, for example, it is plus or minus four
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error into the poll. Variations in the wording and order of
questions, for instance, may lead to somewhat different results.

<P>
   For Philip Morris, the imminent political conventions are not so
much about nominating presidential candidates and building party
loyalty as they are about, well, macaroni.
</P>
<P>
   Macaroni in the shape of donkeys. Macaroni in the shape of
elephants. Macaroni the company plans to hand out to delegates.
</P>
<P>
   This is macaroni with a purpose: to tell the assembled opinion
makers and power brokers that Philip Morris is not just a tobacco
company and hasn't been for some time, that it also sells other
products _ Kraft macaroni among them.
</P>
<P>
   For many, conventions have little to do with politics and a lot
to do with business _ polishing civic and corporate images,
exploiting marketing opportunities, courting influence and turning
what has long been an exercise in democracy into a huge corporate
festival. The dazzling corporate sideshows put this year's
gatherings _ next Monday through Aug. 3 for the Republicans in
Philadelphia and Aug. 14-17 for the Democrats in Los Angeles _ in a
class with the Olympics and the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just major corporations like Philip Morris, which has
bigger plans for the Republican gathering but is not ignoring the
Democratic one. Cities, too, see a chance to bask in the spotlight.
Armed with studies putting the economic benefits of playing host to
a political convention at $100 million or more, over a dozen cities
_ including New York, Indianapolis and San Antonio _ lined up to be
picked, offering millions of dollars in support. This largess comes
on top of the $13 million the federal government gives each party
to hold its four-day convention.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in this head-long marketing rush, many are concerned. Some
contend the economic benefits are vastly overblown, while the risk
to a city's image is underrated. Others call the conventions orgies
of cash, providing yet another route for corporations to buy
political access. Still others say that as conventions have
increasingly lost their political role of nominating candidates and
rallying the party faithful, corporations have stepped in to fill
the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventions have become Super Bowls of the influence of
money on politics,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director of the
Center for Public Integrity, a Washington nonprofit group. ``These
are gala events where the most garish examples of excess appear.''
</P>
<P>
   The cities selected mounted all-out attacks to land the events
along with promises of raising $35 million to $50 million in local
funds for support services, mainly transportation, decorations and
civic improvements. Tax-deductible contributions come to each
city's host committee as cash or goods _ pagers from Motorola,
software from Microsoft, discount tickets from US Airways and UAL's
United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Local governments kick in cash as well. Los Angeles donated $4
million to close a last-minute gap for the Democratic convention.
Philadelphia's effort is supported with $17 million from the states
of New Jersey and Pennsylvania and the city government, along with
a $20-million letter of credit.
</P>
<P>
   To critics of campaign financing like Lewis, host committees
have become a gray zone _ a way for parties to benefit from
millions of unregulated dollars, raised with minimal disclosure and
given out of civic pride as well as a desire to help one candidate.
Even so, some cities, like Los Angeles, have struggled to raise
enough money.
</P>
<P>
   Critics may rage, but cities that have landed conventions _ both
now and in the past _ are thrilled. Even also-ran cities like
Indianapolis say they benefited. And corporations on both coasts,
local suppliers to national brands, are bubbling with enthusiasm
about their plans for the conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fabulous opportunity,'' said Patrick McGranaghan,
vice president for marketing at Dale Carnegie Training &AMP;
Associates, which is training thousands of corporate volunteers for
Philadelphia. ``We are putting Dale Carnegie in front of every
major corporation in the Delaware Valley and showing them what we
do. It gives them a taste of Dale Carnegie training, and we hope
they will come back and ask for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy's MicroBatch Ice Cream, a 3-year-old Philadelphia company
that recently produced the first beer-flavored ice cream, plans to
donate $10,000 worth of its product to the media center, where
15,000 reporters will work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope it gets hotter than blazes, so people will want
something cool and refreshing,'' said Michelle Peranteau, a
spokeswoman. ``There will be hundreds of thousands of people
descending on our city. That's hundreds of thousands we could turn
into MicroBatch lovers.''

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A ghost at Camp David has been America's Congress.
This week, as musing turned to the monetary rewards for peace, the
speaker of the House of Representatives, Dennis Hastert, wrote to
President Bill Clinton, tartly reminding him that Congress is the
sole authority for spending money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to be kept fully apprised of all aspects of the
negotiations prior to entering into any commitments,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch McConnell, the head of the Senate subcommittee that would
have to propose any aid package that formed part of a peace deal,
says, ``The chances of the Congress approving (the money) this year
are pretty slim, probably even nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   His opposite number in the House, Sonny Callahan, worries that
``a lame-duck president looking for a legacy might be willing to
write a blank check to get an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   America bankrolled the first Camp David agreement, between
Israel and Egypt in 1978. If there should be a second deal, might
Congress scupper it? The possibility seems real.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has come under unprecedented attack in Congress lately,
meaning that bipartisan backing for a deal signed by the Israeli
government can no longer be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, congressmen of both parties have
criticized Israel for its proposed sale of an airborne radar system
to China, and have been only partly mollified by the deal's
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when the Israelis suggested that a peace deal
with Syria might cost America around $17 billion, largely for
splendid new military equipment to offset the loss of security once
Israel had withdrawn from the Golan Heights, congressmen were
openly unsympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   But that sum pales into insignificance compared with the alleged
costs of any likely Palestinian deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians are said to have claimed that it will take
something like $40 billion to resettle or compensate the refugees
who were evicted in 1948 from what is now Israel, plus other forms
of compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is also claiming vast amounts of money, partly to rehouse
those of its settlers who will have to leave the West Bank, partly
to buy yet more splendid military equipment to offset the loss of
security from handing over control of the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The grand total may be $70 billion or even more, of which
America's share could be in the order of $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers at this stage are plucked from the sky. But given
that this is an election year in America, the potential for
grandstanding is endless. Campaigning politicians are bound to say
that this is money for a Clinton legacy, and that it would be far
better spent on health care.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, the chances are that if the negotiators were to
reach a deal that was accepted in Israel and Palestine, Congress
would approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Congressmen are being disingenuous in claiming to be out of the
loop. Although the negotiations are secret, both the National
Security Council and Israel's ambassador have been busy briefing
congressmen, to prepare the ground should there be a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton will be out of office by the time any bill is
presented to Congress _ which should mean a Congress less strongly
influenced by anti-Clintonian sentiments. &QL;

 UNDATED: MicroBatch lovers.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a bigger scale, companies like Philip Morris, Motorola,
McDonald's and Microsoft have donated money or products, or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome the opportunity to showcase our technology,'' said
Norm Sandler, head of government relations for Motorola, which has
supplied conventions since 1952 and will play host at a party to
honor the House speaker, Dennis Hastert, the Illinois Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris gave $250,000 to the Philadelphia host committee,
but the Los Angeles committee does not accept tobacco
contributions. In Philadelphia, where the company will ``sponsor''
a downtown street to be temporarily renamed for the company, it
will join other corporations in giving parties for politicians and
delegates and it is giving away lots of food-related products.
Besides the animal-shaped macaroni, it plans to stock hospitality
suites and delegate ``goody bags'' with Altoids mints, Toblerone
chocolates, Maxwell House coffee, Miller Beer and Philadelphia
cream cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are in a business that has some controversial
aspects,'' said Peggy Roberts, the company's director of
communications, ``it is important to our shareholders and employees
that we try and build relationships in venues that are important to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when civic fund-raisers approach corporations, the
pitch is often more about business than politics. After all, if a
company wants political access, some say, it would be better off
giving directly to the parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to sell it as a marketing experience and not as a
political contribution,'' said Eli Broad, chief executive of
SunAmerica and co-chairman of the L.A. 2000 Host Committee. Broad
gave $1 million to the effort, along with $1 million from
SunAmerica's parent company, AIG.
</P>
<P>
   Each city has its own reason for seeking the spotlight. For
Philadelphia, it is an opportunity to show off a spiffed-up
downtown and a new convention center, and to promote itself as a
place to visit, do business and live. Los Angeles hopes the
convention will erase memories of earthquakes, urban rioting and
the O.J. Simpson trial and show the world that the city actually
does have a downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had fires, rains and floods, everything but locusts,''
said Noelia Rodriguez, chief executive of the host committee. ``Now
we've turned the city around and we believe it's our moment to
shine.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Buchholz, president of Philadelphia 2000, added, ``Getting
this convention is like a seal of approval for Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the motive of civic pride is money. The Federal Reserve
Bank of Chicago estimated in a study there would be a direct
financial benefit to Chicago of $132 million from the 1996
Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing is to get people to come to your city in the
first place,'' said Geoffry J.D. Hewings, a University of Illinois
professor and the study's author. ``Hopefully, they will be
attracted to it and will come back. And there is a lot of ego
associated with these conventions. Lots of people enjoy the
nonfinancial benefits of being close to power.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the benefits are overrated and risks underplayed.
Many cities already have a thriving hotel business in August that
must be subtracted from any convention revenues. Besides, it is
hard to imagine cities like Philadelphia or Los Angeles needing to
raise millions of dollars to market themselves. And a backlash is
possible if baton-wielding police crack down on unruly
demonstrators. Cities can have their images tarnished, as Seattle
found after the riots at the World Trade Organization meeting in
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the convention make people say, `Gee, I didn't know Los
Angeles was there, maybe I'll go visit?''' said Andrew Zimbalist,
an economics professor at Smith College. ``If you have a lame
convention and fairly soporific candidates, it seems unlikely you
would say, `Boy, let's go see where Al Gore got nominated.'''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Noll, an economics professor at Stanford University added,
``It seems crazy for anyone to claim that the image of New York or
San Francisco or Chicago hinges on getting any of these kinds of
events.''
</P>
<P>
   Cities that have been convention hosts, or came close, disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The event was fabulous for the city,'' said Susan Golding,
mayor of San Diego, which hosted the 1996 Republican convention.
``It brings a great deal of public attention and a general feeling
that if you can handle a national political convention, well, you
can handle just about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Sainz, former Republican convention planner and now head of
the San Diego convention center, said cities craved the visibility
more than the dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``When reporters get bored with the conventions, as they do,
they will write stories about the city,'' he said. ``Larry King
going live with the bay and the skyline and sitting there in a
short-sleeved shirt in cool August breezes _ that does a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis was a finalist for the 2000 Republican convention,
and Michael McDaniel, chairman of the state Republican party, said
the city had benefited anyway. ``We've had bookings in Indianapolis
for events just as a result of being a finalist,'' he said. ``They
thought they should check us out for conventions. There is no way
to put a price tag on that ripple effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the perceived benefits, raising money isn't easy.
In the days before the 1996 San Diego convention, the city had
fallen about $5 million short, causing a worried Dole campaign to
tap its donor list. In Philadelphia, while the host committee
boasts of raising more than $40 million, only about $10 million of
that is cash from corporations.
</P>
<P>
   And fund-raising problems in Los Angeles have been the stuff of
local headlines. Only two months before the convention was to
begin, the host committee was still around $11 million short. The
city contributed $4 million, and President Clinton came to Los
Angeles to raise money, as well as lending his top fund-raiser,
Terry McAuliffe, to twist arms. As of early July, the city was
still $4 million short.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, when Rodriguez, head of the host committee, was
interviewed earlier this month, she said Mayor Richard Riordan was
in her office. What was he doing there? He was on the phone, she
said, asking donors for money.

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A ghost at Camp David has been America's Congress.
This week, as musing turned to the monetary rewards for peace, the
speaker of the House of Representatives, Dennis Hastert, wrote to
President Bill Clinton, tartly reminding him that Congress is the
sole authority for spending money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to be kept fully apprised of all aspects of the
negotiations prior to entering into any commitments,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch McConnell, the head of the Senate subcommittee that would
have to propose any aid package that formed part of a peace deal,
says, ``The chances of the Congress approving (the money) this year
are pretty slim, probably even nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   His opposite number in the House, Sonny Callahan, worries that
``a lame-duck president looking for a legacy might be willing to
write a blank check to get an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   America bankrolled the first Camp David agreement, between
Israel and Egypt in 1978. If there should be a second deal, might
Congress scupper it? The possibility seems real.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has come under unprecedented attack in Congress lately,
meaning that bipartisan backing for a deal signed by the Israeli
government can no longer be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, congressmen of both parties have
criticized Israel for its proposed sale of an airborne radar system
to China, and have been only partly mollified by the deal's
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when the Israelis suggested that a peace deal
with Syria might cost America around $17 billion, largely for
splendid new military equipment to offset the loss of security once
Israel had withdrawn from the Golan Heights, congressmen were
openly unsympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   But that sum pales into insignificance compared with the alleged
costs of any likely Palestinian deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians are said to have claimed that it will take
something like $40 billion to resettle or compensate the refugees
who were evicted in 1948 from what is now Israel, plus other forms
of compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is also claiming vast amounts of money, partly to rehouse
those of its settlers who will have to leave the West Bank, partly
to buy yet more splendid military equipment to offset the loss of
security from handing over control of the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The grand total may be $70 billion or even more, of which
America's share could be in the order of $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers at this stage are plucked from the sky. But given
that this is an election year in America, the potential for
grandstanding is endless. Campaigning politicians are bound to say
that this is money for a Clinton legacy, and that it would be far
better spent on health care.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, the chances are that if the negotiators were to
reach a deal that was accepted in Israel and Palestine, Congress
would approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Congressmen are being disingenuous in claiming to be out of the
loop. Although the negotiations are secret, both the National
Security Council and Israel's ambassador have been busy briefing
congressmen, to prepare the ground should there be a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton will be out of office by the time any bill is
presented to Congress _ which should mean a Congress less strongly
influenced by anti-Clintonian sentiments. &QL;

FEDERAL AGENCIES UNDERESTIMATING FLIGHT DELAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since 1988, the two government agencies that track airline
delays have underestimated the amount of time lost by passengers by
a total of 247 years, according to a study scheduled for release
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Department of Transportation's inspector
general found that the major airlines increased their scheduled
flight times on hundreds of routes over the last decade in order to
improve their on-time statistics. As a result, 130 million minutes
of extra travel time was tacked on to airline schedules between
1988 and 1999, the study found, even before counting delays, which
have soared during the corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
   The report was requested last summer by Sen. Richard Shelby, a
Republican from Alabama who is chairman of the appropriations
subcommittee on transportation, after the country suffered the
worst airline delays in history. This summer has turned out to be
even worse. The report is sure to fuel the growing debate about an
air system that many say is approaching gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby asked the inspector general to examine what causes flight
delays and cancellations, a question often asked by tens of
thousands of frustrated travelers. But the report, which is
scheduled to be released at a hearing of his subcommittee Tuesday,
concluded that the government does not collect enough information
about the causes of delays to answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   It also found that the conflicting ways that the Federal
Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation define
delays has made it impossible for the government and the airlines
to agree on what causes them.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines blame the FAA and weather for most delays, while
the FAA cites weather and the high number of flights as the main
culprits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't be a surprise that they are having a hard time
coming up with what the solutions are when they can't figure out
what the causes are,'' Shelby said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has acknowledged the problem and is in the process of
coming up with a new method to more accurately measure delays and
their causes. In addition, the latest congressional appropriation
bill ordered the Transportation Department to compel the airlines
to disclose more accurate information about why planes are late and
get canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the FAA says a plane is delayed if it takes off 15
minutes or more after the pilot radios a request to the tower to
taxi out to the runway. If the plane sits at the gate for an hour
before asking for clearance to taxi, it is not considered late.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Transportation Department counts a plane
as delayed if it leaves or arrives at the gate more than 15 minutes
after its scheduled departure or arrival time. If the plane sits on
the tarmac for an hour but arrives at its scheduled time, it is not
considered late.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines say that they have stretched their schedules in order
to account for the inefficiency of the country's aging air traffic
control system, and to make their schedules more predictable for
passengers. And they do not hide the practice. United Airlines,
which has been plagued by delays, recently announced that it was
adding an average of four minutes to each of its 2,400 daily
flights.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the report found that airline delays last year would have
been 25 percent higher, as calculated by the Transportation
Department, if the airlines had kept the scheduled flight times
they used in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the airlines' efforts to make planes appear on time,
delays increased 11 percent between 1995 and 1999, according to the
FAA. About 83 percent of those delays were on the ground, the
report found, up from 60 percent in 1996. Ground delays of an hour
or more have also become more frequent, increasing 130 percent in
the last five years, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Cancellations have also soared during the period, increasing 68
percent. Certain routes, such as Newark to Chicago, San Francisco
to Los Angeles and Washington to Boston, had cancellation rates
that were more than five times higher than the national average of
2.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without good causal data,'' the report concluded, ``it is
unlikely that the current debate within the aviation community will
end, nor the increasing number of flight delays and
cancellations.''

 &HT;    14-year-old charged in girl's death
 &HT;    By Colleen Mastony

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ A 14-year-old boy has been charged with
vehicular homicide in connection with the death of a 12-year-old
girl who was a passenger in the car he was driving at high speed in
May when it crashed and landed in a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Singh faces a ``definite possibility'' of being tried as
an adult and a maximum 15-year prison sentence if he is convicted,
Assistant State Attorney Tom Bakkedahl said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Singh turned himself in to Port St. Lucie police late Monday
afternoon. He is taken to the St. Lucie Regional Juvenile Detention
Center in Fort Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Kaily Pittman was killed in the May 14 crash, and Jeanna
Collins, 15, and her sister, Carly Ann, 12, were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Singh was driving his parents' car without their knowledge,
according to police. When police tried to pull the car over about 2
a.m., Singh sped away, making a series of high-speed turns in a
residential neighborhood, at times traveling up to 80 mph, and
eventually failed to see that the road ended in a T-shaped
intersection at Twylite Terrace and Ferris Drive. Singh drove
through a vacant lot and crashed into a drainage ditch. The car
flipped over a chain-link fence and crashed in a backyard pool,
according to police reports.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol was not a factor in the crash, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Singh told investigators he tried to stop for police but that he
couldn't find the brakes and when he did hit them, they didn't
work. Police later tested the car's brakes and found that they were
working normally.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Monday that Jeanna and Carly Ann Collins yelled at
Singh to stop the car but he said he was going to try to lose the
police.
</P>
<P>
   When Jeanna tried to grab the keys out of the ignition, Singh
punched her twice ``into a state of unconsciousness,'' according to
the investigation report.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Kaily was wearing only her lap belt, and that she
had put the shoulder strap of her seat belt behind her when she got
into the car. She died of internal injuries caused by the intense
pressure exerted by the seat belt's lap strap during the crash,
according to Associate Medical Examiner Charles Diggs.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanna Collins suffered a broken back which required 15 hours of
surgery, and recovery in a plastic body cast, according to officer
Darin Howie, and Carly Ann Collins suffered from bruised ribs and
lungs. Both girls are out of the hospital. Singh suffered two
fractured ankles and some broken bones in his feet.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This year's summit of the rich world's leaders
suffers no shortage of symbolism. It marks the 25th anniversary of
the first such summit; the first of the new millennium; and
President Bill Clinton's eighth and last.
</P>
<P>
   It is taking place between July 21 and 23 on the Japanese island
of Okinawa, home to 26,000 American troops and site of a vicious
battle in the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Keen as it is to flex its muscles on the international economic
stage, Japan is determined to make the summit a big deal. The goal,
say the Japanese hosts modestly, is to set the stage for ``greater
prosperity,'' ``peace of mind'' and ``world stability'' in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is less imposing. Since all the world's big
economies, except Japan's, are in relatively good shape, there is
no impetus for the economic navel-gazing and criticism that has
long characterized these get-togethers _ especially since, as
hosts, the Japanese will be determined to deflect talk away from
their own, still shaky, economic performance.
</P>
<P>
   So there is little chance of big breakthroughs on big
international controversies. The chance of an announcement of a big
new trade round, for instance, is close to zero.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the summiteers will try to divert attention away from
their differences by talking grandly about development. The hot new
topic will be the ``global digital divide.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be much speculation about the potential for
information technology to accelerate development, and much
hand-wringing that so many poor countries are not wired.
</P>
<P>
   Of an estimated 332 million Internet users, fewer than 1 percent
live in Africa. Only about 2.7 million of Africa's more than 600
million people use the Internet, and most of those are in South
Africa. That compares with an average in North America and Europe
of one user for every four people.
</P>
<P>
   Less obvious is how to bridge this divide. Mimicking its efforts
to increase computer- and Internet-access among poor Americans, the
Clinton administration is keen on partnerships with the private
sector. So several business stars, including John Chambers of Cisco
Systems and Nobuyuki Idei of Sony, were invited to the pre-summit
discussion in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, much of the burden of implementing fine-sounding
ideas will fall on multilateral institutions, so the heads of the
United Nations Development Program and the World Bank were also
invited.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's approach to the divide, as so often in development, is
to throw money at it. It has announced a $15 billion aid package
over five years, although it is unclear whether this is new money,
or what exactly it will be spent on.
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless, the gathering will yield more headline-grabbing
initiatives. There is, for instance, to be an ``Okinawa Charter''
on information technology. But there are few signs that anybody
knows how best to address the divide, or even whether information
technology is the right place to concentrate development efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Those uncertainties do not plague the summiteers' two other
development priorities: education and health.
</P>
<P>
   The heads of government will reaffirm their determination to
reach the international goal of universal primary education by
2015. They will stress the importance of educating girls. Some
60-70 percent of the more than 100 million children who are not in
school are girls.
</P>
<P>
   On health, there will be more talk about tackling the spread of
infectious diseases, especially AIDS. Specific targets for reducing
the number of young AIDS victims over the next decade by, say, 25
percent, are likely.
</P>
<P>
   Here again, Japan has already pledged $3 billion to fight
infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   These deadlines and promises should all be taken with a pinch of
salt. After all, it was only a year ago that the summit in Cologne
announced, with great fanfare, a package of enhanced debt relief
for the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   So far only nine countries have received relief, worth about $15
billion in total.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC)
program argue that the process is too slow, and that conditions
attached to debt relief are still too burdensome. Neither argument
is entirely convincing. Many of the countries potentially eligible
for debt relief are deeply corrupt or at war.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbing is the fact that some rich countries, notably
the United States, have not yet made good on their commitments to
finance debt relief. Assistance for Honduras and Bolivia has
already been held up for lack of American contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the exaggerated expectations, the summit's focus on debt
relief has expanded and accelerated the process. The same could be
true of this year's areas of concern.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is still a nagging suspicion that the global
digital divide is the wrong priority for the world's richest
countries.
</P>
<P>
   If they really wanted to help the poorest, the summiteers would
do far better to focus on opening up their markets. But sadly,
trade liberalization costs political capital. Grand words come
cheap. &QL;

CONVICTED RAPIST LIKELY TO BE PARDONED AFTER NEW ROUND OF DNA
TESTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Texas inmate whose rape conviction attracted
national attention in 1998 after the state's highest criminal court
disregarded DNA evidence and refused to grant him a new trial is
now receiving a recommendation that he be pardoned.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the man, Roy Criner, who was sentenced to life in
prison in 1990 for the rape of a 16-year-old hitchhiker, could land
on the desk of Gov. George W. Bush as soon as next week. New DNA
tests completed this month persuaded officials in Montgomery
County, including the district attorney, the sheriff and the
presiding judge, to join Criner's lawyer in asking that the inmate
be freed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm assuming that Criner at some point will be pardoned,''
said Michael A. McDougal, the district attorney in Montgomery
County, about 20 miles north of Houston. A court hearing will be
held on Friday to make the application for pardon final.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Bush, said state law required
that Criner's application first be approved by the Texas Board of
Pardons and Paroles before the governor could grant a pardon. But
since 1997, the paroles board has weighed new DNA evidence
favorably in recommending pardons for three other inmates convicted
of rape or sexual assault. And in all three cases, the latest of
which was in May, Bush has approved the pardons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor will make a decision very quickly once he gets a
recommendation from the board,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   For critics of the criminal justice system in Texas, the Criner
case has long stood out. The case involved the 1986 rape and murder
of Deanna Ogg, a high school student who was found bludgeoned and
stabbed to death. Criner, then 33, was charged with capital murder
and rape based on statements he made to three acquaintances that he
had picked up a hitchhiker, threatened her and had sex with her.
The murder charge was dropped for lack of evidence, but Criner was
convicted of aggravated rape, even though no physical evidence
linked him to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a DNA test determined that semen found inside the
victim's body did not belong to Criner. His lawyer, Michael
Charlton, sought a new trial, and the presiding state district
judge, Michael Mayes, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But on appeal, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed
Mayes' ruling and denied the new trial. Writing for the majority,
Judge Sharon Keller concluded that the DNA evidence did not prove
Criner's innocence, noting, for example, that the victim might have
had sex with another person ``at a time relatively near her
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller, who is running for presiding judge of the court, also
wrote that Criner may have used a condom or failed to ejaculate.
She said the statements made by Criner outweighed the new DNA
evidence. Judge Keller did not return a telephone message left
Monday at her office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Kafkaesque reasoning,'' said Barry Scheck, co-director
of the Innocence Project at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law
in Manhattan, ``and a troubling exercise in mental gymnastics to
avoid accepting the truth. It was a stunning and outrageous
decision by the Court of Criminal Appeals.''
</P>
<P>
   The case quickly attracted media attention. In Texas, The
Houston Press reported Criner was a slow learner with an I.Q. of
70. The Press article also cast doubt on the credibility of the
accounts of three people to whom Criner had made statements. In
January, the PBS program ``Frontline'' featured the Criner case on
a segment called ``The Case for Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   The new DNA testing, completed this month, involved a cigarette
butt collected from the crime scene. Tests at an independent lab in
California, and later at the Texas Department of Public Safety,
determined that the DNA of two people could be found on the
cigarette _ that of Ms. Ogg and of the same person whose semen was
found in her body.
</P>
<P>
   To McDougal, the district attorney who had opposed efforts for a
new trial in 1998, this new evidence changed everything. ``It puts
the semen donor and the victim at the scene together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scheck's group, which specializes in using DNA testing to
examine questionable convictions, financed the second round of
tests. Charlton, the defense lawyer, said the potential release of
his client was exciting, but he remained adamant that Criner should
have gotten a new trial after the initial DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think anybody could stand there and look at that new
evidence,'' Mr. Charlton said, ``and not think that he may be
innocent and deserve a new trial.''

DESPITE BIG ORDERS, BOEING REMAINS IN AIRBUS SHADOW AT AIR SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Boeing Co. announced orders at the Farnborough
International air show Monday for more than 110 new jets worth
about $12 billion at list prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the Seattle-based aerospace giant still found itself being
elbowed out of the spotlight on the world aerospace stage by Airbus
and its A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   The super jumbo is intended to break Boeing's 30-year monopoly
that it has enjoyed with its flagship 747, and talk of the A3XX is
dominating this year's air show.
</P>
<P>
   With a standing-room-only crowd of reporters and photographers
pressing in, Airbus signed the first two customers for the A3XX _
Emirates and Air France _ and all but guaranteed it would launch
the 555-seat jet by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Noel Forgeard, chief executive officer of Airbus, said at a news
conference that the European airplane maker would match Boeing in
new orders this year, even though Airbus is now behind. He said
Airbus would announce orders for as many as 200 planes at the
Farnborough show this week and end the year with more than 500.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the orders announced Monday by Airbus were firm, and
a spokesman said they will not be added to this year's Airbus
totals until they are firm.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the air show, Boeing had 326 firm orders to 239 for
Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's orders Monday also are not completely in the bag,
though they are a lot closer to being firm than those announced by
its archrival.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing orders were for the 777, including two new ultra long
range versions known as the 777-300X and 777-200X, and for the next
generation 737, which is having a strong sales year.
</P>
<P>
   All but six of the Boeing orders were by leasing giants GE
Capital Aviation Services and International Lease Finance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital said it had signed an agreement to buy up to 143
Boeing jetliners, which includes options.
</P>
<P>
   President Henry Hubschman said GE Capital will buy 10 of the
777X jets, which were launched earlier this year. In addition, GE
Capital will buy five of the current model 777-200ER.
</P>
<P>
   The 777-200ER has an average list price of about $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   The leasing company did not specify the mix of the 10 777X jets
that it will order. The 777-300X has an average list price of about
$215 million, and the 777-200X an average list price of about $190
million.
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital also took options and purchase rights for 10 more
777X jets and seven 777-200ER jets.
</P>
<P>
   Its biggest order was for 45 of the next generation 737s. And it
exercised options for 14 more of the popular twin jets.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the model, the average list price of a next
generation 737 can range from about $42 million up to about $60
million.
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital took options for another 52 next generation 737s.
</P>
<P>
   The 74 firm orders and exercised options are worth about $5.5
billion at list prices, Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
   Hubschman said a firm agreement to buy the 74 jets from Boeing
should be completed within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate any problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The big order with Boeing, he said, ``fills out our order book
for several years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   International Lease said it will buy up to 40 Boeing jetliners,
including eight of the 777X jets and 25 of the 777-200ER models.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery is scheduled from 2002 through 2009.
</P>
<P>
   It also plans to order seven next generation 737s, to be
delivered between 2003 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The order is worth nearly $7 billion at list prices.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Udvar-Hazy, president and chief executive officer of
International Lease, said he expects to sign a firm agreement with
Boeing for the 40 planes in the next 45 to 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mulally, president of Boeing commercial airplanes, said the
large 777 order from GE Capital and International Lease is further
evidence that Asia, a significant market for that plane, has
recovered from its economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   The new long range 777X jets are primarily targeted for Asian
airlines that need to fly 300 or more passengers up to 10,000 miles
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   One other 777X order was announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   All Nippon Airways said is will buy six of the 777-300X jets.
Four of those are conversions from a previous 777 order.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the blockbuster order day, Boeing found itself
overshadowed by Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Following a morning news conference during which he said Airbus
has proved it is Boeing's equal, Forgeard could not wait to get
back to the Airbus press chalet for the first A3XX order
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Emirates, the flag carrier of the United Arab Emirates, became
the first airline to officially commit to the A3XX project, which
has been years in the making and is still not officially launched.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier, which plans to use the A3XX on trunk routes from
its Dubai hub, including service to London, the Asia-Pacific region
and North America, said it will order seven A3XXs and took options
for an additional five.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new airliner offers a level of comfort and space never
seen before in the airline industry,'' Emirates Chairman Sheik
Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said as he signed the memorandum of
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard said any orders for the A3XX can't be made firm until
the plane is officially launched.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven planes ordered by Emirates, five are passenger
versions and two will be freighters.
</P>
<P>
   The Emirates chairman put the value of the order at $1.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger version of the A3XX has an average list price of
about $230 million. The launch customers are believed to be getting
discounts of as much as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Deliveries of the passenger versions will begin in February
2006, with the freighters to follow in the spring 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman said Emirates could use the aircraft today on some
routes, including London and Bangkok. The airline is experiencing
rapid growth and would double the number of passengers it carries
over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   After the Emirates announcement, Air France said it signed a
letter of intent for 10 A3XXs, which it plans to use initially on
five routes, including those from Paris to New York, Montreal and
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Cyril Spinetta, Air France's president, said the aircraft
would enter service on five of the airline's busiest
intercontinental routes and should cut costs by between 15 and 20
per cent.
</P>
<P>
   A firm order will depend on capacity at some airports, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus also announced that CIT Aerospace, an operating unit of
the CIT Group, has signed a letter of intent to buy 35 single-aisle
Airbus jets and 15 of the 330 model widebody planes.
</P>
<P>
   Air France and Emirates were two of nine customers that
expressed an initial interest earlier this year in a total of 52 of
the planes. Three of the possible customers have not been
identified by Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines, Qantas, Virgin Atlantic and leasing company
International Lease Finance Corporation have also said they are
interested in the super jumbo.
</P>
<P>
   At the morning news conference, Forgeard said he was confident
Airbus would secure enough orders _ probably about 50 _ to launch
the A3XX by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard said Airbus plans to turn disclosed letters of intent
for 22 of the 52 A3XX into memos of understanding at this week's
air show.
</P>
<P>
   While Airbus was signing up customers for its A3XX, Boeing was
sharing its latest market forecast with reporters. It questions the
need for very many planes the size of the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing believes the market is only about 87 planes the size of
the A3XX over the next 10 years, said Randy Baseler, Boeing's vice
president of marketing for commercial aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Baseler said Boeing sees the dominant part of the market being
served by intermediate-sized, twin-aisle aircraft, particularly in
the next three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   The world fleet is projected to more than double, to 31,755
aircraft in the next 20 years, from about 13,670 in 1999, Baseler
said.
</P>
<P>
   That increase means airlines will need 22,300 new airplanes by
2019, worth about $1.5 trillion, Baseler said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Boeing expanded its market forecast to
include aviation services (including maintenance, training and
updates for planes), an area that Boeing views as increasingly
important in its business plans.
</P>
<P>
   The total market, including planes and services, will be worth
more than $4 trillion over the next 20 years, Baseler said.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial services market will be worth more than $2.6
trillion of that amount, he said.

<P>
   LA PORTE, TEXAS _ The Texas Independence Trail, a dreary stretch
of road on the outskirts of Houston, is inspiring in name only.
</P>
<P>
   Lined with some of the state's largest oil refineries and
petrochemical plants, the trail ends in the murky town of La Porte
at the monument to the Battle of San Jacinto, an obelisk which,
from afar, is virtually indistinguishable from the dozens of
smokestacks that dot the skyline.
</P>
<P>
   In the smog that often hangs over this hallowed ground, it is
hard to conjure up images of 1836, when Texan soldiers crying
``Remember the Alamo!'' defeated the advancing Mexican army.
</P>
<P>
   If Al Gore has his way, this place will generate a new rallying
cry in the closing months of the 2000 presidential campaign:
``Remember La Porte!''
</P>
<P>
   In its bid to undermine George W. Bush's record as governor of
Texas, the Gore campaign is painting a grim picture of the state's
environmental woes on Bush's watch.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the criticisms from several environmental groups,
you might think that Texas's rivers are awash in industrial waste
and its cities choked with pollution as bad as that of the old
Soviet block.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent letter printed in several national newspapers, a
Sierra Club official thundered: ``Voting for Bush is the kiss of
ecological and planetary death! To do so is to risk the lives of
our children and our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Bush become president, he is unlikely to be the earth's
destroyer. Still, he hardly bills himself as its savior, either. On
the campaign trail, offering himself as a ``Reformer with
Results,'' he perks up when he discusses education reform and tax
cuts in Texas, yet rarely mentions the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Even his aides admit it has never been exactly at the top of his
agenda. The Gore camp sees this as a chink in his armor, and will
no doubt run ominous advertisements _ or give a wink and nod to ads
run by others _ about billowing smokestacks and miles-long traffic
jams in the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   Are things in Texas really that bad? And is Governor Bush to
blame? To the first question, the answer is undoubtedly yes.
</P>
<P>
   As the heart of America's petrochemical and oil-refining
industries, Texas puts more chemicals into the air than any other
state, and by most rankings is the state with the worst toxin level
in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Were Texas a country in its own right, it would be the world's
seventh-biggest national emitter of carbon dioxide _ even though
the latest data from the NAFTA Environmental Commission show that
Texas's toxic release levels actually declined by 15 percent from
1995 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The largest problem is the dangerous amount of nitrogen oxide
(which mixes with vehicle-exhaust gas to create ozone, and then
smog) coughed out by the state's industrial plants.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Houston surpassed Los Angeles as the country's
smoggiest city, Texas had the nation's 25 highest ozone
measurements and 90 percent of the nationwide readings deemed
``very unhealthy'' by the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush took office, the number of days when Texan cities
have exceeded federal ozone standards has doubled, and Houston and
Dallas currently face federal deadlines to make sharp cuts in air
pollution or risk losing federal money for their roads.
</P>
<P>
   As pollution gets worse, environmentalists are constantly
knocking heads with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission (TNRCC), the state's environment-regulating agency. They
accuse the agency's officials of deliberately delaying plans to
clean up the air, in part because of heavy lobbying by oil-industry
executives.
</P>
<P>
   The officials reply that Rome was not built in a day, and they
cannot be expected to clean up Houston overnight: after all, it
took 30 years to get that way. The dramatic growth of Texas's
cities over the past decade, they add, has not exactly helped.
</P>
<P>
   This does not persuade the environmentalists. They point to
cities such as Charlotte, N.C. and Salt Lake City, Utah: places
that have grown as fast as Houston and Dallas and yet have managed
to improve their air.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Marston of the Texas chapter of the Environmental Defense
Fund is scathing: the agency people ``pretended like (air
pollution) wasn't happening, then shrugged their shoulders and said
it wasn't their fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas's woes are not Bush's creation. It needed a lot of years
(and several governors) to create an air pollution crisis, and Bush
inherited most of the trouble when he took office in 1995
</P>
<P>
   Given most Texans' dislike of regulations, there has never been
a strong grass-roots environmental movement in the state, so the
issue has never been high on the agenda of any governor. Yet, even
if he is not responsible for the problem, he has not been notably
energetic in looking for solutions to it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is fond of saying that you cannot regulate or sue your way
to clean air and water. It is a nonchalant way to approach the
issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Consider the centerpiece of his present environmental policy,
the plan to clean up the state's so-called ``grandfathered''
industrial plants.
</P>
<P>
   Grandfathered plants, built before the state's Clean Air Act in
1971, are bigger polluters than newer ones, accounting for 36
percent of the chemicals Texas releases into the atmosphere each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, rather than order the older plants to comply with new
environmental standards, Bush instead worked with industrial
leaders to arrange a system by which the plants' owners are
supposed to take part in the plan voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Texas's industrialists are not bursting with the spirit of
volunteerism. As of last month, two-and-a-half years after the
scheme was introduced, only 30 out of 461 plants not already facing
federal restrictions had volunteered to comply with environmental
guidelines; they will reduce grandfathered emissions by only 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   This does not surprise environmentalists, who have long argued
that any policy of pollution-reduction that does not include a
threat of punishment for non-compliance is useless.
</P>
<P>
   However, according to Ralph Marquez of the TNRCC, it is too
early to pass judgment on the success of the policy, since the
deadline for plants to take part voluntarily does not fall until
September next year.
</P>
<P>
   He praises Bush for his ``new approach'' to environmental
regulation, and for endorsing during the 1999 legislative session a
bill that ordered emission cutbacks in Texas's electric power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in the view of Marquez, has consistently avoided adopting
the ``anti-industry philosophy'' of his Democratic predecessor, Ann
Richards.
</P>
<P>
   For many environmentalists, this is exactly the problem. They
argue that Bush has in effect let the oil industry dictate the
state's environmental policy.
</P>
<P>
   All of the TNRCC's three present commissioners have backgrounds
in industry; Marquez, for instance, formerly worked for the
Monsanto chemical company. And some of the industrialists who
helped to create the voluntary pollution-reduction plan are among
the most generous contributors to Bush's presidential campaign. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,300) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A cozy relationship between government and big business is
nothing new in Texas. Yet it does not go down well in
pro-environment states like Washington and Colorado, which Bush
hopes to win in November.
</P>
<P>
   And he faces, in Gore, an opponent who has every intention of
making the most of Texas's environmental troubles.
</P>
<P>
   If the Gore dagger strikes home, Bush may feel like the
disobedient son haunted by his father's words.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, George Bush senior went to Boston Harbor and attacked
the environmental record of his opponent in that year's
presidential race, Michael Dukakis: ``My opponent has said that he
will do for America what he has done for Massachusetts. That's what
I fear for my country.'' &QL;

the campaign trail, offering himself as a ``Reformer with
Results,'' he perks up when he discusses education reform and tax
cuts in Texas, yet rarely mentions the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Even his aides admit it has never been exactly at the top of his
agenda. The Gore camp sees this as a chink in his armor, and will
no doubt run ominous advertisements _ or give a wink and nod to ads
run by others _ about billowing smokestacks and miles-long traffic
jams in the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   Are things in Texas really that bad? And is Governor Bush to
blame? To the first question, the answer is undoubtedly yes.
</P>
<P>
   As the heart of America's petrochemical and oil-refining
industries, Texas puts more chemicals into the air than any other
state, and by most rankings is the state with the worst toxin level
in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Were Texas a country in its own right, it would be the world's
seventh-biggest national emitter of carbon dioxide _ even though
the latest data from the NAFTA Environmental Commission show that
Texas's toxic release levels actually declined by 15 percent from
1995 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The largest problem is the dangerous amount of nitrogen oxide
(which mixes with vehicle-exhaust gas to create ozone, and then
smog) coughed out by the state's industrial plants.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Houston surpassed Los Angeles as the country's
smoggiest city, Texas had the nation's 25 highest ozone
measurements and 90 percent of the nationwide readings deemed
``very unhealthy'' by the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush took office, the number of days when Texan cities
have exceeded federal ozone standards has doubled, and Houston and
Dallas currently face federal deadlines to make sharp cuts in air
pollution or risk losing federal money for their roads.
</P>
<P>
   As pollution gets worse, environmentalists are constantly
knocking heads with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission (TNRCC), the state's environment-regulating agency. They
accuse the agency's officials of deliberately delaying plans to
clean up the air, in part because of heavy lobbying by oil-industry
executives.
</P>
<P>
   The officials reply that Rome was not built in a day, and they
cannot be expected to clean up Houston overnight: after all, it
took 30 years to get that way. The dramatic growth of Texas's
cities over the past decade, they add, has not exactly helped.
</P>
<P>
   This does not persuade the environmentalists. They point to
cities such as Charlotte, N.C. and Salt Lake City, Utah: places
that have grown as fast as Houston and Dallas and yet have managed
to improve their air.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Marston of the Texas chapter of the Environmental Defense
Fund is scathing: the agency people ``pretended like (air
pollution) wasn't happening, then shrugged their shoulders and said
it wasn't their fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas's woes are not Bush's creation. It needed a lot of years
(and several governors) to create an air pollution crisis, and Bush
inherited most of the trouble when he took office in 1995
</P>
<P>
   Given most Texans' dislike of regulations, there has never been
a strong grass-roots environmental movement in the state, so the
issue has never been high on the agenda of any governor. Yet, even
if he is not responsible for the problem, he has not been notably
energetic in looking for solutions to it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is fond of saying that you cannot regulate or sue your way
to clean air and water. It is a nonchalant way to approach the
issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Consider the centerpiece of his present environmental policy,
the plan to clean up the state's so-called ``grandfathered''
industrial plants.
</P>
<P>
   Grandfathered plants, built before the state's Clean Air Act in
1971, are bigger polluters than newer ones, accounting for 36
percent of the chemicals Texas releases into the atmosphere each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, rather than order the older plants to comply with new
environmental standards, Bush instead worked with industrial
leaders to arrange a system by which the plants' owners are
supposed to take part in the plan voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Texas's industrialists are not bursting with the spirit of
volunteerism. As of last month, two-and-a-half years after the
scheme was introduced, only 30 out of 461 plants not already facing
federal restrictions had volunteered to comply with environmental
guidelines; they will reduce grandfathered emissions by only 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   This does not surprise environmentalists, who have long argued
that any policy of pollution-reduction that does not include a
threat of punishment for non-compliance is useless.
</P>
<P>
   However, according to Ralph Marquez of the TNRCC, it is too
early to pass judgment on the success of the policy, since the
deadline for plants to take part voluntarily does not fall until
September next year.
</P>
<P>
   He praises Bush for his ``new approach'' to environmental
regulation, and for endorsing during the 1999 legislative session a
bill that ordered emission cutbacks in Texas's electric power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in the view of Marquez, has consistently avoided adopting
the ``anti-industry philosophy'' of his Democratic predecessor, Ann
Richards.
</P>
<P>
   For many environmentalists, this is exactly the problem. They
argue that Bush has in effect let the oil industry dictate the
state's environmental policy.
</P>
<P>
   All of the TNRCC's three present commissioners have backgrounds
in industry; Marquez, for instance, formerly worked for the
Monsanto chemical company. And some of the industrialists who
helped to create the voluntary pollution-reduction plan are among
the most generous contributors to Bush's presidential campaign. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,300) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A cozy relationship between government and big business is
nothing new in Texas. Yet it does not go down well in
pro-environment states like Washington and Colorado, which Bush
hopes to win in November.
</P>
<P>
   And he faces, in Gore, an opponent who has every intention of
making the most of Texas's environmental troubles.
</P>
<P>
   If the Gore dagger strikes home, Bush may feel like the
disobedient son haunted by his father's words.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, George Bush senior went to Boston Harbor and attacked
the environmental record of his opponent in that year's
presidential race, Michael Dukakis: ``My opponent has said that he
will do for America what he has done for Massachusetts. That's what
I fear for my country.'' &QL;

CONVICTED PHILADELPHIA KILLER IS ORDERED EXTRADITED TO U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The prime minister of France has ordered the extradition to the
United States of Ira S. Einhorn, once a charismatic leader of
Philadelphia's counterculture who was convicted in absentia of
murdering his girlfriend 22 years ago, legal authorities announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given his track record, I am still concerned that he is going
to flee,'' the Philadelphia district attorney, Lynne Abraham, said.
With a final legal challenge still possible, she noted that Einhorn
has been a fugitive for 20 years and has vowed never to return to
his home city where he had been celebrated as a leading hippie
advocate of peace, mysticism and environmentalism.
</P>
<P>
   The extradition was ordered by French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin, said Abraham, who had no estimate on when American
authorities hoped to regain custody of Einhorn, now 60. He has been
fighting extradition since he was discovered three years ago, after
an extensive search across Europe, living under an alias in
Champagne-Mouton in the Bordeaux region of France.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn jumped $40,000 bail and disappeared as he was about to
go on trial in the 1977 killing of Holly Maddux, a Bryn Mawr
College alumna who had been his lover. Police found Maddux's body
stuffed in a steamer trunk in Einhorn's apartment 18 months after
she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn's transition from counterculture guru to accused
murderer caused a sensation in Philadelphia. He denied committing
the murder, saying the Central Intelligence Agency, KGB or other
``large intelligence agencies'' sought to frame him because he had
uncovered classified mind-control experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn has 60 days to appeal with the Council of State,
France's highest administrative tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after lengthy legal maneuvering, the French Court of
Appeals ruled that Einhorn could be extradited to the United States
provided that he would be granted a new trial and would not face
the death penalty. The court decided to reverse its earlier order
protecting Einhorn after Pennsylvania passed a law in 1998 granting
people convicted in absentia the right to a new trial if they
returned and demanded one.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn's lawyer, Theodore Simon, said Monday there was no way
to guarantee a retrial. The 1998 law, he said, was clearly
unconstitutional because it would violate the separation of powers
in having a state legislature attempt to force a retrial on the
court system.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn has been free since he was arrested three years ago. He
was required to report weekly to authorities in France where he
lived in a remote millhouse with his Swedish-born wife.

 &HT;    Golf club group hits green with winning Lotto ticket
 &HT;    By Molly Hennessy-Fiske
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Russ Kelly had a new house he was struggling
to pay for as a golf club manager. Cathy Wilson dreamed of owning
her own home, but could barely scrape together gas money to get to
work at the club Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Kelly is planning a trip to Australia, Wilson
may get that house after all, and everybody in town knows why: Bent
Pine Golf Club is the ``home'' of the $65 million jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew,'' Robin Kelly, 30, said of the hours after
staff discovered the office pool won the lottery Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we could even tell them,'' Russ Kelly, 34, said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that they live in a small town, or even in the same
part of town. The group is diverse, ranging in age from 19 to
50-something. Many in the pool of 26 are young (Kelly pegs the
average age at 28), some just hired a few months ago. All but one,
a florist who contracts with the club, work there, but with so many
people moving in different circles, Kelly said, word got around.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the pats on the back at restaurants, 29 phone messages
in a morning, and a pressing need to organize. Since a club
dishwasher spotted the winning numbers _ 9-10-14-26-34-42 _ in a
newspaper and called the clubhouse early Sunday, the group has met
twice to discuss their strategy. They are dividing the money
roughly evenly _ about $2.5 million apiece _ with slight variation
depending on how long individuals paid in. The pool has been going
for five years, and when Joanne Dowling purchased the winning
ticket Thursday afternoon, it was with $2 from each player.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the Bent Pine group has 80 days to claim their winnings
as a lump sum (about $32.1 million, according to a lottery
spokesman), 180 days if they choose a 30-year series of payments.
Kelly, the unofficial spokesman for the group, said that after
meeting Monday afternoon and trooping over to a local bank to place
the unsigned ticket in a safe deposit box, they remain undecided.
According to current state lottery figures, 75 percent of recent
winners chose the lump sum.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Kelly said, the group will put the money in a trust
fund. Then those who gathered Monday with stories of the cars and
boats they spotted on the lots that morning are on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vero resident H. Roy Kaplan, author of ``Lottery Winners:
How They Won and How Winning Changed Their Lives,'' said pools can
often lead to infighting among winners. But compared to those he
studied in the 1970s and 1980s, Kaplan said recent winners benefit
from more accessible financial counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today people are more savvy and you've got the Internet,''
Kaplan said during an interview from his Tampa office. ``Certainly
everyone talks about investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the group, Russ Kelly said he will be back at
work this week. The state's newest millionaires will be washing
dishes and sorting files until they charter that bus north to
redeem their ticket in Tallahassee next week. And Kaplan said
things could stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even large winners, they look for something to do, and work is
the glue that binds us to society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly admits the workplace atmosphere may have to change with
club staff and guests suddenly on equal financial footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's definitely a concern,'' he said, ``I mean, do you want
millionaires working for you?''
</P>
<P>
   For now, co-workers are satisfied with collective
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we do, we vote,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Schlitt is looking into college. Siblings Heather and
Nathan Kovatch are spreading the word to their family. Wilson is
looking for a home her kids would like, and the Kellys are planning
a cookout _ after an appearance on Good Morning America. In the
end, six little numbers were more of a big relief than a big win.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kelly: ``At least now we can afford to live where we are.''

MUSIC REVIEW: A SUMMER TRIBUTE TO BACH IN SONG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: New England)   By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Conn. _ Much of the music world heads for the hills of
New England during the summer, and so, in a Bach year, does Bach.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he is a regular visitor in concerts of the New England
Bach Festival at Marlboro, Vt., among others. But the activity has
stepped up markedly this year, the 250th anniversary of the
composer's death, with events like the ``Bach 2K'' concerts this
weekend at the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The first concert here, on Friday, offered the ``Brandenburg''
Concertos, with some performers (the Tokyo String Quartet) more
surprising in this repertory than others (like the harpsichordist
Kenneth Cooper). But alas, that enticing prospect conflicted with a
Marlboro concert offering cantatas, as the Saturday concert here
also did.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Bach Festival, in its 32nd year, was founded by
Blanche Moyse, herself a venerable institution: a founder of the
Marlboro Festival 50 years ago and a longtime Bach adept. On Friday
she conducted the Blanche Moyse Chorale and the festival orchestra
in three cantatas at the Persons Auditorium of Marlboro College.
</P>
<P>
   Or rather, she conducted when needed. In small-scale movements,
involving a singer and continuo with, perhaps, an obbligato player,
she sat and beamed on the performance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as frail as she looked, there was no lack of vitality in the
performances. In the delightful duet ``Nun verschwinden alle
Plagen'' (``Now all torments vanish'') from Cantata No. 32,
``Liebster Jesu, Mein Verlangen'' (``Dearest Jesus, My Desire''),
her quick clip nearly outstripped the abilities of her talented
fiddlers.
</P>
<P>
   The rich mix of cantatas ranged from the unfamiliar No. 60, ``O
Ewigkeit, Du Donnerwort'' (``Eternity, Thou Thunderous Word''),
with its inventive use of duets, to the famous No. 147, ``Herz und
Mund und Tat und Leben'' (``Heart and Lips and Deed and Conduct''),
with the ``Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring'' chorale descending twice.
(Bach knew a good thing when he found it.) In addition, Steven Paul
Spears, a tenor, sang the ``Benedictus'' from Bach's Mass in B
minor, a bonus enhanced by the flute playing of Paula Robison.
</P>
<P>
   Hyunah Yu, a soprano, was the most impressive of the vocal
soloists, with clear, secure tone. Randall Scarlata, a fine
baritone, lacked the bass notes occasionally needed.
</P>
<P>
   Moyse's chorus, 22 strong, achieved what good intentions could.
The basic sonority is that of so many amateur groups: fuzzy and
unfocused, with little core or bite.
</P>
<P>
   The Norfolk concert on Saturday avoided any such problem by
having the four vocal soloists sing the choruses. There being only
two choral movements, opening and closing Cantata No. 8, ``Liebster
Gott, Wenn Werd Ich Sterben'' (``Dearest God, When Will I Die?''),
this practice may well have been merely an economy of chamber
scale.
</P>
<P>
   But it also carries the cachet of advanced musicological
thinking; Joshua Rifkin and others maintain that Bach probably had
only one voice per part in most of his own choral performances. In
any case, it worked well enough here: remarkably so in view of the
weakness of individual voices (including a veritable caricature of
a countertenor), as revealed in solo numbers.
</P>
<P>
   By far the finest vocalist was Richard Lalli, a baritone, who
also contributed the solo Cantata No. 82, ``Ich Habe Genug'' (``I
Have Enough''). His approach seemed a bit dry and reserved at times
in this warmest of outpourings, and the addition of ornaments in
the repeat of the central aria ruffled the inherent serenity of
this lullaby, but Lalli won the listener over in the end, rejoicing
with Bach and the text at the prospect of death.
</P>
<P>
   The Norfolk concerts were dedicated to the memory of Ronald
Roseman, an oboist and Bach specialist who worked at the festival
for more than a quarter of a century before his death in February.
Roseman took a hand in programming this death-haunted concert, Joan
Panetti, the festival's director, said from the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, he quickly proposed ``Ich Habe Genug,'' as
well he might have, with its prominent oboe solos in the first and
last movements. As it was, Randall Wolfgang played them ably, and
Jennifer Grim was a deft, smooth flute soloist in ``Liebster
Gott.''
</P>
<P>
   The extras here were highly variable. David Connell, an
organist, and a brass quintet offered three chorales to start, all
well and good.
</P>
<P>
   Less to the point, the guitar virtuoso Eliot Fisk opened the
second half with a lute prelude and his arrangement of the Chaconne
from Bach's D minor Violin Partita. If the steady tread and the
cumulative magnificence of that great movement can be achieved on
the guitar, they were not apparent here.
</P>
<P>
   Another brass quintet ( this one sorely undercut by trombone
playing woefully out of tune) performed a movement from ``The Art
of Fugue'' and another chorale. And the sour notes extended to
Panetti's introduction, with recourse to the hoary myths of these
as last works and of dictation by the composer from his deathbed.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the Bach year should be an occasion to dispel myths once
and for all and set the record straight. Happily, a tool is readily
at hand: Christoph Wolff's magisterial new biography, ``Johann
Sebastian Bach: The Learned Musician.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a city that takes theater very seriously, Kama
Ginkas was arguably the most successful director of the season that
just ended. He certainly was the busiest.
</P>
<P>
   Five of his plays were staged through the year, each one in its
own way a hit. His ``Pushkin.Duel.Death'' was considered the best
original work to come out of last year's nationwide Pushkin
extravaganza. This spring he picked up a Golden Mask prize for `'A
Room of Laughter,'' a popular one-act play that he directed for
Oleg Tabakov's studio. And the premiere last fall of `'The Black
Monk,'' a striking dramatization of Chekhov's mystical short story,
dazzled even Moscow's jaded critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is that Ginkas has hit his peak,'' said John
Freedman, an American scholar and critic of the Russian theater.
``He is racing to keep up with his abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   By early summer Ginkas, 59, was rehearsing another play, based
on Oscar Wilde's ``Happy Prince.'' Watching Ginkas in rehearsal is
like watching his actors perform: the process begins and ends with
an intensity that radiates both heat and clarity. No detail, no
object, no movement is too small to escape his attention; every
prop, every gesture, takes on meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your fingers!'' he shouted during one rehearsal, pointing
accusingly to an actress' right hand. ``Your fingers are moving.
That makes it a mise en scene, a fact. It could mean many things.
It could mean you are bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Boredom is not something Ginkas usually worries about. His plays
are not the kind that let the audience off the hook. For one thing,
audience and actors are typically packed into small spaces. In
``The Black Monk,'' the stage is put on the theater's upper
balcony, with the audience wrapped around three sides. Two of his
other plays are staged in a rehearsal room, with the audience
acting as a prop. ``A Room of Laughter'' takes place on the main
stage, but in a box.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly it is a very human drama that keeps the audience's
attention riveted as Ginkas works his way in and around the
emotionally dense landscape of his characters, some of them drawn
from masterpieces of Russian literature and moments of Russian
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plays arouse catharsis, shock, even hysteria, but there are
viewers who would rather not be touched,'' he said. ``I can't say
that I am speaking to the whole of humanity, or even all of Russia,
or Moscow, but I am speaking to the audience of those people for
whom these things are interesting.'' Whether it is the tortured
tragedy of the Dostoyevskian character of Katerina Ivanovna in
``K.I. From Crime,'' or the complex mesh of grand and petty motives
that drove Russia's greatest poet to his death in
``Pushkin.Duel.Death,'' his plays ensnare the spectator the way a
spider's web catches a fly. In ``The Black Monk'' the audience is
left poised on the edge of a balcony, gazing into the blackness of
a theater that becomes the haunt of a mysterious creature who is
either a source of genius, of madness or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Ginkas, indifference is a catastrophe,'' says Anatoly
Smelyansky, a scholar of the Russian theater, who is head of the
Moscow Arts Theater school studio. ``He has been playing this game
for many years. It is always a bit of a game: some naturalism, some
aspect of real life, and characters that he stretches to their
limit. For all of this love of theatrics, jokes and games, he has a
taste for reality, for the raw stuff of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginkas' characters are intense but they are also nuanced, which
he says is one of the legacies he inherited from his first teacher,
the great Leningrad director Georgi Tovstonogov. ``He found humor
in tragic moments,'' Ginkas said. ``There was realism, but the
eccentricities were all inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Jewish in Lithuania on the eve of the Nazi occupation,
Ginkas was one of a handful of children who were saved from being
shipped off to Auschwitz. He is also a cultural survivor, one of
the few members of a generation of Soviet theater directors who
came of age just as the Khruschchev-era ``thaw'' was coming to an
end, and who managed to stick it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation started work at the end of the 1960s, at the end
of the thaw,'' he said. ``We were not shot; we were not sent into
exile, but we were battered by shrapnel. Many simply left the
profession and did something else. Many were so strongly poisoned
that they never worked to their potential. Those before us managed
to accomplish something during the `thaw,' before getting hit on
the head. We were like idiots. We rushed right out, stuck our necks
out, and wham _ we got hit before we even had a chance to do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child Ginkas survived because his parents managed to hide
him in a Roman Catholic convent. As an individualist in the
Brezhnev era, he also lay low, ducking the radar of Soviet cultural
orthodoxy. For a time, he was a director of a state theater in
Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, but even there his free spirit was more
than the authorities could tolerate. He returned to Leningrad,
where he staged shows in private apartments and built a reputation
as a theatrical dissident.
</P>
<P>
   At the first glimmering of cultural liberalization in the early
1980s, he was lured to Moscow, where he was invited to the Moscow
Art Theater and Mossoviet, before settling at the Young Spectators
Theater where his wife, Genrietta Yanovskaya, was made artistic
director.
</P>
<P>
   As a student of Tovstonogov, Ginkas is firmly fixed in the great
Russian tradition of psychological theater, which began with
Konstantin Stanislavsky and Vsevolod Meyerhold. Their photographs _
together with portraits of Joseph Brodsky and Andrei Sakharov _
adorn the office at the Young Spectators Theater that he shares
with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stanislavsky, Meyerhold, Vakhtangov, they were the titans,''
he said. ``Then there were the gods: Tovstonogov, Yuri Lyubimov''
(director of the Taganka Theater). ``The task of the gods was
different. The titans had to create the foundations, to create
heaven and earth from the cosmos. Our generation is the heroes: our
job is to conserve and refine, make it more usable, combine the
uncombinable.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending several years abroad, mostly in Helsinki, Ginkas
returned to Moscow in 1994 with a production of ``K.I. From
Crime,'' a disturbing and moving play about a character in ``Crime
and Punishment.'' In 1997 it won a prize at France's theater
festival in Avignon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are watching what happens to a person,'' Ginkas explained.
``It is not clear whether she is insane or if the actress is
provoking the audience. There are circuslike movements, but she is
no clown. There is an element of the game, but it is nuanced and
paradoxical.''
</P>
<P>
   Having survived its long bout with Socialist Realism, Russian
theater is now emerging _ battered but not defeated _ from its
first decade of laissez-faire capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100 theaters in Moscow alone _ and another 400 in
the rest of the country _ Russian theater has survived, in large
part because Russians refuse to let it die. ``There were several
times when Russian theater should have fallen flat on its face, but
it has survived every crisis with flying colors,'' said Freedman,
who is the theater critic for the English-language Moscow Times.
``Russians cannot imagine themselves without theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginkas describes theater as one of Russia's few ``brand-name''
products. ``Theater is one of the few things we can still export,''
he said. ``Russian theater is like Sony. It is still the real
thing.''

DEMOCRATS PUSH PANEL CHAIRMAN ON HIS OWN MEDICARE DRUG BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Fla., Okla.)   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee
appeared to be dragging his feet, Democrats urged him Monday to
take action on his own proposal to establish prescription drug
benefits under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the chairman, Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del., the
Democrats on the committee prodded him to convene the panel ``as
early as possible, perhaps before the August recess,'' to vote on
legislation adding drug benefits to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Roth unveiled his proposal on July 10. Democrats said they liked
many of its features, including benefits that would be uniform
throughout the country, fully integrated into the Medicare program
and administered by the government, not by private insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators, including Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the
assistant majority leader, gave Roth's proposal a cool reception,
saying they feared that the costs could explode after a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Roth is in a tight race for re-election, running against Gov.
Thomas Carper, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Roth had reaped favorable publicity with his
proposal two weeks ago. But now, they said, they see no evidence
that he will try to push it through the Senate or even through his
own committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ginny Flynn, a spokeswoman for Roth, said he was revising his
proposal and would describe the changes at a meeting of the
committee behind closed doors on Thursday. But, she said, the
committee will not formally take up the legislation or vote on it
before the recess, which begins at the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show that drug prices and the need for
prescription drug coverage are major concerns of many voters.
</P>
<P>
   James M. Jordan, political director of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, which coordinates efforts to elect Democrats to
the Senate, said Roth's proposal was ``a cynical political move''
that had little chance of success in the Senate, now controlled by
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But several Democrats on the Finance Committee commended Roth's
effort, which would provide $40 billion over five years for drug
benefits. The Democrats said more money was needed and available,
now that the Congressional Budget Office has increased its estimate
of federal budget surpluses over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said: ``Sen. Roth deserved the kind of
commendation he received for his original proposal. It took
considerable political courage for him to break from the mantra
that this had to be done through private health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   A bill passed last month by the House would give subsidies to
insurance companies to entice them to provide drug benefits to
people on Medicare _ an approach opposed by President Clinton and
by most Democrats in Congress, who say it is unlikely to work.
</P>
<P>
   Under Roth's proposal, beneficiaries could stay in the original
Medicare program, with existing premiums and benefits, or they
could enroll in a high-option plan, which would provide drug
benefits but would also charge more for certain services, including
home health care and skilled nursing care.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Graham said: ``I don't think you ought to
create a disincentive for people to elect prescription drugs by
forcing them, and them alone, to bear the additional costs. The
people likely to need prescription medicines are the very ones most
likely to be using home health care and skilled nursing homes.''

BARAK VISITS THE GETTYSBURG BATTLEFIELD 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related MIDEAST-TALKS) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
  THURMONT, Md. _ The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, is known
back home for his love of military history. As chief of staff of
the Israeli army, he dazzled _ and disarmed _ parliamentary
committees with his knowledge of warriors from Alexander to
Napoleon. So with cabin fever intensifying at Camp David, Barak _
who was reported in the Israeli press to be in a gloomy mood and
confined to reading in his suite _ decided to take a break. He
requested a trip on Sunday to the Civil War battlefield at
Gettysburg.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In doing so, Barak was repeating a somber excursion arranged by
President Carter at his Camp David summit meeting for the Israeli
leader, Menachim Begin, and the Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat.
Carter later wrote in his memoirs that as the mediator between two
tough adversaries, he wanted to demonstrate the high cost of war.
</P>
<P>
   And what better place to do it than the site of one of the
deadliest battles in American history, where 51,000 men were killed
or wounded. To drive home the point that peace is preferable to
war, Carter led the two men to the spot known as High Water Mark on
Cemetery Ridge and personally explained what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Barak ended up at the same spot. He was accompanied by Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright. They traveled in a motorcade around
the battlefield, alighting at only two places: Round Top and High
Water Mark.
</P>
<P>
   There Barak learned the story of how Maj. Gen. George E.
Pickett's Confederate troops were shredded by the Union forces
under the command of Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade.
</P>
<P>
   Pickett led a final assault _ known as Pickett's charge _ on the
Union lines. About 13,000 soldiers set off down Cemetery Ridge and
into a meadow with Pickett's units in the middle. About 350 of his
men reached the focal point of the attack _ the High Water Mark _
before being engulfed on three sides by Union forces.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of Barak's impressions of the military
strategy _ just a photograph of Barak examining a cannon.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat opted for a more sedate outing. He has been the
guest of Albright on several occasions at her smart Georgetown home
this year, and on Saturday, Albright invited Arafat to her Virginia
farm. Recently, Albright said that being hostess to Arafat, who for
so many years was a pariah in Washington, was one of the things she
least imagined doing as secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   But she enjoyed entertaining him at lunch during his Washington
visits and he liked to ``chill out'' in the informality of her
home, she said. In Virginia, the visit was really informal.
Albright and Arafat took a strenuous walk through the long grass of
her fields. A photograph showed Albright in casual white pants and
T-shirt and a blue baseball cap striding alongside the former
guerrilla leader dressed in his fatigues, trailed by a posse of
Palestinian bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   PASSION AND ATTRITION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The descriptions of the atmosphere at Camp David by the
presidential spokesman, Joe Lockhart, have been so clinical that
they almost defy belief. There has been little hint in his accounts
of temper, frustration or stubbornness. Lockhart seems fairly
precise in describing the president's stamina, however. Clinton has
gone to bed at 5 a.m. on each of the last few days he has been at
Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Savir, an Israeli legislator who negotiated with the
Palestinians in secret over 1,100 days at the landmark Oslo talks,
said he was not surprised by the horrible hours. He describes peace
talks as a process of ``attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You work around the clock,'' he said. ``Generally there is a
combination of creativity and brinkmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Successful negotiators, Savir said, possess a combination of
passion and patience. And as the mediator-in-chief, Clinton had the
right psychological touch: the compassion to understand the
different personalities of Arafat and Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian likes to extend deadlines as far as possible;
the Israeli favors putting proposals on the table and cutting a
deal. Thus, it is not surprising that so far, the two adversaries
have not met face-to-face very much at Camp David, although they
did sit on either side of Clinton Monday night at dinner _ with
Chelsea on the other side of Barak.
</P>
<P>
   But the members of the three negotiating teams have seen each
other, day in and day out. The Americans, the Palestinians and the
Israelis have all known each other from painstaking negotiating
since the Oslo accords of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   So when Clinton announced last Wednesday night that the peace
talks were over, emotions took over. With motorcades in position
ready to drive down the mountain from Camp David, Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators began hugging and kissing each other.
</P>
<P>
   LOCKHART'S DEADLINE
</P>
<P>
   The most frequent question now: when will the talks end? They
have gone far longer than most expectations. The Republican
Convention begins next Monday. Could Clinton let the summit meeting
cut into George W. Bush's crowning? Lockhart said Monday that Bush
had been gracious, saying that partisan politics should not
interfere with the work toward peace. But it was highly unlikely,
Lockhart suggested, that it would be useful to string out the talks
for another week. A rumor swept the elementary school that has
served as the press headquarters Monday afternoon that Clinton was
looking for a Wednesday wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart had another date in mind. ``There is an informal
deadline,'' he deadpanned. ``All parties want to be available to
watch Kathie Lee Gifford's last show on Friday.''

   U.S. selection process ensures fairness
</P>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ When one of his star athletes did not
qualify for the U.S. Olympic team because of injury a few years
back, gymnastics coach Bela Karolyi was asked how such a thing
would be handled in his homeland of communist Romania.
</P>
<P>
   How would the Olympic team be selected?
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi licked the tips of his fingers, clapped his hands and
started pointing at an imaginary row of gymnasts lined up before
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell them, `You, you, you, you, you and you,''' Karolyi
said, popping his finger at the phantom gymnasts. ```You're going.
You, you and you, you're staying.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of what happened in Sunday's Olympic Trials
200-meter final, you just might be thinking right about now,
``What's a little old-time Soviet-bloc selection politics among
friends?''
</P>
<P>
   USA Track &AMP; Field czar _ and we use the term czar loosely _
Craig Masback probably wishes he could indeed handpick the
200-meter Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   After Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene suffered a
double-whammy hammy in Sunday's highly hyped Trials finale, it was
Masback who looked most strained.
</P>
<P>
   After all the anticipation ended with Johnson and Greene
grasping at the backs of their legs, Masback put his frustration
about the flop bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, reality sucks,'' Masback said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you're John Capel, Floyd Heard or Coby Miller _
the athletes who did qualify in the 200 _ those are not exactly the
inspiring words you like to hear from the highest-ranking official
in track and field.
</P>
<P>
   Now, get out there and try not to embarrass us, guys! Go for the
bronze!
</P>
<P>
   Masback also likened the absence of what may be America's best
two sprinters in the 200 to a ``Shakespearean tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's no tragedy. It's the American way.
</P>
<P>
   In simplest terms, Johnson and Greene did not qualify in the 200
because they did not have what it took to do so.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reasons, their hamstrings cramped and strained. No
matter their stature, no matter their rankings, they could not make
it through the rounds unscathed. Capel, Heard and Miller did.
</P>
<P>
   Make excuses all you want _ the heat, the pressure, the hype,
the mere 1{ hours between semifinal and final races. Johnson even
fell back on the age-old copout: When in doubt, blame the media.
</P>
<P>
   But would anything be different in Sydney? The Trials are laid
out in the three-race, two-day format for a reason. That's how it's
done at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Under any other system in which the higher-ranking sprinters
could earn byes through the early rounds or not race at all, the
glittery stars might shine. But would medals?
</P>
<P>
   Racing only once or twice or getting handpicked for the Olympic
team does not offer the test of stamina and resilience that the
Trials do.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson in fact spoke some foreboding words to women's 200
sensation Marion Jones on the warmup track shortly after the
semifinal races Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who will participate in her first Olympic Games this
year, wondered to Johnson, ``Are they trying to kill us with the
finals an hour and a half after the semis?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson responded: ``Get used to it. That's how it is in the
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Trials are the ultimate track and field meet on
U.S. soil and the ultimate _ and only _ way to choose a U.S.
Olympic team. Maybe Johnson breezed through this same system four
years ago and went on to unprecedented double gold in Atlanta, but
that was four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is indeed sad to see such talents as Johnson and Greene
having to sit out. But they did race, and they did lose.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Johnson and Greene probably miscalculated
their pace through two days of heats and in Sunday's final. Capel,
Heard and Miller paced themselves nicely through the rounds and
then flashed to a sizzling final.
</P>
<P>
   Capel's 19.86, Heard's 19.88 and Miller's 19.96 marked only the
second time in the sport's history that three sprinters broke the
20-second barrier in the same race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Michael could have won if he didn't get hurt,'' Capel
said, smiling. ``But maybe he wouldn't have. You know, that was a
pretty fast race we ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet only moments after the final, some already were wondering
about the long-talked-about ``wild card'' entries for runners such
as Johnson and Greene.
</P>
<P>
   Why couldn't America's best sprinters be placed on the team in
circumstances of injury?
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Johnson said he would not accept such an
invitation. And what exactly would you tell Capel, Heard and
Miller, all of whom did everything right?
</P>
<P>
   As Tom Hanks said in the movie A League Of Their Own, ``Of
course it's hard. The hard is what makes it great.''

 &HT;    Emmitt Smith one of the last of the old-time Cowboys
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ While Emmitt Smith runs with the
football, technicolor images of old teammates flicker on the big
screen of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Freeze frame. Michael Irvin does his best Spiderman imitation.
</P>
<P>
   Freeze frame. Daryl Johnston delivers a headfirst block in the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Freeze frame. Deion Sanders falls to his knees and reminds the
world he's the baddest man around.
</P>
<P>
   Freeze it.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to that old gang? Nate Newton and Jay Novacek have
gone forward with their lives. Mark Tuinei has lost his. Rodney
Peete and Jason Garrett play in enemy colors.
</P>
<P>
   No more Playmaker, Moose or Prime Time.
</P>
<P>
   All good things must come to an end, and Smith knows his day
will come soon enough. He and Troy Aikman are about the only Dallas
Cowboys who have been teammates since George W. Bush's dad was
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the last of the Mohicans,'' Smith said on a sultry
afternoon in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is a constant reminder of a different time. Before the
Cowboys won their three Super Bowls in the 1990s, they drafted a
fresh-faced, bright-eyed kid from Florida who hasn't stopped
running. At 31, he ranks No. 3 on the all-time list of NFL rushers.
He needs 1,306 yards to reach Barry Sanders and 2,764 to pass the
late Walter Payton at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Barring injury, he will surpass Payton in 2002 or 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's down the road,'' Smith responds. ``Right now I'll deal
with today. We'll evaluate my situation at the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something different about this season, and it showed on
Smith's face when he was asked about the players who have come and
gone through the Cowboys' franchise. Without Irvin and Sanders,
this is a quieter team. Smith misses the rapid-fire talking from
their corners of the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   They were friends, teammates, brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a key word here _ family,'' Smith said. ``They talk
about family. This is real. Working with a group of people for a
common goal of one team _ win and lose together, sweat and cry
together. And bleed together. When you see (teammates leave), it
hurts, it's tough. It's like part of your family saying it's over.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, they are moving on to their real lives. But in the
sport, it's like a person has died. They are with you in spirit,
but they are no longer with you in body.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all part of a revolving-door business called the National
Football League. Smith said he has ``mourned'' after players leave
the team, but 2000 beckons. There are new challenges this year,
beginning with a new coaching staff, a new offense and perhaps
renewed enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emmitt's going to have a chance to do what he does all the
time, and that's to make plays when the ball is in his hands,''
first-year Coach Dave Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   The direction of the offense was questioned when Campo and new
offensive coordinator Jack Reilly installed a pass-friendly offense
designed to get the football to Joey Galloway and Rocket Ismail.
The receivers have never been fast, never been this deep Will
Smith's role change in his 11th season in the league?
</P>
<P>
   No, Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I thought we were probably high in the run end,''
Campo said. ``I still believe the way to win football games is to
be balanced. Every game is going to be different. It depends on how
the defense plays you.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has been remarkably consistent, rushing for 1,332 yards in
1998 and 1,397 in 1999. He is not the reason the Cowboys did not
make a reasonable playoff run during that span.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas finished 24th in the league in passing offense last
season, a major reason the Cowboys improved their stock of
receivers in the off-season. To help compensate for the loss of
Irvin, the Cowboys acquired Galloway, perhaps the fastest player in
the NFL, and Tennessee tight end Jackie Harris. Ismail, former
Texas Longhorn Wane McGarity, Jason Tucker and David LaFleur have
given Aikman the deepest group of receivers during his 12 years
with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't respect this, we'll open it up and pass the
ball down the field,'' Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of an air show should prolong Smith's career. Smith
ranks second in NFL history in total carries, quite an achievement
for someone who has been in the league only 10 seasons. It has
amazed some that Smith is still effective after taking a pounding
every year. He has averaged 324 carries a season, translating into
about 21 a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' reliance on Smith has resulted in some incredible
feats:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Smith was the first player in history to rush for 1,400 yards
five straight years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  He owns the NFL record of 136 rushing touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sanders and Smith are the only players with nine 1,000-yard
rushing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In 10 years, Smith has missed only three games because of
injury.
</P>
<P>
   He owns postseason records for rushing touchdowns (19),
consecutive games with a rushing touchdown (nine), 100-yard rushing
games (seven) and total rushing yards (1,586).
</P>
<P>
   Smith sees no reason why he cannot continue to build good
rushing seasons. He runs behind a good offensive line, led by
All-Pro left guard Larry Allen. Flozell Adams has developed into a
terrific left tackle, and the right side should be solid if Erik
Williams returns from his holdout.
</P>
<P>
   There are enough good pieces to the puzzle to reach the Super
Bowl again. St. Louis made a dramatic improvement to win this
year's championship, and the Cowboys now run the same wide-open
offense the Rams have used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why a Super Bowl can't be a realistic goal for
any team,'' Smith said. ``You just try to win as many games as you
possibly can to get into the tournament. If you can play your best
ball, you can go a long way. I don't think a Super Bowl is
unachievable.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys reach it this year, they will do it with a cast
that is dramatically different from the one that won the Super Bowl
in 1996. Only nine players from that team are still around. Before
long, Aikman and Smith, along with Allen, Williams, Darren Woodson,
Kevin Smith, Chad Hennings and Leon Lett will be gone, too.
</P>
<P>
   So, before Smith takes his last step, before he scores his final
touchdown, he wants to create some more images. Just because most
of his friends have moved on, there is no reason to quit bonding
with new guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only going to get caught up in what I need to get done
today, tomorrow and this year in order to help this team win,'' he
says.

FEWER FIRST-DAY DOWNLOADS THAN EXPECTED FOR KING'S ONLINE NOVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a closely watched test of the Internet's potential to
transform the book business, the horror writer Stephen King on
Monday became the first major author to self-publish online. But
demand for his new electronic book fell far short of what it was
for his last, which was published online in March with the help of
a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   That event seemed to foretell an imminent revolution in
publishing when more than 400,000 fans jammed computer servers
attempting to download the book in the first two days after it
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   King's Web site operators had planned to handle similar demand
Monday, just in case. But as of late Monday afternoon, fans had
downloaded 41,000 copies of the first chapter of ``The Plant,'' an
epistolary novel about the predations of a vicious vine. King plans
to publish the novel in monthly installments.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difference may be that this time King elected to
publish the book without the support of a publisher, relying
entirely on the Internet and word-of-mouth to attract readers. ``We
didn't have the marketing and sales promotion that Simon &AMP; Schuster
put behind `Riding the Bullet,' and that obviously accounted for
some of the difference,'' said Marsha DeFillippo. King's promotion
of the project consisted entirely of two advertisements, one in
Publishers Weekly and another in USA Today, as well as a morning
television appearance and a few newspaper interviews.
</P>
<P>
   King was ``very pleased'' with sales for far, DeFillippo said,
calling the first-day sales respectable. King's Web site designers
prepared for as many as half a million downloads, just in case. But
others in the industry said 40,000 was an impressive total for one
day's sales of an electronic book, for which there are few
benchmarks for comparison.
</P>
<P>
   King may have thrown off some readers by trying out an
honor-system payment plan. King asked readers to pay him a dollar
for each chapter they downloaded, and warned that he would not post
new installments unless he received payments for at least 75
percent of the downloads.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com agreed to handle the payments, and said that by late
Monday afternoon it had received about 25,000 credit card payments
for the first chapter, and that another 7,000 customers had
promised to send a check or cash. Amazon.com had distributed
``Riding the Bullet'' for free and all in one piece.
</P>
<P>
   King was particularly pleased to see that the number of payments
so far seemed to meet his 75 percent threshold, DeFillippo said.
</P>
<P>
   William Thornton, president of Radiant Ideas, who maintains
www.stephenking.com., said that some visitors to the Web site
objected to the installment plan.
</P>
<P>
   In e-mails and messages posted on the Web site, ``There was
fairly vehement reaction to the idea of paying multiple times for
it,'' Thornton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com's chief executive, said he hoped that the
honor-system model might inspire others to try distributing books
as if they were ``shareware,'' software circulated on the Internet
with payment expected later. ``If you can make it easy for people,
people are going to be willing to pay,'' Bezos said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lorraine Shanley, a principal in the book industry
consulting company Market Partners International, questioned just
how easy it was. She noted it took several clicks to finish the
Amazon.com payments. Then readers will need to come back and pay
for more installments. ``There wasn't instant gratification,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a hint perhaps of battles to come, some other booksellers
questioned King's decision to favor Amazon.com as the exclusive
bill collector. ``It is a shame,'' said Ed Morrow, owner of the
Northshire Bookstore in Manchester Center, Vt., and former
president of the American Booksellers Association. He noted that
King could have elected to send customers for payment to the
association's Booksense Web site or another store's, including his
own. ``We have a Web site, and we could have done it for him,'' he
said.

RARE SEALS   CAPTIVATE   A BEACH IN HAWAII 
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL X. WEISSMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recent birth of an endangered Hawaiian monk seal on a
popular public beach in Kauai, Hawaii, has pitted conservationists
against the organizers of a surfing event at a festival to be held
there next week.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists feared that the added noise, light and traffic from
the festival would cause the mother to abandon her two-week-old pup
before it was weaned, leaving it to die.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks of negotiations between the Kauai Surfing
Association, the event organizer, and the federal, state and local
authorities, the association decided to move its festivities to
Prince Kohio Beach about two miles west of Poipu Beach, where the
mother and pup are.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 1,300 existing monk seals living on the remote
northwest Hawaiian Islands steer clear of people. Only about 50
frequent the main Hawaiian Islands, and a birth on such a popular
beach is rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 1,000 people a day visit the beach, which lies between
two resorts,'' said Bradley Ryon, a wildlife technician with the
Hawaiian Monk Seal Program of the National Marine Fisheries
Service. ``Normally the moms will go to more remote beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother seal hauled up onto the beach on the evening of July
5. Early the next day passers-by heard her barking and discovered
that she had given birth.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ryon and about 30 volunteers have guarded the pup
and mother 24 hours a day, trying to persuade tourists not to use
flash bulbs, to stay clear of the seals and to keep noise down.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the seals was piqued by an article on July 17 in the
local Garden Island newspaper, which reported that festival
organizers were reluctant to move their event.
</P>
<P>
   Reuben Balmores, president of the Kauai Surfing Association,
denied that his group had been anything but cooperative with the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``As surfers and oceangoers who live in Kauai, we totally
understand the importance of monk seals,'' Balmores said. ``Once we
found out the entire situation, we immediately pulled out of the
park.''

NEGOTIATORS REPORTED TO BE DRAFTING OUTLINE OF PEACE AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-TALKS-NOTEBOOK) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ The Camp David peace negotiations intensified on
Monday as President Clinton plunged into the nitty-gritty of
issue-by-issue deliberations. After meeting almost until dawn with
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, he then oversaw a day and
night of what officials said quietly was the exercise of drafting
the skeleton of an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which is overseeing a news blackout on the
talks, would not confirm that a document was being drafted. But
Israeli and Palestinian officials said that negotiators, under the
direct supervision of Clinton, were engaged in forging a working
agreement in an effort to establish concrete points of accord and
highlight the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially imposing another informal deadline on the process,
the White House announced that Clinton, whose departure for Japan
last Wednesday almost collapsed the talks, would leave Camp David
at noon Tuesday to attend a funeral in Arkansas. He is to return at
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Israeli and Palestinian officials said they expected it
to become clearer on Tuesday ``whether we are moving forward or at
a standstill,'' as Amnon Lipkin Shahak, a senior Israeli negotiator
inside Camp David, told Israel's Channel Two television on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman, offered his
least guarded assessment of the 14 days of talks, saying that the
pace and intensity of the president's schedule suggests that, five
days after talks nearly collapsed, Clinton believes there is a
prospect for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hesitate to use a phrase like hopeful because these issues
are so difficult,'' Lockhart said at a briefing at a press center
several miles from Camp David. ``But obviously the last time I
stood here it was an hour or so removed from the collapse of
discussions. The fact that it's continuing is a positive thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that the American president, who held up crossed
fingers as he boarded his helicopter to return to his Catoctin
Mountains retreat on Sunday, was engaged in a ``rolling
assessment'' of the probability of success. He said that a final
deadline would not be ``calendar-driven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While the president believes the discussions are substantive,
he will remain here and keep the parties here,'' Lockhart said.
``The fact that he was up to 5 a.m. working through issues in a
very personal hands-on way and back at it this morning should lead
you to believe that he thinks staying here for the time being is
worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview played on Israeli television, a
reporter asked Shahak, Israel's transportation minister, to
estimate, by percentage, the chances of an agreement. Shahak said,
``It's either zero or 100. There is no middle ground.''
</P>
<P>
   That remark and a similar one made by a senior Palestinian
negotiator, Abu Mazen, on Sunday indicate that the Israelis and the
Palestinians are for now discounting the possibility of a partial
agreement that would leave aside the potentially deal-breaking
issue of Jerusalem's status.
</P>
<P>
   But other officials say that the draft agreement has not yet
touched Jerusalem, and that the Americans may still try to persuade
the parties to reach an accord without resolving the city's
contested status.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ground rules at Camp David, nothing is agreed until
everything is agreed, and a senior Palestinian official said on
Monday night that the dispute over Jerusalem has caused the parties
to retreat from offers that were on the table last week.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that the Palestinians' mood was soured after
Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, asserted that he would not
feel bound by compromise positions reached at the summit if it ends
in failure.
</P>
<P>
   After his early return from Japan, where he attended a meeting
of the leading industrial nations, Clinton met on Sunday night with
Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. Some 30 American,
Israeli and Palestinian delegates shared a dinner in which Clinton
sat between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, around midnight, Clinton convened the senior
negotiators from each side, leaving aside the two leaders. After
breaking near dawn for a nap, he cut short a White House staff
meeting to rush back into the talks with the negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Over a total of nine hours, Clinton worked with various teams
specializing in different issues, recessing before an expected
evening meeting.

 THURMONT, Md.: evening meeting.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An official photograph from inside Camp David showed Clinton
with two Israeli negotiators on one side and two Palestinian
negotiators on the other.
</P>
<P>
   All are taking furious notes, and Dennis Ross, the Middle East
peace envoy, holds a large folder in his lap.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Savir, an Israeli lawmaker who served as a senior negotiator
of the Oslo interim peace agreement of 1993, said he viewed the
photograph as an illustration of document drafting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging from my experience in these things, there would be no
reason for Clinton to spend this amount of time with the
negotiators themselves for any other reason,'' Savir said. ``And
that's a very good sign. Generally when you finish writing, you
discover the gaps are wider than you thought. But in a very real
sense, you are launched in the dynamic of an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle East, those whose fate rests on the deliberations
seize each day's limited news from Camp David with a mixture of
anxiety and excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone there who has lived through the ups and downs of the
conflict awaits the end in a protective zone of skepticism for what
would be the amazing news _ exhilarating for some, gut-wrenching
for others _ that the 52-year, blood-soaked conflict was to be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, a poll published on Monday morning showed that 59
percent of Israelis surveyed hoped that the summit would end in
agreement, even knowing full well the ``painful compromises'' that
would be entailed.
</P>
<P>
   This reflects what Barak has been arguing, that, despite the
defection of rightist parties that left him with a minority
government this month, the public supports his peacemaking and
would endorse an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he should sign an agreement,'' said Dalia Itzik, the
environment minister, ``he will present it as, ladies and
gentlemen, the agreement you always dreamed of: the end of the
conflict in return for a few Arab neighborhoods that you personally
have never visited and have no interest in.''
</P>
<P>
   No Israeli leader had ever broached the idea of sharing
sovereignty in East Jerusalem with the Palestinians until last
week, when word leaked out of the talks that Barak was considering
it. The official rhetoric always called for a united, undivided
Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty even though most Israelis know
that on the ground, Jerusalem is a segregated city.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say that, as the morning's polls indicate,
Israelis may be prepared to absorb a changed outlook relatively
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling that we are at a turning point in public
opinion'' toward Jerusalem, said Dr. Tamar Hermann, director of the
Tami Steinmetz Center for Peace Research at Tel Aviv University.
``The moment the taboo was removed on even discussing the issue of
dividing Jerusalem, it created an opening.''
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Palestinian official said that the idea of sharing
sovereignty in East Jerusalem is now off the table, having been
rejected by both sides.

<P>
   &UR; G &LR; 
 &UR; eorge W. Bush &LR;  last week unveiled his new Web site, which features
a list of the Republican presidential contender's top three
priorities, reports the Washington Post. On www.georgewbush.com:
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 priority is ``reforming Social Security''; No. 2 is
``lowering personal income tax''; and No. 3, third, is ``putting

 &UR; DEATH AND HOBBIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; J.K. Rowling &LR; , author of the Harry Potter books, told the Times
of London recently that her hero is the late  &UR; Jessica Mitford &LR; , who
was born a British aristocrat, lived in Oakland and whose first
best-seller was ``The American Way of Death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She had courage,'' Rowling said of the muckraking author.
``She didn't just talk it, she lived it.'' Rowling said she named
her daughter after the writer.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Reviewing Rowling's latest Harry Potter book in the New
York Times on Sunday,  &UR; Stephen King  &LR; wrote that he is worried about
the forthcoming movie version, which he fears may fail in bringing
``Rowling's scatty wit and vibrant imagination to the screen. ...
Perhaps Harry Potter's place is in the imaginations of his readers.
And if these millions of readers are awakened to the wonders and
rewards of fantasy at 11 or 12 ... well, when they get to age 16 or
so, there's this guy named King.''
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. As to the British way of death,  &UR; Benedict le Vay &LR; 's
``Eccentric Britain'' (Globe Pequot; $17.95) notes that funeral
trains at Ripley, Derbyshire, are aimed at filling the needs of
``dead steam-train enthusiasts.'' Specially built tracks carry the
deceased and mourners on a two-mile ride ending at a special
platform at the edge of a new cemetery. Wakes are held in the
buffet car. The late are buried purposely close to the tracks so
that passing trains rattle their bodies.

   &UR; Barbara Walters &LR;  was going to have  &UR; O.J. Simpson  &LR; on ``The

protested. Simpson was touting a Web site that would allow users to
pay to ask him questions and would sell Simpson memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I received more very unhappy phone calls from viewers than I
have in a very long time,'' Walters told the New York Times. ``That
was not the defining thing, but that troubled me.'' Co-hosts
 &UR; Meredith Vieira &LR;  and  &UR; Joy Behar  &LR; had said on-air they were unhappy
about Simpson's planned appearance;  &UR; Star Jones  &LR; said she was eager

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRONXVILLE, N.Y. _ We are in what's advertised as the season of
snorkeling, roller-coaster riding and cross-country hikes. But with
jobs and work places getting more intense by the day, an old truth
about vacations may be truer than ever: They're about rest. Whether
it's at the beach, in the mountains or in the Tuscan hills,
sleeping in can be better than venturing out.
</P>
<P>
   Most people may be sheepish about admitting this, but not my
family. We are serious sleepers, and proud of it. We even compare
notes. When my sister, my three brothers and I talk long-distance,
before discussing our kids' grades, our spouses' foibles or our
parents' knee replacements, I always ask: ``Have you had any great
sleep lately?'' When the answer is yes, I fluff the sofa pillows,
take off my shoes, stretch out and demand details. Where? When?
How?
</P>
<P>
   An acquaintance once bragged to me about landing a temporary job
at a sleep research clinic, where he got paid to sleep. I was not
impressed. No one in my family would consider sleeping while
attached to electrodes and monitors. Even if it meant napping away
the working hours as well as the ones in between, this wouldn't be
quality sleep. Duration alone won't do.
</P>
<P>
   But, then, quality alone won't do, either. A blissful childhood
memory of mine is of summer nights sleeping in the open air with my
siblings, on the big second-floor balcony of our family's cabin in
the Uinta Mountains of Utah. Don't imagine us curled up in smelly
old sleeping bags; we had discovered that beneath piles of quilts
on our old four-poster beds at the cabin lay mattresses, circa
1940, that could be folded over and easily, gleefully, carried out
to the balcony, where there was plenty of room to spread them out. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; On those chilly, pitch-dark nights, we'd drift off in our
cushiony beds, lulled by the soothing noise of a nearby rocky
river. It was the highest-quality sleep. But it never lasted long
enough. We grumpily ran for cover as the sun came up.
</P>
<P>
   The true vacation challenge isn't rock climbing or tennis games.
It's finding the ideal combination of unstructured and
uninterrupted time for sleep and a quiet, airy and light-controlled
setting.
</P>
<P>
   My siblings and I had both quality and duration when we left our
mattresses on our beds, which were in our mountain cabin's sleeping
loft. For the adult vacationer, looking for the perfect spot to
book a good rest demands asking questions about not only
pine-scented air and distance from noisy roads, but nonintrusive
housekeeping services and gap-free Venetian blinds.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal way to wake up, of course, is the way we always did in
the Rockies: to the aroma of fresh-brewing coffee and sizzling
bacon. And not a minute before, let's say, noon.
</P>

<P>
   While the Senate holds back from voting on normal trade with
China because of hesitation about Chinese nuclear help to Pakistan,
the senators should take a closer look at another issue in the
trade debate: the questionable argument that modern technology will
force China to liberalize its political system.
</P>
<P>
   As the Chinese expand trade with the West and make greater use
of computers and the Internet, the thinking goes, an unstoppable
current of ideas will spur political reform. ``When over 100
million people in China can get on the Net,'' President Clinton has
argued, ``it will be impossible to maintain a closed political and
economic society.'' But will it?
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government will never squelch all dissident voices
on the Web, but because Internet communication relies on each
person or computer having a unique, traceable address, the
authorities can find ways to locate users and punish activities
they don't like. There is an active debate in the United States,
where political freedom is sacrosanct and individuals are
guaranteed due process of law, about the clash between citizens'
civil liberties and corporations' innovations for protecting
security or profits. Imagine the implications in an authoritarian
state.
</P>
<P>
   China is already monitoring what goes out over the Internet and
identifying where messages come from. Ask Huang Qi, if you can:
authorities have detained him since June 3 for operating a Web site
about human rights abuses. Or ask Lin Hai, who served prison time
for sending some 30,000 Chinese e-mail addresses to a dissident
information service.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who only read dissident sites, rather than
contributing to them, cannot be sure of safety. Surfing the
Internet appears untraceable on the surface, but users unwittingly
leave behind detailed footprints, as evidenced by privacy concerns
among Internet users in this country. Chinese computer experts have
plenty of tools and techniques at their disposal to follow these
footprints.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is blocking and filtering technology. A user can't
get a single bit of digital information from the Internet without
connecting his computer to it, and services that provide the
connections can interpose equipment or software that blocks certain
types of traffic or keeps users from reaching certain Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has already blocked disagreeable Western
sites like The Washington Post and Amnesty International, but the
censors have had difficulty identifying offending sites fast enough
to block them all. It could solve that problem by adopting a
strategy used by a number of American-based systems, like America
Online's AOL(at)School service: Block access to any Internet
services not on a pre-approved list.
</P>
<P>
   Business trends within China could also end up limiting the
Internet's power there as a liberalizing force. Analysts of the
industry think many Chinese will eventually connect to the Internet
not with personal computers, as Americans typically do, but through
devices like set-top boxes and mobile phones, which have cumbersome
keyboards. Chinese who went online this way could shop or get
government messages, but might find it difficult to send e-mail or
post opinions to a Web bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   As Western companies work to protect copyrights and enhance the
security of information they collect, new techniques for control of
Internet communication are being developed every day. Even if
American companies do not sell their innovations to China directly,
the Chinese will be able to develop them on their own or buy them
from other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet won't be free in China until other influences force
the country to lift its most insidious trade barrier: the ban on
ideas that threaten Communist Party rule.

 By DAVID FRUM    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As George W. Bush has led America to contemplate
Richard B. Cheney as a vice presidential nominee, he is sending two
powerful messages to the country and his party _ one reassuring,
one disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   The reassuring message: Bush is self-possessed and
self-confident _ unafraid to campaign alongside a candidate of
wider and greater experience. It's the very opposite of the
decision his father made in 1988 when he selected Dan Quayle, whom
no one considered his equal, as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a disturbing message, too, at least for
Republicans. And no, it's not just a warning to county fairs across
America that if they invite Cheney to judge the local beauty
contest, he will go home with a tiara on his head. The disturbing
message is that Bush apparently feels he owes the conservative wing
of the Republican Party almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Cheney is not a conservative man; of course he is.
He's much more conservative than, say, Jack Kemp, Bob Dole's choice
in 1996. In many ways, he would make an excellent national leader:
calm, sound, seasoned, trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Cheney is conservative, he's not ``a conservative''; he's
not someone whom the right wing of the Republican Party recognizes
as one of its own, the way it recognized Kemp in 1996, or Quayle in
1992 and 1988, or Ronald Reagan in 1984 and 1980, or (odd as it may
be to remember) Bob Dole back in 1976. The choice of Cheney offers
a Bush-Bushie ticket, one that declares the Reagan chapter of the
Republican Party's history not merely completed, but closed. This
might seem an audacious maneuver in a party whose congressmen
occupy their idle hours renaming airports and highways after
Reagan. But it's not as audacious as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   In their quieter way, the Reaganites within the party have,
since 1996, taken a tumble every bit as painful and embarrassing as
that which toppled the last New Deal Democrats in the mid-1980s.
The outmaneuvering of Newt Gingrich by Bill Clinton in 1995, Jack
Kemp's debate debacle against Al Gore in 1996, the electoral
reverses of 1998 _ fairly or not, all have together discredited the
wing of the Republican Party that considered itself the inheritor
of the Reagan legacy.
</P>
<P>
   That wing knew it was discredited. Through the spring, summer
and fall of 1999, one-time Reagan Republicans made the pilgrimage
to Austin, Texas. They flew back charmed, convinced that the
popular governor was just as committed as they were to tax cuts,
school choice, the defense of the traditional family and
color-blind civil-rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   Others, more skeptical, might acknowledge that the governor was
not as staunch as he might be on this or that conservative
shibboleth but (they whispered) even if he wasn't good on
everything, he could still be counted on to name the right kind of
judges.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how they could feel so sure that the governor would
deliver the judiciary after all, given that his father named David
Souter to the Supreme Court, the bitterest Republican judicial
disappointment since William Brennan, they would smile the quietly
satisfied smile of those in the know.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Reaganite right gathered itself to Bush. It spurned
Steve Forbes, ignored Dan Quayle and recoiled from John McCain. It
committed itself early, just as labor signed up early with Bill
Clinton in 1992, and without haggling too long or too hard over the
specifics of the quo it could expect in return for its quid.
</P>
<P>
   But there's an old rule in politics: The people who make up
their minds last count the most. That's why politicians worry more
about female voters than they do about men, more about young voters
than they do about the old, more about the middle class than about
the poor or the well-to-do. Having pledged themselves to Bush so
hastily and so unreservedly, Reaganite conservatives now find
themselves in no position to extract things from him.
</P>
<P>
   He may, for reasons of his own, take a Reaganite line on issues
like national missile defense. But if, for other reasons of his
own, he should take a non-Reaganite line on abortion or federal
spending or affirmative action, the old Reaganites will not find it
easy to prevent him.
</P>
<P>
   There's no point in grumbling about this. The present weakness
of the Reagan wing of the party is no dirty trick; it is the price
that must be paid for its recent mistakes and defeats. But it is
always better to pay such a price knowingly: conservative
Republicans would judge Bush more accurately and probably, in the
end, more charitably if they understood from the beginning how
little they counted with him and why.
</P>
<P>
   Offering Republicans Cheney only drives home that message. And
in that sense, perhaps after all it is good news all around.

 &UR; GEORGE W. PUTS THINGS IN ORDER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; G &LR; 
 &UR; eorge W. Bush &LR;  last week unveiled his new Web site, which features
a list of the Republican presidential contender's top three
priorities, reports the Washington Post. On www.georgewbush.com:
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 priority is ``reforming Social Security''; No. 2 is
``lowering personal income tax''; and No. 3, third, is ``putting
education first.''

 &UR; DEATH AND HOBBIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; J.K. Rowling &LR; , author of the Harry Potter books, told the Times
of London recently that her hero is the late  &UR; Jessica Mitford &LR; , who
was born a British aristocrat, lived in Oakland and whose first
best-seller was ``The American Way of Death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She had courage,'' Rowling said of the muckraking author.
``She didn't just talk it, she lived it.'' Rowling said she named
her daughter after the writer.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Reviewing Rowling's latest Harry Potter book in the New
York Times on Sunday,  &UR; Stephen King  &LR; wrote that he is worried about
the forthcoming movie version, which he fears may fail in bringing
``Rowling's scatty wit and vibrant imagination to the screen. ...
Perhaps Harry Potter's place is in the imaginations of his readers.
And if these millions of readers are awakened to the wonders and
rewards of fantasy at 11 or 12 ... well, when they get to age 16 or
so, there's this guy named King.''
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. As to the British way of death,  &UR; Benedict le Vay &LR; 's
``Eccentric Britain'' (Globe Pequot; $17.95) notes that funeral
trains at Ripley, Derbyshire, are aimed at filling the needs of
``dead steam-train enthusiasts.'' Specially built tracks carry the
deceased and mourners on a two-mile ride ending at a special
platform at the edge of a new cemetery. Wakes are held in the
buffet car. The late are buried purposely close to the tracks so
that passing trains rattle their bodies.

protested. Simpson was touting a Web site that would allow users to
pay to ask him questions and would sell Simpson memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I received more very unhappy phone calls from viewers than I
have in a very long time,'' Walters told the New York Times. ``That
was not the defining thing, but that troubled me.'' Co-hosts
 &UR; Meredith Vieira &LR;  and  &UR; Joy Behar  &LR; had said on-air they were unhappy
about Simpson's planned appearance;  &UR; Star Jones  &LR; said she was eager

 INTERNET PHONES LEAVE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Stewart Lin has mixed feelings about his
Internet phone.
</P>
<P>
   Lin, a San Francisco computer consultant who is often on the
road, said the phone is ideal for scanning e-mail and checking San
Francisco Giants baseball scores. He even logged on from the 14th
hole of the Pebble Beach golf club and watched the practice round
for the U.S. Open last month.
</P>
<P>
   But navigating the Internet is practically impossible. And
sending a long e-mail message, using a nubby telephone keypad, can
be a nightmare. To type a message, Lin must hit each key on his
telephone pad multiple times until the right letter or symbol
scrolls by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear it took an hour to write three sentences,'' said Lin,
28, recalling his efforts to send a note from the links. The
experience was especially annoying because it costs him 39 cents a
minute to use the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the downsides, many pundits and tech magazines are
hyping the wireless Internet as the next big thing. The Yankee
Group in Boston predicts that 60 million people in the United
States will have Net access from cell phones in 2005, up from fewer
than 200,000 in December.
</P>
<P>
   But some industry players are already beginning to sense a
backlash, as early users complain that it's not as simple to use a
Net phone as it is to flick on their home computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have used the Internet from their desktops expect
it to be the same thing,'' laments Greg Heumann, a marketing
executive at Phone.com, the Redwood City, Calif., firm that
provides the microbrowser for most Net phones. But ``it's not a
smaller version of the PC.''
</P>
<P>
   Heumann said many people are disappointed because the phones
can't possibly live up to all the hype. ``The industry and media
tend to conspire together and always end up oversetting peoples'
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, users can also increasingly access the Net from
laptops and handhelds. But experts say cell phones are especially
key because they are so common. In addition, because phones
generally have tinier screens and don't work with a stylus, it also
raises trickier issues about how to adapt the technology to the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't to say Internet phones aren't useful. Lin is
still generally a fan. And enthusiasts say the phones are still
ideal to scan e-mail and receive tiny, targeted bits of news _ like
stock quotes or sports scores _ while out of the office.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade, for instance, figures that many active investors will
set up their accounts to automatically shoot them ``alerts'' about
major stock swings or news related to companies they are tracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``An alert isn't valuable if it isn't getting to people wherever
they are,'' said Jim Safka, who oversees the wireless strategy for
the Menlo Park online brokerage. ``If you come back to your PC a
couple hours later, it's too late. You can't respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, logging on to Web sites is more cumbersome with a phone
than a PC. For one thing, only a handful of sites are set up to
handle hits from cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, typing in URLs (Web site addresses) can be clumsy on a
telephone keypad.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to get around the problem, of course. Experts
recommend that you first create a list of online bookmarks on your
PC (with help from Web sites like  &LR; mobile.yahoo.com &LR;  or
 &LR; www.cellmania.com &LR; ). Then you can point your microbrowser to the
list of links and store the address. ``You should never have to
enter a URL into your phone,'' Heumann says.
</P>
<P>
   Experts figure users might take the trouble to enter an address
for their online broker or e-mail provider. But generally,
customers will likely stick to the standard menu of sites featured
on their phone _ what analysts call ``the walled garden.'' And it
might be difficult to escape. Some of the manuals that come with
Web phones do not even contain instructions on how to scale the
garden walls and access other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are likely to be blocked in'' as a cell phone customer,
said Andrew Cole, head of the wireless practice at Renaissance
Worldwide, a Boston technology consultancy.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at America Online, said Yankee Group analyst David
Berndt. Roughly 70 percent of AOL subscribers never venture out
onto the Web, relying on AOL's expansive online service.
</P>
<P>
   If that holds true with Net phones as well, it means wireless
carriers could demand hefty fees or commissions to feature an
Internet site on their exclusive list. Companies such as E-Trade
and Fidelity are already paying undisclosed sums to show up on
wireless screens.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewees declined to comment about the going rate to be
featured on a phone. They said the deals vary widely. In fact,
Yahoo, the Santa Clara, Calif., Web portal, said it actually
receives money from AT&AMP;T and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Because Yahoo is the most popular Web site in the world, cell
phone carriers want to use the name to peddle their services,
explained Drew Lanham, Yahoo's senior director of business
development. And the longer users stay online, the more telephone
companies can charge in connection fees. ``We drive up their
usage,'' Lanham said. The most popular features include e-mail,
stock quotes, news headlines, sports scores and weather.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you might have trouble recognizing the telephone
versions of popular Web sites such as Yahoo and Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   To make them work, programmers have to strip them down to just a
few lines of text _ like making a jazzy billboard into a puny
classified ad.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider Amazon's Web site. In addition to its trademark
logo, the site features dozens of icons (including one of a
shopping cart) and pictures of book covers and albums.
</P>
<P>
   But click on the phone version and you'll likely see just the
name of the site and a few options like books and records. No
logos. No pictures. Not even any unusual fonts.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say graphics will come eventually, as phone companies
develop faster connections and update the standards Web sites use
to tailor their sites for mobile users.
</P>
<P>
   One problem not likely to go away, though, is the lack of a
keyboard. To get around the problem, experts strongly advise users
to type in as much information ahead of time from their PC.
</P>
<P>
   Many sites like Yahoo, for instance, let registered users enter
their zip codes, favorite sports teams, key stocks and other
personal information in advance. Then when they log onto that site
from their phones, the page can automatically show them their local
weather, the stock quotes they are interested in and scores for
their favorite teams. Or users can program the sites to
automatically send out the information in the form of alerts.
</P>
<P>
   One downside, of course, is that users still have to log on to
each and every site _ using the clumsy keypad to type in a name and
password _ to access the info. But cell phone companies are trying
to work out ways to let users log in just once _ giving them entry
to all their partners' sites. They are also considering offering
``electronic wallets'' that let customers make purchases without
having to type in their credit card numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Experts' opinions differ, though, on just how frequently
customers are likely to use phones for shopping. Heumann said he
has bought books and records several times from Amazon.com on the
spur of the moment _ figuring that if he scribbled down the title
to make the purchase later, he'd probably just lose the information
or forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo's Lanham says: ``I don't believe that you are going to
buy substantial purchases from these phones.''
</P>
<P>
   Ad agencies are already pondering how to make money from
Internet phones. However, Yahoo and Redwood City, Calif.'s
ExciteAtHome said they're jumping into the online game mainly as a
convenience to consumers and to encourage them to register with the
site and give them personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts say the wireless telephone companies are in
the catbird seat because they can track where users go and feed
them targeted ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a saying that he who owns the customer information,
controls the customer,'' said Cole, the Renaissance analyst. ``We
are extremely bullish'' on wireless firms.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy watchdogs, however, are increasingly worried that phone
companies may not adequately safeguard customers' personal
information.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS stoked concerns earlier this year after a Seattle
software developer noticed that his phone automatically transmitted
his phone number to any Web site he visited. Sprint denied it was a
problem, but promised to eliminate the practice in the new version
of its software.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, an AT&AMP;T spokesman initially confirmed that AT&AMP;T
phones worked the same way, then insisted they were different.
``AT&AMP;T's Pocketnet service does not transmit phone numbers to Web
sites,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a disclaimer, bundled with AT&AMP;T Internet phones, warns users
that their personal information including the ``mobile number''
will be transmitted to other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The disclaimer shocked privacy advocate Jason Catlett, president
of the Junkbusters in New Jersey, when he stumbled across it after
buying an AT&AMP;T Internet phone. Catlett said it is always worrisome
when companies assign Net users a unique ID, because it lets Web
sites track individuals, but using a phone number raises even more
red flags. ``I have friends who don't give out their cell phone
number,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokesman Ritch Blasi said the phone company plans to
update its software in the next 30 to 60 days to scramble the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Other privacy issues lurk on the horizon. Federal regulators,
for instance, have ordered phone companies to find ways to identify
the precise location of a user, so 911 dispatchers can quickly find
anyone who calls in for help.
</P>
<P>
   The information could also potentially be used by wireless Web
users to find the location of the nearest ATM machine or get
directions if they are lost. But Catlett worries that cell phone
companies could sell the information to Web operators, who hope to
target customers with ads for nearby stores. Catlett called it
``cookies on steroids.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the alarms, most analysts predict wireless Net
technology will become nearly ubiquitous in a few years, as more
telephones come ready-armed with Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the service has already taken off in some other parts
of the world. More than 7.8 million Japanese, for instance, use NTT
DoCoMo's iMode service to go online. In Asia and Europe, the
service is especially popular for sending short digital notes to
friends and colleagues, like sending an instant message on America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   Lin, the San Francisco user, said he's already a fan. But Lin
was quickly shocked by bills of $100 to $150 a month after he first
started using his Net phone.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms have a flat rate for $7 to $20 per month. But others,
such as Sprint, charge the same price for navigating the Web as
they do for regular voice calls.
</P>
<P>
   So, until the price comes down, Lin said he can only afford to
log on if he is expecting an urgent e-mail or if the Giants are
playing in a crucial game and he's dying to see the score.

BIOSCOPE: ADVISORY FORUM HOPES TO PREVENT TRADE WAR
OVER  `FRANKENFOODS'
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Leading consumer and environmental groups are
fuming because the Clinton administration has appointed a former
Monsanto Corp. lobbyist to represent U.S. consumers on a
transatlantic committee set up to avoid a trade war over
genetically engineered foods.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. farmers have planted millions of acres of corn and other
crops that have been genetically engineered to resist pests, and
the growers want to export such produce freely. But in Europe,
where genetically altered crops have been dubbed Frankenfoods,
governments have imposed labeling rules and safety tests that have
restricted U.S. imports.
</P>
<P>
   Friction between the United States and Europe over the foods
issue torpedoed last year's World Trade Organization (WTO) talks in
Seattle and now threaten to erupt into a transatlantic trade war.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort to settle their differences, U.S. and
European leaders agreed in May to create a 20-person Biotechnology
Consultative Forum, representing pro and con interests on both
sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter appointing the U.S. members of this advisory forum,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright asked them to suggest a
compromise on labeling, safety testing and other regulatory issues,
and to present it to the next U.S.-European economic summit in
December.
</P>
<P>
   To build support for this compromise effort, the State
Department asked environmental and consumer opponents of
bioengineered foods to nominate their representatives to the
biotech powwow.
</P>
<P>
   But this gesture backfired when the State Department ignored the
nomination of consumer representative Michael Hansen _ a scientist
with Consumers Union _ and instead gave the post to Carol Tucker
Foreman, a Capitol insider who recently took over food issues for
the Consumer Federation of America after 18 years as a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   What angered critics most is that during her lobbying days,
Foreman helped Monsanto _ the firm most closely identified with
genetically engineered foods _ win approval for bovine growth
hormone, a chemical that stimulates milk production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a big mistake to appoint a person to represent
consumers who's been so closely tied to the biotech industry,''
said Dan Seligman, the Sierra Club's representative on trade
issues.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. government official, who wanted to remain anonymous, said
the State Department is aware of the flap created by Foreman's
appointment but believes the committee _ which includes Norman
Borlaug, the father of the ``green revolution'' _ represents ``a
broad range of civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreman, 62, was on vacation, and associates at the Consumer
Federation of America said she could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But federation Executive Director Stephen Brobeck called it
``absurd'' to suggest that Foreman, who has worked on Capitol Hill
for 40 years, would be beholden to Monsanto because she did some
``modest consulting'' for the company five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would challenge anyone to identify any statement or action
since she's returned to CFA that did not serve the public
interest,'' Brobeck said. ``People in this town move between the
private, public and nonprofit sector all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreman's career exemplifies Capitol Hill's revolving door.
</P>
<P>
   An Arkansas native, Foreman came to Washington in 1961 as a
Senate staffer, became executive director of the Consumer
Federation of America in the early 1970s and was appointed an
assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Agriculture during
the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   In her government role, Foreman earned praise and criticism from
consumer colleagues. Foreman helped persuade Congress to eliminate
a co-payment requirement that had kept millions of people from
getting food stamps. But she also relaxed poultry inspection rules
that favored big chicken farmers like Arkansas' Tyson Foods.
</P>
<P>
   But what really irked critics is what Foreman did after she left
USDA in 1981 to form her own lobbying firm. In addition to helping
Monsanto get USDA approval for bovine growth hormone, she also
lobbied for Olestra, Procter &AMP; Gamble's fat substitute, and
consulted with tobacco giant Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Critics concede that Foreman's corporate involvements never
damaged her Democratic Party credentials and marvel at how her
Arkansas roots _ her brother is Jim Guy Tucker, the former Arkansas
governor and Whitewater figure _ enhanced her access in the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't surprise me at all when the White House nominated
her to this international committee,'' said John Stauber,
co-founder of the Center for Media and Democracy, a Madison, Wis.,
nonprofit that tracks lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's trusted and tight with the Democratic Party, she isn't
threatening to industry and she has managed to retain consumer
credentials,'' Stauber said. ``Who better to try to smooth over
these differences (between Europe and the United States) and make
the world safe for the export of genetically engineered foods?''
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the transatlantic commission said Foreman was
chosen because she is a pragmatic dealmaker who is more interested
in compromise than confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Foreman's critics also seem to prefer that the
transatlantic compromise effort fail. Lori Wallach, a trade
specialist with Public Citizen, a nonprofit advocacy group in
Washington, D.C., said if U.S.-European differences over
genetically engineered foods spark a trade war, it could topple the
entire WTO framework which, in her view, favors corporate profits
over worker and consumer interests.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, those who want the commission to achieve a compromise
are running out of time. The first meeting of the transatlantic
forum probably won't occur until September because many of the
European members are on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope for the forum is to bring the United States around to
regulatory approval and labeling policies that are more consistent
with the European policies,'' said Rebecca Goldburg, a scientist
with Environmental Defense, a nonprofit advocacy group. Goldburg
was appointed by the State Department to fill the environmental
slot on the transatlantic committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have an incredibly broad charge and a limited amount of
time,'' she said.

BUSH SAYS HE'S MADE VP CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Saying he had made a final decision about whom he would
name as a runningmate, George W. Bush Monday extended the ongoing
drama surrounding his vice presidential selection process with a
sly grin, refusing to name his choice or confirm wide rumors that
he planned to pick former defense secretary Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   But two Republican sources told media outlets that Bush planned
to tap Cheney in a telephone call Tuesday, and that Bush aides were
preparing for the Texas governor to make an official announcement.
Officially, Bush was willing only to narrow the playing field,
saying he had not selected retired General Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it clear to me early _ and I mean early _ that he just
didn't want to be the vice president,'' Bush said, denying reports
of a last-minute effort to recruit Powell. ``He made it clear, and
when he makes it clear, he makes it clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said he had told no one _ not his wife, and not his
choice of running mate _ of his decision. ``I have not notified
anybody yet,'' he said. ``I think it's pretty clear that I'd better
start telling people pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks, which aired on the CBS evening news after a day of
frenzied speculation, did little to stop rampant buzz among
politicians and reporters that Bush was planning to name Cheney.
Indeed, the drawn-out selection process seemed purposely
orchestrated to keep a spotlight on the Republican ticket as long
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after it was revealed that Cheney had transferred his
voting registration out of Texas _ a move required by the US
Constitution if he hoped to appear on the same ticket as someone
else registered in Texas _ Bush aides still insisted the governor
might make ``a surprise pick.'' As anonymous Republican sources
began to leak word that Bush had in fact settled on Cheney _ and
Cheney began telling business partners that he would accept the
offer _ the Bush campaign maintained there was no way anyone else
could know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they could know that, because I haven't told
anybody yet,'' Bush said of the early news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday Bush communications director Karen Hughes also
issued this statement: ``Governor Bush tonight said he has made his
decision on a vice presidential nominee but has not yet notified
that individual or told anyone else about his choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, only one person knows the answer and it's not me,'' said
senior Bush advisor Karl Rove. ``The person is Governor Bush. He's
making this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, in a telephone call to a friend, said he had not been
offered the position as of late Monday afternoon. The friend, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said Cheney, who has been leading
Bush's vice presidential search, sounded ``exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who also served as a Wyoming congressman for a decade
and as chief of staff under President Gerald Ford, is widely viewed
as a safe but unexciting choice. Now chief executive officer of
Halliburton, an oil and energy corporation in Dallas, Cheney is
perhaps best known for his role as defense secretary under
President Bush during the Gulf War; several Republicans, however,
downplayed Cheney's connection to the elder Bush, saying any of the
potential finalists would have been somehow linked to the nation's
leading Republican family.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney will surely face questions about his work in the oil
industry, work for which he has been richly remunerated. On May 31
Cheney sold 100,000 shares of stock for $50.97 a share, bringing
him a $5 million payout, according to a report of insider trading
activity. Cheney's timing was very good; the price was close to the
52-week high of $52.25. The sale came after a period of rising oil
prices, which would benefit the energy company. Since then, the
stock has dipped and it closed Monday at 41 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the matter of Cheney's health. Now 59 years
old, Cheney has already suffered three mild heart attacks, and
undergone bypass surgery. But Hughes, the Bush communications
director, noted that he has been in good health for more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney does appear to meet the requirements Bush first set down
nearly a year ago, when questions about his running mate began to
surface. Bush said his vice presidential choice would have to be
two things _ capable of assuming the presidency, and a loyal
friend. ``I am going to pick somebody who can be president of the
United States, and somebody with whom I get along,'' Bush said from
the start.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney brings no electoral college advantage to the table;
Wyoming, a conservative state, is one the Bush campaign expects to
win. And he has none of the star power of certain other vice
presidential contenders _ especially Powell and Arizona senator
John S. McCain, who lost to Bush during the Republican presidential
primary earlier in the year. Republican governors Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania and Frank Keating of Oklahoma, as well as former
Missouri Senator John Danforth, were also on the short-list, and
had been carefully considered by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But none of them would have allowed for such a dramatic turn of
events: Just last week, Cheney was merely the man in charge of
Bush's runningmate selection. Now he is the presumed candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's Cheney. You know, with the registration change,
that's what I believe,'' Danforth told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The heightened suspense, all part of the theatrical atmosphere
Bush hoped to create heading into next week's Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia, made for a chaotic scene outside the
governor's mansion here, where dozens of television crews and
satellite trucks sat awaiting small clues of what might happen
next.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, returning home after spending the weekend at his Crawford
ranch, shouted to the throng of reporters that there was ``no news
today.'' With a mischievous look on his face, the governor then
disappeared into the mansion. He was not expected to release any
further information.
</P>
<P>
   But the guessing game continued. At one point Monday, CBS
anchorman Dan Rather reported that Powell was again being heavily
courted for the position, causing a wave of panic among politicians
and reporters who had concluded Cheney was the leading contender.
Not until Powell's office issued a statement saying there was
``absolutely no substance to Mr. Rather's report'' _ followed by
Bush's own denial _ did the rumor begin to fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually like sharks in a feeding tank,'' said Ron
Kaufman, the Massachusetts committeeman at the Republican National
Convention, who said he had no idea who Bush was planning to pick.
``If you drop the smallest droplet of blood, they go crazy.''

 &HT;    Time Warner executive likens Napster site to the devil
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time Warner President Richard Parsons made it clear
Monday how he feels about free digital music downloads on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He hates them. He really, really hates them.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he knows there is money to be made from
digital music distribution and he wants his company to make it.
</P>
<P>
   This quandary is at the core of the heated debate at the 5th
Annual Jupiter Plug-In music conference. More than 1,600 artists,
record executives and Internet business people are sharing the
auditorium with a news corps gathered to witness the fight.
</P>
<P>
   In his keynote address, Parson compared the popular
file-swapping site Napster to the devil, pirates, thieves and even
Communists out to destroy artists' and record companies' right to
be compensated for their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital music is illegal,'' said. ``They are ripping off
artists and hiding behind third-party neutrality. The music being
passed around on the Internet is stolen, and the artists have a
right to be paid.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Time Warner and other major music distributors
will continue their legal efforts to stop sites like Napster and
MP3.com from distributing free music. A judge is expected to rule
this week if the record companies are right and Napster could be
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience as a lawyer says that the courts will speak
forcefully and say ripping off music is a crime whether you do it
in the store or on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, borrowing liberally from President Kennedy, he further
emphasized his company's commitment to fighting free music
distribution on the Net: ``The music industry will pay any price,
bear any burden, undergo any hardship and oppose any foe to protect
the copyrights of their companies and the copyrights of their
artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Parson said that no musician, artist or filmmaker was going to
invest years of work in something that will bring them nothing and
that will be ``universally and instantly pirated.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if it weren't for Napster, the conference might still
be held at its initial digs in a basement in Greenwich Village.
Illegal though it may be, Napster has stirred more interest in the
recording industry than anything in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of simple technology, a community environment
and the availability of songs for free has proved irresistible to
music lovers of all ages and demographics.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter analyst Adam Sinnreich told the group that online music
industry continues to grow despite the fact that it is illegal, but
the average music lover doesn't want to steal music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online music is now a mainstream phenomenon, with 500,000
simultaneous music users online every night,'' Sinnreich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the labels are fighting it, it's really a net
positive for them,'' he said noting that a Jupiter poll of Napster
users said that 45 percent were more likely to increase their music
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Sinnreich said that in the United States, online music will
generate roughly one-fourth of the total music market reaching $5.4
billion in 2005. Sinnreich said what nearly every analyst and
developer has been saying for years _ to grow their business,
record companies can't ignore the Internet and must make the shift
from a product-based model (CDs and tapes) to a service-based
business model. That model would use the Internet to deliver music
digitally and provide users with a range of goods and services,
such as artist information, ticket sales, merchandizing and
streaming audio and video concerts and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   A sneak preview of the Virgin Megastore's new Web site aired at
the conference revealed the scope of the problems faced by
companies trying to sell digital music legally. While the Virgin
site will sell nearly any CD produced, its range of digital
downloads available for sale is quite limited.
</P>
<P>
   Sinnreich and Jupiter advocate a subscription mode, similar to
some agreements music retailers are working on, to deliver digital
music to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subscriptions deliver on the value of music,'' he told the
group. ``A la carte (one song at time) sales do not. Buying a la
carte downloads make no sense. Consumers like volume discounts.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Time Warner's merger with America Online, even
Parsons can't deny the great opportunities presented by the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet offers us a chance to offer our unmatched stable
of artists to anyone, anywhere at any time,'' he said, echoing the
mantra of Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos, as well as AOL's ``anywhere''
strategy for delivering content to users over a variety of devices.
``Music will benefit from the intimacy it provides consumers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Parsons said adequate copyright protection is key. The
industry would have to come up with digital copyrights and
watermarks that would protect the copyright holders. Lastly,
despite his strongly worded comments about Napster and
``underground'' digital distribution in general, he also said he is
keenly aware that Napster or Napsterlike technologies are extremely
popular and nothing but litigation can shut them down. In the
meantime, the major labels have to figure out a way to get into the
game and get in fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must embrace the Internet and the digital technology,'' he
said. ``I would be the first one to acknowledge that the legitimate
players are missing in the online world.''

 &HT;    Bush closer to announcng running mate
 &HT;    By Jena Heath and Elizabeth Barchas
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush is expected to announce as
early as today that he will name Richard B. Cheney, former defense
secretary, congressman, family loyalist and the man in charge of
the vice presidential selection, as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Monday that he had made his decision, but he declined
to reveal it. The Washington Post and the Associated Press,
however, declared Cheney as Bush's choice, based on comments that
Cheney made to friends. The choice is largely viewed as relatively
unrisky even if it lacks the drama of a Gen. Colin Powell, who CBS
News said still was being considered on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good, solid choice that no one in the party can carp
at and I think it'll give Bush a nice bounce in Philadelphia,''
said Scott Reed, who managed former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole's 1996 White
House campaign. ``Remember, this is an issue for about 72 hours and
then all the focus goes back to the top of the ticket. That's who
people vote for.''
</P>
<P>
   Choosing Cheney would be a ``strategic decision,'' that
indicates Bush has, ``a lot confidence in the way the campaign is
setting up and he's reaching out to somebody who is acceptable to
conservatives and brings a lot of heft and weight to the national
ticket.'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his thinking, Bush maintained the mystery, telling CBS
News anchor Dan Rather in an interview at the Governor's Mansion
Monday that he had made up his mind late Sunday, but had not yet
told anyone, including his wife, Laura, or his parents. He
responded to reports that he had made a last-ditch appeal to
Powell, saying that Powell made it clear early he wasn't interested
in the job and contending that talks didn't get much farther.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was reportedly preparing to offer Cheney the job Monday
night, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm guarding my decision very carefully,'' Bush said. ``I have
made up my mind. ``
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, after returning from a weekend in seclusion at his
ranch, Bush told reporters staked outside the Governor's Mansion:
``No news today. I will let you know soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation zeroed in on Cheney during the weekend, following
news reports that he changed his voter registration from Texas to
Wyoming to comply with the Constitution, which says that the
president and vice president cannot be registered in the same
state. He also reportedly got a clean bill of health and discussed
the possibility of joining the ticket with associates at
Halliburton Co., the Dallas energy giant where he serves as chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The guessing game reached a frenzy as news reports veered back
and forth between Cheney and Powell, an undisputed knock-out ticket
had Bush been able to convince him to join the ticket. CBS News
reported that Bush and his father had pursued Powell to the end and
that Powell's wife, Alma, had dropped long-held objections to a run
for national office. By late afternoon, Powell's office was denying
that any such conversations took place and Hughes all but shot down
the possibility of a Bush-Powell march to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Gen. Powell specifically has made it very clear
that he is not interested in serving as the vice president,''
Hughes said. ``He said that very consistently and I think he's said
that very unequivocally.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes confirmed that Bush had asked his father to call Dr.
Denton A. Cooley, a Houston cardiac surgeon and family friend, to
request that Cooley would consult with a Cheney physician to
determine if Cheney is strong enough to run. Cheney suffered three
mild heart attacks in the seventies and eighties, and had bypass
surgery in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that Gov. Bush asked his father to call
Dr. Cooley as part of his vetting process because his father is a
friend of (Cooley's) and he asked, if he were called, if he would
be willing to offer an opinion and that was the extent of his
father's involvement,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Directly or indirectly, there is no doubt that the elder Bush is
playing a major part in his son's march to the White House, despite
Bush's contention Friday that his father has been acting as a
sounding board who doesn't need to be first in line to hear the
vice-presidential choice.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, a Nebraska native, served as defense secretary in
the Bush administration. Before resigning to take that post in
March 1989, Cheney served six terms in Congress representing
Wyoming. He was White House chief of staff under President Gerald
Ford from 1975-1977. So trusted is Cheney in the tight Bush circle
that, last year, George W. Bush asked him to spearhead the search
for a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign team also includes, among others, Condoleezza
Rice, a former Stanford University provost and adviser to President
Bush, who is serving as foreign affairs and defense adviser to his
son and George P. Shultz, who served as secretary of state in the
Reagan-Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas political scientist and
longtime Bush watcher, said choosing Cheney is in character for
Bush, for whom comfort and loyalty are paramount.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing it says is that you go with the sure, the safe
and the comfortable,'' Buchanan said. ``By that I mean the stuff
that matters most to him, 'Yes, I like this guy. I feel like I can
trust him. I feel like he has the capabilities to help me and his
loyalty is proven because he links back to my dad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta pollster Whit Ayers said Cheney is a good choice, ``a
man who's conservative in his views and moderate in his rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster Mark Mellman gave a hint of how Democrats
might seek to exploit Bush's choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting two Texas oilmen on the ticket doesn't exactly send
the best message to the rest of the country,'' Mellman said. ``The
folks in the oil fields of Texas may be jumping for joy, but I'm
not sure the rest of the country is.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said the challenge now is for the Bush campaign to
re-introduce Cheney _ a consummate Washington insider _ to voters
during the Republican National Convention set to begin in
Philadelphia next week. And he credited Bush with his handling of
the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``The V.P. selection is the one time the candidate is totally in
control of his own campaign,'' Reed said. ``He calls the shots,
keeps his circle of advisors really tight and can have a little
fun, sending signals, putting his arm around people and totally
dictating the timing and the terms of the debate. It looks like
Bush is enjoying it.''

 TECH 21: ZANY ELECTION SITES AMUSE ON THE NET  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With the Republican convention opening in less
than a week, the election season is now in full bore, and this year
the Web will play a central role in reporting and interpreting the
campaign's dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   The ``2000 Elections'' category in Yahoo's directory includes a
mind-boggling 1,214 sites (or so Yahoo says _ I confess I didn't
count).
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't, however, include my current favorite, a site called
``Billionaires for Bush (or Gore)''
( &LR; www.billionairesforbushorgore.com &LR; ). You don't have to be quite
as jaded as I am about our major-party candidates to get a kick out
of this one.
</P>
<P>
   The site's slogan is ``Because Inequality Is Not Growing Fast
Enough,'' and one highlight is a ``Candidate Price/Performance
Analysis'' page. There's also a stirring call to join ``Million
Billionaire Marches'' at the two conventions (``For too long we
have ruled the country from behind the scenes. It's time for us to
come out of the closet.'')
</P>
<P>
   I liked some of the proposed slogans, too, like ``The rich,
united, shall never be defeated'' and ``Who needs day care, hire an
au pair!''
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in a more-serious look at the thinking of
some of the protesters who will be in the streets of Philadelphia
and Los Angeles, try the Whirled Bank site ( &LR; www.whirledbank.org &LR; ).
This one has a bit of humor, too, mainly in the section dedicated
to the First Church of the Almighty Dollar. (I'm not sure they're
really entitled to call themselves first, but whatever ...)
</P>
<P>
   Most of the site, though, is devoted to analysis of World Bank
policies and their consequences. The ``In Our Own Words'' section
includes some interesting documents, such as a 1991 memo by
Lawrence Summers, then the bank's chief economist and now U.S.
secretary of the Treasury, making the case that industries that
pollute enough to cause death and disease should be moved out of
the United States and into less-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   (His reasoning: The economic costs of health-impairing pollution
can be measured by the total amount of earnings foregone as a
result of increased disease and death. Because people in
less-developed countries earn less than Americans, ``the economic
logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage
country is impeccable.'')
</P>
<P>
   And if you're up for a long but (at least to me) surprisingly
readable critique of the economic assumptions both major parties
have embraced, check out the text of a farewell speech by Herman
Daly, a former senior economist at the bank (World, not Whirled).
It's profoundly radical fare, especially considering where it comes
from.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that you don't find stuff like that on the
mainstream political sites, but you might expect at least an
independent perspective from a site headed by former Washington
Post reporter Carl Bernstein. (Footnote for those too young to
remember the mid-1970s: Bernstein and his colleague Bob Woodward
played a central role in exposing Watergate and related Nixon
administration shenanigans.)
</P>
<P>
   The site, Voter.com, does seem to have a large selection of
information and commentary on the campaign, including some
interesting ways to ``follow the money''
( &LR; www.voter.com/home/candidates &LR; 
 &LR; /contributions/0,3496,2--,00.html &LR; ). And its ``Compare
Candidates'' page does encompass more than just Shrub and Bore _ if
you take the time to use the pop-up menus, you'll find nine other
candidates listed.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's virtually no material on any of the
third-party candidates, and nearly everything else on the site
comes right out of the two-party mainstream. An article in the New
York Times last week helps explain why: It turns out that Voter.com
charges the campaigns to post information in its candidate
sections. It also has contracts with the two parties under which
they pledge to ``advise Voter.com on ways to maintain `balanced
partisanship''' and to promote the site.
</P>
<P>
   DECONSTRUCTING BENCHMARKS: ``Lies, damn lies and benchmarks,''
Mark Twain might have said if he had been at last week's Macworld
Expo, unless of course he happened to be a true Mac believer.
(Remember, he was a techie in his time _ one of the first writers
to adopt a new invention called the typewriter.)
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly many PC loyalists, and probably even a few Mac
users, reacted with similar sentiments to Apple Chief Executive
Officer Steve Jobs' demonstration of a standard 500-megahertz Power
Mac G4 handily outperforming a Windows box with an Intel Pentium
III running at 1 gigahertz, or twice the Mac's processor clock
speed, in a sequence of demanding operations in Adobe Photoshop.
</P>
<P>
   All the more so for the follow-up demo of the new high-end model
introduced last week, with two of the 500-megahertz G4 chips,
crushing the same PC, and Jobs' contention that his dual-CPU system
is equivalent to a 2-gigahertz Pentium PC _ a system that won't, he
predicted, be available for another year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mac zealots will no doubt take these claims as the whole
truth; PC enthusiasts will probably dismiss them as nothing more
than marketing hype.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is somewhere in between. And the issue, I think, is
worth exploring because benchmark-based performance claims are so
much a part of the technology scene.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly true that benchmarks can be manipulated in a
variety of ways, including improper or unequal configuration of the
machines being tested. But that's not the most profound problem
with comparative benchmarking, and I'll assume it wasn't an issue
in Apple's Expo exploits.
</P>
<P>
   The core issue is that the performance of a computer system,
whether it's measured with a real-life application like Photoshop
or a synthetic testing tool like Ziff-Davis's widely used WinBench
and MacBench, is a function of many different components within
that system _ processors, memory, buses (the channels through which
data is transported within the system), drives, graphics card, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Even tests that focus specifically on processor speed must, if
they're to be at all meaningful, include a variety of operations,
so they can measure the speed at which the chip can carry out the
many different kinds of tasks it's capable of.
</P>
<P>
   And when you're dealing with products that are anywhere close to
being competitive, you're not likely to find that one outperforms
the other on every dimension _ typically, each will have strengths
and weaknesses of its own.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true when you're comparing Macs and PCs, which
_ even though both now have many components in common _ remain
based on radically different chips and internal architectures. If
you measured finely enough, you'd find that the Mac and its G4
processor leave the PC and its Pentium in the dust on some
operations _ and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the overall outcome of a benchmark test is a function of
the combination of tasks that go into it _ not just the program,
but the specific commands and operations used in the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   If the test is weighted toward tasks where the Mac excels, it'll
win; if the exercise involves a lot of routines where the PC is
best, then  &LR; it  &LR; will come out on top. When the end result is total
time, as is the case with most computer benchmarks, a major
difference in one or two long operations can wash out the effects
of smaller differences on dozens of other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   I don't for a minute believe that Apple rigged its demo. Anybody
else doing the same test on the same hardware would almost
certainly get identical results.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm equally certain that among all the jobs that could be
used to compare the performance of the two platforms, Apple
deliberately chose one that showed its products at their best.
Using almost any application other than Photoshop would have
changed the dual-processor picture, because it's one of only a
handful of Mac programs that take advantage of multiple chips. Even
within Photoshop, a different sequence of operations might have
produced significantly different results.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing surprising or unethical about that. After all,
Jobs was pitching his products, not conducting a scientific
experiment. Intel or any PC-maker would do the same on its turf.
</P>
<P>
   And both tests could have been representative of real life _
just of different aspects of its complexity.
</P>
<P>
   PS5BENCH: My own attempts to compare Mac and PC performance
might make all this more concrete. Back in April, when I reviewed
three of the first gigahertz PCs for The Chronicle, I added a
sidebar noting that my 450-megahertz Power Mac G4 beat them all on
a series of Photoshop series routines somewhat similar to the
sequence Apple used last week. My tests involved basic Photoshop
commands: rotating and resizing a test image, changing color modes,
``despeckling'' the image, and applying common effects such as
``Gaussian blurs'' and ``unsharp masks.''
</P>
<P>
   These operations are both commonly used in the graphics world
and pretty demanding in terms of processing power. I'm no Photoshop
expert myself _ I hardly use the program except for benchmarking _
so Adobe and several graphics professionals helped me pick them out
years ago as a good indicator of overall performance in the
program. I've used the same set of tests for years in Mac and PC
reviews for other publications, before I came to The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   But I got tons of e- mail about the sidebar (nobody seemed to
care about the actual review of the PCs, just the cross-platform
comparison). Many of these messages were childish ``flames,'' but
others cited some real evidence that my results were wrong or at
least unrepresentative. So I agreed to go back and do further
testing with a wider set of tests.
</P>
<P>
   For that I turned to something called PS5bench, a Photoshop
``actions file'' _ a set of routines designed to be run as an
automated sequence _ that was developed for benchmarking purposes
and runs on both Mac and PC. (If you have Photoshop 5, you can
download it and try it for yourself - it's at
 &LR; www.geocities.com/Paris/Cafe/4363/ &LR; . There's also a version for
Photoshop 4.)
</P>
<P>
   The PS5bench sequence involves all the routines in my own
personal test suite, but it also includes a number of others
-effects like Lens Flare and Pointillize. Altogether, it
encompasses 21 operations.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have room here to go into all the details, but the end
result is interesting. Basically, this test confirmed my original
results _ for the operations I'd benchmarked. The Mac still came
out ahead in 13 of the 21 tests.
</P>
<P>
   But the addition of the other effects changed the balance
noticeably, because on some of them _ notably a filter called
Radial Blur _ the PC turned out to be much faster. The net effect
was that the Hewlett-Packard Pavilion with a 1-gigahertz PC edged
out my Power Mac G4.
</P>
<P>
   By then, however, Apple had lent me a 500-megahertz G4 for
testing, and the extra megahertz made just enough difference to put
the Mac back in front.
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite true, as one reader claimed in May to me, that
you can make any computer look faster than any other by choosing
the right tests _ short of outright fraud, my first computer, a
Commodore 64, wouldn't beat a Power Mac or a Pentium PC no matter
how you slice it. But as my PS5bench results show, exactly what you
benchmark can make a dramatic difference.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the reality is that today's Macs and PCs are
roughly competitive _ they're both pretty fast for most things, but
in the most demanding applications both still keep you waiting.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the companies who make its PowerPC chips _
IBM and Motorola _ haven't been able to improve their clock speeds
much during the past nine months, even as Intel and rival Advanced
Micro Devices have raced ahead to the gigahertz mark and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   With Intel's Pentium 4 due this fall and expected to give PC
performance a nice boost, Apple could soon have faced real trouble,
at least for that part of its customer base that cares more about
performance than elegance or ease of use.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs' decision to put two G4s in every high-end Mac is a clever
preemptive response. As the Expo demos showed, it's likely to be
effective with the Photoshop crowd, and they're the heart of
Apple's professional market.
</P>
<P>
   It's an expensive solution, though, even if _ as I'm sure is the
case _ Apple is getting the chips at a bargain price. (It is, after
all, the only real customer for the desktop versions of the
PowerPC.)
</P>
<P>
   For the long haul, Apple and its PowerPC partners will have to
get their chip back on a performance curve parallel to Intel's, or
even loyal Mac artists might again be tempted to jump ship.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as one cynic sitting near me at the Jobs keynote put it,
``Next year we'll be sitting here listening to him tell us four
processors are going to come in every Power Mac.''

ELDER BUSH KEPT A WATCHFUL EYE OVER SON'S CHOICE FOR NO. 2
</HEADLINE>
 By FRANK BRUNI with ERIC SCHMITT 
   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the main lobby of the George Bush
Presidential Library, about 90 miles east of here, Dick Cheney has
a prominent place in an enormous oil painting that is the first and
pretty much only thing to catch a visitor's eye.
</P>
<P>
   It is a portrait of former President Bush in the Oval Office
during perhaps the most critical juncture of his presidency, the
Persian Gulf War, and Cheney, his defense secretary, is in a huddle
of advisers helping to guide Bush through those geopolitical
straits.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Cheney is back in the picture, back in the center of
another Bush's political career and poised once again to provide
his loyal assistance at a pivotal time. A senior Republican
official said Monday said Gov. George W. Bush, the
soon-to-be-crowned Republican presidential nominee, had decided to
choose Cheney as his running mate, and would announce his choice as
early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That development, prophesied for several days, showed that
Cheney had become as important to the son as he was to the father.
And to some degree, it undoubtedly reflected the high regard in
which former President Bush had long held Cheney, a level of
respect that was almost bound to be inherited by the Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has told reporters that he spoke repeatedly with his father
as he pondered his choice of a running mate, and there were other
hints that the former president maintained a watchful eye over the
process, and maybe put a finger or two in it as well. On Friday,
for example, the elder Bush called a cardiac surgeon in Houston who
is a family friend to enlist his help in determining whether
Cheney, who had suffered mild heart attacks more than a decade ago,
was up to the rigors of a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, Chase Untermeyer, the director of presidential
personnel during the Bush administration, recalled a conversation
that occurred about a month ago in Kennebunkport, Maine, between
the former president and Brent Scowcroft, who served as his
national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   According to Untermeyer, Scowcroft told Bush that he had talked
to Cheney in the previous two weeks, and that Cheney had decided he
was interested in the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember President Bush making a powerful mental note of
that,'' said Untermeyer in a telephone interview Monday. ``He
expressed great interest and surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the former president and advisers to the Bush
campaign said that they did not know if former President Bush and
Cheney had spoken directly over the last few weeks, and the precise
nature and extent of the former president's involvement in his
son's selection process is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But the former president apparently knew more than even some of
the governor's advisers did. A close friend of the Bush family said
that for several days now, the father could not resist making
friends and associates aware that he possessed the inside scoop on
who his son's running mate would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been teasing us unmercifully,'' said the friend.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the former president's involvement, it was also
clear that his son forged his own bond with Cheney long before the
last few months, when Cheney supervised a vice presidential
selection process for the Texas governor that ended, oddly enough,
with Cheney as the choice.
</P>
<P>
   Former Secretary of State George P. Shultz recalled an evening
in early 1999 when he and Cheney, a chief executive with
Halliburton, an energy company based in Dallas, were invited to the
Texas governor's mansion here for dinner and an overnight stay. The
governor was then pondering a presidential candidacy, and he wanted
their advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat around for two to three hours in the evening, just
talking about everything under the sun from foreign policy to
domestic politics,'' Shultz said in a telephone interview Monday.
``Governor Bush was forever turning to Cheney, asking him what he
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor likes him,'' Shultz said. ``He has his confidence
and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   In choosing Cheney, Bush turned to someone whose history with
the Bush family is a long, rich and active one. And that history,
several people who know the governor said, gave the Texas governor
the kind of comfort in Cheney that he almost insists on having in
his closest political associates.
</P>
<P>
   But with Cheney's selection, Bush also summoned the shadow of
his father, and was sure to rekindle debates in the coming days
over just how firmly his political fortunes were tied to his
patrimony. Additionally, Bush, who has used his status as a
governor to style himself as a candidate who would bring an
outsider's perspective to Washington, ultimately cast his lot with
the ultimate insider, someone who spent more years inside the
Beltway than perhaps anyone else on Bush's list of vice
presidential prospects.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of a century ago, Cheney served first as
deputy chief of staff _ and then chief of staff _ for President
Gerald Ford. Cheney, who was only in his mid-30s, was obviously a
rising Republican star. Bush, who was director of the CIA under
Ford, took ample note of that, his friends said.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Bush noticed that Cheney was a keeper,'' said one
close friend. ``President Bush collects people. Smart people do
that. Smart people collect people.''
</P>
<P>
   After Cheney ran for, and was elected to, a congressional seat
from Wyoming in 1978, he quickly became one of the leading
Republican voices in the House. As vice president from 1981 to
1989, Bush played a leading role as President Ronald Reagan's
liaison to Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until Bush was elected president and picked
Cheney to be his defense secretary that the two men truly became
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't really close to the dad until after the 1988
election, when he joined the Cabinet,'' said one of Cheney's
associates. The associate said that Cheney, who always sat on
Bush's left during Cabinet meetings, proved his loyalty and
discretion, two qualities prized in the Bush family as much as any
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came to who Bush senior could rely on for total
discretion, there was Brent Scowcroft and Dick Cheney,'' the
associate said.
</P>
<P>
   But what sealed their bond, friends and associates said, was the
Persian Gulf War. Bush's friends and associates said that he
considered the challenge of managing that conflict to be a defining
moment not just in his political career but in his life. The former
president, in his recently published book of letters and diary
entries, wrote about the solace he derived from Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is constant,'' Bush wrote in a diary entry from
Feb. 20, 1991. But he added that ``oddly enough,'' with Cheney,
among others, at his side, ``I still feel content.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Bond, a former chairman of the Republican National
Committee who knows Bush well, said, ``They all went through the
soul-searing experience of a war, and they got even closer.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the former president said that there were parameters
to the relationship, given that Cheney was Bush's subordinate and
so much younger. When the former president, now 76, held a 75th
birthday party for his wife, Barbara, in Kennebunkport last month,
Cheney, 59, was not among the nearly 200 people who were invited.
</P>
<P>
   But Jean Becker, the president's current chief of staff,
nonetheless described them as ``close friends.'' She noted that in
the winter, when Bush lives in Houston, he occasionally goes
hunting with Cheney, who lives in Dallas. They took a hunting trip
together earlier this year, Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent Republicans in Washington said that it would
be easy to make too much of the relationship between Cheney and the
elder Bush as a factor in the Texas governor's decision. They noted
that because the former president had such a long, varied and
prominent political career, many of his son's prospective vice
presidential selections had ties to him.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. John C. Danforth of Missouri, for example,
vigorously defended President Bush's nomination of Clarence Thomas
to the Supreme Court. And Elizabeth Dole was President Bush's
secretary of labor.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, advisers to the Texas governor said that the
younger Bush's path crossed with Cheney even after the end of his
father's administration in early 1993. The fact that Cheney had
become a prominent businessman in Texas by the time Bush was
elected governor in 1994 guaranteed that they would run into each
other, these advisers said, and the two men did, in ways that
apparently left an impression on the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush talked about him over the years,'' one adviser said.
``He'd say, `Cheney said this. Cheney said that.' It was clear they
talked to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   And during the early stages of Bush's presidential candidacy
last year, the adviser said, Bush sometimes alluded to Cheney
himself considered running for president in 1996. ``He would say,
`This is how Cheney approached the issue in 1995,''' the adviser
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Several advisers said that the emphatic lack of interest that
Cheney initially stated about the No. 2 job, a resistance that
apparently began to soften faster than was previously believed,
probably only heightened the governor's interest in him as a
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush takes pride in what he sees as the charming, persuasive
effect he can have on people who spend enough time around him, and
Cheney may be proof of his prowess.

 ONLINE INVESTING: DAY TRADERS DON'T SET STOCK PRICES  &HT;     By HARRY DOMASH 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Judging from media hype, you would think day
traders are primarily responsible for moving stock prices. Wrong.
It's really mutual funds and other institutional investors such as
trust funds and pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Quest Diagnostic, a provider of clinical laboratory
services. Shares in the company moved from a low of $23 in October
to about $100 last week.
</P>
<P>
   Quest has 44 million outstanding shares. Of those, almost 23
million, or more than 50 percent, are owned by 135 institutional
investors. According to Morningstar, the Vanguard Health Care Fund
alone held 2.4 million shares as of March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 400,000 shares of Quest trade on an average day. That
means institutions hold more than 50 times the average daily
trading volume. So a small amount of buying or selling on the part
of institutional holders can significantly influence the stock
price.
</P>
<P>
   The same math keeps funds and other institutions from moving
quickly in and out of a stock. A fund wanting to take a new
position in Quest would have to move slowly to avoid pushing up the
stock price with its buying. In practice, it can take a fund
manager a couple of months or longer to establish a new position or
to move out of an existing position in a stock.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, you can make better investing decisions if you know
which stocks the institutions are buying and selling.
</P>
<P>
   LionShares.com ( &LR; www.lionshares.com &LR; ) can help you find out.
Institutional investors are required to periodically file reports
with the Securities and Exchange Commission detailing their stock
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   LionShares.com maintains a database of institutional stock
holdings extracted from these filings. Use of the site is free, but
you have to register to access most of the data.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. Register first so you can follow along with
me.
</P>
<P>
   I'll use Fidelity as an example. Fidelity operates more than 300
mutual funds. Although each fund usually has an individual manager,
a common research department supplies the same analysis to all
managers interested in a specific industry.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, a stock favored by a research analyst will
probably be held by a number of Fidelity funds. Conversely, most
fund managers will unload stocks out of favor with its sector
analyst. ``Once in, Fidelity funds tend to hold positions for a
considerable time,'' said Glenn Tanner, LionShares.com's general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see what we can learn by examining Fidelity's holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Start by typing ``Fidelity'' into the data box at the top and
click Search. Be sure the ``by holder name'' search choice is
selected. Click on ``Fidelity Management &AMP; Research Co.'' from the
list.
</P>
<P>
   Scroll down and you'll see the top 15 combined holdings of all
U.S. Fidelity funds, in terms of market value.
</P>
<P>
   When I looked last week, Cisco Systems, General Electric,
Microsoft and Intel comprised Fidelity's top four holdings. The
``Position'' column listed the number of shares held as of March
31, and the ``$ Mkt Val'' column showed the market value of those
shares as of June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where it gets interesting. Click on ``Position Change,''
the change in the number of shares held during the three-month
period. The largest additions to Fidelity funds' combined
portfolios were in Cisco Systems, Nortel Networks, Micron
Technology and Texas Instruments (ignore lines without ticker
symbols or market value numbers, those are debt instruments).
</P>
<P>
   Although already considered highly valued by many experts,
Fidelity managers were still loading up on those stocks during the
first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Click on the arrow to the left of the ``Position Change'' column
header to sort the list in the opposite direction. Now stocks
Fidelity managers sold the most during the quarter are listed
first. Topping the list when I looked were WorldCom, Philip Morris,
FleetBoston Financial and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Click on ``Sector Summary'' in the middle column above the stock
list to see the market value of Fidelity's holdings by industry
sector. Technology and Communication Services were the only sectors
with increases in market value in the March quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Beware. That doesn't mean Fidelity's managers added shares to
those sectors during the period. The market value could have
increased solely because the share prices increased.
</P>
<P>
   Click on ``Health Care'' to see a list of industries within the
overall health care sector. As you may recall, biotech stocks took
a wild ride early this year, soaring in January and crashing in
March. Click on ``Biotechnology'' to see what Fidelity's managers
were doing in the biotech sector in the March quarter.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see that Fidelity fund managers were busy reducing most
of their biotech positions. Click on ``Position Change'' to sort
the list so the stocks with the largest purchases are listed first.
Fidelity managers added 3 million shares of Medarex and about 2
million shares each of Supergen Cor Therapeutics and Alexion
Pharmaceuticals to their cumulative holdings during the first three
months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   You have to think Fidelity managers saw something positive in
these companies to load up on shares while they were dumping the
sector in general. It's intriguing information. By itself, this is
not a signal to buy the stocks. But these are good research ideas
if you're interested in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio information compiled by LionShare.com can be
months out of date. The value of the data depends upon how fast the
funds change their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Funds with high turnover rates probably won't own the same
stocks by the time you see the data.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be better off looking at fund families with low turnover
rates. These, along with Fidelity, should give you a good start to
using institutional buying to spot invest ment candidates. They
are: Firsthand Capital Management, Janus Capital Group and Oak
Associates.

   CART leader Andretti knows he has miles to go
</P>
<P>
   By TERRY BLOUNT
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Michael Andretti has been around long enough to know that
holding a slim points lead in July is a long way from winning a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti took over the top spot in the standings for the CART
FedEx championship with his second-place finish to Juan Montoya in
the Michigan 500 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leading the points right now isn't the biggest thing,''
Andretti said. ``Finishing well each race is the most important
thing. I said that Michigan and Fontana (California) are two races
where we had to do well, and we're halfway there now.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti was only about five feet away from earning four more
points, falling four-hundredths of a second short of Montoya at the
checkered flag in one of the most exciting finishes in CART
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a disappointment to lose such a close finish,''
Andretti said. ``But it's big consolation for us to take the points
lead for the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti, who drives the Texaco Ford-Lola, entered the race two
points behind Roberto Moreno but now leads Moreno by 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno had gearbox problems in the Visteon Ford-Reynard and
dropped out of the race early, finishing 23rd. It was the second
consecutive race in which Moreno failed to score a point, allowing
Andretti to gain 36 points on him in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sad day for us,'' Moreno said. ``We've had two bad
races in a row, so hopefully the bad luck is out of the way. We'll
be competitive in Chicago (this weekend).
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is strong, and there's no reason to believe we won't
stay in contention. I'm confident we'll be back stronger than ever
and fighting for the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   With nine races remaining on the 2000 CART schedule, four
drivers are within 30 points of Andretti, and five others are
within 44 points, the total number of points a driver could earn in
two races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked up some points (Sunday) and kept some momentum going
into Chicago,'' said Paul Tracy, who finished seventh at Brooklyn,
Mich., and held his No. 3 spot in the championship, 24 points
behind Andretti. ``We didn't lose touch with the (points) leaders,
and that's the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who has battled his way back into contention is Montoya,
the defending FedEx champion. The 24-year-old Colombian has
overcome a slow start and moved up to fifth in the standings, only
30 points behind Andretti.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our second podium finish, and we won both those
races,'' Montoya said. ``Obviously, if we can start finishing more
races, we will be right up there for the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti believes Montoya will be a force down the stretch and
probably will be near the top by the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid is really good,'' Andretti said of Montoya. ``He
deserves the praise he's getting. He's definitely for real. When he
goes to F1, I believe he is going to give Michael Schumacher a run
for his money.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya won the CART title on a tiebreaker last season. Dario
Franchitti earned the same number of points as Montoya, but Montoya
won the championship because he had more victories.
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti, who finished third at Michigan, has weathered a
disappointing season and ranks 11th with 58 points. He probably is
out of contention but isn't giving up yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been near the top much this season, but we saw last
year that the championship can go down to the last lap of the last
race,'' Franchitti said. ``This is going to be close all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the drivers in the top 10 seem to agree with Franchitti
because no one has dominated the series this season. Three drivers
_ Montoya, Andretti and Gil de Ferran _ have won twice, and five
other drivers have won once.
</P>
<P>
   ``With nine races still to go, things are so close that anything
can happen,'' said Adrian Fernandez, who finished sixth at
Michigan. ``We scored some points (Sunday) and moved up in the
championship battle. That's what you have to do every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti agrees. His only championship came in 1991, but he has
been the series runner-up five times and believes he has learned a
thing or two about what it takes to end up on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to finish,'' Andretti said. ``We might not win every
race the rest of the way, and we might not be on the podium for all
of them, but if we keep having strong finishes, we're going to be
there at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the drivers in the top 10 have yet to win a
championship, including Tracy, who feels a CART FedEx title is the
one thing that would make his career complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual achievements are great,'' Tracy said. ``I've won a
lot of races, and I've got a lot of things in the (record) book
that are nice. But the championship is what it's all about. That's
what we're all here to do.''

 INTERNET PHONES LEAVE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Stewart Lin has mixed feelings about his
Internet phone.
</P>
<P>
   Lin, a San Francisco computer consultant who is often on the
road, said the phone is ideal for scanning e-mail and checking San
Francisco Giants baseball scores. He even logged on from the 14th
hole of the Pebble Beach golf club and watched the practice round
for the U.S. Open last month.
</P>
<P>
   But navigating the Internet is practically impossible. And
sending a long e-mail message, using a nubby telephone keypad, can
be a nightmare. To type a message, Lin must hit each key on his
telephone pad multiple times until the right letter or symbol
scrolls by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear it took an hour to write three sentences,'' said Lin,
28, recalling his efforts to send a note from the links. The
experience was especially annoying because it costs him 39 cents a
minute to use the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the downsides, many pundits and tech magazines are
hyping the wireless Internet as the next big thing. The Yankee
Group in Boston predicts that 60 million people in the United
States will have Net access from cell phones in 2005, up from fewer
than 200,000 in December.
</P>
<P>
   But some industry players are already beginning to sense a
backlash, as early users complain that it's not as simple to use a
Net phone as it is to flick on their home computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have used the Internet from their desktops expect
it to be the same thing,'' laments Greg Heumann, a marketing
executive at Phone.com, the Redwood City, Calif., firm that
provides the microbrowser for most Net phones. But ``it's not a
smaller version of the PC.''
</P>
<P>
   Heumann said many people are disappointed because the phones
can't possibly live up to all the hype. ``The industry and media
tend to conspire together and always end up oversetting peoples'
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, users can also increasingly access the Net from
laptops and handhelds. But experts say cell phones are especially
key because they are so common. In addition, because phones
generally have tinier screens and don't work with a stylus, it also
raises trickier issues about how to adapt the technology to the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't to say Internet phones aren't useful. Lin is
still generally a fan. And enthusiasts say the phones are still
ideal to scan e-mail and receive tiny, targeted bits of news _ like
stock quotes or sports scores _ while out of the office.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade, for instance, figures that many active investors will
set up their accounts to automatically shoot them ``alerts'' about
major stock swings or news related to companies they are tracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``An alert isn't valuable if it isn't getting to people wherever
they are,'' said Jim Safka, who oversees the wireless strategy for
the Menlo Park online brokerage. ``If you come back to your PC a
couple hours later, it's too late. You can't respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, logging on to Web sites is more cumbersome with a phone
than a PC. For one thing, only a handful of sites are set up to
handle hits from cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, typing in URLs (Web site addresses) can be clumsy on a
telephone keypad.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to get around the problem, of course. Experts
recommend that you first create a list of online bookmarks on your
PC (with help from Web sites like  &LR; mobile.yahoo.com &LR;  or
 &LR; www.cellmania.com &LR; ). Then you can point your microbrowser to the
list of links and store the address. ``You should never have to
enter a URL into your phone,'' Heumann says.
</P>
<P>
   Experts figure users might take the trouble to enter an address
for their online broker or e-mail provider. But generally,
customers will likely stick to the standard menu of sites featured
on their phone _ what analysts call ``the walled garden.'' And it
might be difficult to escape. Some of the manuals that come with
Web phones do not even contain instructions on how to scale the
garden walls and access other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are likely to be blocked in'' as a cell phone customer,
said Andrew Cole, head of the wireless practice at Renaissance
Worldwide, a Boston technology consultancy.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at America Online, said Yankee Group analyst David
Berndt. Roughly 70 percent of AOL subscribers never venture out
onto the Web, relying on AOL's expansive online service.
</P>
<P>
   If that holds true with Net phones as well, it means wireless
carriers could demand hefty fees or commissions to feature an
Internet site on their exclusive list. Companies such as E-Trade
and Fidelity are already paying undisclosed sums to show up on
wireless screens.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewees declined to comment about the going rate to be
featured on a phone. They said the deals vary widely. In fact,
Yahoo, the Santa Clara, Calif., Web portal, said it actually
receives money from AT&AMP;T and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Because Yahoo is the most popular Web site in the world, cell
phone carriers want to use the name to peddle their services,
explained Drew Lanham, Yahoo's senior director of business
development. And the longer users stay online, the more telephone
companies can charge in connection fees. ``We drive up their
usage,'' Lanham said. The most popular features include e-mail,
stock quotes, news headlines, sports scores and weather.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you might have trouble recognizing the telephone
versions of popular Web sites such as Yahoo and Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   To make them work, programmers have to strip them down to just a
few lines of text _ like making a jazzy billboard into a puny
classified ad.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider Amazon's Web site. In addition to its trademark
logo, the site features dozens of icons (including one of a
shopping cart) and pictures of book covers and albums.
</P>
<P>
   But click on the phone version and you'll likely see just the
name of the site and a few options like books and records. No
logos. No pictures. Not even any unusual fonts.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say graphics will come eventually, as phone companies
develop faster connections and update the standards Web sites use
to tailor their sites for mobile users.
</P>
<P>
   One problem not likely to go away, though, is the lack of a
keyboard. To get around the problem, experts strongly advise users
to type in as much information ahead of time from their PC.
</P>
<P>
   Many sites like Yahoo, for instance, let registered users enter
their zip codes, favorite sports teams, key stocks and other
personal information in advance. Then when they log onto that site
from their phones, the page can automatically show them their local
weather, the stock quotes they are interested in and scores for
their favorite teams. Or users can program the sites to
automatically send out the information in the form of alerts.
</P>
<P>
   One downside, of course, is that users still have to log on to
each and every site _ using the clumsy keypad to type in a name and
password _ to access the info. But cell phone companies are trying
to work out ways to let users log in just once _ giving them entry
to all their partners' sites. They are also considering offering
``electronic wallets'' that let customers make purchases without
having to type in their credit card numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Experts' opinions differ, though, on just how frequently
customers are likely to use phones for shopping. Heumann said he
has bought books and records several times from Amazon.com on the
spur of the moment _ figuring that if he scribbled down the title
to make the purchase later, he'd probably just lose the information
or forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo's Lanham says: ``I don't believe that you are going to
buy substantial purchases from these phones.''
</P>
<P>
   Ad agencies are already pondering how to make money from
Internet phones. However, Yahoo and Redwood City, Calif.'s
ExciteAtHome said they're jumping into the online game mainly as a
convenience to consumers and to encourage them to register with the
site and give them personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts say the wireless telephone companies are in
the catbird seat because they can track where users go and feed
them targeted ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a saying that he who owns the customer information,
controls the customer,'' said Cole, the Renaissance analyst. ``We
are extremely bullish'' on wireless firms.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy watchdogs, however, are increasingly worried that phone
companies may not adequately safeguard customers' personal
information.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS stoked concerns earlier this year after a Seattle
software developer noticed that his phone automatically transmitted
his phone number to any Web site he visited. Sprint denied it was a
problem, but promised to eliminate the practice in the new version
of its software.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, an AT&AMP;T spokesman initially confirmed that AT&AMP;T
phones worked the same way, then insisted they were different.
``AT&AMP;T's Pocketnet service does not transmit phone numbers to Web
sites,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a disclaimer, bundled with AT&AMP;T Internet phones, warns users
that their personal information including the ``mobile number''
will be transmitted to other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The disclaimer shocked privacy advocate Jason Catlett, president
of the Junkbusters in New Jersey, when he stumbled across it after
buying an AT&AMP;T Internet phone. Catlett said it is always worrisome
when companies assign Net users a unique ID, because it lets Web
sites track individuals, but using a phone number raises even more
red flags. ``I have friends who don't give out their cell phone
number,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokesman Ritch Blasi said the phone company plans to
update its software in the next 30 to 60 days to scramble the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Other privacy issues lurk on the horizon. Federal regulators,
for instance, have ordered phone companies to find ways to identify
the precise location of a user, so 911 dispatchers can quickly find
anyone who calls in for help.
</P>
<P>
   The information could also potentially be used by wireless Web
users to find the location of the nearest ATM machine or get
directions if they are lost. But Catlett worries that cell phone
companies could sell the information to Web operators, who hope to
target customers with ads for nearby stores. Catlett called it
``cookies on steroids.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the alarms, most analysts predict wireless Net
technology will become nearly ubiquitous in a few years, as more
telephones come ready-armed with Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the service has already taken off in some other parts
of the world. More than 7.8 million Japanese, for instance, use NTT
DoCoMo's iMode service to go online. In Asia and Europe, the
service is especially popular for sending short digital notes to
friends and colleagues, like sending an instant message on America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   Lin, the San Francisco user, said he's already a fan. But Lin
was quickly shocked by bills of $100 to $150 a month after he first
started using his Net phone.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms have a flat rate for $7 to $20 per month. But others,
such as Sprint, charge the same price for navigating the Web as
they do for regular voice calls.
</P>
<P>
   So, until the price comes down, Lin said he can only afford to
log on if he is expecting an urgent e-mail or if the Giants are
playing in a crucial game and he's dying to see the score.

 LAST GASP FOR BANK OF AMERICA ENTITIES  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At Bank of America, the final power grab is
under way.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, NationsBank bought the San Francisco
financial giant and took its name. Now, executives of the North
Carolina bank are seizing control of the last stronghold of the old
BofA _ the global, corporate and investment banking division based
here.
</P>
<P>
   The division's chief, Michael Murray, was the lone survivor from
the old BofA among the combined bank's top-ranking leadership. A
month ago, he announced his retirement, paving the way for a
sweeping shift of control from old BofA managers to their
NationsBank counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Murray stepped down, his replacement, longtime
NationsBank corporate banker Ed Brown, unveiled a far-reaching
reorganization of the unit.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a subtle plan. All four of Brown's key deputies are
now former NationsBank executives. And all top managers from the
old BofA find either that their authority has been slashed or they
have been assigned new bosses lower on the corporate totem poll _
or both.
</P>
<P>
   Now BofA watchers are asking whether the next shoe to drop will
be the move of the global division's headquarters to North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   If so, that would break the promise NationsBank made when it
bought BofA _ to keep wholesale banking headquartered here. And it
would leave San Francisco as no more than a regional outpost for
the bank, on par with Jacksonville, Fla., and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is based in San Francisco and the city officially remains
the division's headquarters. ``I'm here and I'm staying,'' Brown
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most executives based in San Francisco were effectively
demoted and all of the unit's other key officers now work
elsewhere, raising the question of whether the city will be the
division's headquarters in name only.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flow of power and responsibility continues to go east or,
better said, (to) the Southeast,'' said John Wilson, a recruiter
with the executive search firm Korn/Ferry International.
</P>
<P>
   The global, corporate and investment bank is one of the world's
largest wholesale banking operations. It does business in 38
countries, vies with Chase Manhattan for the title of largest U.S.
corporate lender and owns the former Montgomery Securities, renamed
Bank of America Securities, a major investment bank. More than
2,000 people work for the division in the Bay Area, many of them in
the securities unit.
</P>
<P>
   You might say what's happening to the division is deja vu all
over again, duplicating NationsBank's take-charge tactics in
consumer banking during the takeover's early days.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first fights between the old BofA's chief executive,
David Coulter, and his NationsBank counterpart, Hugh McColl,
concerned the appointment of a NationsBank executive to run retail
operations in the West.
</P>
<P>
   It took longer for NationsBank to make its move in the wholesale
arena because the old BofA was by far the bigger of the two banks
in the business. Before the takeover, NationsBank had only a
nascent overseas operation and was far behind BofA in accounts with
big corporations.
</P>
<P>
   When the banks divided top jobs in 1998, there was little debate
about giving the global and corporate portfolio to Murray, the old
BofA manager. Brown became his deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, 56, originally planned to hand power over to Brown
sometime in 2001. But he decided to advance his departure because
he was beginning to feel like ``a fifth wheel,'' he told The
Chronicle in an interview last month.
</P>
<P>
   Once Murray was out of the way, Brown put his own people in
place. As his key reports, he selected four NationsBank executives,
two based in North Carolina and one each in Chicago and New York.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco executives from the old BofA were the big losers.
International banking chief Robert Morrow, for example, lost
responsibility for Europe, which was transferred to Charlotte
executive Tom Bunn. Morrow, who formerly reported to Brown, now
works for Bunn.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, San Francisco executives Timothy Bottoms, who manages
North American credit products, and Richard Harris, who runs the
bank's leasing unit, previously reported to Brown or Murray. Now
their bosses are more-junior executives.
</P>
<P>
   And Jeremy Fair, formerly chief of U.S. corporate banking, lost
his job to NationsBank executive Graham Denton. A bank spokesman
said Fair will be offered another senior position.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Brown said he didn't care whether managers came
from the BofA side or the NationsBank side when he handed out
assignments. And he said he wants everyone to stay. ``Everybody has
been offered a job. No one has been asked to leave,'' he stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked specifically about Morrow, Brown said Bunn was the logical
choice to manage European operations because he already manages
leveraged finance, the bank's top-priority product on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   The division's shifting center of gravity is paralleled at Bank
of America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   With its home office in the Transamerica Pyramid, the old
Montgomery Securities was a mainstay of San Francisco's Financial
District. Lewis Coleman, formerly the unit's chief in San
Francisco, now reports to New York executive Carter McClelland.
</P>
<P>
   While New York executives now manage investment banking, San
Francisco will remain the base for brokerage operations for the
foreseeable future, Brown said. Securities sales and trading
operations are anchored here because the bank opened a
state-of-the-art trading floor in the Pyramid a year ago.

 REGULATORS PLAN RULES TO SIMPLIFY PHONE BILLS  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ State regulators in California plan to propose a
new set of rules Monday to force telephone companies to simplify
their bills and disclose key terms to customers.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Los Angeles, the National Association of
Regulatory Utility Commissioners is expected to unveil the
``truth-in-billing guidelines,'' which could serve as a model for
each state.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, which must still be formally approved by the group
later this week, are similar to guidelines already approved by the
Federal Communications Commission. The move underscores the growing
role of state regulators in protecting consumers from phone
companies, including interstate long-distance companies and
cellular giants.
</P>
<P>
   States need their own rules because they don't always have the
authority to enforce federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, California joined five other states in suing
WorldCom for false advertising and improperly billing customers.
And several states also sued AT&AMP;T and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really happening is that enforcing (telecommunications
rules) are falling more and more to the states,'' said Joan Smith,
a commissioner with the Oregon Public Utility Commission, who is
scheduled to field questions at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the FCC is increasingly looking to the states for
help because complaints are soaring against long-distance
companies. A recent study found that complaints against WorldCom
and AT&AMP;T tripled over the past three years nationwide. And growing
competition has also boosted the number of companies selling
service. ``There is no way (the FCC) can handle it all alone,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has also specifically taken action to give states more
authority to go after long-distance companies for slamming, or
switching customers' service without permission. In the past,
states often had to refer complaints to the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman William Kennard, who is from Los Angeles, is also
scheduled to appear at the news conference. ``It's a signal that he
sees a very important role for the states,'' said Carl Wood, a
commissioner with the California Public Utilities Commission, who
will also attend.
</P>
<P>
   California is already in the process of hammering out its own
guidelines as part of a Telecommunications Bill of Rights. Indeed,
the national group borrowed its preamble almost entirely from a
California staff report on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, William Schulte, director of the state PUC's
consumer services division, helped craft the national guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the proposals, included in a draft of the document,
include making sure that telephone companies use the same name on
the bills as they use to market the service. Companies would also
be required to highlight any new services or changes in rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overarching goal ... is to help the consumer understand
better what is sold to them and not be confused,'' said William
Gillis, a commissioner with the Washington Utilities Transportation
Commission, who heads the regulatory group's consumer affairs
committee.

former Mayor  &UR; Ed Koch &LR;  chowing down with former Police Commissioner

their table and mentioned they might like to read Talk magazine's
July story about  &UR; Rudolph Giuliani &LR; .
</P>
<P>

by  &UR; Benjamin Wingate &LR;  and his family 150 years ago, selected and
edited by &UR; Stephen Vincent &LR; . Wingate worked as an accountant in San

</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a young man, I should certainly settle here,'' he
wrote in 1852. ``... I can get everything I want to eat, drink or
wear, here, as well as in New York, or Boston. The market is well
supplied with everything. Indeed it is much better furnished with
some things, than is desirable. Cards, dice, painted women, obscene
prints, gin cock-tails and brandy-smashers are in large demand and
full supply. But then to meet and oppose them, there are churches,
Sabbath schools, active temperance societies, libraries, reading
rooms, many good families and a large number of well-principled and
consistent men. ... Many sanguine and successful persons describe
California as a Paradise. Others of a sour and bilious temperament,
who are disappointed and homesick, paint it as the hot-bed of
iniquity, from which all good men should escape. ... The truth lies
between them.''
</P>
<P>
   - Reading ``Westward Tilt: The American West Today,'' written by

   ``He is often pictured as a crew-cut young man on Montgomery

finds it in vogue to be alarmed by the new freeways which obstruct
some views of the bay and disgorge great traffic jams into
downtown. He is knowledgeable about restaurants and a bit of a jazz

DEUTSCHE TELEKOM HIRING LOBBYISTS IN QUEST FOR VOICESTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (With VOICESTREAM-DEUTSCHE) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Deutsche Telekom's bid to enter the United States
begins a political battle over tricky regulatory questions and
fundamental trade policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications company whose majority stockholder is the
German government was scheduled Tuesday to formally announced its
intention to buy VoiceStream for $50.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But political opposition to the deal began to foment in
Washington during the publicized negotiations with VoiceStream,
including a legislative initiative in the Senate to block the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom has responded by retaining Lloyd Cutler, the
former White House counsel to Presidents Clinton and Carter.
Cutler's law firm, Wilmer, Cutler &AMP; Pickering, is engaged in a
three-pronged attack on behalf of its new client. It must persuade
Congress not to intervene, the White House to approve the deal and
the Federal Communications Commission to approve the transfer of
wireless telephone licenses.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the deal and the legislative and regulatory
fight said Cutler had turned to his golden Rolodex, urging
lawmakers and other officials not to stand in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telecom and VoiceStream have also hired more than half
a dozen lobbying and law firms with former White House officials
and congressional aides. They include Pat Griffin, the former top
White House lobbyist in the Clinton administration, and Dan Tate
Jr. of Cassidy &AMP; Associates, a former White House official and aide
to Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying effort has begun to pay off. The White House
announced its opposition Monday to two separate pieces of
legislation drafted by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings and supported by
many top lawmakers that could derail the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the Communications Workers of America, a significant
lobbying force in its own right, recently sent a letter to Congress
supporting the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The deal's fate, though, will probably not be in the hands of
President Clinton or William Kennard, the FCC chairman, who Monday
again promised he would scrutinize the acquisition closely. Since
reviews by the FCC and a host of other government agencies almost
certainly cannot be completed before 2001, it will be up to the
next president and the next chief of the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   The primary issue is the ownership of Deutsche Telekom. More
than half of its stock is controlled by the German government, and
even after the deal is completed, the government's stake will be 45
percent, far more than the 25 percent limit generally permitted by
federal communications law.
</P>
<P>
   But the company and some lawyers say the law also contains an
important exception for deals deemed to be in the public interest _
a test, they say, that is satisfied because the German government
belongs to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom plans to convey a message that at a time of
rapid consolidation, the deal brings a new player to the table,
increasing competition by lowering prices and encouraging
innovation in the wireless telephone market.
</P>
<P>
   Top executives at the two companies said Monday in a telephone
interview that they would come to Washington this week to convey
that theme to the Federal Communications Commission and to other
officials who have expressed skepticism about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the rhetoric about the transaction in Washington is
merely an attempt by our large competitors to keep us from having
access to resources to become competitive,'' said John Stanton, the
chief executive of VoiceStream. ``This is pro-consumer and
pro-competitive. It will create another large national competitor
in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Deutsche Telekom plan to pump $5 billion in new
investments into VoiceStream even before the deal is completed to
participate in an upcoming auction over spectrum licenses is widely
hailed as good news at the FCC, which has been trying to stimulate
as much interest, and as many large bids, as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory battle pits a pre-World War II federal
communications law aimed at discouraging foreign investment in the
United States against a 1997 World Trade Organization agreement on
telecommunications services that was meant to do the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that the FCC appears to have the authority to
approve the deal, even though the law is murky. But Congress is
flirting with changing the law and eliminating any ambiguities.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Hollings, a Democrat from South Carolina, renewed his
criticism of the deal and vowed to press forward with legislation
supported by a number of congressional leaders, including the
majority and minority leaders, that would block the deal. Hollings
has sponsored two measures that would block the deal.
</P>
<P>
   One is a rider to an appropriations bill that would prevent the
FCC from approving the deal for a year. A second bill would
permanently block the deal as long as the German government owned
more than 25 percent of Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollings' legislation suffered a setback when the White
House announced that it could not support the legislation because
it was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that these various regulatory and antitrust reviews
can address the senator's concern and new legislation is not
necessary,'' said Jake Seiwert, a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Deutsche Telekom's potential rivals in the United States
have urged lawmakers to step in, maintaining that it would be
unfair to permit entry in the United States of a foreign company
that enjoys the backing of a foreign government. The competitors
have laid low, congressional aides say, in part because they have
interests in possibly expanding abroad and in part because they
want to leave the door open to foreign investments in their
companies.

GILES TO BE NAMED HEAD OF NIEMAN FOUNDATION

<P>
   Robert Giles, 67, the former Detroit News editor and publisher
whose candidacy reignited resentment over the five-year old Detroit
newspaper strike, is expected to be named curator of Harvard
University's Nieman Foundation Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Harvard nor Giles was available for comment Monday. But
word of his appointment to head the nation's most prestigious
journalism fellowship program was posted on the online version of
Editor &AMP; Publisher Monday. Another source, who requested
confidentiality, informed the Globe of Harvard's decision to choose
Giles, whose selection as curator had seemed imminent several weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Giles, senior vice president at The Freedom Forum, saw his
bid threatened by a lobbying campaign conducted by unions and
journalists critical of his role during the strike. In late June,
Metropolitan Detroit AFL-CIO president Donald W. Boggs and
Newspaper Guild president Linda K. Foley sent letters asking
Harvard President Neil Rudenstine to reject Giles as curator,
complaining that he was a polarizing figure during the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper Guild of Detroit president Lou Mleczko said Monday
that the ``local is very disappointed'' to hear that Harvard had
put the leadership of ``such a venerable and respected program in
the hands of what we feel is a mediocre candidate, at best.'
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the union complaints, some of Giles's colleagues
began weighing in on his behalf. Sandra Mims Rowe, editor of The
(Portland) Oregonian, told the Globe that the attack on Giles's
strike record was ``unjust'' given his ``substantial contributions
to journalism.'' And four officers of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors recently signed a letter to Rudenstine supportive
of Giles.
</P>
<P>
   Giles's appointment would end Harvard's tortuous efforts to
replace Bill Kovach, the respected former editor of the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, as Nieman curator. The school failed to land
several of its top candidates, Globe columnist Ellen Goodman and
new Los Angeles Times editor John Carroll. At one point, the
National Association of Black Journalists suggested that Harvard
consider several minority candidates, adding that the process could
benefit from a ``diverse pool'' of contenders.

former Mayor  &UR; Ed Koch &LR;  chowing down with former Police Commissioner

   ``If I was a young man, I should certainly settle here,'' he
wrote in 1852. ``... I can get everything I want to eat, drink or
wear, here, as well as in New York, or Boston. The market is well
supplied with everything. Indeed it is much better furnished with
some things, than is desirable. Cards, dice, painted women, obscene
prints, gin cock-tails and brandy-smashers are in large demand and
full supply. But then to meet and oppose them, there are churches,
Sabbath schools, active temperance societies, libraries, reading
rooms, many good families and a large number of well-principled and
consistent men. ... Many sanguine and successful persons describe
California as a Paradise. Others of a sour and bilious temperament,
who are disappointed and homesick, paint it as the hot-bed of
iniquity, from which all good men should escape. ... The truth lies
between them.''

   - Reading ``Westward Tilt: The American West Today,'' written by

some views of the bay and disgorge great traffic jams into
downtown. He is knowledgeable about restaurants and a bit of a jazz

GETTING AWAY, THE DUTCH WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   In summer
when the local population is augmented by the swarm of tourists
that descend on Amsterdam, walking the web of streets and alleys
that crisscross the canals can be exhausting. At any time of year,
this densely populated city can feel crowded.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who want a bit of an escape, there is a serene
counterpoint to the city's bustle just a half-hour out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Volendam is a fishing village on the coast of what was called
the Zuider Zee until 1932, when the Dutch government built a dike
that closed it off from the sea. Visitors can get there either by
car or by bus, which runs every 30 minutes from Amsterdam's Central
Station _ a 15-minute walk from the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   Volendam's harbor is ringed with two- and three-story houses
painted in cheerful tones of green, black and red, their windows
immaculately trimmed in white. Larger European harbors are often
crowded with speed boats, but there was only one docked in Volendam
the day my son, David, and I visited last summer. Instead, small
modern sailboats or old wood-bottomed fishing boats rested at the
slips. Their owners still earn their living catching herring, eel
and shrimp. The day we sat drinking koffie verkeerd _ the Dutch
version of cafe au lait _ ``The Mermaid,'' a double-masted old wood
clipper, sailed into port, manned by local fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Volendam's boats were only part of the pleasure. The real treat
was watching the Dutch sky, with clouds rapidly bunching and
dispersing, hiding and revealing the sun. A sailboat glided into a
sunlit sliver of sea that darkened to black as a cloud bank swept
across.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter, Anne, who lives near Utrecht, advised us to go in
the morning when the town was likely to be most tranquil, and it
was relatively deserted (on weekends, it is a popular excursion
from Amsterdam).
</P>
<P>
   After watching the boats, we boarded the half-empty ferry for
the 30-minute ride to Marken, an island until 1957, when it was
joined to the mainland by a causeway. Creating the causeway
provoked outrage among Marken's independent and ecologically minded
citizens. The deeply religious Calvinist population lives a life
somewhat less removed from that of its mainland counterparts than
it once was. The 3,000 inhabitants used to support themselves as
fishermen; today many commute from their small wooden homes to
surrounding towns to work in a variety of trades. The day I
visited, the tiny town was quiet, and there was little traffic.
Residents have all painted their wooden homes either a somber green
or black. But the interiors of the little two-story houses are
generally bright yellow and blue.
</P>
<P>
   Marken, which is ringed by ice in winter, had no electricity or
heat until 40 years ago, and in the Marker Museum, a spare, small
house museum at the port, the rigors of that earlier era are made
clear. Delft tiles telling biblical stories surround the fireplace
from floor to ceiling. The family depended on heat from the stove,
and all slept in a single room: the parents on the top of a
double-decker bed, and the children in a small bed beneath them.
</P>
<P>
   It is the queen's custom to visit one Dutch town on her birthday
each year. The guide, who was dressed in the traditional long gown
with a lace bodice, explained proudly that three years ago Queen
Beatrix had chosen to visit Marken.
</P>
<P>
   Though the weather was clear, the winds were so strong that the
hot chocolate on the ferry going back was welcome, even in summer.
</P>
<P>
   From Volendam, it was only a two-mile drive to Edam, home of
Edam cheese. Tour buses usually include Edam in their trips. We
drove, but the buses that leave Amsterdam's Central train station
every half hour for Volendam go on to Edam, which is also a port.
If you have the inclination, you can rent a bicycle and peddle your
way as many Dutch do.
</P>
<P>
   Edam is far wealthier than Volendam or Marken, and the houses
that line its main canal are substantial stone residences, though
some tilt slightly. Just across the broad arched pedestrian bridge
on Damplein _ the main square _ stands the Speeltheatre, an
18th-century building that recalls the town's once lively cultural
life.
</P>
<P>
   Edam's history began in the 12th century, when the Dutch settled
along the little Ye River _ hence ``Yedam.'' In its heyday as a
shipbuilding center, Edam's shipyard built the Halve Mann used by
Henry Hudson on his 1609 foray to find a northern route to the
Orient. He ended instead on the island of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Local stores will arrange to ship cheese almost anywhere in the
world, but before addressing any shipping slips, we tasted (at no
charge) a number of varieties of Edam at one of the several cheese
stores along the Damplein. The most prevalent Edam here comes in a
yellow wrapper and has a far sharper flavor than the red-packaged
version that is a staple in the United States. My favorite was the
aged Edam. The wedge we bought was gone by the time we returned to
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   If Volendam and Marken are quiet counterpoints to Amsterdam,
Haarlem is a sophisticated but diminutive version of its larger
neighbor and has become a popular residential area for wealthy
Dutch who work in Amsterdam. We made the half-hour drive by car,
but trains leave Amsterdam's Central Station every 10 minutes for
the 20-minute trip.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape painters Salomon van Ruysdael and his nephew Jacob
van Ruisdael (who spelled their surnames differently) were born
here. Frans Hals spent most of his career in Haarlem, painting
everyone from the local power elite to common folk in the pubs.
Today there is a good-sized museum in Haarlem that houses nine
important Hals paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling main square, where one is likely to see residents
arrive on bicycles built for two, is just five minutes from the
train station. It sits in the shadow of St. Bavo, a church built
between 1400 and 1550, the successor to one first mentioned in
1313. Though its exterior is dark and foreboding, the interior is
surprisingly light with white stone walls and 24 massive columns.
It is dominated by an organ built in 1738 by Christian Muller,
which has a special mystique because Mozart played it on a visit to
Haarlem in 1766. Lovers of organ music can check with the church
for a schedule of recitals, which are fairly frequent.
</P>
<P>
   The square boasts a fish market and a town hall. But before
stopping for coffee or lunch, meander over to the Frans Hals
Museum. The former orphanage, converted to a museum in 1913, is
built around a garden with clipped hedges and orange trees.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's great cache is a series of five Hals portraits of
the men who were then part of the local civil guards _ hung in a
single room. The subjects exhibit the robust energy and optimism
that is the hallmark of Hals' work. Unfortunately they are hung so
far above eye level it is difficult to examine them closely.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite was Hals' group portrait of the Governesses of the
Oudemannenhuis, an old men's house in Hals' day. That portrait is
in a separate room where the only sound was the whirring of the
humidifier as I studied the mean-spirited faces of the women who
once ran the hospice. So nasty are their expressions that it was
long believed, incorrectly, that Hals had been under their
supervision as a patient. However, he did paint the group portrait
when he was more than 80 years old, in 1664.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also houses portraits by other artists of the
Netherlands of the period including Jan Verspronck, Jan van Scorel
and Cornelis Cornelisz, offering a chance to study how Hals was
influenced by his predecessors and contemporaries _ and in relative
peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Following the winding Spaarne River brings you to the oldest
museum in the Netherlands, founded by a wealthy Mennonite silk
merchant and banker, Pieter Teijler. The Mennonites believed in
accumulating wealth, if it was used for noble causes. Teijler's
will created a foundation to promote religion, encouragement of the
arts and sciences and help for the poor. The Teylers Museum, built
shortly after the patron's death in 1778, houses his collection of
fossils, metals, scientific instruments, books and drawings by
Raphael, Rembrandt and Michelangelo, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Those with an interest in science will like the heliograph, an
astronomical telescope built in 1874 to observe and photograph the
transition of Venus over the Sun. It is housed in the most charming
room of the museum, a double-story space with a library on the
second floor.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Frans Hals Museum, this one fits easily into its
neighborhood, so that a visitor can sit in the pleasant cafe and
look across the backyard into neighboring houses, some still
cheerfully uncurtained as they were in the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   From the Teylers, it is only a short walk to the train station,
but I was tempted to stop by the Hals Museum once more. While
Marken had a naive charm, Volandam some lovely vistas, Edam its
prosperous homes and its cheeses, Haarlem offered both charm and
the chance to ponder some of the great art of the Netherlands in
welcome tranquillity.

CLINTON PUSHES FOR MIDEAST ACCORD 
 

</HEADLINE>
 TALKS-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ President Clinton kept pushing Israeli and
Palestinian leaders to make peace Monday as the Camp David summit
entered its third week and the parties continued to search for
common ground on which to build an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Just back from a whirlwind trip to Japan, Clinton plunged into
marathon negotiating sessions with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. After a few hours sleep, he
went back to it again hoping to persuade the long-time enemies to
compromise over their competing claims to Jerusalem, which has
become the major stumbling block to a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart described the talks as
``exhaustive and exhausting'' and said the president still believes
there is ``a realistic chance'' that an agreement can be reached.
But he acknowledged that controversial issues remain that will be
extremely difficult to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hesitate to use a phrase like `hopeful' (that an agreement
is near) because these issues are so difficult, and I don't know
that I would be able to back that up with any substance,'' said
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``the fact that these discussions are continuing
is a positive thing...and as long as we're here and discussing
things, there is a prospect for reaching an agreement. But it's
impossible to predict the likelihood of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to take another break from the talks today
to attend the funeral in Arkansas of Diane Blair, a close family
friend. He planned to return to Camp David tonight.
</P>
<P>
   After attending the economic summit in Japan, Clinton returned
to the talks on Sunday evening and went immediately into separate
meetings with Arafat and Barak. Later he had dinner with the two
leaders, and at midnight launched into another round of joint talks
with Palestinian, Israeli and U.S. negotiators that lasted until 5
a.m. At 10:30 a.m. Monday, he was back at it trying to force
concessions from both sides, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he was up until 5 a.m. working through the
issues in a very personal, hands-on way, and that he was back at it
again early this morning should lead you to believe that he thinks
staying here for the time being is worthwhile,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lockhart said the parties know ``that there is a balance
here between taking the time to work through the issues and taking
too much time that will never lead to an agreement.``
</P>
<P>
   The negotiating teams continued to maintain their vow of secrecy
in keeping with the news blackout that was imposed when the talks
began on July 11. But Israel's chief negotiator, Shlomo Ben-Ami,
told Israeli army radio that a ``final clarification'' of where the
talks stand will be made by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While shying away from any discussion of substance, he said the
parties had agreed Sunday night on Clinton's return to begin
around-the-clock negotiations aimed at forcing a final agreement or
an end to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   While Lockhart said that some ``areas of agreement'' have been
found by the Palestinians and Israelis, reports out of the Middle
East indicated that competing claims to Jerusalem, which is home to
holy sites for Jews, Muslims and Christians, remains the biggest
obstacle to a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is demanding that the Palestinians be given sovereignty
over all of East Jerusalem, which was captured by the Israelis in
the 1967 war and annexed a year later. But so far Barak has
indicated that Jerusalem must remain undivided with the
Palestinians getting control of only some of the Arab neighborhoods
in the old eastern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Tayeb Abdel-Rahim, a senior Arafat aide who spoke with reporters
in Gaza Monday, said the talks have yet to resolve other core
issues as well, including where the final borders of a Palestinian
state will be drawn, the fate of Palestinian refugees and Israeli
settlers in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   But Abdel-Rahim acknowledged that if the Jerusalem question
could be resolved the other issues would be easier to address.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution is very simple _ give full sovereignty of East
Jerusalem to a Palestinian state,'' Abdel Rahim said, adding that
Arafat would guarantee all faiths with access to the holy sites in
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready to have Jerusalem as an open city for all
religions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, however, Barak may not be able to take that step.
He entered the talks with his government in a precarious position,
having lost several of its coalition members who resigned over the
prospect of the Palestinians winning control of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show that most Israelis still view East Jerusalem
as their ``eternal undivided capital'' and oppose any concessions
that would give Palestinian control over any part of it. And Barak
is reminded nearly every day by his opponents of the danger of
being the first Israeli leader to make concessions on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, former Israeli foreign minister Ariel Sharon told
Israeli radio that ``no prime minister has the right to make
concessions over Jerusalem. Jerusalem is the birthright of the
Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart declined to speculate on how the talks are progressing
on Jerusalem, and at one point even admonished reporters for
raising questions about the ``moods'' of Barak and Arafat on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that in the 21st century how you feel is often more
important than what you do, but not here,'' he said. &QL;

car out of food? Amtrak says it wants to make things right, and, if
it fails, wants to make sure passengers get their money's worth, by
giving them a certificate for future travel.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new policy announced this month, passengers _ whom the
railroad now refers to as ``guests'' _ are asked to make their
complaint on the spot, to a conductor or other Amtrak employee. But
even if a disgruntled passenger eels shortchanged and calls the
national reservation number instead, the railroad will offer a
certificate to take the trip again free, said George Warrington,
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no small print,'' he said. The railroad may give away
some certificates for trivial complaints, he acknowledged, but it
will build loyalty among riders. ``This is about the long haul, not
about short-term hand wringing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about the long haul is a change for Amtrak, which has
led a hand-to-mouth existence for the last few years, its recent
history a ``Perils of Pauline'' saga in which the onrushing train,
not the damsel on the tracks, is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Its strategy, as described by Warrington, was to ``cut its way
into profitability'' by slicing off more and more service. Instead,
the railroad, created by Congress in 1971 as a way to preserve the
passenger service that the investor-owned railroads were closing
down, was decimating itself, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Amtrak has recently shifted its focus, deciding to add
trains and readjust schedules to permit connections, making its
system work like an integrated network, as the airlines do. The
satisfaction guarantee follows training for its 25,000 employees in
customer service, and a long effort to make sure its trains are
``right and ready'' for each run.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes at a time of success for the railroad, which is
beginning to partake of the travel boom that has come along with
sustained national prosperity. Bookings are at a nine-year high,
the railroad said, with passenger loads up 7 percent for the four
months ending June 30, compared with a year earlier. Passenger
traffic on its four daily all-electric Acela Regional trains
between Washington and Boston is up 40 percent over the older
trains they replaced, the railroad said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real bump up,'' said Mortimer Downey, the deputy
secretary of Transportation. The additional passengers are coming
out of planes and automobiles, not other trains, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad intends to introduce its high-speed Acela service,
with a top speed of 150 miles an hour (30 mph faster the current
top speed), later this summer. That had been scheduled for last
year, but a variety of problems surfaced in the new trains during
testing. In recent post-test inspections, for example, some bolts
were missing from the new trains, but technicians have installed
longer, stronger ones, Downey said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that aside from a late start to the new service,
they did not expect any significant problems.
</P>
<P>
   Railroad officials also say, without mentioning the airlines
directly, that it is not hard to do better at customer service than
their main competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers want travel that's going to improve their quality of
life,'' said Warrington, discussing the new guarantee with
reporters. That means warm personal contact, he said, and help that
can sometimes be quite simple. If a train is running late, he said,
it could be something like giving out a phone card so the passenger
can call ahead, at Amtrak's expense, to tell waiting relatives of
the delay.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that Amtrak said showed the policy was working, ticket
sales in the first 15 days after the guarantee announcement were
$57.6 million, up $8.3 million, or 17 percent, above the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak has been promising free tickets to dissatisfied customers
for the last three years on a single train, the Coast Starlight,
which runs between Los Angeles and Seattle. It has given them to
fewer than one passenger in 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   But that train is ``one of our gems,'' as Warrington put it, and
railroad officials expect far higher rates systemwide. They are
aiming for one in 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 15 days, the railroad issued 2,987 service
guarantees, or about 3 for every 1,000 passengers. They were worth
$228,000, about 0.4 percent of sales. The average value of a
certificate was $76. The most common reason was lateness, said Bill
Schulz, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines sometimes placate irate passengers with discount
coupons for future travel, or a gift of frequent-flier miles, but
industry experts doubt any will follow Amtrak's lead with a
guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margins are so tight,'' said David A. Fuscus, a spokesman for
the Air Transport Association, a trade group, who said that if an
airline makes a profit of 5 cents per dollar of revenue, ``people
are doing cartwheels down the middle of the street.'' The airlines
are hundreds of times bigger than Amtrak, he said, so offering
guarantees could mean enormous liabilities.

 &HT;    Dumb ideas? She wrote the book on them
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jane O'Boyle did what any of us could have done with a particle
of imagination and an ounce of follow-through: She compiled
``Wrong!'' (Plume, $11.95), a collection of the biggest bonehead
predictions, pronouncements and decisions ever made, and offered
them to the public in an 88-page, soft-cover book.
</P>
<P>
   The result is _ well, two kinds of reading satisfaction. The
first is relief in knowing that it wasn't you who committed the
big-time gaffe. The second is the perverse pride of authorship when
you know that your own stupidity has surpassed the examples given.
</P>
<P>
   It's that second reaction that interests me. If, on reading the
following examples from ``Wrong!,'' you find yourself saying, ``Ha,
that's nothing. Why, I remember the time I ... ``
</P>
<P>
   The time you what?
</P>
<P>
   You bet your friend that he could run over your foot with his
front tire and that it wouldn't hurt? Came up with a foolproof
roulette system?
</P>
<P>
   Write or e-mail me an example of the wrongest you have ever
been, and if I judge your entry the best, the book is yours.
Otherwise, you will have exposed yourself to taunts and ridicule
for nothing, and how dumb is that?
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, some of your memories are repressed. Let's see if
some examples from O'Boyle's book bring them to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   After Elvis Presley's first Grand Ole Opry appearance, manager
Jim Denny was guarded in his praise for the new talent: ``You ain't
going nowhere. ... You ought to be back to driving a truck.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1859, oil distributor Edwin L. Drake set about devising ways
to go into the ground and get crude. He consulted professional
water-well drillers, who assessed his proposal in these words:
``Drill for oil? You mean drill into the ground to try to find oil?
You're crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing for Albert Einstein to be dismissed as nothing
special when he applied to the Munich Technical Institute. But how
do you account for Ernest P. Rutherford, a guy smart enough to be
first to split the atom in 1933, who then tut-tutted the feat as
hardly worth the trouble? Afterward, the Cambridge physics
professor declared: ``The energy produced by the atom is a very
poor kind of thing. Anyone who expects a source of power from the
transformation of these atoms is talking moonshine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Olson, president and founder of Digital Equipment, was more
or less wrong when he said: ``There is no reason anyone would want
a computer in their home.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, when Joe DiMaggio came up from the New York Giants farm
team, he limped from a knee injury. Giants manager Bill Terry took
a look at the rookie and saw enough to offer the following
congratulations to farm team director George Weiss: ``You bought
yourself a cripple.''
</P>
<P>
   In the marketing game, O'Boyle neglects the famous marketing
mistakes, such as Ford's Edsel and New Coke, to remind us that
there's wrong _ and then there's real wrong. Like when Ivan
Petrovich Pavlov decided it wasn't enough to make a dog salivate by
ringing a bell, not when he could corner the lucrative dog spit
market. This is not a joke. Pavlov demonstrated that maybe there
was a reason Russians showed no early aptitude for capitalism: ``It
is less well known,'' O'Boyle reports, ``that Pavlov tried to
market his discovery by bottling dog saliva and selling it as an
appetite stimulant.''
</P>
<P>
   In business, sometimes you need somebody to tell you when you
have a bad idea. Fred Smith had the benefit of a Yale business
professor, who told him just that after he submitted his senior
thesis for what later became Federal Express: ``The concept is
interesting and well-formed, but in order to earn better than a C,
the idea must be feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it is time for you to put on the hair shirt and tell me the
wrongest you have ever been. To bolster your courage, remember that
no matter how wrong you have been, you couldn't have been any
wronger than Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who stated in 1940, ``Japan
will never join the Axis.'' The day after his statement, Japan
announced it had done exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   And you certainly couldn't be any wronger than I was when I was
5 and tried to boost myself on the back of a mule-drawn wagon by
sticking my foot on a rising spoke. Dragged under the wagon, I was
smacked against the ground and the bed about eleventy-nine times
before my foot came free.

 &HT;    What grows in a dorm room?
 &HT;    By Heather Graulich
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could give Sam Pasley a hard time about ``The Chickster.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, how many college freshmen do you know who sleep with
a stuffed chicken they've had since childhood? But then again, do
you really want to tangle with a 6-foot, 3-inch guy who weighs 300
pounds and played offensive tackle for Delray Beach's Atlantic High
School?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already got The Chickster dressed up in FSU gear,'' says
Pasley, now a Florida State University freshman who recently moved
into a dorm room _ with The Chickster _ for summer session. ``All
my friends give me a lot of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Teasing aside, Pasley's like most young adults heading off to
college: They look forward to living independently but still want
their home-away-from-home to be just that _ homey. And most schools
try to make the transition easier, too. Most notably, they don't
even call them dormitories anymore. ``Residence halls'' is the
preferred term.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to dispel the old image of the big, impersonal
environment,'' says Christine Brun Abdelnour, an interior designer
and author of ``Big Ideas for Small Spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's quite a science to it; to capture those young freshmen
and make them comfortable, because this is their prime
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides The Chickster, Pasley took along some family photos and
a few favorite posters of sports stars like Nolan Ryan and Barry
Sanders to help him feel at home.
</P>
<P>
   LeAnn Barkey, a recent graduate of Lincoln Park Academy in Fort
Pierce who heads off to the University of Tampa next month, will
carefully stick some glow-in-the-dark stars on her ceiling to
remind her of her little brother, Will, who loves them. (Of course,
she'll use a tacky putty so as not to damage the ceiling and get
hit with those pesky repair fees.)
</P>
<P>
   But, like all college students living in residence halls, Barkey
has already found certain elements of uniformity that can make
settling in tricky _ like the ``extra-long twin sheets''
phenomenon. Barkey and her mom, Kathy, finally gave up searching
for the sheets at local stores and ordered a hunter green set
through the college. (Many schools use extra-long twin beds in
residence halls so that even the tallest students can fit in them.)
</P>
<P>
   To make her room cozier, though, Barkey settled on a warm color
palette of hunter green and burgundy to complement the sheet set.
She found a burgundy and white plaid throw rug to help cushion what
will surely be a hard-surfaced floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do hope it'll be cozy,'' Barkey says of her room, ``because
it'll be a hard transition to go from being at home at night to
being somewhere where your only comfort is someone (a roommate)
who's a stranger to you.''

 &HT;    After Big Tobacco, we need a class-action world
 &HT;    By Practical Man
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The practical man lit up last week.
</P>
<P>
   When he heard the tobacco verdict.
</P>
<P>
   No, he has nothing against tobacco companies. In fact, the
practical man puts them on par with coffee growers and Scotch
distillers, for he knows the tasty truth about cigarettes: They're
yummy.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they're also dangerous, but for years the practical man
deemed those mouth-watering Marlboros worth the risk. Eventually,
an older, wiser practical man nixed nicotine for good, but when he
smoked, he smoked because he liked it, not because anyone made him.
And if he'd gotten sick, he would have blamed himself, not some
marketing meathead he knew was lying anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the practical man has had little sympathy for folks who
sue Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before he saw the practical applications.
</P>
<P>
   The light bulb went off when a Miami jury awarded 500,000 sick
smokers $145 billion because cigarette makers lied about their
product. Cash for corporate lies? The practical man did some math.
</P>
<P>
   Say you see a commercial for a blockbuster movie. The trailer
makes it look great, but when you go see the show, it stinks. Don't
just write it off as the way the world works. Do the right thing
for humanity: File a class-action suit! If you make $15 an hour,
you're due $30 for the two hours you wasted watching that sorry
flick, and if 10 million others saw it as well, BOOM! That's a $300
million verdict. Hammer Hollywood with a handful of those and watch
how fast movies improve, and misleading commercials disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Or, say your teenage daughter spots Cindy Crawford caking crud
on her face in a magazine ad. She buys a tube of goop, but _
surprise! _ the makeup doesn't make her look like Cindy. It makes
her look like your daughter goobered in goo. Don't waste your
breath arguing cosmetics with a 16-year-old. Improve the world!
Your kid and 15 million other young women will spend an average of
132 hours this year applying ``beauty'' products that won't make
them beautiful. If a teenager's time is worth $6 an hour (yeah, the
practical man knows that's a stretch), then WHAM! That $12 billion
judgment ought to make makeup makers think twice before lying to
little girls.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea. A couple of big-buck verdicts will clear the
air of preposterous automobile ads when sports-car drivers discover
they're still bald, beer-bellied bumpkins, not the suave
sophisticates they saw in the commercial. Sic a hungry lawyer on
the fast-food industry and feel a nation's arteries unclog when he
turns up 2 million heart patients who munched a Big Mac a week for
years. Target ads for insipid TV shows and the tobacco judgment
will look like chump change _ and television might become tolerable
at last.
</P>
<P>
   If we can't be just, let's be practical. If we're no longer
willing to blame consumers for being stupid, let's start blaming
corporations for treating them that way. We'll not only get rid of
the lies. We might even pick up enough jing to spring for a case of
brew. The commercials say that stuff's a chick magnet.

TAKING A BREAK FROM SCENIC VERMONT
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By MARIALISA CALTA  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year, as my husband and I pack the car for our August
vacation, we look around at the impossibly green, impossibly
beautiful Vermont landscape and ask each other if we are crazy. Why
would anyone leave Vermont in the summer, when there are so many
swimming holes to splash in, so many country fairs to visit, so
many trails to hike. Why would anyone leave during the time of year
when our down-country friends would trade in their theater tickets
to stay even in the sagging old farmhouse we live in, and a chance
to watch the sun set over the mountains and hear the crickets at
night.
</P>
<P>
   One of my closest friends comes to Vermont from the Upper West
Side of Manhattan each summer with her husband and two children,
renting a house not far from ours. She delights in going fishing
and canoeing, taking walks and shopping at the local farmers'
market. She and her family love Vermont, and every year Dirk and I
have the opportunity to see our home state anew through their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I realize once again how lucky we are to live within walking
distance of a pond that features both good swimming and excellent
boating, and a general store where the owners not only know our
names but also extend credit. In summer, the night sky offers
northern lights and shooting stars, swooping bats and
symphony-quality thunderstorms. There are farms to visit and
potters' studios and small gallery shows by wonderful artists.
There are mountains to climb and, in nearly every village, a
Vermont institution: the ``creemee'' stand, offering soft-serve ice
cream in vanilla, chocolate and maple.
</P>
<P>
   So why, come August, do we pack our two children and our dog and
way, way too much stuff into our Subaru wagon and take a grueling,
16-hour drive north? Prince Edward Island, our destination, is,
after all, not that much different from Vermont. Cows graze in
pastures that slope to the water's edge. Towns are small and
manageable, and people are reserved but friendly. ``Vermont with
ocean'' is how we describe Prince Edward to our stay-home friends.
</P>
<P>
   While others may seek cultural stimulation on their vacations,
my husband and I see our few weeks off as an opportunity to get
some much-needed exercise and simplify our lives. We live in a
place that offers plenty of opportunity for both. But whether or
not we've brought it on ourselves, we have certainly managed to
complicate our lives. We spend many more hours driving our kids to
sports and school events than contemplating nature, and much more
time absorbed in our work than working out on country roads. Our
lives are cluttered with the trappings of contemporary America _
computers and portable phones, TV and videos, stores offering way
too much stuff and credit cards offering way too much money to buy
it with.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason anyone who lives in a vacation destination
leaves it for another is simple: we live here. We're not on
vacation. While my New York friends Pam and Carl may spend their
Vermont days splashing with their kids, I spend mine e-mailing,
faxing and phoning _ not to mention laundering, shopping, cooking
and cleaning. I can't remember the last time I went fishing with my
daughters (who, at 15 and 12, would now regard me as demented if I
were to suggest it), or did much of anything else with them except
drop them at the pond or _ more to their liking _ at the nearest
mall.
</P>
<P>
   I know people who take ``at home'' vacations, visiting all the
attractions they never get a chance to see, but I don't think I
could manage it. My home is my workplace, and it's hard to get out
the door to go recreate while the phones are ringing.
</P>
<P>
   So each summer we drive north to impose our fantasies of a
slower paced life on the Prince Edward Islanders. We do almost
nothing for days on end and marvel at how laid-back the islanders
are. The friends we have made there do seem to have more time for
music and visiting, but that's probably because we are the ones who
are dropping by, urging them to pick up their fiddles.
</P>
<P>
   Surely they have just as much laundry to do, and I often hear
their children clamoring to go to ``town'' (as the capital city,
Charlottetown, is called) and shop the malls. I've noticed a
proliferation of cell phones since we first started going there
about 10 summers ago. Last August the carpenter who built the cabin
we own gave us his pager number. The rest of the year we
communicate with him by fax and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   For two or three weeks, we fancy ourselves part of something a
little purer, somewhat less materialistic and more genteel than
what we experience at home _ just as, I think, Pam feels when she
leaves the hubbub of her neighborhood. And it works. Our life on
vacation is less crazy and materialistic, and more genteel. I go
biking and berry-picking with my daughters, and the four of us
sleep outside some nights and watch northern lights and meteor
showers even more spectacular than we see at home in darkness that,
since we are miles from an electric light, seems more absolute than
in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly trip to the Laundromat seems like a pleasant outing
compared with the daily load or two I do routinely at home. Even a
trip to the carwash is a maritime adventure: The one in Souris _
the town closest to our cabin _ offers a ridiculously spectacular
ocean view. I can count fishing boats and sea gulls while vacuuming
the red island clay from the floor mats. Food shopping is a treat:
we delight in seeking out fishermen and local gardeners to sell us
some of what we will eat each evening. And cooking on the tiny
propane stove or over a campfire at our cabin is much more fun than
it is at home, where the microwave and the food processor make the
chore more mechanical. We play hearts by candlelight and read big
fat books that we have no time for back in Vermont. Most important
for me is the fact that I get to spend several weeks without
hearing a phone ring or a fax beep, or checking any sort of mail
whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   We leave our home, in fact, for the same reason people in New
York or Paris or any other world-class vacation destination leave
theirs: for a change of scenery and a change of pace.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers often indulge in the fantasy that the people in the
places they visit lead lives that are more civilized, or more down
to earth, or more ``spiritual'' than their own workaday existences.
In truth it is the travelers themselves _ separated from familiar
rooms and belongings _ who are forced to focus more on who they are
and what is important to them.
</P>
<P>
   We return, of course, to stacks of mail and desks full of the
work that piled up while we were away. But if time and distance
have worked their magic, we return also with a renewed appreciation
for where we live, and a sense of pride that people ``from away''
will travel long distances to gaze at the views we take for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, some of our friends from Prince Edward Island, who
usually stick very close to home, sent us an e-mail message that
said they were contemplating a vacation this year. They are
thinking of coming to Vermont. We can't wait to show them how
laid-back we are.

Philadelphia, says that many of them are doomed to repeat the
mistakes of their financial predecessors. A Q&AMP;A. By Saul Hansell.

IN CASE OF EMERGENCY   ...   DEFIBRILLATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ariz., Wash., Britain)  
 (For release Sunday, July 30)   By BETSY WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Heart defibrillators are likely to
be required aboard all big United States airliners within three
years. The Federal Aviation Administration, acting on the basis of
a one-year survey of 15 airlines' in-flight illnesses among
passengers and crew, concluded that the devices, which can save
lives of people who are unconscious in cardiac arrest, would be
worth the cost.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In May, the FAA said it had drafted a rule requiring airlines to
buy battery-driven defibrillators for all planes able to carry at
least 30 passengers and one flight attendant. After 120 days for
public comment, the rule _ which may be modified in that time _ is
scheduled to take effect in September. The airlines are allowed
three years to buy the devices and train crew to use them, although
they can also be operated by untrained people because an electronic
voice gives instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 major United States airlines, eight either have
defibrillators on all their planes already or expect to by the end
of the year. Only Trans World Airlines and America West have not
begun the process.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines, which was in the vanguard of domestic
airlines with defibrillators, began putting the devices, about the
size and weight of a desk dictionary, aboard its planes in 1997.
According to John Hotard, a spokesman, all of its planes were
equipped by March 1999. Alaska Airlines has completed the process,
as have Delta and United. US Airways is 97 percent complete,
according to David A. Castelveter, a spokesman, with fewer than 10
planes without defibrillators. All of the line's 50 new Airbuses
have the devices, he said. Northwest Airlines reports it is about
50 percent complete and expects to finish by the end of the year.
Southwest Airlines says the same, as does Continental, which adds
that all of its 777s are now outfitted.
</P>
<P>
   TWA has not begun the process. Christine Kelly, a spokeswoman,
said: ``TWA is evaluating various equipment options to determine
the specific characteristics offered by the various manufacturers
so that should the rule be officially issued, we would be ready to
comply.''
</P>
<P>
   America West likewise has not begun installation, although it
has selected the model it will buy. Its spokeswoman, Janice
Monahan, said it expected to have installation on its 135 planes
completed ``by the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is keeping formal track of foreign airlines with
defibrillators, although Dr. Claude Thibeault, the medical director
of Air Canada, said that an informal group of airline medical
directors had a general picture of which lines were equipped. He
said that Qantas, Virgin Atlantic, British Airways, Air Zimbabwe,
Swissair and Varig were known to have them. Air Canada is in
process, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing the forthcoming regulation in a radio speech in
May, President Clinton said that the FAA survey of in-flight
illnesses from July 1998 through June 1999, which was initiated by
the Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1998, showed automatic
external defibrillators' value. ``AEDs have proven effective in
saving lives,'' he said, ``and I believe that all airline
passengers should have access to this life-saving technology.''
</P>
<P>
   In defibrillation, the restarting of a heart that has stopped or
has begun ineffective beating, known as ventricular fibrillation,
time is of the essence. Medical studies show that chances of
survival decrease 10 percent with each minute that passes without
circulation of blood. Quick application of cardiopulmonary
resuscitation, or CPR, can force blood into the body, particularly
the brain, as a holding action, but the heart must be started
again. The defibrillator does that, and all the television dramas
showing interns running to a bedside with equipment emphasize this
need for speed. Diversion of an airplane to the nearest airport may
help in other cases, but takes way too long to help in cardiac
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen airlines carrying 85 percent of American domestic
passengers contributed data to the one-year Government study; they
submitted 188 usable ``medical event'' reports: 177 that occurred
on board planes _ in flight, at the gate or in taxiing; 10 in the
boarding ramp or the terminal, and 1 in a cab to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 177 events, 119 were thought to involve the heart; the
average age of these passengers was 62. Sixty-four of the 119 died;
10 were known to have survived, and the other outcomes were
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   While the study was going on, of course, airlines were phasing
in defibrillators. In 14 on-board events and 3 on the ground, the
devices were used, and four of the victims survived; the FAA
checked later and found these passengers still alive. For the
on-board cardiac events, the report said, an AED was reported ``not
available'' in 40 cases and ``not needed'' in 12. There were 74
aircraft diversions reported because of passenger medical
emergencies; 52 involved cardiac events.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines gathered data before and after the Government
study. Dr. David McKenas of its corporate medical department,
testifying in Congress, said that defibrillators saved 11 lives
over three years. He said the results were ``spectacular'' in
comparison with those that emergency medical services on the ground
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Despite gaps in its data, the FAA said it concluded that
``deaths occur on air carriers and certain medical interventions
... may change the outcome for some.'' Projecting
``conservatively'' against a potential total of 7.58 billion
passengers in the next 10 years, it concluded that 55 outcomes of
future medical events might be changed by defibrillators.
</P>
<P>
   The draft rule also requires additions to the standard medical
kit carried on board. It also carries a good Samaritan provision
protecting those who help from random prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA voiced some caution about its steps. ``The intent of the
regulation is to provide options for treatment,'' it said, ``not to
raise expectation in the passenger or physician community regarding
the level of medical care available in flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Comments on the draft regulation may be mailed in duplicate to
Department of Transportation Dockets, Docket FAA-2000-7719, 400
Seventh Street SW, Room Plaza 401, Washington, D.C. 20590.
Instructions for electronic filing may be found at dms.dot.gov/.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, two overseas airlines, British Airways and
Virgin Atlantic, which both have defibrillators on their fleets,
announced plans to add an additional medical device, one that can
transmit an electrocardiogram by satellite from a conscious but ill
passenger to a medical center on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Bagshaw, head of medical services for British
Airways, said that the Micromedical Biolog monitor, about the size
of a deck of cards, could be linked to the seatback telephone that
transmits to a satellite and then to a 24-hour medical team in
Arizona called Medlink. The team may recommend aspirin,
nitroglycerin or diversion of the plane, Bagshaw said. The Biolog
device is distributed by Medtronic Physio-Control in Redmond, Wash.
Virgin Atlantic is using a device called Tempus 2000, made by
Remote Diagnostic Technologies in Hampshire, England.  &QL;

 &HT;    Tech football looking at life without Joe Hamilton
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOT SPRINGS, Va. _ Life after Joe begins officially at Georgia
Tech next week. For the first time in four years, George O'Leary's
Yellow Jackets will play a game without Heisman Trophy runner-up
Joe Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Leary says the surrounding cast for the player who winds
up behind the center is the best he has had during his tenure at
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be as potent without Joe on offense, but we're going
to be pretty good,'' O'Leary said from the ACC's annual football
kickoff meetings. ``We've got more weapons than we've had. I'm very
high on this football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Five offensive starters return, including All-America candidates
Kelly Campbell at flanker and Chris Brown at tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Tech also has an inordinate number of quarterbacks on
scholarship. The Yellow Jackets will open fall practice with six.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, redshirt junior George Godsey is the starter, but
the situation could change. ``I think (Andy) Hall can make more
plays, but he makes more mistakes, too,'' O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Godsey and Hall, Jermaine Crenshaw and Brian Camp
open camp for their second year. The freshmen are Mark Logan and
Brandon Sumner.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tech has a couple of holes to fill on the offensive
line, the skill positions are deep. Campbell leads a receiving
corps with speed to burn. Behind Campbell, who broke every Tech
receiving record with 69 catches for 1,105 yards and 10 touchdowns,
are sophomore Will Glover and senior Brett Basquin. At split end,
Jon Muyres beat out Kerry Watkins for the starting spot. Watkins
caught 33 passes for 476 yards and six scores last season.
</P>
<P>
   The backfield is the ACC's deepest. Sophomore Joe Burns, junior
Sean Gregory, and sophomores Gordon Clinkscale and Sidney Ford are
fighting for playing time at running back. With freshman Jimmy
Dixon (6-2, 215), the Jackets also have a power back. Gregory had
837 yards last season, while Burns was the leading rusher in 1998
before missing most of 1999 with a broken leg. Ford rushed for 49
yards and a score against N.C. State.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Ed Wilder, 6-2, 259, is perhaps the most underrated
player on the team as a powerful runner, blocker and receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surrounding cast is so much better, it's not even close
(to) when Joe took over four years ago,'' O'Leary said. ``We've got
to find the quarterback who has the most flexibility and
maneuverability. We need to find out who can take a bad play and
make something good out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Godsey is the starter today, he might not be later.
``That job is his for one snap,'' O'Leary said. ``His job is to
keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense graduated only two starters, but that might not be
good news.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets had one of the worst defenses in the conference and
ranked 100th in the NCAA in total defense. Only Tech's ability to
outscore opponents kept it out of deep trouble. The 1999 defensive
unit gave up 333 points, an average of 30.3 per outing.
</P>
<P>
   The linebacker slots should be improved, with Matt Miller
returning from a knee injury. He is joined by Recardo Wimbush and
two super freshmen who will play immediately. Keyaron Fox (6-4,
220) out of Westlake High in Atlanta and Hobie Holiday (6-4, 235)
from Houston County are too good to sit.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive line remains undersized, but it got a boost when
O'Leary moved Nick Rogers from linebacker to defensive end.
Sophomore Greg Gathers and Felipe Claybrooks will anchor the other
end, with Gathers moving inside at times to give the line more
speed and mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Tackles Guenter Kryszon and Merrix Watson started last year and
are adequate. With a front four weighing 260, 255, 250 and 280 at
times, the Jackets are sure to get pushed around.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive backfield is led by two excellent safeties. Chris
Young will open at strong safety after an All-ACC year last season
with 89 tackles. Sophomore Jeremy Muyres will be at free safety
after starting seven games as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets have had problems at cornerback. Senior Jamara Clark
and sophomore Marvious Hester are the starters, but incoming
freshmen Jonathan Cox from Chicago and Tony Hollings out of Twiggs
County will get early looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (defensive coordinator) Ted Roof I needed to get him
better players,'' O'Leary said. ``I think we've done that.''

   The bull market has not just been on the stock exchange but in
exchanges themselves. The frenzy to find business-to-business uses
of the Internet is prompting people to create online exchanges
where companies will be able to trade everything from sheet steel
to hotel sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Eric K. Clemons, a professor in the Information Strategy,
Systems and Economics group at the Wharton School of the University
of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, says that many of them are doomed
to repeat the mistakes of their financial predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   He discussed the lessons from the financial markets in a recent
series of e-mail messages. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Electronic-trading exchanges first began opening in financial
markets 15 years ago, amid great skepticism by traditional traders
that they would work. Why did some work and others not?
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: I guess the biggest difference between success and
failure continues to be liquidity. When there are enough buyers and
sellers to determine an effective price, then online trading can
occur.
</P>
<P>
   If buyers and sellers are widely separated in time, and if there
is little information on ``comparables'' to help buyers or sellers
determine fair prices, then intermediaries will continue to serve
an essential function. Thus, I would not expect to see real-estate
agents disappear anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, exchanges didn't help instruments that no one
understands or no one wants to trade, such as contracts tied to
hurricanes in Florida, the cost of cellular air time in August in
midtown Manhattan or other forms of catastrophic risk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But online exchanges also failed in the United States in some
very liquid markets, such as futures.
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: It's hard to get market participants to leave a
structure that's liquid and working well, even if it is not working
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, online trading has captured markets abroad where there had
been no previous exchange or where the existing stock market had
been less efficient and more expensive than its U.S. equivalents.
Online trading in the U.S. continues principally to provide
lower-cost access to existing exchanges, rather than replacing
these existing exchanges, in general because they have been doing
such a good job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what sort of industrial markets will be most suited to
online exchanges?
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: The invisible hand of the marketplace does the best job
when buyers and sellers are fragmented and thousands of small
orders interact simultaneously. This is true whether I want to buy
1,000 shares of IBM at the current price on a stock exchange or if
I want to buy 1,000 standard memory chips in one of the emerging
industrial exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The guiding principle here is that the random flow of small
orders is sufficient to assure that the market finds the right
price.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what about the proposed exchanges in industries like auto
parts, where there are a handful of buyers and not all that many
sellers of each type of item?
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: If the order flow is heavily concentrated in a small
number of buyers or a small number of sellers, or if delivery must
be carefully coordinated and scheduled between buyer and seller,
then an exchange is likely to be less effective.
</P>
<P>
   If I need several million fuel injectors or pistons, an
exchange-based market will not be my best alternative. If my
pistons arrive too late, my production line will shut down.
</P>
<P>
   In business environments such as these, I will want to carefully
negotiate order quantities and delivery schedules, quality levels
and purchase prices.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A lot of people say the real value of the exchanges in the
long run won't be the lower transaction costs or even the lower
prices, but the efficiencies throughout the production stream that
would flow from the instant, universal, transparent demand
information being shared. I take it you don't completely agree.
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: That's right. For some industries full transparency
will indeed produce allocative efficiency _ by setting the right
prices, based on aggregating supply and demand, the product will
end up in the hands of the customers who value it most highly. In
industries with rapidly evolving products _ personal computers _
this might indeed be a new and optimal design.
</P>
<P>
   In these cases the key issue is not determining the right price,
but scheduling delivery of the right quantity at the right time.
Ford or GM might be more concerned with assuring that spark plugs
and fuel injectors arrive in the right-sized batches at precisely
the right times to avoid disrupting their assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the right quantity of products at the right time is
closer to traditional supply-chain optimization than it is to the
design of trading mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some people argue that one benefit of these new exchanges is
that they open up world markets, allowing a small steelmaker in
Thailand to find a buyer in Peru. Does that make sense?
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: Globalization of markets and exchanges, likewise, will
be important only if buyers and sellers have a real need for global
access. But when they do, geographical separation appears to be no
longer relevant as a barrier to trading, as long as the item's
description is clear enough to be described online without too much
ambiguity, and its value is sufficient to justify shipping costs.
</P>
<P>
   I will admit that the online trading of Beanie Babies through
eBay caught me pretty much by surprise.

 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In the early rounds of the online banking competition, the
surprising outcome is that the big commercial banks have not been
beaten to the punch by nimbler young challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the brokerage titans of Wall Street that steadfastly
refused to recognize the threat posed by Internet-based stock
trading competitors, commercial banks have been wrestling with the
Web for years. But the results of those efforts have ranged from
modest success to spectacular failure.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that, unlike online stock trading, online banking
has not, so far, been a killer app. Consumers have been just as
slow as the banks to accept the Internet as a medium for managing
everyday money matters.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 percent of American consumers bank online. Last
year, about 8.3 million people shopped the Internet for mortgages
and other loans, but only one in eight even started the
loan-application process online, said Robert Sterling, an analyst
with Jupiter Communications in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The real challenge to established banks may just be arriving, in
the form of companies that combine banking with other services
online. Control of consumers' financial information is so critical
to establishing bonds with them that it has attracted a host of
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ETrade Group, the electronic brokerage firm, is
making a big push for its ETrade Bank, which was known as Telebank
before ETrade bought it earlier this year. ETrade also bought a
network of more than 8,800 automated teller machines. The company
eventually hopes to link those ATMs with its Web sites so that
customers can withdraw cash from bank or brokerage accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional banks take some comfort in ETrade's moves because
they reinforce the belief that Internet-only banks have limited
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advent of Net-only banks seems so exciting,'' said Bruce
Zimmerman, a senior vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank. ``The
reality is, there aren't many customers who want to do everything
only over the Net. That's why you've seen that Net-only models
haven't been successful.''
</P>
<P>
   To build business quickly, most Internet banks have taken
advantage of their slim cost structures by paying higher interest
rates on checking accounts and certificates of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   But, analysts say, paying above-market rates to attract deposits
has never been a path to profits. Indeed, that tactic contributed
to the failure of many savings and loans in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The people most likely to shop for the best rates are retirees,
Sterling said, and they are unlikely to shop online.
</P>
<P>
   Among Internet banks, the most visible disappointment has been
WingspanBank.com, the electronic bank created by the Bank One Corp.
After spending about $35 million on advertising for Wingspan, Bank
One put it up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's Citibank has also struggled with its Internet
strategy. Even with its latest electronic offering, called Citi
f/i, Citibank, the nation's largest bank, trails Wells Fargo and
Bank of America in the number of online accounts.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for the slower migration online for
bank customers compared with investors, according to analysts and
industry executives. One of the most important is that electronic
discount brokerages opened up a simple, affordable route for
investors. Another is that investors were not accustomed to
visiting brokerage offices with any regularity, while many bank
customers still stop at their neighborhood branch regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Big banks are following a trail that was blazed in the brokerage
business by Charles Schwab: They are working toward making their
services available online, over the phone and in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe people will want a choice of how they access the
bank,'' Zimmerman said. ``And we believe customers will value a
seamless financial relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are not so smooth just yet. Traditional banks are ahead
of the game if they have made all account information accessible to
customers online, said Matt Cone, senior vice president of
marketing for the Corillian Corp., a provider of Internet banking
software in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of financial institutions that still have
yet to get to first base,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone said that making account information available
electronically was a step toward offering what customers really
want: a single, online source of up-to-date information about their
finances, including savings and checking accounts, credit cards,
mutual funds and other investments.
</P>
<P>
   On that score, banks are facing new challengers: upstarts that
want to give people one place on the Web where they can check on
accounts scattered among several companies, from savings at a bank
to brokerage accounts to frequent-flier mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, such as Yodlee.com and X.com, are offering to
gather account information from disparate sources and compile it
for a quick survey. The technology that these companies use is
known as ``screen scraping'' because it requires them to use
customers' account numbers and passwords to collect confidential
data posted by other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are hoping that most consumers will not trust other
companies, especially new dot-com ventures, with access to such
important personal information.
</P>
<P>
   The faith that most consumers place in traditional banks is a
powerful competitive advantage, Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem banks have had historically is that they rely on
that and so they could take their sweet time to get there.''

   To build business quickly, most Internet banks have taken
advantage of their slim cost structures by paying higher interest
rates on checking accounts and certificates of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   But, analysts say, paying above-market rates to attract deposits
has never been a path to profits. Indeed, that tactic contributed
to the failure of many savings and loans in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The people most likely to shop for the best rates are retirees,
Sterling said, and they are unlikely to shop online.
</P>
<P>
   Among Internet banks, the most visible disappointment has been
WingspanBank.com, the electronic bank created by the Bank One Corp.
After spending about $35 million on advertising for Wingspan, Bank
One put it up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's Citibank has also struggled with its Internet
strategy. Even with its latest electronic offering, called Citi
f/i, Citibank, the nation's largest bank, trails Wells Fargo and
Bank of America in the number of online accounts.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for the slower migration online for
bank customers compared with investors, according to analysts and
industry executives. One of the most important is that electronic
discount brokerages opened up a simple, affordable route for
investors. Another is that investors were not accustomed to
visiting brokerage offices with any regularity, while many bank
customers still stop at their neighborhood branch regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Big banks are following a trail that was blazed in the brokerage
business by Charles Schwab: They are working toward making their
services available online, over the phone and in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe people will want a choice of how they access the
bank,'' Zimmerman said. ``And we believe customers will value a
seamless financial relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are not so smooth just yet. Traditional banks are ahead
of the game if they have made all account information accessible to
customers online, said Matt Cone, senior vice president of
marketing for the Corillian Corp., a provider of Internet banking
software in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of financial institutions that still have
yet to get to first base,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone said that making account information available
electronically was a step toward offering what customers really
want: a single, online source of up-to-date information about their
finances, including savings and checking accounts, credit cards,
mutual funds and other investments.
</P>
<P>
   On that score, banks are facing new challengers: upstarts that
want to give people one place on the Web where they can check on
accounts scattered among several companies, from savings at a bank
to brokerage accounts to frequent-flier mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, such as Yodlee.com and X.com, are offering to
gather account information from disparate sources and compile it
for a quick survey. The technology that these companies use is
known as ``screen scraping'' because it requires them to use
customers' account numbers and passwords to collect confidential
data posted by other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are hoping that most consumers will not trust other
companies, especially new dot-com ventures, with access to such
important personal information.
</P>
<P>
   The faith that most consumers place in traditional banks is a
powerful competitive advantage, Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem banks have had historically is that they rely on
that and so they could take their sweet time to get there.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was something about Joey Pillot that made a
federal prosecutor ask if he was telling the whole truth about his
violent past. Joey seemed uncomfortable, as if he was hiding
something. There would be no deal, the prosecutor warned, if Joey
did not come clean.
</P>
<P>
   Pillot, a member of a drug-and-extortion gang, sighed, then
spilled out a startling story: Two innocent men were in prison for
a murder that he committed. Later, he conceded that his best
friend, James Rodriguez, known as Spanky, had also been involved.
</P>
<P>
   That was six years ago. The men convicted of the crime, David
Lemus and Olmado Hidalgo, are still serving sentences of 25 years
to life for the murder of a bouncer at a Manhattan nightclub, the
murder Pillot says he and his friend committed.
</P>
<P>
   It is a case that has frustrated lawyers for Lemus and Hidalgo,
who said they had been certain their clients would be released, or
granted a new trial. They acknowledge that some evidence points to
their clients, but say that there is much more evidence that Pillot
and Rodriguez were the real killers.
</P>
<P>
   For Steven M. Cohen, the former assistant U.S. attorney who
extracted the confession from Pillot, the intervening years have
been troubling. Now in private practice, he wonders whether he did
enough. ``This is the only case I left behind that keeps me up at
night, that plays on my conscience,'' Cohen said. ``There are real
questions about whether the right guys are in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to overturn a conviction in New York, even in
the face of powerful new evidence. Trial judges and state appeals
courts have always been reluctant to reverse a jury's verdict, and
in 1996, Congress sharply limited the rights of defendants to take
their appeals to federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, a state judge in Manhattan refused to allow a new
trial, saying he found Pillot's confession unbelievable, and state
appeals courts refused to intervene. Lawyers filed an appeal in
federal court two years ago, but they are not optimistic about its
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   So Lemus, now 32, and Hidalgo, now 34, pace the yard at Green
Haven Correctional Facility in Stormville, seemingly as baffled as
their lawyers. They guard against false hope now. Lemus, the only
son of a single mother from the Bronx, is still able to summon
tears if he is questioned closely about the course of his life.
Hidalgo, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic, where his wife
and two children remain, has the lifeless eyes of one who long ago
detached himself from the world.
</P>
<P>
   It is not lost on them that there is a wave of interest in death
penalty cases. They can see it on the television set mounted in the
prison yard; even the smallest irregularities are debated. But
their case, with sentences just a notch less harsh, generates
little interest, for all its contradictions and unanswered
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Why, for instance, did the police think that two men who
apparently did not know each other, who came from different worlds
and spoke different languages _ Lemus only English and Hidalgo only
Spanish _ would commit a murder together? And why, if he was
innocent, did Lemus tell a girlfriend that he had committed the
crime?
</P>
<P>
   TIPS TO POLICE POINT IN TWO DIRECTIONS
</P>
<P>
   It was Latin night at the Palladium on Thanksgiving in 1990, and
more than 1,000 people showed up to drink and dance at the
nightclub on East 14th Street. By 1 a.m., only a few bouncers
remained outside. That is when the trouble started. A man left the
club and argued with a bouncer, who punched him in the face.
</P>
<P>
   The man and his friends left, and at least two retrieved guns
from their cars and returned. One fired a semiautomatic pistol, but
it jammed. The other fired a revolver, hitting Jeffrey Craig, the
security supervisor, in the leg. Another bullet ripped through the
chest of Marcus Peterson, 23, a bouncer and an aspiring
body-builder. He died, but Craig survived.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting was widely reported, and within hours, the police
got their first tip. An anonymous caller to their Crime Stoppers
line said Spanky and Joey, from 550 East 139th Street in the Bronx,
had done it. That was the address of the C &AMP; C gang, a group of
violent extortionists. The police briefly looked into Rodriguez, a
C &AMP; C member, and one of the bouncers identified him from a
photograph as one of the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   But a few days later, another tip sent the police in a different
direction.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A woman who had been picked up for on prostitution charges told
the police that her friend knew who had committed the Palladium
shooting. So the police interviewed the friend, Delores Spencer, a
married mother of three. The man she was having an affair with, she
said, had told her that he had done it. That man was David Lemus.
</P>
<P>
   So the police compiled a photo array and showed it to four of
the bouncers. Two picked out Lemus. About two months after the
shooting, he was picked up and put in a lineup. Three bouncers,
including Craig, the survivor, identified him; three others said
they could not. Lemus was charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the police showed four bouncers a set of photographs
that included Hidalgo. Neither the detectives nor prosecutors have
ever explained why they thought he was involved. Three bouncers
picked out Hidalgo, but a fourth picked out another man.
</P>
<P>
   Lemus and Hidalgo said they rejected plea bargains for shorter
prison terms. They told their lawyers that they had never even seen
each other until they were brought to court. And each said he had
not been at the Palladium on the night of the murder _ and had
alibi witnesses to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the shooting, their trial began, but the defense
cases quickly fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Craig testified that he was now certain that Hidalgo was one of
the gunmen. He said he had no doubt that Lemus was the other. Two
years earlier, Craig had said only that Lemus could have been one
of the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Three other bouncers identified the defendants, but their
accounts differed in some key details, like who was wearing what.
And one reversed the roles that each had supposedly played. Several
said that both gunmen had slight Spanish accents. Lemus speaks like
a native New Yorker. And three bouncers said they believed there
had been a third gunman, although they disagreed about whether he
fired his gun.
</P>
<P>
   But all the bouncers agreed on what led up to the shooting. A
man who had come with a group of friends left the club, and asked
for permission to go to his car and then re-enter. The bouncer
refused, the man shoved him, and the bouncer punched him. The man's
friends came outside, the whole party left, and at least two men
returned with guns.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's testimony was devastating. She said that Lemus had
left a message on her answering machine after the shooting, saying,
``Call me, I'm in trouble.'' She did not, however, save the tape.
When she called him, he said he had shot a bouncer at the
Palladium, she testified. But the account he gave her was quite
different from that of the bouncers: He had been at the club with
another woman, and the trouble started inside the club when someone
pinched her bottom. He got into a fight and was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Then the prosecution produced a knockout punch. After Lemus was
charged with murder, he kept calling Spencer, unaware that she had
spoken to the police. She was frightened, she said, because he kept
demanding that she come to his house alone. So she arranged with
investigators to secretly tape his calls. The hour or so of
recordings contained no such demands, just banter and flirtation,
except for an exchange in which she said, ``Why should I be afraid
of you?''
</P>
<P>
   Lemus answered, ``Because you know that I know that you know,''
and made three popping sounds. She said it was a reference to the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Lemus' lawyer, Eric M. Sears, asked that he be allowed to play
another portion of Spencer's tape, in which Lemus said that he
stood to win a large legal settlement because he had been jailed
for a crime he did not commit. The judge refused.
</P>
<P>
   Lemus' alibi defense fell through, Sears said, because the
girlfriend who he said was at home with him on Thanksgiving night
had given contradictory accounts to the police and would not have
made a convincing witness. Several of Lemus' friends had stopped by
that night, Sears added, but their testimony would have forced him
to put the girlfriend on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo was in equally bad shape. Just before closing arguments
were to begin, his lawyer, Andres Aranda, said he had two alibi
witnesses, explaining that he had been unable to locate them
earlier. But Gold said it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated for a day before convicting both men of
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   TALKING A THUG LIFE AND PAYING THE PRICE
</P>
<P>
   It is no mystery to David Lemus why a jury convicted him. He had
contributed a good share of the evidence. But, in his view, it is a
great injustice that he is still in prison. He is guilty, he says,
only of being an immature jerk and a braggart.
</P>
<P>
   He was 22 when he boasted to Delores Spencer that he had been
involved in the Palladium shooting. She was eight years older, and
``liked the gangster type and thugs,'' he said, ``and I portrayed
myself as one.'' In reality, he said, he had seen a report about
the shooting on television.
</P>
<P>
   He has been in prison for nearly seven years now, and no one
visits or writes anymore, except for his mother, Nilsa Huertas.
Perhaps not surprisingly, she says he was a good son, except for
the time when he was 16 and was caught driving a stolen car.
Huertas' right wrist bears the scars of a suicide attempt shortly
after he was convicted of the murder; she says she is better now.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she was allowed to visit her son for a weekend. They
shared a trailer with a little kitchen, took long walks on the
prison grounds and watched movies on a VCR. He made the mistake, he
said, of showing her ``The Shawshank Redemption,'' in which an
innocent man is imprisoned for life. She cried for 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo seems to have found a way to cope with the long, empty
days. He rarely hears from anyone, and no one visits. Relatives in
New York send money to his family in the Dominican Republic now; he
used to send them about $300 a month. He, too, was not a saint,
having been arrested twice for illegal possession of a gun.
</P>
<P>
   They are good friends now, Hidalgo having assumed the role of
elder brother, helping Lemus to keep the good news and the bad in
perspective.

 NEW YORK: in perspective.

<P>
   A GANG MEMBER LIES TO PROTECT A FRIEND
</P>
<P>
   The C &AMP; C Gang controlled every aspect of life around Brook
Avenue and 139th Street in the Bronx in the early 1990s, enforcing
its rules with murders and kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   When a state and federal task force began rounding up C &AMP; C
members, it fell to Cohen, the federal prosecutor, and Robert
Addolorato, a veteran New York City police detective, to interview
Joey Pillot. They were trying to decide whether to offer him a plea
bargain in exchange for his testimony against other gang members.
Over several days in 1994, Pillot admitted to two murders and an
assortment of other gang-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember saying to him,'' Cohen recalled, `` `Whatever it is
that you think we will never find out, you had better tell us now,
because if you don't, and we find out, I promise you that you will
spend the rest of your life in prison.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pillot replied, ``You mean the Palladium murder,'' Cohen
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Cohen said, ``tell me about that.'' He had never heard
of the Palladium murder.
</P>
<P>
   At first Pillot said he had done it alone, but later conceded
that his best friend, Spanky Rodriguez, had been the gunman. His
own gun had jammed, Pillot said. He had lied, he said, to protect
Spanky.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he and Addolorato became convinced that Pillot was
telling the truth. He knew details, like the jamming of the gun and
its caliber, that only a participant would be likely to know. And
he had implicated his closest friend.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Cohen contacted Stephen Saracco, the assistant
district attorney who had prosecuted Lemus and Hidalgo, and Saracco
told the defense lawyers, who were granted a new hearing before
Gold in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Pillot testified that he and some friends had gone to the
Palladium on Thanksgiving in 1990, and that Spanky had had too much
to drink. Spanky left the club, and a bouncer would not let him
re-enter. The bouncer finally punched Spanky.
</P>
<P>
   The group, four men and four women, went to their cars, Pillot
said, and he and Spanky returned with their guns. Pillot said his
misfired, but Spanky's didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Pillot's wife, Millie, testified that she had been there, too,
and the judge peppered her with questions about the bands that had
performed and the songs they had sung. She said she did not
remember. And two C &AMP; C members testified that Pillot had admitted
his involvement shortly after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The judge asked both sides to submit briefs. Sears pointed out
the call to the Crime Stoppers line six years earlier that had
named Joey and Spanky. And he argued that there was ``absolutely no
motive'' for Pillot to confess to a crime that he did not commit,
or to implicate his best friend on behalf of two men he said he had
never met.
</P>
<P>
   Saracco, the prosecutor, argued that Pillot had made up the
whole story, and had gotten many details wrong. Pillot said, for
instance, that he and Spanky ran from the scene after the shooting,
while witnesses said the gunmen had walked away. Pillot's story,
Saracco wrote, could have been concocted from reports relayed to
him by a gang member who had met Lemus in prison. And Pillot,
Saracco argued, believed he had a deal with Cohen and would not be
prosecuted, and therefore had nothing to lose. (Pillot never got an
immunity deal from federal prosecutors.)
</P>
<P>
   Gold agreed. He called the testimony of Pillot and his wife
``entirely unworthy of belief.'' Pillot, the judge wrote, had
confessed to placate Cohen. Gold would neither set the defendants
free nor order a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Not much has happened in the case over the last four years,
except that prosecutors changed their argument about Pillot's
testimony, and seem to give it some credence. In a brief filed in
federal court last year, they said there was ``no dispute'' that
Rodriguez _ who was picked out of a photo lineup in 1990 but never
charged _ was involved in the shooting. Pillot, they said, could
have learned the details of the shooting from his friend.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy E. Little, a Legal Aid Society lawyer who is handling the
appeal, said prosecutors were scrambling to make the new evidence
fit. ``They came up with a new theory to plug up one gap, but in
doing so they opened up all these other gaps,'' she said. One of
the biggest is the lack of explanation for how Rodriguez knew
either Lemus or Hidalgo, or how Lemus and Hidalgo knew each other,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Sears met with Saracco to discuss an immunity offer
for Rodriguez. His testimony could reopen the case. Rodriguez's
lawyer, Richard Verchick, said his client would testify in return
for a promise that he would not be prosecuted, but no such offer
has been made.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who was convicted of extortion in 1996 for his role
in the C &AMP; C gang, is set to be released from federal prison in
Fort Dix, N.J. on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Pillot, who pleaded guilty to a gang-related murder in 1996, is
serving a sentence of 15 years to life at the Shawangunk
Correctional Facility in Wallkill.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney's office is willing to review
any new evidence in the case, said James M. Kindler, the chief
assistant district attorney. He would not comment on discussions
regarding Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   There is little the defendants and their lawyers can do but
wait.

EDITORIAL: THE CHENEY SPECULATION 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 25:
</P>
<P>
   Fate and the Bush family _ or maybe it is fate in the form of
the Bush family _ seem to have a way of intervening in the life of
Dick Cheney. In 1988, he was serving as minority whip in the House
of Representatives when President George Bush made him secretary of
defense after the Senate rejected the nomination of Sen. John Tower
of Texas. This year, Cheney was out of government and five years
into a career as a Texas oil executive when Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas made him director of his vice-presidential search committee.
It now appears that Cheney may have found himself. Therein hangs a
splendid opportunity for political divination.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's most obvious asset as a running mate is that he could
provide an instant gravitas injection for a ticket headed by Bush.
Given Cheney's role in running the gulf war, his presence would
shore up Bush in his weakest areas, foreign policy and national
security. The downside is that a Cheney selection would allow
Democrats to argue that the lightly experienced Bush is still
dependent on both his father's name and his key advisers. The
counterspin from the Bush campaign would be that the candidate is
secure enough to surround himself with weighty figures.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever they say about Cheney, the Democrats would be
relieved to see his name on the ticket rather than that of Gen.
Colin Powell. For months, supporters of Vice President Al Gore have
spoken of Bush-Powell as a nightmare ticket that would put the
election out of reach before it begins. Campaigns, of course,
rarely play out in predictable ways, but there is no doubt that
Powell could change the dynamic in a way that no one else could.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of excitement, Cheney offers solidity, unity and, based
on his record at defense, toughness. His House record is
conservative enough for the Republican right. At 59, he does not
represent as big a threat to younger Republicans looking to run for
president in four or eight years. Then there is the loyalty issue.
Bush would never have to worry about Cheney's next quote, not the
case if he picked a prickly free spirit like Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   This record would provide plenty of targets for Gore, who might
also be relieved that Cheney, a Wyoming native, would not have an
obvious impact on the electoral vote.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush does select Cheney, though, that choice might in some
way be connected to Gore's own service as vice president. President
Clinton and Gore got the public fully accustomed to seeing the vice
president cast and marketed as a senior adviser rather than a space
holder. If he chooses Cheney, Bush will be giving that model a
place of even greater prominence.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The nation's most famous urban park was closed Monday
night, and a New York Philharmonic concert postponed, after city
officials announced that they had found mosquitoes infected with
West Nile virus in Central Park and would spend the night
blanketing the 843-acre refuge with pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   The park was scheduled to reopen Tuesday morning, with the
concert rescheduled for Tuesday night. But the city was prepared to
postpone the spraying in the event of rain.
</P>
<P>
   The pesticide spraying will be extended on Wednesday night to
much of Manhattan, from 23rd Street to 110th Street, between the
East River and the Hudson, as the city escalates its response to
the mosquito-borne virus that killed seven people in the region
last year and made 55 others sick. No infections of humans have
been reported this year.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Dr. Neal
L. Cohen, the city health commissioner, sought to reassure city
residents that even if they were bitten by infected mosquitoes, the
likelihood that they would become seriously ill was remote.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed to be panicking in the park Monday. Although
hundreds of people who had arrived early for the concert were
packing up, joggers, bikers and roller-bladers continued to enjoy
the park into the early evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a huge scare,'' said Gerald Ginsberg, an East Side
physician who was taking his daily 3-mile walk through the park.
``You know what would have been more frightening to me? If they had
found deer and deer ticks with Lyme disease in Central Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and the health commissioner urged city residents and
tourists not to be apprehensive about visiting the park after the
pesticide treatment has been completed. But they added that with an
estimated 30,000 people expected for the Philharmonic's annual
summer concert, they felt it was best not to tempt fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances, the risk, is very, very small,'' Giuliani said.
``But to risk 30,000 people in the park, sitting there for two or
three hours of music, that is another thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we're disappointed, but public health is the primary
concern,'' said Eric Latzky, a spokesman for the New York
Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   City officials also canceled a weekly youth track and field
program scheduled to be held in the park Monday night, and asked
teams playing at 16 ballfields to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   The extreme steps were taken Monday after officials learned that
a sample of mosquitoes collected on July 12 in the Park, near 63rd
Street and Fifth Avenue, had tested positive for the virus. Two
mosquito samples collected this month on Staten Island also tested
positive, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They were not the first infected mosquitoes to be found in the
state. In the last week, mosquitoes in Westchester, Suffolk and
Orange Counties have also been found to be carrying the virus.
Throughout the New York region, more than 40 infected birds have
also been found, with Nassau County added to a list Monday that now
includes nine New York, New Jersey and Connecticut counties in a
circle around the city.
</P>
<P>
   The growing list of West Nile confirmations, while disconcerting
to the public, are to an extent an illustration of what city and
state officials consider a successful public health campaign. By
intensifying monitoring of birds and mosquitoes and then quickly
moving to spread pesticides in surrounding areas, officials hope to
prevent or at least limit the spread of the disease to humans this
year. People over 50 are at the highest risk of severe disease, but
young children and people with weakened immune systems are also
more susceptible, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The city this year has mosquito traps in 90 locations. None
other than two in Staten Island and one in lower Central Park has
turned up infected insects. City officials did not detect infected
mosquitoes last year in Central Park, but the surveillance then was
not nearly as intense. Still, the city chose to spray the park with
pesticides last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the virus probably was present in the area of the
park last year, because an elderly man who lived on Central Park
South was made sick by the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not send everybody out of their homes and close down
the area,'' Giuliani said, emphasizing that it should be safe to
return to the park once it has been treated with pesticide.
``People should just go about their lives normally, except for one
night, stay out of the park, let us spray it and it will be back to
normal.`
</P>
<P>
   The city has already sprayed on Staten Island. More spraying is
planned for Tuesday night in Queens and bordering sections of
Brooklyn. Spraying has also taken place or is planned in many
surrounding communities, although some, like Nassau and Bergen
Counties, are holding off. Pesticide campaigns _ using crews of
city contractors that have sprayers mounted on trucks _ had already
been planned Monday night in northeastern Queens and on Staten
Island, in response to the infected birds confirmed last week.
</P>
<P>
   The city is using synthetic pesticides, Anvil and Scourge, that
officials say are similar in composition to a natural pesticide
produced by chrysanthemum flowers, and that quickly break down when
exposed to sunlight or water or air. But the heavy reliance on
spraying is evoking increasing protest from some environmental
groups that say the mayor is overreacting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is taking an irresponsible course of action,'' said
Kimberly Flynn, a researcher for the New York Environmental Law and
Justice Project.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Cohen rejected those concerns. The spraying, Cohen
said, should kill about 90 percent of the mosquitoes present, which
means that a certain number infected with the virus may survive.
</P>
<P>
   While city residents and visitors should continue to use Central
Park without hesitation, he said, they should wear bug repellent
and consider wearing long-sleeved shirts, long pants and socks. The
recommendations are particularly important for the elderly and
young children, who are more susceptible to the virus.

   After exiting the political stage, Miller makes a re-entrance
</P>
<P>
   By Alan Judd
</P>
<P>
   c, 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Zell Miller thought his work was done when he returned
to his beloved North Georgia mountains last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had my hour and more upon the stage,'' Miller said
shortly before leaving the Capitol, where he served eight years as
governor and 16 as lieutenant governor. ``If I were 10 years
younger, I would have wanted to go to Washington, probably.''
</P>
<P>
   But a year and a half later, the 68-year-old Miller is, indeed,
headed to Washington. Capping an extraordinary week in Georgia
politics, Gov. Roy Barnes on Monday appointed Miller _ a fellow
Democrat but sometimes adversary _ to the U.S. Senate to replace
the late Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the appointment was a difficult decision for Miller,
friends say. It takes him away from his native Young Harris, Ga.,
at a time when he was enjoying not just teaching college courses
but also making a good living serving on seven corporate boards.
It's a life that Miller and his wife, Shirley, craved as he
completed a 39-year political career last year. But setting aside
his reservations to replace Coverdell, friends say, illustrated
Miller's lifelong dedication to public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're to be commended for giving up what they're going to
give up,'' said Bert Lance, the former Carter administration budget
director who has known Miller since they attended elementary school
together. ``They've got a great life, with family close by, with
none of the hassles and frustrations that go with doing the
public's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller conducted the public's business more than half his life,
beginning in 1960, when he was elected to the state Senate at 28.
It was a remarkable accomplishment for a young man raised by a
single mother after his father, dean of Young Harris College, died
when the baby was 17 days old.
</P>
<P>
   Miller remained in the state Senate two terms, then worked in
the administrations of two very different governors: Lester Maddox
and Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   He won his first run for statewide office, lieutenant governor,
in 1974. After winning a second term, he took his first shot at a
higher office _ the U.S. Senate _ but lost to incumbent Herman
Talmadge in a bitter primary. Ultimately, he served four terms _ 16
years _ in the state's second-highest office before finally getting
his chance for the top job in 1990. That year, he won the
Democratic gubernatorial primary by defeating former Atlanta Mayor
Andrew Young and Barnes, then a state senator. He easily won
election that fall over Republican Johnny Isakson.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, he championed a state lottery and its popular
payoff _ the HOPE scholarship program, which covers college tuition
for every Georgia child who graduates from high school with a B
average or better. The program would become the centerpiece of
Miller's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   But he also took on a controversial issue that would almost be
his political undoing. In 1992, Miller proposed removing the
Confederate battle emblem from Georgia's state flag. Conservatives
protested, and few of Miller's fellow Democrats supported the idea.
Miller's proposal died in 1993 without gaining passage in the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, in an election season dominated by Republicans,
Miller barely won re-election over his GOP challenger, Guy Millner.
Chastened by his close call, the governor focused on safer issues
in his second term: welfare reform and tougher criminal sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he retired, he had become one of the most popular
governors in Georgia's history, with an approval rating as high as
85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, he remained a passionate spokesman for issues
affecting North Georgia, and responded quickly when he perceived
any slight toward the mountains or their people. In 1998, he said,
only partly in jest, that one of his greatest regrets was that he
never challenged ``someone at the Atlanta newspapers to duel over
their never-ending bigotry toward rural mountain people.''
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the governor's office, Miller has taught at Young
Harris College, Emory University and the University of Georgia,
said Toni Brown, a longtime aide. He also has served on the boards
of seven corporations, she said: Georgia Power Co., Gray
Communications, Post Properties, Law Companies Group, United
Community Bank of Blairsville, ezgov.com, and Coleman USA.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the return from private to public life, Miller may face a
difficult transition in Washington, said Charles Bullock, a
political scientist at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may find it frustrating,'' Bullock said. ``Governors who
move on to the Senate often do. They are used to making
pronouncements and things will happen. ... He's going to be the
least senior member of 100 members, and he's going to be the least
senior member of the minority party. And he's never been part of
the minority party.'' But Lance predicted a distinguished Senate
career that will last as long as Miller wants: ``I'm sure he
intends to be a fully functioning senator, starting whenever he's
sworn in and ending whenever he decides it's time for him to come
back home.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THREE MAJORS IN A ROW NEXT TEST FOR WOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Thanks to Tiger Woods, a ticket to the
2000 PGA Championship will be one of golf's hottest items.
</P>
<P>
   Before Woods started making history, this year's PGA
Championship was in danger of being overshadowed by the other three
majors. The Masters is the Masters. And both the U.S. Open and the
British Open were played at two of golf's most fabled locations _
Pebble Beach, Calif., and St. Andrews, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Ky., from
Aug. 17-20 will hold the attention of anyone interested in sports.
After dominant victories at both the U.S. Open and the British
Open, Woods can join Ben Hogan as the only other player to win
three consecutive modern majors if he wins at Valhalla.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a golf genius, like Woods, to like his
chances at Valhalla. Think about it. He has won the last two major
championships by a total of 19 strokes. Instead of watching the
final round of both Opens to see if Woods would win, many people
watched just to see how many he would win by.
</P>
<P>
   His peers have been left in various states of admiration and
frustration. But the message is clear. Woods is changing golf, both
inside and outside the ropes, like no one else who has come along
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's thrown all these old myths out the window, that you can't
physically train for golf, that you can't be strong or you are
going to lose your touch,'' said Nick Faldo, a three-time British
Open champion, who finished tied for 41st behind Woods, who won
Sunday at St. Andrews by eight strokes over Ernie Els and Thomas
Bjorn. ``Through the '90s and through science, you can train for
golf. The knowledge that I have after 25 years, you'd love to be
starting again. All these 15 year-olds have to stop eating the
doughnuts. They have an incredible opportunity to go out and chase.
It's no good sitting back and thinking, `I won't go and practice
because it's raining.' If you are going to go out and beat Tiger,
you have to be out there doing as much, if not more.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woods is special not only due to athleticism and work
habits. He has passion for his profession. Woods loves golf. He
loves to practice. He loves to play tournaments. And he loves to
win.
</P>
<P>
   After Woods' triumph Sunday, someone asked Woods if he might
grow tired of winning. Woods had to smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-uh,'' said Woods.
</P>
<P>
   What great athlete gets tired of winning? They may grow tired of
training, traveling, forcing their body to do things as they grow
older. But who gets tired of winning?
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem facing Woods' competition. He is only 24
years old, and he is not going away anytime soon. He will not grow
bored with golf to pursue other interests, because golf is his main
interest. And he is playing a sport that will him to perform at the
highest level well into his 40s, particularly considering how well
he takes care of himself. Woods has won three of the last four
majors, and 13 of his last 23 starts on the PGA Tour. If he wins
the PGA Championship, imagine the anticipation that will lead into
next year's Masters, when he would be shooting for his fourth
consecutive major.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' victory somewhat overshadowed another great champion,
Karrie Webb, who won the U.S. Women Open on Sunday, proving she is
still the best player in women's golf. Webb has won three of the
last four women's majors, and in Annika Sorenstam and Juli Inkster,
Webb has two formidable rivals who will keep her from resting on
her laurels.
</P>
<P>
   However, Woods has no real rival, yet it does not seem to deter
is drive. Those who fear that Woods' domination will be bad for
golf should think again. The Boston Celtics won 11 championships in
13 years when Bill Russell played, and the National Basketball
Association kept going strong. The Yankees have had several
dominant runs during different decades, and they still call
baseball the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is great for golf, not only because he is attracting new
fans, but because he is not distracted by the money or the fame.
When Woods comes to a tournament, he comes to win. And playing an
individual sport gives Woods the freedom to set his own schedule,
to take time off when he needs it, and to arrive at every
tournament feeling as if he can perform his best.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what achievement had most surprised him since turning
professional, Woods cited his consistency. He has only missed one
cut in four years, or two cuts if you insist on counting the
weather-delayed 1998 Pebble Beach tournament, when he elected not
to return for the final round in August, six months after the
tournament began.
</P>
<P>
   Other players realize that right now, Woods rules. Remember when
the Detroit Pistons had The Jordan Rules, a serious of defensive
schemes designed to contain Michael Jordan? There are no Woods
rules in golf. People have talked about Tiger-proofing courses, but
the harder you make a golf course for Woods, the harder it is for
everyone else. And by retooling his swing over the past several
years, Woods now has the control to succeed on tight courses, the
power to succeed on long courses, the short game to recover from
bad shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really stinks is that you can't control him, said Paul
Azinger. ``In every other sport, you can control your opponent.
Except this sport. You can only focus on your own game.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Woods plans to remain focused. He is scheduled to play
in the Buick Open in Michigan two weeks from now, followed by the
PGA Championship the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Woods can savor another milestone. And at age 24,
his best may be yet to come. &QL;

GORE COMPILES SHORT LIST OF VP CANDIDATES 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as he criticized his Republican rival for
conducting a too-public search for vice president, Democrat Al Gore
Monday divulged more details about his own search, saying he had
met with a number of potential running mates and had compiled a
short list of contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had meetings with some people and I will have meetings
with some people before I reach my conclusion,'' Gore told
reporters on Air Force Two en route to Washington after a campaign
swing in Ohio and Michigan, where he received the endorsement of
the environmentalist Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   To help him make the decision, Gore said he will meet this
morning with Warren Christopher, the former secretary of state who
is helping him vet vice presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
   While the vice president would not mention any names he made it
clear that he had made progress on his search, saying he had
whittled down the list of possible contenders to a short list.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been some speculation that he would name his
running mate shortly after the end of next week's Republican
convention, Gore said he is more likely to make his choice public a
few days before the Democratic convention, which begins Aug. 14 in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Among the candidates Gore is reported to be considering are
Florida Sen. Bob Graham, former Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell of Maine, Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh and Connecticut Sen.
Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore criticized Texas Gov. George W. Bush's search for vice
president, suggesting that the intense media speculation about GOP
running mates over the past week has violated privacy of some of
the potential contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've handled my process differently than the Bush campaign has
handled theirs. I've kept it private and I hope dignified out of
respect for the individuals, the men and women who are under
consideration. And I am going to continue to approach it that
way,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to comment on Bush's apparent choice, former Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney, or any others who had been mentioned as
possible contenders.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear that the Democratic contender wanted to share
in some of the media spotlight that has been intensely focused on
Bush's selection process.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president ostensibly came back to the media area on Air
Force Two to announce that he talked to Zell Miller, the former
Georgia governor just named to fill the Senate seat left vacant by
the death of Paul Coverdell. But he fielded numerous questions
about the status of his search for a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore's staff alerted reporters to the scheduled meeting with
Christopher at the vice president's official residence. Previous
meetings between Gore and Christopher have not been made public.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Gore received the official backing of the
Sierra Club, the nation's largest environmental group, at an
outdoor event in Grand Rapids, Mich., along the Grand River that
runs through the political battleground state.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he expected to be criticized by his
political opponents and industry officials for his strong
environmental stands.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he had heard that copies of his 1992 environmental
tome, Earth in the Balance, had been selling well in Philadelphia,
where Republicans are preparing to hold their national convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the polluter and special interests are coming after
me,'' he said. ``I wear their attacks with a badge of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeated his belief that environmental protection could
co-exist with economic growth. While not mentioning Bush, Gore
suggested that his critics would undermine the environmental
protections enacted by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to beat back the special interests who want to
mine and drill and clear cut our national heritage into oblivion,''
he said. ``We're not going to let them do it. This earth is not in
a liquidation sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore left the most scathing criticism of Bush and his Texas
record to Dr. Robert Cox, the president of the Sierra Club, who
told reporters ``I have no doubt he (Bush) would be an
environmental disaster as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said that under Bush Texas has become the leading source of
industrial toxic emissions in the country. And he faulted the
governor for promoting increased logging in national forests and
opening up the arctic wildlife refuge for oil drilling.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra president said that Bush's election would mark a
return to the policies pushed by the Reagan administration, which
was despised by environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said even the candidate's father, President Bush, was better
on environmental matters than his son would be in the White House.
</P>

   The Sierra Club endorsement follows a long period of debate that
highlighted the schism among environmental leaders over Gore's
green credentials. During the primaries a few vocal Sierra board
members were reluctant to back Gore, claiming the administration
had not lived up to all of its promises.
</P>
<P>
   Gore already has been endorsed by another large environmental
group, the League of Conservation Voters. But Friends of the Earth
has been more critical of the vice president and suggested it might
back Green Party nominee Ralph Nader. &QL;

 MP3.COM HIT WITH HUGE LOSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY BENNY EVANGELISTA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The high cost of making peace with the recording industry showed
up on MP3.com Inc.'s bottom line Monday as the Internet music
portal posted a whopping $177.1 million loss for the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The loss included $150 million that the San Diego company has
set aside to settle copyright infringement lawsuits filed by the
five biggest record companies.
</P>
<P>
   The amount also includes enough money to pay legal fees and
anticipated royalties to music publishing companies and smaller
record labels that have not filed lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But Chief Executive Officer Michael Robertson said the company,
which also generated a record $20.2 million in revenue for the
quarter ended June 30, could afford the loss because it has $360
million in cash reserves and no debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's a lot of money, but it's the cost of doing business
in the music industry today,'' Robertson said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com angered the record world earlier this year when it
launched My.MP3.com, a service that enables members to listen to
their MP3-formatted music files online.
</P>
<P>
   For the service, MP3.com copied about 45,000 CDs into the MP3
format, giving music fans a vast virtual library of popular songs
they could access from any Internet-connected computer.
</P>
<P>
   However, a federal judge ruled in April that the service made
MP3.com liable for copyright violations and billions of dollars in
fines. Last month, MP3.com announced it had reached settlements
with BMG Entertainment Inc. and Warner Music Group, and is close to
similar deals with Universal Music Group, EMI and Sony Music.
</P>
<P>
   Although terms have not been officially disclosed, industry
sources say MP3.com will have to pay about $20 million to each of
the five labels.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said the company hopes to relaunch the My.MP3.com
service, which it suspended after the judge's ruling, as soon as
the remaining three suits are settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of all this turmoil and the lawsuits, we're still
executing in our numbers, which is testimony to our solid business
model,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com's net loss amounted to $2.71 per share. But the
company's $20.2 million in revenue for the second quarter compared
with just $1.9 million for the same quarter in 1999, when it posted
a loss of $6.3 million, or 22 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 million songs were downloaded or listened to online
from MP3.com during the quarter, about 26 million more than the
previous quarter. That helped boost traffic to the site to about
578,000 unique visitors in June alone.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Philip Leigh of Raymond James Financial Inc. said the
quarterly loss, while still big, at least sets MP3.com up to offer
legal songs in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a heck of an admission ticket to get access to that
content,'' Leigh said.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of its revenue comes from advertising, which
Leigh said could be stronger once the portal can resume drawing
music fans to its site with the My.MP3.com service.

would associate with determined recyclers or serious suds swillers.
But there are approximately 5,000 people across the nation who simply
like the color, the nostalgia, the thrill of discovery, or the basic
"guy-ness" of amassing and displaying large numbers of beer cans.

CONVENTIONS-MARKETING-2 -- For many, the political conventions have

marketing opportunities have turned conventions from what was an
exercise in democracy into a huge corporate fest. Philadephia's City

Harry Potter and his creator, J.K. Rowling, have won praise around
the globe for drawing videogame-crazed and television-besotted young
people back to reading, games like Diablo II, a Dungeons &AMP;
Dragons-like  computer game that sends players to battle evil knights
and monsters and  save the world from a demon, have drawn
condemnation for ensnaring players in a morbid worldview and gluing
them anti-socially to a computer screen. (The New York Times)

are still in prison serving sentences of 25 years to life for the
murder of a bouncer at a Manhattan nightclub, despite a confession by
another man that he was the killer. The case has frustrated Hidalgo
and Lemus's lawyers who said they had been certain their clients
would be released, or at least granted a new trial following the
confession. Though they acknowledge that some of the evidence points
to their clients, the lawyers say that now there is much more
evidence that others were the real killers. Hidalgo and Lemus at

Reinventing or in some cases abandoning the rituals of party

SCI-EARTHQUAKES-HOMES -- Scientists testing wood frame houses with
earthquake simulators are finding that wood isn't as earthquake
resistant as previously thought. However houses with stucco did
surprisingly well in the tests, which could either be due to the
stucco or the house's simple box shape. Further testing is needed.

 CALPINE GAINS FROM DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY KELLY YAMANOUCHI &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Heat waves and the threat of blackouts have made Californians
anxious about the cost and supply of electricity, but it's
Christmas in July for Calpine Corp., the San Jose power producer.
</P>
<P>
   Calpine, one of the state's major utility companies, said Monday
that net income for the second quarter soared 176 percent to $51.7
million (37 cents per share), compared with $18.7 million (16
cents) for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the company, which has energy generation projects in
27 states and Alberta, Canada, rose to $363.7 million, up 85
percent from $196.6 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Cartwright, chairman, president and chief executive
officer, was optimistic that strong demand combined with recent
acquisitions would benefit Calpine's earnings for at least the
remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forward prices look good, and many more plants are coming
into operation in Calpine's portfolio,'' Cartwright said during a
conference call.
</P>
<P>
   Calpine said it expects to receive $2.5 billion in funding from
the Bank of Nova Scotia and Credit Suisse First Boston. The money
will go toward financing construction of gas-fired energy plants
Oklahoma, Florida and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it plans to issue a public offering of 10
million shares of common stock and $800 million in senior notes.
The proceeds will be used to build power plants, fund recent
acquisitions and refinance debt from fund development and
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Calpine's second-quarter earnings benefited from strong energy
demand as well as 1999 acquisitions of six gas-fired energy plants,
geothermal steam fields and energy facilities at the Geysers in
Lake and Sonoma counties.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to account for the successful quarter, Jeffrey Wolinsky,
an energy analyst with S&AMP;P Ratings Services, pointed to Calpine's
low-price electricity generation combined with high market prices
elsewhere in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be times where they have exorbitant profits and
there'll be times where they experience lean periods,'' said
Wolinsky. ``They're growing exponentially, and I think they have a
good strategy to manage the growth. It remains to be seen whether
it will pan out.''
</P>
<P>
   Calpine shares fell $2.88 Monday, closing at $70.

 &HT;    Plenty of hype-free substance to all the Potter-maniaDon
O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adults who have dismissed the Harry Potter books as fairy tales
for children may want to change their minds after reading Joan
Acocella's assessment of J.K. Rowling's novels in The New Yorker
($3).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she notes, the Potter stories are fairy tales, but they
also are ``a bildungsroman, plus a murder mystery, plus a cosmic
war of good and evil.'' Acocella finds elements of the Arthurian
legend, the Superman comics, ``Star Wars,'' ``Cinderella,'' ``The
Lord of the Rings,'' ``The Chronicles of Narnia,'' Genesis, Exodus
and ``Paradise Lost,'' all with a touch of Jane Austen and Charles
Dickens. Rowling is not only a good psychotherapist, Acocella says,
she teaches excellent morals. ``Those parents who have objected to
the Potter series on the grounds that it promotes unchristian
values should give it another read.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Politics and personalities: In a special pre-convention issue,
George ($2.95) puts a photograph of a smiling Ronald Reagan on the
cover with the pertinent political question, ``Who will make us
proud again?'' Apparently no one in this batch of candidates. In
addition to retrospective pieces on the last two presidents who
made us feel good _ John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan _ the
magazine includes a viewer's guide to the conventions. If anyone
watches, that is. As the editors point out, the Democrats averaged
18 million viewers and the Republicans attracted 16.6 million in
1996. An episode of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' draws around
23 million.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Going with the grain: Time ($3.50) weighs in on the debate
over genetically engineered crops this week with a cover story on
Swiss professor Ingo Potrykus and his beta-carotene-enriched rice.
This golden rice could save a million kids a year, Potrykus says,
and so could other genetically improved crops. But there are a
number of concerns, including the fear that transgenic foods are
potential sources of allergens and could cause genetic pollution.
Plant scientist Florence Wambugu dismisses protests as ridiculous,
noting that nearly half the fruit and vegetable harvest is lost
because it rots on the way to market. ``If we had a transgenic
banana that ripened more slowly,'' she says, ``we could have 40
percent more bananas than now.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Entertainment Weekly's ($3.50) 10th-anniversary
issue features 10 years of the best pictures from the magazine.
Photos range from the glamorous (Drew Barrymore in lingerie) to the
grotesque (a closeup of a blood-splattered Christian Bale from
``American Psycho''). ... In a revealing photo spread and interview
in W ($3.95), Jennifer Lopez talks about Puff Daddy (``he and I do
understand each other,'') her infamous dress (``I couldn't believe
it was such a big deal.'') and her prominent backside (``A little
bit of jiggly is OK if that's what your boyfriend likes.'').

 PROPOSALS ATTEMPT TO SHORE UP SOCIAL SECURITY
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY ARTHUR M. LOUIS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's a classic case of woulda, coulda, shoulda.
</P>
<P>
   If all the taxes that American workers paid into the Social
Security system during its 65-year history had been invested in the
stock market, the system would be abundantly overfunded today. Its
future viability would not be a bone of contention between
presidential candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, not a penny of Social Security money has been
invested in stocks. Virtually all of it has gone into U.S. Treasury
issues, which are risk-free but yield relatively low returns.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, according to government actuaries, the overburdened
Social Security system has a date with bankruptcy, perhaps before
the middle of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Bush, figuring that later is better than never, has
proposed letting workers establish individual investment accounts
in which they could directly invest an unspecified portion of their
future Social Security taxes in stocks or stock mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   He claims this would help forestall the need for sharp cuts in
Social Security benefits or sharp increases in Social Security
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Gore initially scoffed at the proposal, saying that it
was too risky. Later, he proposed an investment plan of his own,
which would be kept outside the Social Security system but
subsidized with generous grants from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security system itself, Gore says, can be shored up
with inflows from the trillions of dollars in budget surpluses that
are expected in the years just ahead.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of evidence that a stock-market tie-in could be
just the tonic Social Security needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely the way to go,'' says John Goodman,
president of the National Center for Policy and Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the hypothetical example of a wage earner who is
approaching retirement today after 40 years in the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   If that person paid the maximum Social Security tax each year,
and if all the money had been invested in the equivalent of a
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fund, the value of the payments would
have ballooned from a total of roughly $60,000 to more than
$700,000.
</P>
<P>
   Upon retiring, our hypothetical worker could have collected the
$700,000, invested it conservatively in long-term certificates of
deposit paying interest of more than 7 percent, and enjoyed an
annual income of $50,000. And there would be that $700,000 nest egg
to draw upon in a pinch.
</P>
<P>
   (This assumes _ perhaps too hopefully _ that the money amassed
through taxation would not be taxed again upon withdrawal.)
</P>
<P>
   The figures would be twice as impressive if one added in the
payments made to Social Security by the retiree's employers.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Employers' Contributions
</P>
<P>
   Because the employers had to match the employee's tax payments
dollar for dollar, the theoretical nest egg could have grown to
$1.4 million, pushing the worker's risk-free retirement income to
$100,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, under the real-world system, if someone were to
quit work today at age 65, the annual pension from Social Security
would amount to a piddling $18,000 or so. And there would be no
nest egg to tap when the annual payments proved inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Why the humongous difference?
</P>
<P>
   Market historians who have looked back more than a century say
that the return on stocks _ including reinvestment of dividends _
has outpaced inflation by an average of more than 6 percent
annually. By contrast, Treasuries have outpaced inflation by less
than 2 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   With compounding over many years, the spread of more than 4
percentage points translates to the difference between feast and
famine for many individual workers.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Happy Times for Investors
</P>
<P>
   The past 40 years have been kind to stock investors. The average
annual return during that period has been in the neighborhood of 12
percent, dividends included.
</P>
<P>
   However, the period encompassed severe bear markets in every
decade, the worst being the one that sent the S&AMP;P 500 skidding
nearly 50 percent between January 1973 and October 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But bear markets also present spectacular buying opportunities
for the venturesome. Every $1,000 invested in the average stock at
the end of 1974 would be worth about $50,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it would not be practical nowadays to let workers channel
the full amount of their Social Security taxes into individual
stock-market accounts.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial portion of those taxes are needed to fund the
pensions that are being paid to current retirees, or have been
promised to future retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security currently boasts reserves of $750 billion, says
Gary Burtless, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution. But
the value of payments promised to workers who have a stake in the
current system totals $10 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not specified what portion of Social Security taxes
would be diverted into the personal investment accounts that would
be created under his program. The scuttlebutt is that it would be
around 2 percent of the wages that are taxable under Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in proposing the plan, Bush cited the 2 percent figure
when giving an example of how it would work.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean 10.4 percent of taxable wages _ including the
contributions from employers _ would continue to go into the
traditional Social Security structure.
</P>
<P>
   Salting away 2 percent of taxable wages in the market may not
seem like much _ it would amount to a maximum of about $1,500 this
year _ but over time it could produce tremendous growth.
</P>
<P>
   A worker who had put 2 percent of taxable wages into the S&AMP;P 500
every year starting 40 years ago would have amassed about $300,000
by now from a total investment of somewhat more than $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says the program would be voluntary _ evidently because the
workers would have to surrender part of their current, guaranteed
benefits to participate. (Bush has not explained it exactly that
way, but he has implied as much in an official policy statement.)
</P>
<P>
   Fears of Depleting Program
</P>
<P>
   The main beef against the Bush plan is that it might divert too
much money away from the current benefits program. Burtless
estimates that if the Bush plan were implemented, Social Security
could run out of funds to pay traditional pensions in 15 or 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters dispute this, claiming that the Texas
governor's plan could relieve much of the burden on Social Security
by causing people to rely more on their own resources and less on
the government. Bush claims that under his plan, the system would
remain viable for at least 75 years. Dallas Salisbury, president of
the Employee Benefit Research Institute, notes that Bush's proposal
would provide the greatest relief to people in the higher income
brackets, while Gore's is targeted at those in the lower brackets.
In short, the candidates are following party tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The present Social Security system, by levying a higher tax on
people with higher incomes, causes those people to subsidize
workers with lower incomes, Salisbury points out. That's because
the annual pension benefits are roughly the same for all income
groups.
</P>
<P>
   By creating private investment accounts, Bush would divert some
of the high-income money away from the poor, and allow the
high-income people to reap whatever benefits that money produces.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore's investment program _ which strictly
speaking cannot be called a Social Security plan because it would
be administered apart from Social Security _ heavily favors the
poor and near-poor.
</P>
<P>
   People earning less than $30,000 annually would be entitled to
government grants of $3 for every $1 they invested. The matching
grants would be scaled down to nothing for people earning more than
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   For those in the lowest income brackets, the $3-to-$1 match
would present a rare and potentially bountiful opportunity to build
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   If such a program had been available 40 years ago, and if
someone had used it to invest a mere $100 in the average stock each
year, with the government chipping in $300 more, the total value of
that person's account would have grown to roughly $500,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   Take your choice, voters.

 NOTHING CERTAIN IN MUTUALS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY HENRY NORR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: &LR;   &LR; I am a widow, age 72, and don't have much income. I have
been advised to re-invest the $57,000 in my individual retirement
account, which is in a certificate of deposit paying 7 percent and
expiring soon. I was told to put the money in a growth/income
mutual fund that would pay me about $100 permonth more on the same
money. Should I take the risk?
</P>
<P>
   A: You put your finger on the key point when you mention
``risk.'' The value of a CD will never decline. The value of a
mutual fund might go down, and might stay down for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if the fund performs well, the value of your
investment will increase.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to predict with certainty which will happen.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's a matter of how comfortable you feel with the risk. Is
the promise of an extra $100 per month worth the uncertainty and
possible instability of the fund investment? Would making this
change pass what investment professionals call the ``sleep test'' _
by which they mean: Will you lose a lot of sleep if you do it?
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, you might want to take a closer look at that fund
investment. You say that it would pay you $100 per month more than
a 7 percent CD.
</P>
<P>
   I'm wondering whether the payout you describe comes strictly
from dividends and interest, or whether capital-gains distributions
are included.
</P>
<P>
   If capital gains are included, that's fine _ as long as the fund
continues to earn capital gains. But if the fund's investments go
south, those capital gains might dry up. That would leave you in a
real pickle, sitting on shrunken capital and receiving a smaller
annual payout than you expected.
</P>
<P>
   You don't mention who recommended the mutual fund. Was it
someone who will receive a commission if you buy shares in the
fund? If so, take the recommendation with at least one grain of
salt.
</P>
<P>
   IRA Withdrawal
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have an individual retirement account containing $25,000,
and I own my own home. My daughter is a teacher, doesn't own her
own home, would like to _ but can't afford it. Can I withdraw money
from my IRA without penalty and give it to her to help her make a
first-time home purchase?
</P>
<P>
   A: Internal Revenue Service spokesman Bill Steiner says you can
do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Money to purchase a first home qualifies for the exemption from
the 10 percent early-withdrawal penalty if it comes from an IRA
held by the home buyer, the home buyer's parent or the home buyer's
grandparent, among other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   However, to avoid any penalty, each withdrawal is limited to a
maximum of $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   While that may not seem like much in the overheated Bay Area
housing market, your daughter conceivably could get penalty-free
withdrawals from more than one relative, each of which could amount
to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   If you give her $10,000, and your spouse gives her $10,000, and
a grandparent, say, gives her $10,000, she will have a good start
toward a down payment on a lower-priced home.
</P>
<P>
   Taxable or Not?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been putting money into IRAs since 1977, and my
accounts have become rather tangled. I started out with deductible
IRAs, then switched to nondeductible, and I have done some
rollovers from one institution to another. When I retire and start
to withdraw the money, how can I figure out how much of the money
is taxable and how much isn't?
</P>
<P>
   A: The institutions that hold your IRAs now should have a
running record of your transactions, including those that occurred
when the accounts were held by other firms. When you begin making
withdrawals, they should be able to pinpoint how much is taxable.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, distributions from traditional IRAs into which you
made nondeductible contributions are partly taxable and partly
nontaxable. IRS spokesman Bill Steiner says, for example, that if
you have $10,000 in a traditional IRA and you made $6,000 in
nondeductible contributions to that IRA, then $6 out of every $10
you withdraw would not be subject to tax.

 &HT;    Jury awards ex-stripper $2.4 million
 &HT;    By Jim Dyer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Vanessa Steele Inman never drank, smoked or took
drugs. And the 33-year-old former stripper also refused to allow
one of the coordinators of the 1997 Miss Nude World International
pageant to lick whipped cream off her naked breasts in a photo
shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Her unwillingness to partake in ``extra-curricular activities''
during the weeklong contest held at a strip club angered the
coordinators, who she said immediately began fabricating stories
that she stuffed the ballot box and cheated her way to be one of
the lead contestants. They eventually disqualified her.
</P>
<P>
   She sued the club, the Pink Pony, its Las Vegas owner and
pageant organizers, claiming they violated Georgia's beauty pageant
statute and state racketeering laws.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a Fulton County jury awarded Steele $2.4 million in
damages agreeing that the pageant organizers not only rigged the
contest but systematically destroyed her career by blackballing her
from nightclubs around the country owned by the Pink Pony's owner,
Jack Galardi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm elated,'' said Steele, as she prefers to be known. ``It
isn't even about the money. Now people believe what I had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele, now a model living in Pittsburgh, proved she actually
had won the pageant by salvaging judges' ballots from the Pink
Pony's Dumpster, which showed she had the highest score among the
contestants. After disqualifying Steele, the judges gave the top
honor to the spokesmodel for the Pink Pony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rigged,'' said Steele, who claimed her chances of
winning were erased after she refused to be auctioned off to a
group of drunken male golfers, do lap dances on a tour bus with wet
bars and beds, or allow Galardi to lick whipped cream off her naked
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Galardi) got very angry when I refused,'' she recalled. ``He
said: `Do you know who I am?' I didn't care who he was. I wasn't
going to let anyone touch or fondle me.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the three defendants _ Galardi, Jack Pepper, and
The Pink Pony, Deep Six Inc. _ declined to comment except to say
they would appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The verdict was contrary to the evidence,'' said Galardi's
attorney, O. Jackson Cook. During closing statements, Cook had
implored the jury to forget awarding punitive damages because the
$835,000 in compensatory damages he and his co-defendants lost in a
judgment last Friday was already excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll jeopardize the ability to collect what you've already
awarded,'' he told the jury.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury disagreed, hitting Galardi with $1 million in
punitive damages and his co-defendants with $300,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors said that their decision came easily, that Steele was
credible and that defendants gave conflicting accounts of what
transpired. Jurors said the amount of money they awarded Steele was
not excessive, considering what she lost.
</P>
<P>
   Steele, who normally earned $1,800 to $2,400 a week dancing,
said winning the pageant could have tripled those earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the dancer who won the pageant received great exposure
by being featured in magazines and on several TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   Steele, who once headed a school to help young aspiring dancers
cope with an industry she says is fraught with intimidation,
extortion and physical and sexual abuse, said she hopes the jury's
decision sends a message that will change the industry. ``It's been
a long, three-and-a-half year battle, but I'm very happy with the
outcome.''

INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS INVESTIGATING STATE FARM'S REJECTION OF
CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners said Monday
that it had begun investigating reports that State Farm, the
largest auto insurer, improperly denied claims for treatment of
injuries in accidents nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   George Nichols III, the president of the association, which
represents insurance regulators in all 50 states, said it was not
immediately clear how widespread the practice might have been, but
that investigators intended to study claims for treatment of injury
in all the states.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said the investigation would initially concentrate on
companies known as ``medical review utilization organizations''
that purportedly provide independent judgments on whether claims
for injuries should be paid or rejected. But he said the precise
scope of the investigation would be worked out by a core group of
regulators, including those from Illinois, where State Farm is
based, Maryland, Colorado and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm acknowledged that some claims might have been
improperly handled and said that it welcomed the inquiry. Under
insurance regulatory practices, State Farm, as the subject of an
inquiry, will have to pay for the work of the investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations of this type, known formally as multistate market
conduct exams, have been rare, but they have resulted in fines of
millions of dollars for some companies.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the biggest recent cases, the Prudential Insurance Co.
of America, one of the largest life insurers, was fined $35 million
in 1996 for misrepresenting the costs and terms of coverage to
millions of customers. It later paid more than a $1 billion to
settle class-action suits arising from the investigation. Just last
year, American Bankers Insurance was fined $15 million for
misleading customers and sometimes refusing to pay claims on
insurance covering such things as credit card balances, furniture
and appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Deborah Senn, the insurance commissioner in
Washington state, ordered her own investigation of State Farm and
five other insurers on similar grounds. The other companies are the
Safeco Insurance Co., Farmers Insurance Co. of Washington, Pemco
Insurance Co., Mutual of Enumclaw and the Allstate Property and
Casualty Co.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say some of the medical companies working with State
Farm and other insurers employ reviewers who lack medical training.
Other critics say these organizations are sham operations designed
to help insurance companies reject claims and keep down costs.
</P>
<P>
   A State Farm spokesman, Philip Supple, said the insurer sent
less than 5 percent of its injury claims to these companies and
paid the others ``without any review at all.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that State Farm had begun its own investigation last May
after State Farm employees began to question information that was
being provided and some customers filed suits. State Farm contracts
with about 75 of these companies, he said. In reviewing 4,900
claims, Supple said, State Farm concluded that 500 might have been
improperly reduced and then paid the claims with interest.
</P>
<P>
   Supple said State Farm ``wants to make sure the utilization
review process is fair and objective.'' He said that customers who
had concerns about their claims and wanted to take ``a second
look'' could do so by contacting their State Farm agent or claims
representative.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said he and other regulators first became aware of
questions about State Farm's claims practices through a report
broadcast on the NBC magazine show Dateline in late June.
</P>
<P>
   He said he called Edward Rust, the chief executive of State
Farm, on July 15 to tell him that an investigation was being
started.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he would fully cooperate with our activities,''
Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance commissioner said that State Farm would be
formally notified of the investigation in a letter this week.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 states have established regulatory review panels to
deal with challenges of claims payment for health insurance, but,
in most states, neither the panels nor any other regulatory body
has oversight on auto injury claims. That is likely to change,
regulators said, as a result of the State Farm investigation.

DRIVER SAYS HE WAS PAID TO STAGE VIOLENCE TO TAR TEAMSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Tenn., Va.)   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A driver for a company involved in a strike by the Teamsters for
the last nine months has come forward to say that officials of the
company, Overnite Transportation, paid him $10,000 to damage
property and falsely accuse Teamster supporters of wrongdoing so
they would be fired.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the strike, the company has repeatedly accused
union members of shooting at company trucks and smashing truck
windows and has said it is spending hundreds of thousands of
dollars a week on security.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Holly, a driver based in Tennessee who has worked for
Overnite for three and a half years, said in an affidavit presented
to federal officials that the company's managers, upon hearing of
his financial problems, wired $10,000 to his bank account in return
for his agreeing to certain misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The company denies Holly's accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted me to break windows; they wanted me to do other
things,'' Holly said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Holly insisted that he did not break windows although he said he
gave company officials the impression that he had. Holly said he
had lied to company officials and the National Labor Relations
Board about the actions of two outspoken Teamster supporters,
saying they threatened him with violence for crossing the picket
line. Overnite fired those two drivers, Kyle Brooks and Paul
Holder.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Holly said he regretted having falsely accused
the two men of threatening him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ashamed for doing what I've done,'' he said. ``Overnite
had me brainwashed. I thought the Teamsters were crooked Mafia and
gangsters. As I got to know them, I saw it's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Ira Rosenfeld, an Overnite spokesman, denied that the company,
based in Richmond, Va., paid any workers to commit violence or
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overnite has never given anybody any money to destroy company
property,'' Rosenfeld said. ``We have never asked one of our
employees to damage Overnite's property. It is a lie if anybody
says anything different.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld acknowledged that the company wired Holly $10,000, but
he said that was a loan, not a gift. In his affidavit, Holly said
the money was a payment, not a loan.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld said the company occasionally lent money to its
workers, explaining that Holly received a loan because he was in a
financial bind.
</P>
<P>
   Holly said he agreed to lie and engage in violence because he
was worried he might be fired if he refused. He said he also feared
that his father, who had worked for Overnite for 25 years, might
lose his pension.
</P>
<P>
   In his affidavit, Holly indicated that there were other favored
Overnite workers, considered company men, who received payments to
damage trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld said Holly should not be believed, noting that he
admitted lying previously to the National Labor Relations Board.
Rosenfeld also noted that the Teamsters were paying Holly's legal
bills and had found him a new job and given him child support
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Teamster officials said union members voluntarily collected
$1,200 to help with the child support.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters and Overnite, one of the nation's largest nonunion
trucking companies, have been locked in one of the nation's
bitterest labor battles. As one of his chief goals, James P. Hoffa,
the union's president, has vowed to unionize Overnite 8,200 drivers
and dockworkers.
</P>
<P>
   In the public relations war between union and company, the
Teamsters have sought to show that the company was responsible for
much of the violence that the union has been accused of. Teamsters
made available to The New York Times a copy of Holly's affidavit
and a copy of bank records showing a $10,000 deposit into his
account on Oct. 28, four days after the strike started.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters have given the NLRB information about Overnite's
payments to Holly as well as other evidence the union says
demonstrates that Overnite had anti-union workers engage in
violence to embarrass the union. The NLRB has forwarded that
information to the U.S. attorney in Memphis, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Sykes, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney in Memphis,
said her office would not comment on Holly's accusations.
</P>
<P>
   At several Overnite terminals the drivers and dockworkers voted
to unionize more than five years ago, but they still do not have a
contract.

 &HT;    Georgia's newest U.S. senator plans to be in Washington by
week's end
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Pressed out of political retirement, former Gov. Zell
Miller said Monday he will be in Washington before the end of the
week to begin his job as Georgia's newest U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 68, was appointed Monday by Gov. Roy Barnes to fill the
vacancy created by the death of Republican Sen. Paul Coverdell last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he also will seek election to serve the remaining
four years of Coverdell's term
</P>
<P>
   The popular former governor's presence on ballot in the
nonpartisan Nov. 7 election is expected to give a boost to Democrat
Al Gore's presidential campaign in Georgia, Emory University
political scientist Merle Black said.
</P>
<P>
   But for Republicans still trying to overcome the death of
Coverdell, 61, from a cerebral hemorrhage last week, Miller's
appointment only increases the pressure. They must determine _ and
quickly _ which, if any, of their eight members of Congress in
Georgia will abdicate relatively safe House seats to enter a Senate
race against Miller, who left office two years ago with an 85
percent approval rating.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles (R-Okla.) said he wasn't
surprised by Barnes' choice of a Democrat, particularly Miller. But
he predicted a ``competitive race'' in November.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish that, Republicans have to decide how to unite the
party behind a single challenger. The GOP delegation is expected to
meet today in Washington to assess their response. Four Georgia
congressmen _ Bob Barr, Saxby Chambliss, Jack Kingston and Johnny
Isakson _ are said to be considering the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a test for the Republican Party,'' Georgia GOP
chairman Chuck Clay said. ``If we get out there with two, three or
four candidates running against Zell, we're going to look foolish.
We'll almost squander our chance to win the seat.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the party's most conservative members are expected
to balk at backing a candidate such as Isakson, who represents the
party's moderate wing.
</P>
<P>
   Some GOP leaders even advise against anointing a single
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are better off letting it be a wide open field.
The more the merrier,'' said state Senate Minority Leader Eric
Johnson of Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   The state has yet to set the qualifying period in which
candidates must register for the nonpartisan election.
</P>
<P>
   Already the GOP is testing campaign strategy against Miller,
promising to make an issue of his close ties to President Clinton,
whom Miller helped win the Democratic presidential nomination in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton immediately praised Miller as ``one of the
greatest governors in Georgia history....I believe he will be a
great United States senator, and I look forward to working with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Miller said he ``strongly resisted'' the call at
first.
</P>
<P>
   But in a press conference akin to a coronation, he accepted
Barnes' appointment to fill the office temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an obligation to give but one response when my governor
asks me to sert issued late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment was not without critics. Leaders of Jesse
Jackson's Rainbow/Push Coalition in Georgia, who lobbied Barnes to
name an African-American to the Senate seat, called the selection
``a terrible decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a golden opportunity to show appreciation to people
that put him in office,'' said Rainbow/Push regional director Joe
Beasley. ``If we didn't have qualified people, that'd be one thing.
But to bring in someone that should be retiring...it's very
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Labor Commissioner Michael Thurmond, state Attorney
General Thurbert Baker and former U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young were
among the African-Americans discussed as possible appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's ability to hold the seat for Democrats should overcome
any reservations among African-Americans that Barnes did not choose
a minority, said U.S. Rep. John Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The black 5th District congressman, who said last week he would
``gladly accept'' appointment to Coverdell's vacant seat, on Monday
called Miller ``the strongest voice in the Democratic stable.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the beginning, Miller was widely speculated to be the
frontrunner for the appointment _ if he were willing to accept it.
Miller had been often touted as a potential Washington appointee in
the Clinton administration. And some party leaders wanted him to
challenge Coverdell in 1998. In each case, Miller demurred.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to his hometown of Young Harris to teach
college, Miller said: ``The fires of political ambition that had
burned so long and so strong within me had finally cooled. These
last 18 months with Shirley and our family have been the happiest
of my life.''

IN JUSTICE INQUIRY, CLINTON DENIES SEEKING FINANCIAL HELP FOR
HUBBELL 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON VAN NATTA JR. and JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a wide-ranging interview with a senior Justice
Department prosecutor in April, President Clinton denied asking
political supporters to assist Webster L. Hubbell, his close friend
who received $300,000 from friends and Clinton associates after
resigning from the Justice Department in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The 155-page transcript of Clinton's April 21 interview with
Robert J. Conrad Jr., the Justice Department's chief
political-finance prosecutor, was released Monday night by White
House lawyers. The transcript is the first time that Clinton's
testimony on a wide array of campaign finance issues has been made
public.
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong company controlled by an Indonesian businessman,
James T. Riady, paid Hubbell $100,000 on June 27, 1994. Just four
days earlier, on June 23, Riady met with Clinton at the White House
after meeting that morning with Hubbell for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the interview was devoted to questions about
Clinton's lengthy relationship with Riady, a political patrons of
Clinton in 1992 and who, the prosecutor suggested, bragged about a
``direct pipeline'' to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's line of questioning about Riady and Hubbell is
noteworthy because James Riady has been under pressure in recent
weeks to accept a plea bargain with the Justice Department's
campaign finance task force. Conrad has actively investigated
Riady's activities in connection with contributions he and
employees of the Lippo Group, the $12 billion Riady family
conglomerate, made to Clinton's campaign in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he could not recall discussing Hubbell with Riady.
``At this time, there was a lot of kind of, you know, a lot of
people who knew Webb were expressing some sympathy for him,''
Clinton said. ``And, you know, if James Riady said to me, I'm going
to try to help him, he could have said that, I wouldn't have _ and
I mean, it wouldn't surprise me if he did, but I do not remember
him saying that to me. And, you know, he might have deliberately
avoided saying anything to me, thinking it wouldn't be appropriate
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the interview, Clinton again denied talking to anybody
about Hubbell's being paid. ``I want you to understand two
things,'' he said. ``No. 1, I believe the people that helped Webb
Hubbell did it because, like me, they believed he was innocent. No.
2, I believe Webb Hubbell was persistently persecuted by the
independent counsel because he would not lie about me or Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, Clinton added, ``If he wanted to say something
bad about me, he'd have to make it up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, that would have made Starr happy,'' he said, a reference
to the former independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr. ``But he did
not know anything. The man has been punished more than he otherwise
would have because he would not lie, not because I had any role in
getting him any business contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides questions about the Riadys and the Lippo Group, Clinton
was confronted with a wide array of campaign finance issues, from
his relationship to the fund-raisers John Huang and Yah Lin Trie to
his ``livid'' reaction after he discovered the Democratic Party had
accepted millions of dollars in contributions from foreign citizens
and foreign corporations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is that I was livid about it, because, No.
1, it was, it was embarrassing,'' Clinton said. ``Number _ and I
thought it was wrong not to vet these things. I thought that it
was, it put all of us in a very bad position.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview was the third since 1997 that Clinton has given to
Justice Department prosecutors investigating campaign finance
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Siewert, a White House spokesman, said the White House
decided to release the transcript Monday night because they had
turned it over to the House Committee on Government Reform earlier
in the day. ``We're not going to give people on the Hill the
satisfaction of making an issue out of a non-issue,'' Siewert said.
``There is no issue here.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the interview, which occurred in the Treaty Room on
the second floor of the White House residence, a White House
official said Clinton was not a target of the criminal inquiry and
that he cooperated fully with investigators.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tone of Clinton's interview differed significantly from the
caustic confrontation between Vice President Al Gore and Conrad,
which occurred on April 18. Gore's interview focused on what the
vice president knew about a 1996 luncheon at a Buddhist temple that
was used to raise money for the Democrats. Gore denied that he knew
it was a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad also questioned Clinton about his dealings with many of
the figures at the center of the 1996 campaign fund-raising
investigation, including Trie, Chung, Pauline Kanchanalak and David
Chang, all of whom were charged with violations of federal campaign
finance laws. clinton was asked about letters and gifts he received
from these individuals and their foreign business associates and
whether Clinton knew they were raising money illegally from foreign
nationals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied any knowledge of illegal fund-raising by these
Asian-Americans for the Democratic Party. ``You've got to
understand,'' Clinton told Conrad. ``I know this may look
incredibly naive, but I had a lot of things going on. I believed
that all these people knew what the law was.'' Clinton added, ``I
was aghast when I found out about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He did say he thought Chung was ``kind of hustling,'' and
worried about having photographs taken with Chung's business
associates. But Clinton said he was ``not worried about them being
illegal givers or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was extensively questioned about White House coffees he
hosted for Democratic supporters. Like Gore, who was also
questioned at length about the coffees by Conrad, Clinton denied
that the events were fund-raisers or that there was a price to
attend them. Clinton defended the White House coffees, telling
Conrad that he regretted ``that they got a bad rap in the end,
because I enjoyed them and found them helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   While denying that there was any stated price to attend the
coffees, he said: ``Obviously, we weren't naive. You know, I wanted
these people to help us. I wanted them to give us money. But, to
the best of my knowledge, nobody was given a price tag to come to
coffee at the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was also asked whether Gore was truthful when he
testified that the coffees were Clinton's idea. ``I wouldn't
disagree with that,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's answers to Conrad's questions were reminiscent
of the tortured wordplay he used with investigators for the
independent counsel in the Monica S. Lewinsky investigation. When
pressed about his testimony about whether anyone at the Democratic
National Committee had told him that there was a price to attend
the coffees, Clinton responded, ``Now, I'm not sure that anybody
ever explicitly said they weren't saying what you said.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was questioned about matters large and small, including
his decision to keep a picture frame of little value given to him
by a business associate of Kanchanalak. ``My guess is it was a nice
picture frame worth $50 or something and you can look around
here,'' Clinton said. ``We never have enough picture frames.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned about glitches in the White House e-mail system,
Clinton said he knew nothing about the problems until they were
reported by the news media. He said he never sends e-mail. ``And I
don't do it because _ I mean, I leave, I've got a big paper
trail.''

NORTEL IN TALKS WITH CORNING ON OPTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and CLAUDIA DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The telecommunications equipment giant Nortel Networks is
discussing a complex transaction to sell its fiber optics
components business to Corning Inc., the leading supplier of glass
fiber, according to people familiar with the negotiations. But some
analysts and industry executives say the plan is so cumbersome, and
expensive, that the deal may never get past the talking stage.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms being discussed, Corning would acquire Nortel
Networks' fiber optics unit through a ``reverse merger'' that could
effectively make Nortel Networks the parent of Corning. The deal
would value Nortel Networks' fiber optic unit, which is expected to
have revenue of $2.5 billion, at more than $100 billion. That is
more than Corning's total stock market value and would make Nortel
Networks a majority shareholder of Corning.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company would comment. But executives close to the talks
said that both companies are seeking a corporate governance
structure that would allow Corning to operate independently of
Nortel. In fact, according to the executives, the deal would be
contingent on that assurance.
</P>
<P>
   Each company is trying in its own way to respond to the
consolidation in the fiber-optics components field. JDS Uniphase
has emerged as the leader in that field through acquisitions that
include a deal two weeks ago to acquire SDL for $41 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a further sign that the Corning talks may be only tentative,
Nortel announced Monday that it planned to invest $1.9 billion to
more than double its fiber-optics components manufacturing capacity
in Australia, Britain, Canada and the United States
</P>
<P>
   If it did complete a deal with Corning, Nortel would be
attempting to capitalize on the increasing value of fiber-optics
components, while enabling itself to concentrate on designing and
building networks using its own multimillion-dollar switching
equipment. Corning would be attempting to expand its
fiber-components line to remain competitive with JDS Uniphase.
</P>
<P>
   But the risk to Corning and to Nortel, which competes
head-to-head with the larger Lucent Technologies, would be for the
rest of the industry to perceive the two companies as so closely in
league that their rivals might be reluctant to do business with
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, customers might be loath to buy from a company
owned by the major competitor,'' warned Lawrence M. Harris, an
analyst who follows Corning for Josephthal &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Corning's shares, which had nearly doubled in the last year,
tumbled on news of the talks with Nortel, first reported Monday in
The Wall Street Journal. The stock fell 12 percent, closing at
$250, down $33.25 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel's stock barely budged, closing up 75 cents to end at $82
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   While it remains unclear whether the two companies can reach a
deal _ and people familiar with the negotiations stressed that the
talks could be abandoned at any point _ the discussions underscore
the increasing pressure on manufacturers of fiber optic products to
consolidate as the components end of the business becomes
increasingly one of largely undifferentiated commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the talks with Nortel fall through, Corning is unlikely
to give up its dream of becoming an end-to-end optical components
supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, speculation has been rife on Wall Street that Corning
might be seeking a deal with Lucent, or with one of two European
companies, Perelli and Alcatel. All three have operations that
could help fill out Corning's product portfolio. But few analysts
expect Lucent to sell its components business and Perelli has
already sold a 10 percent stake to Cisco, a data network equipment
company that increasingly competes with Lucent and Nortel. Alcatel,
meanwhile, has been talking about spinning off its fiber optics
business as a tracking stock.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, capacity is so constrained throughout the optical
network industry that customers are forced to buy amplifiers and
lasers and other components wherever they can find them. But most
producers are ramping up capacity, to the point where many analysts
assume that, three or so years down the road, supply may exceed
demand. At that point, the components makers in a position to
survive would be those with a full line of wares they can produce
and sell in large volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Corning, once known primarily for housewares, bailed out of that
business entirely three years ago, in order to focus on
high-technology businesses like photonics _ the lasers, amplifiers
and filters that blast signals down the fiber optic pipelines of
modern telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Its entree may have been glass fibers, but Corning has been on a
buying spree, spending more than $6 billion on acquisitions in the
last year alone, as the company has become the leading supplier of
optical amplifiers, cables and fibers. It recently announced a
joint venture with Samsung, called Samsung Corning Microptics, that
will work on automating the manufacture of so-called dense
wavelength division multiplexing devices, which split signals into
different wavelengths, or colors, of light and thus enable fibers
to carry far more data. And earlier this year it bought out
Siemens' 50 percent stake in Siecor, Corning's longtime
joint-venture fiber cable company, and acquired the rest of
Siemens' fiber operations.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Corning had 17,000 employees. Today it has 33,000.
Most came with the acquisitions, but it has been on a hiring spree
as well, bringing in as many new research scientists as it can
find. Analysts said that Corning has doubled its research and
development budget over the last five years. This year Corning
expects to hit $7 billion in revenues, with 70 percent coming from
communications products. But most of its products are so-called
passive products, items that manipulate and route the signal after
it has been generated. What the Nortel deal would provide is entree
into the active part of the process _ the lasers, receivers and
modulators used to actually generate the laser signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three items are the big hole keeping Corning from having
an end-to-end product portfolio, and there's no small independent
player that Corning could buy that would provide them with all
three,'' said Hasan Imam, who follows Corning for Donaldson Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways Nortel and Corning are already joined at the hip.
Nortel is Corning's largest buyer of optical amplifiers, the
devices that keep signals strong as they travel long distances. And
it is Corning's largest independent supplier of pump lasers _ a
main component of the amplifiers it sells back to Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   After Nortel, Corning's main outside supplier for pump lasers is
SDL. In fact, Corning tried to buy that company, but got trumped
when JDS Uniphase, Corning's main competitor, came in with its $41
billion offer.

BUSH IS SET TO NAME CHENEY AS PARTNER ON TICKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Wyo.)   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush has decided on former
Defense Secretary Richard Cheney as his running mate and could
announce his selection as early as Tuesday, a highly placed
Republican official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the expected Republican nominee, did not tip his hand as
he arrived at the Texas governor's mansion Monday afternoon after a
weekend of deliberations. But only formalities appeared to stand in
the way of an announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Republicans said that Bush planned to make the offer of
the second spot on the Republican ticket either late Monday or
Tuesday. Karen Hughes, Bush's director of communications said on
CNN's ``Larry King Live'' Monday night that Bush would make the
offer Tuesday morning, though she did not say whom he would call.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing Cheney, a respected party elder who had been running
Bush's vice presidential search, Bush made a risk-free and
respectable choice that was cheered by many party stalwarts. Cheney
has a wealth of government experience and a government resume more
far-ranging that Bush's own six years as governor. It includes a
Cabinet stint as defense secretary under Bush's father during the
Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   By age 34, Cheney was already White House chief of staff,
helping President Gerald Ford with the difficult transition after
the Watergate scandal that drove Richard Nixon from office. He
later became a Republican congressman from Wyoming, rising in party
ranks to the leadership post of whip.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was a staunch supporter of Ronald Reagan with a
conservative voting record, he was uncomfortable with the sharply
partisan style of Rep. Newt Gingrich, who was also rising in the
party hierarchy and sought sharp confrontations with Democrats as a
method of bringing Republicans into the majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney meets all of Bush's criteria as someone who could step in
as a commander in chief, someone compatible and loyal. Republicans
said that Bush's father had also strongly supported the selection
of Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides had hoped to keep the vice presidential selection
under wraps until Bush himself announced it. And the governor kept
his own counsel as his motorcade arrived back at his mansion Monday
afternoon. In shirt sleeves, looking relaxed, even bemused, Bush
shouted to the hordes of reporters: ``No news today! No news
today!''
</P>
<P>
   For months speculation over whom Bush would select had focused
on an array of governors and senators as well as former Sen. John
Danforth of Missouri. But many had some liability.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, for example, was a strong
supporter of abortion rights, a stand that could alienate the
party's conservative base. Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma drew
complaints from some Republicans that he was too conservative to
attract swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska was not well known. Rep. John
Kasich of Ohio appeared too boyish. And though some Republicans
were pressing for Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Bush's chief primary
rival, relations remained raw between the two camps.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it seems significant that when he named Cheney to
lead his search, Bush did not rule him out as a possible running
mate. But Cheney himself said that he did not want the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have absolutely no desire to go back to government,'' he
said in May. ``I've done that. I am set in my ways at my stage. I'm
59, and I didn't leave anything in Washington. I have no plan,
intention, desire, under any circumstances to return to
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that Cheney's thinking turned as he worked
closely with Bush and many in the party asked him to reconsider.
And on Friday, Cheney suddenly emerged publicly as the
front-running candidate for the ticket after he flew to Wyoming to
change his voter registration to avoid a constitutional problem.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th Amendment bars members of the Electoral College from
selecting ``inhabitants'' of their state as both president and vice
president. Cheney, a resident of Texas, also has a home in Jackson
Hole, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   By then, a senior Republican said, Bush had already decided
Cheney was his leading choice, but he wanted to consider his
decision once more over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, chairman and chief executive of the Halliburton Co., an
energy services and construction concern based in Dallas, told his
directors on Thursday that he might be offered the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a history of three mild heart attacks and bypass
surgery, he also took a physical examination and received a clean
bill of health. At the request of Bush and his father, the former
president, the heart specialist Denton Cooley reviewed Cheney's
medical records and said he was fit for the job.

   The police discovered the bodies of a man and a woman in waters
off Spain's southern Mediterranean coast and they were believed to
have drowned in a new surge of clandestine emigration from North
Africa. At least three dozen illegal aliens were picked up Monday,
the day after authorities apprehended 311 people, mostly Moroccans
and sub-Saharan Africans, trying to cross the Strait of Gibraltar
in a record one-day total.

   President Hugo Chavez has ordered the arrest of a man who says
he is one of 1,500 Cuban intelligence agents sent by Fidel Castro
to promote Communism in Venezuela but now wants to defect. The
detention order came in the heat of the campaign for the July 30

GEORGIA GOVERNOR APPOINTS HIS PREDECESSOR TO FILL COVERDELL'S
SENATE SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes on Monday appointed his popular
predecessor, Zell Miller, to succeed the late Paul Coverdell as
U.S. senator, a choice that instantly changed the partisan
political calculus both in Georgia and in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a 68-year-old Democrat who left office in early 1999
after two terms, will serve as senator on an interim basis and then
run in a nonpartisan special election in November to fill the
remainder of Coverdell's term, which extends until January 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's acceptance of the offer to succeed Coverdell, a
Republican who died last week, was a huge relief to Barnes, a
Democrat, and to party leaders around the country, including
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. Several officials
close to Barnes said the governor was convinced that Miller was the
only Georgia Democrat who could hold on to the seat in November,
particularly given the scarcity of time to raise money and organize
a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in his Capitol office this evening, Barnes
made it clear that Miller, who rebuffed pleas from President
Clinton to run against Coverdell in 1998, was not easily persuaded
to abandon his position as a college professor in the north Georgia
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end,'' said Barnes, who was lobbied by Democratic
aspirants virtually from the moment that Coverdell died last
Tuesday after a stroke, ``the one who didn't want it was the one
who had to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a career politician who left office with approval
ratings that hovered near 80 percent, said ``the fires of political
ambition that had burned so long and so strong within me had
finally cooled.'' But he said he ultimately accepted the job
because of his devotion to his state and the sense of obligation he
developed as a marine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept this mission,'' he said, ``with a heavy heart and a
profound sense of duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was secretary of the Senate Republican conference.
Miller's appointment narrows the Republican margin in the Senate to
54 to 46, and provides an unanticipated boost to Democratic hopes
of winning control in either this November's general election or in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this year's campaign, Democrats had been given a far
greater chance of taking control of the House than the Senate. But
Coverdell's death and Miller's appointment, coupled with close
Senate races in several states with either open seats or Republican
incumbents, have given the Democrats renewed hope.
</P>
<P>
   While the Republicans remain favored to retain control of the
Senate, Miller's appointment means the Democrats could take over by
picking up a net of five seats in the event of a Republican
presidential victory, or by picking up four seats if Gore wins the
presidency in November. That is because a four-seat gain would
result in a partisan deadlock in the Senate that could be broken by
Gore's Democratic vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's appointment also could help Gore in his quest to win
Georgia in the presidential election. The state, which has become a
partisan battleground in recent years, is considered to be leaning
toward Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican
nominee, but not by enough to keep Gore from contesting it
aggressively. Gore will presumably benefit from get-out-the-vote
efforts by Miller and Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush will have to spend more time in Georgia if he
expects to carry the state,'' said Merle Black, a political
scientist at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   Black said that Miller was ``the strongest possible candidate
that Gov. Barnes could have chosen'' and that he would easily unite
Georgia's various Democratic factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' he said, ``it's really hard to see how anybody
could beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster based in Atlanta,
agreed that Miller was the strongest Democratic choice, but
minimized his potential influence on the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zell Miller is popular in part because independent and
Republican-leaning voters have supported him in the past,'' Ayres
said, ``but those same voters are more likely to prefer George Bush
than Al Gore. And I don't know that Zell Miller on the ticket
generates any substantial increase in turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection leaves Georgia's Republicans in a quandary. Before
Monday's announcement, several of Georgia's eight Republican
congressmen had been considering entering the race to succeed
Coverdell. But Miller's apparent strength is likely to chill the
ambitions of many, particularly since the congressmen would have to
resign their relatively safe seats to run for the Senate. Aides to
several of the Republican House members said they planned to meet
on Tuesday afternoon to discuss their options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming off of eight years of service, he's obviously a
formidable candidate,'' said Rep. Johnny Isakson, one of several
Georgia Republicans considering the race.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Clay, the state Republican chairman, said it was vital for
his party to unite quickly around a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   There is no limit to the number of candidates who can compete in
the nonpartisan special election, meaning the Republicans might
split the conservative vote if more than one runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we cannot do is shred our vote between two or three
candidates and let a Democrat walk into Paul Coverdell's office,''
Clay said. ``What a travesty that would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay criticized Barnes for not appointing a caretaker senator
who would be faithful to Coverdell's philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gone back to what they know best, which is power
politics,'' he said of the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who lost a gubernatorial primary to Miller in 1990,
countered that Miller was clearly the most qualified candidate of
either party.
</P>
<P>
   Miller wasted little time in appealing Monday to independent and
Republican voters, pledging to adopt the ``spirit of dignity,
integrity and bipartisan cooperation that were the hallmarks of
Paul Coverdell's career.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who has run for statewide office seven times, is best
known for bringing the lottery to Georgia and devoting the proceeds
to college scholarships and universal pre-kindergarten programs.
His education strategies have been emulated by several other
governors and by Clinton.

MERCK AND PFIZER REPORT STRONG EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The drugmakers Merck &AMP; Co. and Pfizer Inc. posted strong gains
in second-quarter earnings Monday, and shares of Merck rose more
than 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Net income at Merck increased 16 percent, to $1.72 billion, or
73 cents a share, compared with $1.48 billion, or 61 cents a share,
in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 18 percent, to $9.5
billion from $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected the company to earn 69 cents a share,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, which overtook Merck in size this year after merging
with Warner-Lambert, said profit from operations rose 21 percent,
to $1.44 billion, or 23 cents a share, compared with $1.19 billion,
or 19 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 14
percent to $7 billion from $6.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Those results were in line with Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   With special items, including costs from Pfizer's merger with
Warner-Lambert, which was completed in June, and costs associated
with two drugs, Rezulin and Trovan, which have either been taken
off the market or had sales restricted because of safety problems,
net income was $1.15 billion, or 18 cents a share, compared with
$1.16 billion, or 18 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   At Merck, executives attributed much of the growth to five
drugs: Vioxx, Zocor, Cozaar, Fosamax and Singulair.
</P>
<P>
   Vioxx, a pain reliever, has been gaining on a competing drug,
Celebrex, which is sold by Pfizer and Pharmacia, another drug
company, in a marketing partnership. Sales of Merck's top-selling
drug, Zocor, a cholesterol-lowering drug, rose 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The news cheered drug stock analysts, who have been concerned
about the patents soon to expire on several of Merck's major drugs.
The company also said its profit for the 2000 fiscal year could
exceed Wall Street estimates. Investors were pleased, lifting
shares of Merck $5.875, to $69.625.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer officials said that sales of Lipitor, a
cholesterol-lowering drug, were up 40 percent in the second
quarter. Analysts say that Lipitor is on its way to becoming the
top-selling drug in the world. Pfizer began its hostile takeover of
Warner-Lambert last year largely to gain the rights to Lipitor.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Viagra, Pfizer's heavily marketed drug for impotence,
were flat in the second quarter. Sales of Zithromax, a top-selling
antibiotic, fell, which Pfizer executives attributed to a shorter
flu season.
</P>
<P>
   Before Pfizer announced its results, its shares closed at
$47.5625, up $1.6875.

   THE REFORM PARTY
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN IS CHALLENGED ON BALLOTS: John Hagelin said Monday that
Pat Buchanan, his rival for the Reform Party's presidential
nomination, should be disqualified from running because he appeared
to have committed ``massive election fraud'' in seeking voter
support. Hagelin said his rival's campaign ignored party rules in
acquiring primary ballots for nonparty members. The list of names
that Buchanan came up with was far too large, he said _ 262,314
Republicans in 10 states. Hagelin said he came up with 9,169 names
for those states. Party rules permit candidates to request ballots
for supporters but require that nonparty members initiate the
requests. Hagelin accused Buchanan of stretching that provision.
Buchanan's campaign countered that it had worked with the party's
nominating committee to ensure compliance with the rules.
</P>
<P>
   THE POLLS
</P>
<P>
   SURVEYS OFFER MIXED RESULTS: Gov. George W. Bush continues to
lead Vice President Al Gore in a pair of new Research 2000
presidential preference polls from Washington state and Idaho and
in a Opinion Dynamics poll from Ohio. But Gore remains ahead in a
new Research 2000 polls from California. In Washington, the new
poll, covering 605 voters between July 7 and July 10 with a margin
of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, gives Bush
43 percent to 39 percent for Gore, with Ralph Nader at 7 percent
and Pat Buchanan at 2 percent. The Idaho poll, of 601 voters from
July 5 to July 8 with a margin of sampling error of 4 percentage
points, has Bush still ahead of Gore 57 percent to 21 percent, with
Buchanan at 4 percent and Nader at 2 percent. In the Ohio poll,
covering 501 registered voters on July 19 and July 20 with a margin
of sampling error of 4 percentage points, Bush leads Gore 43
percent to 34 percent, with Nader at 6 percent and Buchanan at 5
percent. The poll in California surveyed 827 voters from July 17 to
July 19, with a margin of sampling error of 3.5 percent, and has
Gore ahead of Bush 44 percent to 37 percent; Nader draws 8 percent
and Buchanan 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORT FOR GUN CONTROL: Handgun Control Inc., a nonprofit group
that advocates gun control, released a poll Monday showing that
voters strongly favor toughening the nation's gun laws and would be
more likely to vote for candidates who support such laws. The poll,
conducted by Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, found that roughly
six of 10 voters strongly favor licensing handgun owners, selling
guns with safety locks and requiring buyers at gun shows to undergo
background checks.

EXCERPTS FROM CLINTON'S INTERVIEW WITH JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
INVESTIGATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CLINTON-FUND-RAISING) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from an interview President
Clinton gave to Justice Department investigators in a campaign
finance inquiry in April. The president was asked about
conversations with an Indonesian businessman and campaign
contributor, James T. Riady, who gave $100,000 to a close friend of
Clinton, Webster L. Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you recall the car ride that you had with Mr. Riady on
Aug. 14 of 1992?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not specifically. I do remember though that I saw him
sometime in 1992 and that he wanted to help. But I don't remember
anything about the car ride. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Whether it's in the car ride or sometime else in '92, do you
have a specific recollection about James Riady pledging $1 million
to your campaign?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't. I don't. And I don't know whether he ever gave that
much money. My recollection is I hadn't seen him in a while. We had
a nice little reunion, and he said he was going to help us. I don't
remember what the specific dollar was.
</P>
<P>
   Q. As candidate Clinton in August of 1992, an offer of $1
million would have been something that was of some interest to you
_
</P>
<P>
   A. Yeah, if he said that, I'm surprised I don't remember it. I
mean, but I, I _ you asked me what I remember. I can't remember any
specific thing. I know that I saw him sometime in '92 after I
became the nominee and I know he said he was going to help us. If
he said he was going to give us $1 million, which he might have
done, I just don't remember it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes people give that much money. I know in an election or
two ago that one of the Republicans got that much money from one
source. So, it happens from time to time and it's not unlawful. But
I, I just don't remember.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Mr. James Riady is someone whom you have described up until
this point as being not necessarily significant in any of your
prior campaigns. So, that same person offering you, pledging to you
to raise $1 million might have been startling to you in August of
1992.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I _ yeah, it would. That's why I'm surprised, if he
said a million, I'm surprised I don't remember it. But all I can
tell you is what I remember. But it wouldn't have surprised me that
they could have given that much money. I knew they had that kind
of, that, you know, they were wealthy. I knew they had big business
interests in America and, of course, you know under the Campaign
Finance Law an American subsidiary, people associated with that
foreign operation, or a citizen of another country that has legal
immigrant status here can contribute. So, he would certainly have
the capacity to do it. That wouldn't surprise me. But I _ if he did
say it, it surprises me that I don't remember because it's the sort
of thing you'd remember.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Mr. Riady has described that limousine ride to another person
and narrates that, in fact, he made that pledge to you and that you
were taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   A. I certainly wouldn't dispute his memory of it. All I can tell
you is that I don' t remember it. But I know that he wanted to help
the campaign and that he wanted to be generous and he _ and like I
said, any amount of money he wanted to give, I wouldn't _ his
capacity to give it wouldn't surprise me. And I know he did give us
quite a bit of money. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. On June 27, a Riady-controlled entity paid Webster Hubbell
$100,000. The previous weekend, June 23, WAVE records reflect that
Mr. Riady met with you in the White House. Do you have any
recollection of a conversation with Mr. Riady concerning Webster
Hubbell in the days before a Riady-controlled entity paid him
$100,000?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, sir, I don't. You know, let me just say this. It's
possible that he could have said to me, ``I'm going to help Webb
Hubbell, you know, I know Webb Hubbell and I want to try to help
him, because everybody knew that I knew him well, that he had been
here working.''
</P>
<P>
   And so if, in fact, I did meet with him then, if that, in fact,
did happen, and if _ but I don't remember it, but might have met
with him.
</P>
<P>
   If, in fact, I met with him it wouldn't surprise me if he'd said
that, something like that in passing. But I do not remember him
doing that.

   Tiger marching over past, present, future
</P>
<P>
   By EDDIE SEFKO
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ After all these years of griping about
not getting the really, really big bucks because they were born too
early, members of golf's older generation now realize they can
relax in the comfort of their advanced age.
</P>
<P>
   Though they won pennies on the dollar by comparison, paving the
way for the current zillionaires was a small price to pay for being
able to avoid the Tiger Woods era.
</P>
<P>
   Would any of them _ Tom Watson, Fred Couples, Greg Norman, Nick
Faldo, even the great Jack Nicklaus _ really want a second chance
with Tiger Woods running around winning everything? It's like
deciding what you'd do if you were up to the big question on Who
Wants To Be A Millionaire and got asked something you had no clue
about.
</P>
<P>
   You'd take the money you already had in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my majors on the wall,'' said Faldo, who has won six
of them. ``But if I were setting out now, I'd be looking for
absolute perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than risk it, the ones who have been there and done that
a few times are content to sit back now and watch Woods make his
relentless march past all of their numbers and all of their
records.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mark O'Meara, the neighbor and good friend of Woods, has to
be happy he got his two majors in '98, when Woods was rebuilding
his swing. That was the window of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   At least O'Meara got to have some laughs before Woods'
onslaught. After winning the British Open on Sunday by a mere eight
strokes _ down seven from his runaway in the U.S. Open last month _
Woods truly is worthy of all the accolades anybody wants to throw
at him. He's won three of the past four majors, and given that he
gears his schedule around the four biggest tournaments of the year,
who's to say that's not an average he won't keep up?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has ever won all four of them in the same year, but
that must be Tiger's ambition now,'' Faldo said. ``He has the game
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows that better than O'Meara. Peer pressure can be a
positive thing sometimes, and in the case of two pals from Orlando,
Fla., it has worked wonders as they now have matching Claret Jugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, Tiger is an exceptionally talented young man and a
tremendous player,'' O'Meara said. ``I spent a lot of quality time
with him last week, and it doesn't surprise me to see what he did.
I know that he is capable of doing it. And I know how badly he
wanted that championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows when I won (the British) in '98, and I brought the
Claret Jug back on the plane with Tiger, he looked at it. He held
it and knew that he wanted it someday. I think he was happy for me
that I'd won as a friend, yet I think he realized in his mind that
he wanted to see his name printed on that trophy very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   But it's impossible for any of his challengers to hold a grudge
against Woods. Yes, he has all the money anybody could ever dream
of, a supportive mother and father, a lovely girlfriend, and a
support team that takes as much pressure as possible off him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet everybody in golf knows he is good for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is just so good,'' O'Meara says. ``I play with him, I
practice with him, and I know him probably as well as anybody
besides his mom and dad and maybe his girlfriend. But he is one of
those sports figures that doesn't come along very often.''
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, who had been No. 2 in the world for so long before
Ernie Els passed him on Sunday with a runner-up finish to Woods,
said everybody who plays golf for money knows they owe a debt of
gratitude to Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made it cool to be a golfer,'' said Duval.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara is sure that has happened. He also knows that the way
Woods is performing, it should come as no surprise to anybody if he
cranks out major after major after major.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly this year, after the way he played at the U.S. Open
and then coming here to the Open Championship at St. Andrews, he
knew it would be special,'' O'Meara said. ``He knew he would be the
heavy favorite. And sometimes that amount of pressure is just
tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he played with a lot of poise. He handles himself
exceptionally well on a golf course, and I'm proud of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the younger players _ the Duvals, Mickelsons, Elses and
Garcias _ who must wonder what to do. When Woods didn't oversleep
and didn't eat that alleged foodstuff called haggis, it was pretty
much a formality that he would win the British Open on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was everybody else who was left sick to his stomach.
</P>

JUDGE RULES AGAINST CITY ON WELFARE-TO-WORK LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge has rejected the Giuliani
administration's efforts to move ahead with its sweeping
welfare-to-work project, ruling that the city cannot turn any more
of its welfare centers into job centers, which discourage the poor
from seeking public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling, made public Monday, the judge found no reliable
evidence that the city had stopped illegally denying emergency food
stamps, Medicaid and cash aid to eligible applicants _ like
pregnant women with young children and disabled, homeless adults _
and refused to lift the temporary ban he imposed last year on the
conversion of welfare offices.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, William H. Pauley III of Federal District Court in
Manhattan, ruled that the audits the city gave the court to show
improvement in its practices were ``hastily conceived'' and
``fundamentally flawed'' and that ``the deck was stacked in favor
of job centers.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he rejected the city's argument ``that errors and
deficiencies at job centers were isolated problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the contrary, the evidence pointed to systemwide failures
resulting from HRA's hurried conversions,'' he added, referring to
the Human Resources Administration. The court, he said, ``declines
the city's invitation to take a leap of faith'' that its plan of
correction is now working.
</P>
<P>
   In a victory for the lawyers for the poor who brought the case,
Reynolds vs. Giuliani, the judge granted class-action status to the
plaintiffs. That allows them to sue the city and the state for
violations of their civil rights under federal law on behalf of all
poor New Yorkers who have sought aid at job centers or may in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The city had taken the unusual step of hiring a top Washington
law firm, Covington &AMP; Burling, to help lawyers for the city present
its case that it should be allowed to turn 12 remaining welfare
centers into job centers like the 16 converted since the program
began in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The city has made job centers the heart of an effort to
discourage people from seeking cash assistance, as allowed under
the federal welfare overhaul of 1996. Job centers require that
applicants look for work or prepare for jobs and pass rigorous
eligibility tests before their applications are accepted.
</P>
<P>
   But in his decision last year, the judge found that in the
process the city was routinely delaying or denying applications for
food stamps and Medicaid in violation of federal law, and denying
cash aid to many who were eligible under state law. At welfare
offices, all applications for benefits are processed with fewer
hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani belittled the judge's new ruling against the
conversions, calling it ``irrational'' and ``rambling.'' He
maintained that it would have little or no effect, because the job
centers operating now have already worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city has been transformed,'' he said during a news
conference at the Seaport Job Center, pointing to a chart that
showed welfare caseloads had shrunk to 572,872 as of June from
1,160,593 in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``This job center is part of that transformation,'' he said.
``Now, when you come in here and you want welfare, the first thing
we try to do is try to find you a job, because we really care about
you, we really love you and we really understand the human
personality a lot better than the people who brought us
dependency.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than two years after the welfare commissioner, Jason
Turner, began the ambitious welfare overhaul, the judge's detailed
and highly critical assessment of the Human Resources
Administration's auditing methods renews questions about the city's
welfare statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the city's claiming success, I don't know what data they're
relying upon,'' Hwan Hui Helen Lee, a Legal Aid Society lawyer,
said Monday. ``The decision shows the city is not really taking a
serious look at who is being denied the opportunity to file an
application for these benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are hungry people who are coming to job centers as a
last resort, as a safety net, because they have not been able to
take advantage of this economic revival that's happening in New
York City.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem cited by Pauley was that a city computer system city
automatically purged the record of welfare applications withdrawn
the same day they were filed, and wiped out any evidence of
multiple applications made by people who had been wrongly rejected
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Pauley also cited affidavits filed by the plaintiffs' lawyers,
who interviewed applicants at job centers in October, November and
December and outlined probable violations in 61 out of 225 cases.
</P>
<P>
   Those cases included a 24-year-old woman in her ninth month of
pregnancy who was told she was ineligible for food stamps because
she was not a citizen, and a 17-year-old woman who had no milk or
pampers for her 10-month-old baby and was turned away after waiting
all day to apply for emergency aid because ``the worker told her
she was in the wrong center for her zip code.''
</P>
<P>
   According to federal regulations, both women should have
received assistance. Instead, the women withdrew their
applications.

SEATTLE POLICE CHIEF NOMINEE OUTLINES PRIORITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIMBERLY A.C. WILSON  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gil Kerlikowske outlined two of his top priorities Monday as
Seattle's soon-to-be highest-ranking police official: bolstering
morale and championing community policing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give the guidance, directions and parameters to
be not one of the best departments in the country, but the best,''
Kerlikowske said at a City Hall news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Paul Schell, who introduced his nominee as ``the right
person for Seattle,'' said the choice was almost a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``His strengths match perfectly with what Seattle and the
department need in their next police chief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor lauded Kerlikowske, 50, for having the communications
skills needed to build a bridge between the department and the
community, and the breadth of national experience to usher city
policing into a new century.
</P>
<P>
   Hinting at one of the reasons why he had an edge over two other
finalists _ Madison, Wisc., Police Chief Richard Williams and
William McManus, an assistant police chief in Washington, D.C. _
Schell noted that Kerlikowske had experience running a ``big city''
police force.
</P>
<P>
   After commanding the Buffalo, N.Y., police force for four years,
Kerlikowske left in 1998 to work as a deputy director of the U.S.
Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   That experience appears to have earned Kerlikowske the respect
of the nine-member City Council, which is expected to unanimously
endorse the mayor's selection over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be 9-0,'' predicted Jim Compton, chairman of the
nine-member council's public safety committee. ``There's nobody
I've talked to who isn't really excited about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Councilman Peter Steinbrueck admitted Monday he would
have preferred to see Schell hire Williams, who is African
American, in part to ease police distrust in the minority
community.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Steinbrueck said the council should give Kerlikowske a
thorough going over before confirming him.
</P>
<P>
   Compton, however, said extensive backgrounding of the candidates
means no surprises will likely emerge about Kerlikowske before the
full council votes on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   After all, his endorsements go all the way to the Clinton
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno commended Schell on his selection of
Kerlikowske, whom she termed a ``champion of community policing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gil Kerlikowske has been a dedicated leader,'' Reno said in a
prepared statement. ``I am sorry to lose Gil from the department,
but delighted he has seized on the opportunity to serve the people
of Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday Kerlikowske unveiled some of the tasks he looks forward
to as Seattle police chief, beginning with revamping the way the
department uses community policing and improving morale.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked at the news conference by his wife, Anna Laszlo, and the
mayor, Kerlikowske said he hopes to get a jump start on both issues
when he participates in Block Watch ``Community Night Out'' events
around the city on Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to be out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   First, he wants to integrate community policing throughout the
Seattle force, turning a patrol-level policy into one that
encompasses the department's many investigative squads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than a special unit. It's more than officers on
bicycles,'' Kerlikowske said. Eventually he'd like to introduce
aspects of community policing to detectives in robbery and traffic
detectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mission isn't to keep the status quo at all _ we're going
to need to move forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He took his first steps toward improving morale by publicly
proclaiming that the department he'll take over isn't one that
needs fixing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exemplary in many ways. ... They need to hear that from
the chief,'' he said of officers. ``I picked Seattle because of its
reputation for integrity and for not having systemic corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees better morale taking root in an accessible chief who is
clear about accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly going to be a vocal supporter when they're right
and take responsibility when they make mistakes, or I make
mistakes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his two priorities, Kerlikowske will face his first big
decision in September, when he helps implement the new Office of
Professional Accountability.
</P>
<P>
   After scrapping an eight-month search for a civilian director,
the city has renewed its search for an outsider to oversee internal
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Kerlikowske said he plans to address reports that blacks in the
city get a disproportionately high number of traffic tickets, and
abolish unfair treatment of any of the city's citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Training, too, will receive attention that has been lacking, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When confirmed, Kerlikowske will earn $140,000 a year, nearly
$20,000 more than retired Chief Norm Stamper earned and the pay
ceiling the job was advertised at, according to city spokesman Dick
Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly attributed the discrepancy to Kerlikowske's ``longer
resume'' and keen negotiating skills.
</P>
<P>
   Kerlikowske's top priorities reflect Schell's concerns, as does
the full schedule he's imposed on himself over the next few weeks
__ meeting officers at roll call, connecting with communities,
learning what the department needs.
</P>
<P>
   That work comes naturally, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a human-service, public safety job. The uniforms and the
patches are different, but it's really the same job where ever you
go.''

GRACE BUYS BACK MONTANA MINE; BANS EPA FROM SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The abandoned mine that caused the deaths and
illnesses of hundreds of miners and their families in Libby, Mont.,
has been bought again by its former longtime owner, W.R. Grace &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the purchase last week, Grace banned
Environmental Protection Agency investigators from the
asbestos-contaminated site.
</P>
<P>
   As EPA lawyers examine their options for regaining access to the
site, the agency's health experts are warning everyone who lived in
Libby while the mine was open that they may have been exposed to
harmful amounts of asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   In newspaper ads and radio broadcasts, the EPA cited tests for
asbestos in the air taken by Grace in 1975 and for the EPA in 1980.
Both tests showed high levels of asbestos in the center of the
northwestern Montana town, six miles from the mine. The tests were
done during rainy weather, which may have reduced the amount of
asbestos fibers in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe these were not isolated instances and that during
dry weather, during weather inversions over Libby and during
periods of high production at the mine or processing areas,
asbestos fiber counts could have been much higher,'' the EPA
notifications said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore it is clear,'' the public announcements continued,
``that a person was likely exposed to asbestos fibers simply by
living in Libby.''
</P>
<P>
   The notice urged anyone living in Libby for more than six months
prior to January 31, 1990, to get tested for asbestos-related
disease by their physicians or at a free screening clinic operated
by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running the notifications because we believe that
asbestos exposure from the mine might have reached far more people
than originally believed,'' said Paul Peronard, who has been
coordinating EPA's emergency response team at Libby since the week
after the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported the health problems
last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people view this as a problem for the miners at the
old vermiculite operation,'' Peronard said. ``Too many people
believe the only ones getting sick and dying are the people who
worked there. That clearly is not the case. We need to get everyone
who lived in the area when the mine operated in for testing.''
</P>
<P>
   The P-I reported last year that dozens of miners' family members
were killed or sickened by asbestosis, lung cancer and
mesothelioma. Many more have since been added to the casualty list
by EPA and other government researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln County Health Department in Libby reported last week
that medical screening, started only recently, has already
identified 48 non-occupational cases, the majority of them family
members of miners. Of greater concern to Peronard's team and the
other health investigators is that 18 of those cases were people
who had no family connection to the mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``These 18 look like their exposure may have come from just
living in Libby, and that's why we want everyone examined,''
Peronard said. ``There is a lot about that old vermiculite mine
that we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly six decades, the mine was the nation's largest
producer of vermiculite. The processed ore, called Zonolite, was
used in insulation, lawn and garden products and fireproofing.
Millions of tons of the the ore was shipped across the country for
processing at hundreds of plants. At several of the plants, the P-I
found that the work force had been decimated by asbestos-related
disease. The EPA is investigating all of the plants to see if an
asbestos hazard remains.
</P>
<P>
   Grace closed the Libby mine in 1990, and three years later sold
the property to Kootenai Development Corp., which planned to
develop the land into a hunting reserve and someday, the owners
said, a housing development.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's action banning EPA from ``old Zonolite Mountain'' and
the other areas it repurchased is frustrating the agency's efforts
to complete the cleanup of asbestos, Peronard says.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Grace was surprising to some in light of the fact
that the company has repeatedly said it ``takes its responsibility
to the people of Libby seriously'' and ``will do everything
possible to expedite the cleanup.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, just days after Grace took ownership of the
Kootenai Development Corp. property, EPA received a letter from
Grace's lawyer David Cleary. The letter said the EPA ``and its
representatives, contractors, agents or guests are hereby forbidden
from entering any KDC property.''
</P>
<P>
   William Corcoran, Grace's vice president for public and
regulatory affairs, said Grace ordered the federal agents from the
mine because the company received a letter from EPA that it didn't
like or understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sent us a letter the day before (we issued the ban)
saying we had 24 hours to sign some sort of an agreement to give
them access to the site and we didn't know what that meant,''
Corcoran said. ``So we said, `We're not going to sign your
letters.' We want to know what access means.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA letter to which Grace took umbrage told Grace, the
company responsible for the asbestos contamination, that EPA wants
to enter the mine to sample the soil, water and air and any other
material disposed of on the site. It wants to store
asbestos-contaminated soil from the old Grace sites in town and
elsewhere on the mine property and take ``other actions deemed
necessary to protect human health and the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Peronard said there was nothing complex in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot of investigative work to do up there to
determine the risk that the mine site poses,'' he said. ``We're
still trying to answer the question of whether asbestos is still
leaving the site. Is it blowing around up there? How far out does
the asbestos contamination occur? We have a lot of work to do and
the mine is the heart of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Lund, a lawyer representing KDC/Grace, wrote to EPA
saying the agency could take the asbestos-contaminated soil and
haul it to a hazardous-waste disposal facility in Spokane, or pay
the company to dump it on the old mine property.
</P>
<P>
   Peronard's only comment was, ``We're not going to pay Grace a
penny.''

STATE SCHOOL BUDGET OVERHAUL IS URGED  

</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WYATT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging New York
state's system of allocating money to school districts has asked a
state judge to order a thorough reassessment of how much it costs
to provide a sound basic education to all of the state's public
school students.
</P>
<P>
   The Campaign for Fiscal Equity said on Monday in its final
written arguments that the state's system for allocating education
money had put New York City at so large a disadvantage that only an
overhaul of the budgetary process could correct the situation. The
group's argument relies in part on the results of 19 successful
lawsuits challenging the education aid programs of other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a fair study that focuses on the costs of education
essentials and a way of delivering those services,'' Michael A.
Rebell, executive director of the campaign, said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, which has 38 percent of the state's students,
receives 35.5 percent of the state's education aid, according to
the campaign, a coalition of advocacy groups. Because of the
demographic makeup of New York City's pupil population, the group
said, using the state aid formulas has meant that, on average,
minority-group students get less financial support than other
students.
</P>
<P>
   The state said in its final written arguments that no such
overhaul was needed, citing its finding that even the city's most
disadvantaged students fared no worse on standardized tests than
similar students in urban and rural districts across the state. The
state also said the city misspent hundreds of millions of dollars
of aid each year, citing mismanagement, corruption and
administrative waste.
</P>
<P>
   The statements were submitted on Monday afternoon in State
Supreme Court in Manhattan. Closing arguments before Justice Leland
DeGrasse will take place on Thursday. A decision is expected this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff's proposed remedy would be likely to increase
school funds in districts with large numbers of minority-group
children, or with high failure and dropout rates. The change could
increase state education costs by $3 billion above the present $13
billion, some experts believe.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff also asked the judge to expand a higher court's
definition of a ``sound basic education.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 decision that allowed the current case to proceed to
trial, the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, said a
sound basic education ``should consist of the basic literacy,
calculating, and verbal skills necessary to enable children to
eventually function productively as civic participants capable of
voting and serving on a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs said that definition should be expanded to
include the skills needed to ``sustain competitive employment.''
</P>
<P>
   In its argument, the state said the educational opportunities
available in New York City schools ``substantially exceed
constitutional minimums.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state argued that the plaintiffs had failed to
prove that the city's schools fell short of preparing students for
the job market or that such deficiencies could be traced to the
state's aid decisions.
</P>
<P>
   If the New York City Board of Education needs additional
support, the state concluded, it should come from local sources,
not from the taxpayers in other parts of the state.

HANANIAH HARARI, 87, ARTIST WHO CHAMPIONED MODERNISM 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hananiah Harari, an American painter and illustrator, died on
July 19 in Halthorne, N.Y. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Harari, who was born in Rochester, N.Y., studied with Fernand
Leger in Paris from 1932 to 1934. He was one of a group of American
painters who promoted the cause of international Modernism and
abstraction in the United States in the 1930s, a time when the
country was politically in an isolationist mode. His semi-abstract
painting always retained a firm connection to realism; he sometimes
painted a chosen subject in both modes.
</P>
<P>
   He had a parallel career as a commercial illustrator until 1950,
when he was blacklisted by the business community for doing
political cartoons for the leftist magazine The Masses. Thereafter,
he worked at commissioned portraiture, as well as with abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   Harari first exhibited in New York at the Mercury Gallery in
1939, and most recently at the Susan Teller Gallery in SoHo in
1995. In 1997 he was the subject of career retrospectives at the
Montclair Art Museum in New Jersey, the Neuberger Museum of Art in
Purchase, N.Y., and Dai Ichi Arts in Manhattan. Another
retrospective was organized by the Memorial Arts Gallery in
Rochester, N.Y., in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   His work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan

IN JUSTICE INQUIRY, CLINTON DENIES SEEKING FINANCIAL HELP FOR
HUBBELL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Subs for writetrhu.)   By DON VAN NATTA JR. and JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an interview with a senior Justice Department
prosecutor in April, President Clinton denied any recollection of a
pledge for a $1 million campaign donation by the Indonesian
businessman James T. Riady and denied asking Riady to help
financially the former Justice Department official Webster L.
Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments were contained in a 155-page transcript of
his April 21 interview with Robert J. Conrad Jr., the department's
chief political-finance prosecutor. The transcript was released
Monday night by White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that Clinton's testimony on a wide array
of campaign finance issues has been made public. The release came
at a time when it was likely to be overshadowed by the impending
news of Gov. George W. Bush's vice presidential selection, but a
White House spokesman denied any connection. The spokesman, Jake
Siewert, said the White House was concerned that the transcript
would be released by Republicans on the House Government Reform
Committee. The Republicans received it, under subpoena, earlier
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the interview was devoted to questions about
Clinton's lengthy relationship with Riady, a generous political
patron of the president who, the prosecutor suggested, had bragged
to Indonesian government ministers that his family enjoyed a
``direct pipeline to the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's line of questioning about the Riadys and
Hubbell is noteworthy because Riady has been under pressure in
recent weeks to accept a plea bargain agreement from the Justice
Department's campaign finance task force. Conrad has actively
investigated Riady's activities in connection with campaign
contributions made by him and employees of the Lippo Group, the $12
billion Riady family conglomerate, to the president's campaign in
1992 and his dealings with Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong company controlled by Riady paid Hubbell $100,000 on
June 27, 1994, after Hubbell resigned from the Justice Department
and faced a criminal inquiry over law-firm billings. Just four days
earlier, on June 23, Riady met with the president at the White
House after meeting that morning with Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he could not recall discussing Hubbell's need for
paid work with Riady.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, there was a lot of kind of, you know, a lot of
people who knew Webb were expressing some sympathy for him,'' the
president said. ``And, you know, if James Riady said to me, I'm
going to try to help him, he could have said that, I wouldn't have
_ and I mean, it wouldn't surprise me if he did, but I do not
remember him saying that to me. And, you know, he might have
deliberately avoided saying anything to me thinking it wouldn't be
appropriate to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the interview, Clinton again denied talking to anybody
about Hubbell's financial distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to understand two things,'' he said. ``No. 1, I
believe the people that helped Webb Hubbell did it because, like
me, they believed he was innocent. No. 2, I believe Webb Hubbell
was persistently persecuted by the independent counsel because he
would not lie about me or Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was also asked about a limousine ride he took in August
1992 with Riady in California. John Huang, a former Democratic
fund-raiser who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations last
year, told federal investigators that Riady promised to give $1
million and that ``President Clinton's reaction was one of
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president told Conrad in the interview that he did not
recall the ride or the offer. ``I don't have a specific
recollection of what the conversation was, or this fact of the car
ride,'' Clinton testified. He added that he recalled seeing Riady
``sometime in '92 after I became the nominee,'' and that Riady had
offered to help his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Riady and Lippo gave more than $1 million to the Democrats in
1992, and that money is the subject of the current criminal
investigation of Riady.
</P>
<P>
   The president was pressed again about whether he could
specifically recall Riady's $1 million pledge, but he said he could
not recall it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he said a million, I'm surprised I don't remember it,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides questions about Riady, the president was confronted with
a wide array of other campaign finance issues, from his
relationship to Huang and Charlie Trie to his ``livid'' reaction
after he discovered the Democratic Party had accepted millions of
dollars in contributions from foreign citizens and foreign
corporations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is that I was livid about it, because, No.
1, it was, it was embarrassing,'' Clinton said. ``And I thought it
was wrong not to vet these things. I thought that it was, it put
all of us in a very bad position.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The interview was the third since 1997 that the president has
given to Justice Department prosecutors investigating campaign
finance issues. The transcripts of the earlier two interviews were
not subpoenaed by congressional investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Siewert, the White House spokesman, said there was nothing in
the transcript to cause the president worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to give people on the Hill the satisfaction of
making an issue out of a nonissue into an issue,'' Siewert said.
``There is no issue here.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the interview, which occurred in the Treaty Room on
the second floor of the White House residence, a White House
official said the president was not a target of the criminal
inquiry and that he had cooperated fully with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   At several points in the interview, Clinton portrays himself as
a victim who has been hounded for years about questions of
overzealous Democratic fund-raising. The tone of the president's
answers, which veered between genial and terse, where he often
failed to recollect fund-raising details, differed significantly
from the caustic confrontation between Vice President Al Gore and
Conrad, which occurred on April 18 at the vice-presidential
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the president's answers to Conrad's questions were
reminiscent of the tortured wordplay he used with investigators
from the office of former independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr
during the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad also questioned Clinton about his dealings with other
figures at the center of the 1996 campaign fund-raising
investigation, including Johnny Chung, Pauline Kanchanalak and
David Chang, all of whom have been charged with violations of
federal campaign finance laws. The president was asked about
letters and gifts he received from these individuals and their
foreign business associates and whether Clinton knew they were
raising money illegally from foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
   The president staunchly denied any knowledge of illegal
fund-raising by these Asian-American fund-raisers for the
Democratic Party. ``You've got to understand,'' Clinton told
Conrad, ``I know this may look incredibly naive, but I had a lot of
things going on. I believed that all these people knew what the law
was.'' The president added, ``I was aghast when I found out about
it.'' He did say he thought Chung was ``kind of hustling,'' and
worried about having photographs taken with Chung's business
associates. But the president said he was ``not worried about them
being illegal givers or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad asked Clinton about whether his policies and visits to
foreign countries were influenced by fund-raisers. The president
said they had not been.
</P>
<P>
   The president was extensively questioned about White House
coffees he held for Democratic supporters. Like Gore, who was also
questioned at length about the coffees by Conrad, the president
denied that the events were fund-raisers or that there was a price
to attend them. The president defended the White House coffees,
telling Conrad that he regretted ``that they got a bad rap in the
end because I enjoyed them and found them helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   While denying that there was any stated price to attend the
coffees, he said, ``obviously, we weren't naive. You know, I wanted
these people to help us. I wanted them to give us money. But, to
the best of my knowledge, nobody was given a price tag to come to
coffee at the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was questioned about matters large and small, including
his decision to keep a picture frame of little value given to him
by a business associate of Kanchanalak. ``My guess is it was a nice
picture frame worth $50 or something and you can look around
here,'' Clinton said. ``We never have enough picture frames.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned about glitches in the White House e-mail system,
Clinton said he knew nothing about the problems until they were
reported by the news media. He said he never sends e-mail. ``And I
don't do it because _ I mean, I leave, I've got a big paper
trail.''  &QL;

HELTON'S ROCKY ROAD TO RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We live in the Atomic Age of baseball statistics, in which
almost any achievement at the plate can be shrugged off as a
mutation, the batter shunned as if radioactive.
</P>
<P>
   Cozier ballpark dimensions, creative balls-and-strikes umpiring,
protein-packed sluggers, expansion-thinned pitching staffs and
tighter-wound baseballs have turned the fans' fabled love of
numbers to apprehension. Can a .380 batting average be trusted
anymore? Can it be compared to a .380 batting average from decades
past? Or is it really a .280 average set aglow by unnatural
science?
</P>
<P>
   These days you need more than a calculator to evaluate the
leading hitters. You need to know, for instance, that Denver's
altitude and arid air cause batted balls to carry 11 percent
farther at Coors Field than at the typical park, as somebody
actually calculated.
</P>
<P>
   And how does it feel to be the object of such study, as is
Colorado Rockies first baseman Todd Helton, the National League's
top batter (.381)?
</P>
<P>
   ``It about makes me want to slug you upside the head,'' Helton
said last week when I brought up the topic of his apparent
home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Helton said this flatly, in a tone neither threatening nor
humorous. It seemed that Helton would simply prefer to be known as
a batman, not as an X-Man, a freak.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, 26, came into his third full major-league season as a
star in the making, having improved on his .315, 25-home run,
97-RBI season in 1998 with .320-35-113 in 1999. But he was in
danger of becoming a star with an asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he batted .385 at Coors, where the ball flies as if
from a missile launcher and easily finds gaps in the league's
deepest outfield. But he batted .252 on the road. He hit 23 homers
at home, 12 away.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody doubted that Helton had the tools to be great _ the body
of a former University of Tennessee quarterback and a studious
nature _ but it was natural to wonder if the Coors effect was
making him look better than he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I've got to apologize for the place I play,'' Helton
groused during the Rockies' visit to Dodger Stadium last week.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Helton is not the first Colorado hitter to go under
this microscope. The Rockies, who came into being in 1993, have
produced an unnerving number of league leaders _ Andres Galarraga
(batting, 1993; homers and RBI, 1996; RBI, 1997), Dante Bichette
(hits, homers, slugging and RBI, 1995; slugging, 1998), Ellis Burks
(runs and slugging, 1996), and Larry Walker (homers and slugging,
1997).
</P>
<P>
   Helton is, though, one Colorado hitter who has set out to do
something about the Coors questions, something more constructive
than complaining about them.
</P>
<P>
   He has become a .300 hitter on the road this season. His road
average stands at .314 as the Rockies host the Dodgers this week.
That improvement is a big reason he made his first All-Star team
earlier in the month.
</P>
<P>
   Helton is a bright man and he knew he had holes in his game. His
hitting against left-handed pitchers was a hole. His hitting on the
road was a gaping hole.
</P>
<P>
   Since his two-sport days at Tennessee, where the Knoxville
native was Baseball America's 1995 college player of the year, he
has recorded every at-bat in a notebook for later analysis. The
notebooks aren't as detailed as they were when he took down every
pitch. But they helped him sort out his problem.
</P>
<P>
   He figured out there wasn't anything tangible tamping down his
numbers on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I look at an at-bat and say, 'I made an out
there because the ball broke sharper,' '' Helton said, referring to
the notion that curveballs bend less in the thin Denver air. ``It's
mental. It's about transferring the feeling I have at home to the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   One theory says that for a player who's new to Coors Field, the
home-field advantage is nearly offset by the shock of returning to
the road and to reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys develop a tremendous comfort zone (at home),'' said
Clint Hurdle, the Rockies' hitting coach. ``(Coors) is
hitter-friendly. It might be the !ital!most hitter-friendly. They
know if they get a good swing on a good pitch, there's reward from
foul line to foul line.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've tried to stress to them is that they've got to take
that swagger on the road. Certainly (Helton's) numbers are
indicative of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd has been able to eliminate a lot of the questions that
were presented to him in his first couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about his power, gone. Questions about handling
lefties, gone. Questions about hitting on the road . . . going.
</P>
<P>
   Of his 24 home runs this season, 17 have come at Coors. Of his
72 RBI, 54 have come at Coors. And although he has made himself a
.300 hitter on the road, he has raised his average at Coors exactly
as much, to .447 going into Monday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   If it bothers him to have the disparity pointed out, the
solution is obvious. He's going to have to find a way to hit worse
at home.

DOCTOR'S CORRECTION: CHENEY'S HEALTH `GOOD,' BUT HEART FUNCTION NOT
`NORMAL' 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BUSH-CHENEY) By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Cheney's personal cardiologist said Monday night that the
man Gov. George W. Bush has apparently chosen to be his running
mate was in good health and had no symptoms of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview, the physician, Dr. Jonathan Reiner of
Washington, took issue with part of a statement released Monday by
a cardiac surgeon in Houston and friend of the Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, the Houston surgeon, Dr. Denton A. Cooley,
said: ``In a recent checkup by Dr. Reiner, he declared that Mr.
Cheney is in good health with normal cardiac function.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiner said that Cooley had called ``about a week ago'' to
discuss Cheney's medical history. Cheney has had three heart
attacks, but none since he underwent a quadruple coronary bypass
operation in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In their conversation, Reiner said he told Cooley that ``Mr.
Cheney is in good health, leads a vigorous professional and
recreational life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reiner said he ``did not characterize (Cheney) as having
normal cardiac function.''
</P>
<P>
   Heart attacks destroy muscle cells that cannot be replaced. The
amount of heart function lost after an attack, or series of
attacks, depends, in part, on how much heart muscle has been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley had said he ``conveyed to Governor Bush that in my
opinion Mr. Cheney's health problems in the past should not
interfere with a strenuous political campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiner said Monday night that Cheney could withstand a strenuous
campaign. He declined to provide details about Cheney's medical
condition until he received permission. He said he expected such
permission would be forthcoming if Bush named Cheney as his running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley said he had agreed to review Cheney's heart records after
a call from former President George Bush ``and presumed approval of
Gov. George W. Bush.'' Cooley did not say whether Cheney had given
his permission.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say who authorized him to make statements about
Reiner's recent examination and other aspects of Cheney's medical
records.

EDITORIAL: MONARCHS OF THEIR SPORTS
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 25:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are few obvious analogies between endurance cycling and
professional golf. Tour de France cycling, for all its strategic
interest, is consummately a physical sport, while professional golf
is consummately a strategic sport, though its young players are
growing physically stronger and stronger. Perhaps the greatest
similarity between Lance Armstrong, who won his second consecutive
Tour de France on Sunday, and Tiger Woods, who won the British Open
at St. Andrews, Scotland, on the same day, is their ability to
demoralize the competition, to leave everyone else playing for
second place.
</P>
<P>
   But to each man his own victory. Like his win last year,
Armstrong's triumph in this year's Tour de France is made more
significant by the fact that he is a cancer survivor. It attests
not only to his own remarkable talents but also to a personal
courage that he shares with other cancer survivors. As for Woods,
his win at St. Andrews _ following his victories in the U.S. Open,
the PGA Championship and the Masters _ amounts to a kind of
canonization. By the time he sank his final putt on Sunday evening,
the Old Course at St. Andrews was knee-deep in hyperbole, all of it
true.
</P>
<P>
   When David Duval, playing with Woods on the final round, found
himself in a deep bunker on the 17th hole, he faced the nearly
impossible task of trying to fly his ball out of the sand and over
a six-foot wall a foot away. It took him four shots to get out, and
it felt to many viewers, and perhaps many players, as though that
wall were somehow Tiger Woods, a resolute, uncanny obstacle in the
path of every professional golfer. Duval's struggle, which was
heart-rending in itself, gave us an opportunity to witness, yet
again, the dignity with which Woods carries himself. As Woods and
Duval left the 18th green, bareheaded, Woods rested his right hand
on Duval's right shoulder. There was not much he could say, but the
gesture meant everything.

FRANKEL WINS TITLE WITH CLOSING KICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Bobby Frankel's horses _ and the Hall of
Fame trainer himself _ put on a big finish Monday at Hollywood
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Starmaniac rallied from next to last in a field of 10 to win a
starter-allowance race and The Seven Seas surged from last in a
field of seven to win the $136,375 Estrapade Stakes. Their
victories on closing day vaulted Frankel to a record ninth training
championship at the Hollywood Park spring-summer meet.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Frankel was fourth in the standings, trailing
leader Bob Baffert by six wins. Going into Monday's races, Frankel
was still third, having saddled 21 winners, one behind Baffert and
Cliff Sise.
</P>
<P>
   Sise's only runner Monday finished fourth. Baffert's pair of
entrants finished fourth and fifth. Frankel sent out a third-place
finisher before winning with his last two starters of the meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't mean that much at this stage of my career,''
said Frankel, 59, who cares more about lucrative stakes victories
nowadays, and was elected to the Racing Hall of Fame in 1995. ``I
had what, 23 wins? When I won the title here in 1972, I had 60
wins. That's a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't plan this. The only time I started to think about it
was in the last four or five days.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's 60 wins in 1972 remains a Hollywood Park record. That
was the first of his six consecutive titles at the Inglewood track
after his arrival from New York as ``King of the Claimers.''
</P>
<P>
   His ninth spring-summer title broke a tie with Bill Molter, who
led for the last time in 1956. This was Frankel's first
spring-summer title since he finished in a tie with Mike Mitchell
in 1982. Frankel also has two titles at the Hollywood Park autumn
meet.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's 27 titles on the Hollywood Park-Santa Anita-Del Mar
circuit put him one behind Farrell Jones, whose last was at Oak
Tree in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The Seven Seas ($5), a 4-year-old filly ridden by Alex Solis,
gave Frankel his fourth stakes victory in July, following
Happyanunoit (Beverly Hills Handicap), Honest Lady (A Gleam) and
Euchre (Bel Air).
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's earlier winner Monday, Starmaniac, was ridden by
Victor Espinoza, the 28-year-old Mexico City native who had
clinched his first major riding title on Saturday. Espinoza
finished the 65-day meet with 62 wins, 11 more than Corey Nakatani
and 19 more than Laffit Pincay (who raised his record career wins
total to 8,949).
</P>
<P>
   Off the track, management was happy with a surge in business,
beginning after the Lakers' championship run, that resulted in a
nearly 5 percent rise in on-site wagering from last year, the first
increase at the spring-summer meet since 1993. Overall wagering
rose nearly 6 percent to a record $10.3 million-a-day average.
</P>
<P>
   But average attendance slipped by about 2.5 percent to 9,820
on-site and 22,062 including off-track facilities, marking the
track's seventh consecutive decline.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar opens a 43-day meet Wednesday at 2 p.m.

ADVERTISING: BP AMOCO'S NEW-LOOK GAS STATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By KRUTI TRIVEDI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BP Amoco introduced a new model of gas station Monday,
and the least important item for sale is the gas.
</P>
<P>
   The prototype of what will be a nationwide line of new stations,
called BP Connect, was outfitted with solar panels, and spiffed up
with the new green, yellow and white BP sunburst-shaped symbol.
Customers will be able to check the forecast for an impending
thunderstorm on a small screen at the pump, buy a bottle of wine
and some fresh-baked croissants at a neon-free supermarket inside,
or log in to the latest news at an e-commerce kiosk.
</P>
<P>
   The decidedly upscale new digs are a launching pad for the
company's new $7 million rebranding campaign, which aims to
reposition BP Amoco, an old-economy gas station giant, into a
progressive, environmentally friendly retailer that goes, in the
company's own words, ``beyond petroleum.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to introduce a new brand image and spruce up its
service stations comes at a time when, as gas prices increase,
competition for customer loyalty is especially fierce. Not only
must BP Amoco deal with consumers' growing sentiment of hostility
toward gas companies, it also has to figure out how to best use its
four major brands: BP, Amoco, Arco and Castrol.
</P>
<P>
   The rebranding campaign was seen by brand analysts as a way of
increasing operating margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retail petroleum business is a dull, boring and
uninteresting business in which the drivers of preference are
location and price, and brands have not played a very significant
role in gas stations,'' said John K. Grace, executive director of
Interbrand Corp., a brand consulting company. ``Because branding
has been weak, consumers have a difficult time differentiating
among top quality players. These petroleum manufacturers are
missing the boat in terms of what role brand can play.''
</P>
<P>
   While the price at the pump may be on the minds of most drivers
this summer, there is a ``growing and large percentage of people
who don't go to gas stations for gas,'' said Peter Dixon, senior
partner at Lippincott &AMP; Margulies, a corporate identity consulting
company owned by Marsh &AMP; McLennan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, BP Amoco is looking to pull drivers into the stations'
stores, where they can buy items that are more profitable to sell
than gasoline. While filling their tanks, customers can order a
cafe latte that will be waiting for them once they've finished
pumping their gas. If they really want to rush, BP is working on
wireless technology that will enable them to send in their payments
ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to have half of the stations' revenues coming from
gas sales and the other half coming from the convenience store,
Doug Ford, BP Amoco's chief executive for refining and marketing,
told reporters Monday at a Georgia test site for the new station.
Currently, 80 percent of revenue comes from gasoline sales and the
rest from retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me this is a real estate business,'' Ford said. ``We're
managing a particular site.''
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco, which analysts say has always been particularly
sensitive to brand identity, began discussing branding as soon as
its $48.2 billion acquisition of Amoco was complete in January
1999. Both brands needed a face-lift: Amoco's stations had kept the
same design for the last 20 years and BP's for the last 12. The
company hired Landor &AMP; Associates, a division of Young &AMP; Rubicam,
to research consumer attitudes toward the stations. Landor found
that customers liked Amoco products but thought the red, white and
blue stations were too dark. At the same time, they found the green
and yellow BP colors appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John Browne, BP Amoco's chief executive, decided that if BP
Amoco was going to be recognized as a global brand, it needed to
have one strong identity, a company official said.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising to promote the new brand image was created by
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group, which was named
by BP Amoco as its global agency in November. The ads, which focus
on BP's role as a green company, will start running in print and on
television Tuesday. One commercial asks: ``Is it possible to drive
a car and still have a clean environment? Can business go further
and be a force for good?'' BP says it plans to spend $25 million a
fiscal quarter on its branding campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The first BP Connect stations will open in Indianapolis,
Cleveland and London this year. The second round of station
openings will include Chicago, Atlanta and Sydney, Australia. The
prototype was tested in an old warehouse outside Atlanta because of
its proximity to the suppliers in charge of making the new pump
with its LCD screen.
</P>
<P>
   The largest BP Connect sites will be 4,200 square feet. They are
airy and open: None of the center aisle shelves is much higher than
waist level.
</P>
<P>
   The stores are divided into five different sections: a food
service section, a beverage section, an impulse buying section with
snacks, a convenience store section and an Internet section. The
type of lighting changes with each section. The food service
section has a warm, golden glow while the milk and eggs portion of
the convenience section has a flourescent tinge.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the store, the offerings are localized: Customers using
the Paris station, for example, will be able to find foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds to me like what BP has done is that they woke up one
morning and said, `You know something, we're not in the gasoline
business, we're in the retail business,''' said Clive Chajet of
Chajet Consultancy, a brand consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics, like Charles T. Maxwell, senior petroleum
analyst at Weeden &AMP; Co., are not convinced that customers will
benefit from some of the add-ons. ``Maybe this is one-stop shopping
but I always like to go to a grocery store to buy my groceries,''
Maxwell said. ``The grease and parts and shout and clatter and
spilled gasoline don't go in my mind with matters of food.''

SURHOFF IS THE NEXT OBJECT OF YANKEES' ARDOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Leery of trading their best prospect to get Rondell
White from the Montreal Expos, the New York Yankees are negotiating
to make a deal for B.J. Surhoff, Baltimore's veteran left fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from the teams exchanged a handful of possible trade
combinations Monday afternoon. The Yankees offered David Walling, a
Class AA right-hander who was their first-round draft pick last
year, as well as a second prospect, to be picked from a list of
three: the Class AA shortstop Erick Almonte, the Class AAA pitcher
Ryan Bradley and the Class AA pitcher Brian Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Through Sunday's games, Surhoff, 35, was batting .294 for the
Orioles, with 12 homers and 56 runs batted in. He is considered by
scouts to be a solid if unspectacular outfielder, not blessed with
extraordinary range or throwing ability but sure-handed and usually
in the right place at the right time. He is widely respected for
his intensity; his on-field demeanor is similar to that of Paul
O'Neill, the Yankees' right fielder. Surhoff is essentially a
contact hitter, with only 44 strikeouts in 388 at-bats, with 29
walks.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff is making $3 million this year and will make $3.5
million next year. He has a vesting option for the 2002 season for
$4.5 million that he should easily qualify for, meaning that if the
Yankees make a deal for him, they know he may be with them for
another two years. Surhoff's contract contains a limited no-trade
clause, but the Yankees are not among the teams Surhoff can block.
The Mets are among those teams, perhaps the result of a frustrating
end to negotiations between Surhoff and the Mets after the 1998
season, when the Mets were negotiating with Surhoff and Robin
Ventura at the same time and signed Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles have been trying to trade Surhoff for months, but
their preference has been to keep him close to his Maryland home,
where one of his children is enrolled in a special-needs program.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Surhoff would give the Yankees four left-handed
hitters and two switch-hitters from positions No. 3 to No. 8 in the
lineup, a situation other teams would try to exploit. But few
contender actually have quality left-handers: Boston has reliever
Rheal Cormier, Seattle has Jamie Moyer and John Halama, the Chicago
White Sox field Jim Parque and Mike Sirotka, the Toronto Blue Jays
have David Wells. The majority of pitchers the Yankees will face
are right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   When the Chicago Cubs were asking for several prospects for
Sammy Sosa last month while the principal owner George Steinbrenner
pushed for a big trade, club executives desperately searched for a
less-expensive alternative that nonetheless could have some impact
on the team. They found David Justice, swapping three young players
instead of the five for Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees' executives seem to be working in a similar circumstance
now. The Montreal Expos are ready to deal White, who has repeatedly
been on the disabled list, and have asked the Yankees for Alfonso
Soriano, the most developed prospect in the organization. The Red
Sox are believed to be involved, as well, perhaps offering third
baseman Wilton Veras and another prospect. Again, Steinbrenner is
pushing for action, wanting to address the left-field vacancy that
was created when Shane Spencer blew out his knee July 9.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees can complete the negotiations for Surhoff _ and
the chances of that have improved because the Orioles appear to
have backed off their long-standing demand for Soriano _ then
Surhoff, like Justice, would represent a less-expensive compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have other options for left field, such as trading
for Philadelphia's Ron Gant, Pittsburgh's Wil Cordero and John
Vander Wal, or making a deal for Texas' David Segui. But those are
all imperfect fits, because they are all poor defensive
outfielders; trading for Cordero, for instance, would require
Justice to play left field more than the Yankees want, with Cordero
serving as designated hitter. &QL;

FORMER NEWARK MAYOR IS CHARGED WITH SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
   By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Kenneth A. Gibson, who as Newark's mayor for 16
years was the first black elected to lead a major northeastern
city, was indicted Monday on federal fraud, bribery and conspiracy
charges in connection with his consulting firm's management of a
$50 million school construction project in Irvington.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the 18-count indictment of the former mayor and two
associates in his Gibson Associates engineering firm, Robert J.
Cleary, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, said Gibson had ``ripped
off'' the Irvington Board of Education by overbilling it for some
work done and falsely billing it for work that was never done.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Gibson, 68, had bribed two board members and used
his Newark firm, which he has run since leaving office in 1986, as
a ``personal, tax-free piggy bank'' to funnel the money into
personal investments and expenses. In the end, Cleary said, it was
the children of Irvington who suffered, as the project managed by
Gibson's firm ran out of money in 1995 before it was completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our view, there is a public trust even given his current
role, in which he has a fiduciary responsibility to provide honest
services,'' Cleary said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   When he was elected mayor in 1970, Gibson became a national
spokesman for the plight of older cities, and in 1982 he almost won
the Democratic nomination for governor. But after four terms in
City Hall, he was defeated in 1986 by the current mayor and a
former ally, Sharpe James.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years later, Gibson attempted a comeback, but narrowly
lost in his bid to unseat James W. Treffinger, a Republican, as
Essex County executive, despite a Democratic edge in voter
registrations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his name recognition, the contacts he made while in
office and the political history his tenure evokes have aided
Gibson, who is trained as a civil engineer, in winning consulting
contracts with public agencies like the Essex County Improvement
Authority and the Passaic Valley Sewer Authority, as well as a
number of local governments in the state and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Indicted with Gibson on Monday were Camille Savoca, 53, of
Newark, the vice president and co-owner of the firm, and Gibson's
companion, and William Bernowich, 53, of Washingtonville, N.Y., who
was project manager on the Irvington job. The three co-defendants
were not arrested; they will be arraigned at a date yet to be
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Bernowich would not comment on the charges. Gibson and Savoca
issued a statement through their lawyer, Cathy Fleming, calling the
indictment ``unfortunate and unwarranted,'' but one they were aware
might be coming as a result of a four-year investigation by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, associates of Gibson described him as unsurprised and
seemingly unperturbed by the charges, in part because of the many
investigations he has survived.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview when he was mayor, Gibson, asked about
investigations his administration faced on matters from its hiring
practices to its purchasing and housing programs, observed, ``In my
13 years in office, there has never been a month when we're not
being investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the Essex County prosecutor, George L. Schneider,
charged him with giving out a no-show job. Gibson was acquitted
after a six-week trial.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations into Newark's political leadership have continued
in the last decade, leading to the convictions of nine sanitation
officials in the Gibson administration, two members of the City
Council and the top aide to Mayor James.
</P>
<P>
   Two former members of the Irvington Board of Education were
mentioned in Monday's indictment as unindicted co-conspirators,
said Ralph J. Marra Jr., an assistant U.S. attorney. The indictment
charges that in 1992, Gibson met with the two board members and
proposed to pay them each $3,000 to $4,000 to show his appreciation
for receiving the construction contract, and that he later paid at
least one. Marra would not name the members or say whether they
were cooperating with the prosecution.

<P>
   (Mesa, ARIZ.) - The name of the Confederate Air Force Museum in
Mesa has become such an embarrassment that its brochures only use
``CAF.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We play down the Confederate part because of problems we're
having with the Confederacy name,'' said Milt Moenich, wing leader.
``We've lost some corporate donations because they're connecting us
with the Confederacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mesa museum at Falcon Field, started in 1978, is a branch of
the nationwide Confederate Air Force Museum founded in the
mid-1950s to restore and preserve old military aircraft. It has
nothing to do with the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The national Texas-based organization is asking its members to
approve a name change. But because of the bylaws, that will take
two elections. A change, if approved by 75 percent of those who
vote, would take place in January 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Some names suggested already are Commemorative Air Force, which
would let the group keep its CAF initials, or Ghost Squadron, its
longtime nickname, said Tina Corbett, marketing and communications
director for CAF in Midland.
</P>
<P>
   She said there are rumors that the group is being pressured to
change its name but said that the impetus comes from the members.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``Confederate'' has become especially controversial in
the light of an economic boycott launched by the NAACP of South
Carolina because of a Confederate flag that has flown over or near
the Statehouse dome in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Corbett said the Confederate Air Force includes Black members.
CAF volunteers in Minnesota are painting a P-51 Mustang in the
colors of the Tuskegee Airmen, a squadron of Black pilots who flew
about 15,500 missions during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it's called, the organization is dedicated to restoring
and preserving old military aircraft and honoring the thousands of
pilots who bravely climbed into cramped plane compartments, flew
into the frigid skies where temperatures fell to minus-40 or below
and risked their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep alive the memory of all the men who gave their
lives to keep this country free,'' said Moenich, 75, who volunteers
at the museum four days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you see some old gentleman saying he flew one of
these aircraft. You see tears coming out of his eyes. This is quite
emotional. This is our pay,'' said Moenich, tears gathering in his
eyes. ``I get choked up when I talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate Air Force Museum in Mesa has nine aircraft, plus
some others on loan. Its two featured aircraft, a fully restored,
flyable B-17 Flying Fortress Sentimental Journey and a German
Heinkel-111, are gone now on their annual summer tours to cooler
climates.
</P>
<P>
   Although the museum draws about 60,000 visitors a year, it has
few visitors now because the lack of air-conditioning turns the
hangar into a sauna. The museum is attempting to build a larger $2
million museum but has only collected about $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   The museum treats visitors to flights in the B-17 (at $350 a
person) and lets them climb into several planes, an experience that
shows visitors just how awkward and frightening it would have been
for World War II pilots, with bullets flying at them while they
shivered.
</P>
<P>
   Moenich wasn't a pilot but performed electrical repairs on
aircraft in the war. Still, he has talked to enough veterans to
know what it was like.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were trapped. You couldn't get out in the face of bullets
and shrapnel flying by. You were cold. Even though you had a heated
suit, your face was not heated.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Moenich said many vets clammed up about their war
experiences because ``it was something they wanted to forget.''

EDITORIAL: MR. DANFORTH'S VERDICT ON WACO
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 25:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Danforth noted last Friday that his inquiry into the 1993
Waco disaster had been limited to ``whether government agents had
engaged in bad acts, not whether they exercised bad judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an important distinction. The report by Danforth, the
special counsel, cleared Attorney General Janet Reno of any
wrongdoing in the federal raid on the compound near Waco, Texas,
occupied by a sect called the Branch Davidians. After a 51-day
standoff, tanks driven by FBI agents pumped tear gas into the
compound, after which a fire broke out, claiming about 80 lives.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that the agents had not shot at the cult
members or started the fire, as many critics of the government's
behavior have long asserted. At the same time, however, the report
did not address the question whether Reno had been right to order
the assault, which we continue to believe was a reckless move.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth rebuked the government on other grounds, mainly its
failure to tell the truth about the use of incendiary tear gas
canisters. Indeed, it was the disclosure that FBI agents, despite
repeated denials and without telling Reno, had fired such devices
that prompted the investigation. According to Danforth the
canisters were launched hours before the fire, landed harmlessly 75
feet from the Branch Davidians' living quarters and did not cause
the fire. Nevertheless Danforth, who described his investigation as
``95 percent complete,'' said the remaining work would focus on why
Congress was never told about the canisters, a failure that
``undermined public confidence in government.''
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, Reno and the country have reason to be reassured
by the report, which seems to put to rest what Danforth called
``the dark questions'' _ whether the government had conspired to
wipe out the Branch Davidians and whether it later engaged in a
cover-up. Danforth's team of 56 lawyers and investigators answered
no on both counts, placing responsibility for the fire and for the
deaths of the cult members squarely on David Koresh, the sect's
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the tragedy need not have happened at all. The one
thing the FBI agents always had on their side was time. Reno went
along with the FBI's assault proposals partly on grounds, never
substantiated, that children were being sexually abused inside the
compound. The agents should have been ordered to starve the cult
out and hold the tanks and tear gas. Koresh might still have
orchestrated the same suicidal endgame, but the country would have
been spared years of doubts about the wisdom and integrity of its
government.

MISSOURI GAMING COMMISSION SUBPOENAS STATION CASINOS INC. EMPLOYEES
 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY RICK ALM, THE KANSAS CITY STAR   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Missouri Gaming Commission on Monday
subpoenaed eight Station Casinos Inc. employees to testify at an
Aug. 30 hearing about bonuses the company paid more than four years
ago to a St. Louis lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those subpoenaed _ Troy A. Stremming, Midwest counsel,
and William W. Warner, vice president for finance at the company's
Las Vegas headquarters _ were among five Station executives
identified last week as members of an investor group seeking to buy
and split off Station Casino Kansas City and Station Casino St.
Charles from the parent firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 30 commission hearing in Kansas City comes after
Michael Lazaroff, Station's former St. Louis outside counsel,
pleaded guilty in federal court last month to multiple felonies,
including misappropriation of more than $800,000 in law firm funds.
That money included the bonus from Station that was paid in
installments over a two-year span that ended in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Lazaroff matter surfaced in December, questions have
been raised about whether any of that money was used to improperly
influence public officials in the licensing of Station's two
Missouri casinos in May 1994 and January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied any wrongdoing in the Lazaroff matter.
</P>
<P>
   Others summoned to Kansas City next month are Frank J. Fertitta
III, Station chairman and chief executive; Glenn C. Christenson,
executive vice president and chief financial officer; Scott M.
Nielson, general counsel; Marnie Hinrichs, Nielson's executive
secretary; Richard J. Haskins, associate general counsel and former
Midwest counsel; and John Pasqualotto, vice president of regulatory
compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Gaming Commission Executive Director Mel Fisher said other
witnesses are likely to testify, but he would not identify them.
</P>
<P>
   That list could include Lazaroff, who is cooperating with
authorities while awaiting sentencing, and Joseph J. Canfora, who
headed Station's Kansas City operation until early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Canfora recently resigned as president of privately held
Horseshoe Gaming LLC, whose principal owner, Jack Binion, faces
licensing problems in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in Kansas City also has issued subpoenas to
Fertitta and Christenson in connection with the Lazaroff payments.
The federal prosecutors office in Kansas City had no comment about
the nature of its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed $475 million sale of the Missouri casinos to
Station insiders is contingent on approval by the Gaming Commission
and others. No such hearings have been set.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said the commission's Kansas City hearing could stretch
into a second day.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaming Commission also will spend Aug. 29 in Kansas City for
its regular monthly meeting.
</P>
<P>
   One item expected to be on the regular agenda is proposed
disciplinary action against Station Casino Kansas City stemming
from an incident last month when a 16-year-old girl entered the
casino with her mother and remained on the premises for more than
24 hours before her false identification was challenged.

FAMILY BELIEVED TO HAVE RAISED CHILD LINKED TO ROBINSON PLANS TO
MAKE STATEMENT  
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY SCOTT CANON, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo., _ The family who raised the baby police
believe to be the daughter of Lisa Stasi plans to make some kind of
public statement in the next few days. Lisa Stasi disappeared after
meeting serial-killing suspect John E. Robinson Sr. 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The family's attorney said over the weekend that the family was
``anticipating making a statement...in a few days.'' He would not
indicate what sort of public comment the couple planned other than
to say it would probably not contain much detail.
</P>
<P>
   So far the girl's adoptive parents, a couple known to Robinson,
have declined comment other than to say they are ``cooperating
fully with law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The family's plan to make a statement comes as authorities are
apparently near to amending the charges against Robinson, perhaps
accusing him in the kidnapping of Lisa Stasi's daughter, Tiffany
Lynn, now 15 years old. That charge would be added to five existing
murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Stasi's blood relatives have been told by prosecutors
that they expect the charges to be amended by next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and investigators, sensitive to how the case could
disrupt a teen-ager's life, have declined to publicly discuss their
progress in identifying Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   A blood sample, which could be used to confirm whether the
teen-ager is Tiffany, was taken from her maternal grandmother early
last week. Results of a test to match DNA were not yet complete.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany was 4 months old, the daughter of 19-year-old Lisa
Stasi, when in-laws reported them missing in early 1985, days after
Lisa accepted an offer of shelter and job training from Robinson.
Friends and relatives have not seen Lisa Stasi since.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, mainly from Johnson County, are looking into
whether Tiffany was raised under a new name by a middle-class
family living in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Last month The Kansas City Star found the family thought to be
raising Tiffany and learned that she had just finished her freshman
year in public high school.
</P>
<P>
   The case holds myriad legal and ethical riddles because the girl
is a minor.
</P>
<P>
   The case _ where a girl is raised by strangers in what could
stem from kidnapping and the possible murder of her mother _ has
only vaguely similar precedents. But discoveries in other parts of
the nation _ children switched at birth or where a biological
parent contests an adoption _ have set off tangled custody fights.
Missouri records indicate this adoption was off the books.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Stasi married Lisa Stasi about a month before Tiffany was
born on Sept. 3, 1984, in Kansas City and is listed as her father
on her birth certificate. He has told The Star he is not eager to
disrupt the life of a teen-ager he has never really known. He now
lives in Kirksville, Mo., has remarried and is the father of
another daughter, a toddler.
</P>
<P>
   The search for Tiffany Stasi had been stymied for years. It
picked up again this summer with the discoveries of five women's
bodies stuffed in barrels on Robinson's property. He was charged
last month with five counts of capital murder, all involving women
who appeared to have died in recent years. But at least three other
women, Lisa Stasi among them, disappeared in the 1980s after making
contact with Robinson. He faces no charges involving those women.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The nation's most famous urban park was closed Monday
night, and a New York Philharmonic concert postponed, after city
officials announced that they had found mosquitoes infected with
West Nile virus in Central Park and would spend the night
blanketing the 843-acre refuge with pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   The spraying began at 10 p.m., and was to continue through the
night, city officials said. The park was to reopen Tuesday morning,
with the concert rescheduled for Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The pesticide spraying will be extended on Wednesday night to
much of Manhattan, from 23rd Street to 110th Street, between the
East River and the Hudson, as the city escalates its response to
the mosquito-borne virus that killed seven people in the region
last year and made 55 others sick. No infections of humans have
been reported this year.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Dr. Neal
L. Cohen, the city health commissioner, sought to reassure city
residents that even if they were bitten by infected mosquitoes, the
likelihood that they would become seriously ill was remote.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed to be panicking in the park Monday. Although
hundreds of people who had arrived early for the concert were
packing up, joggers, bikers and roller-bladers continued to enjoy
the park into the early evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a huge scare,'' said Gerald Ginsberg, an East Side
physician who was taking his daily 3-mile walk through the park.
``You know what would have been more frightening to me? If they had
found deer and deer ticks with Lyme disease in Central Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and the health commissioner urged city residents and
tourists not to be apprehensive about visiting the park after the
pesticide treatment has been completed. But they added that with an
estimated 30,000 people expected for the Philharmonic's annual
summer concert, they felt it was best not to tempt fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances, the risk, is very, very small,'' Giuliani said.
``But to risk 30,000 people in the park, sitting there for two or
three hours of music, that is another thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we're disappointed, but public health is the primary
concern,'' said Eric Latzky, a spokesman for the New York
Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   City officials also canceled a weekly youth track and field
program scheduled to be held in the park Monday night, and asked
teams playing at 16 ballfields to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   The extreme steps were taken Monday after officials learned that
a sample of mosquitoes collected on July 12 in the Park, near 63rd
Street and Fifth Avenue, had tested positive for the virus. Two
mosquito samples collected this month on Staten Island also tested
positive, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They were not the first infected mosquitoes to be found in the
state. In the last 10 days, mosquitoes in Westchester, Suffolk and
Orange Counties in New York and in Stamford, Conn., have also been
found to be carrying the virus. Throughout the New York region,
more than 40 infected birds have also been found, with Nassau
County added to a list Monday that now includes eight New York and
New Jersey counties in a circle around the city.
</P>
<P>
   The growing list of West Nile confirmations, while disconcerting
to the public, are to an extent an illustration of what city and
state officials consider a successful public health campaign. By
intensifying monitoring of birds and mosquitoes and then quickly
moving to spread pesticides in surrounding areas, officials hope to
prevent or at least limit the spread of the disease to humans this
year. People over 50 are at the highest risk of severe disease, but
young children and people with weakened immune systems are also
more susceptible, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The city this year has mosquito traps in 70 locations. None
other than two in Staten Island and one in lower Central Park has
turned up infected insects. City officials did not detect infected
mosquitoes last year in Central Park, but the surveillance then was
not nearly as intense. Still, the city chose to spray the park with
pesticides last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the virus probably was present in the area of the
park last year, because an elderly man who lived on Central Park
South was made sick by the virus.
</P>
<P>
   One popular attraction at the park, the Central Park Zoo, has
already been attacking mosquitoes with larvicide since last year's
outbreak of West Nile virus, a zoo spokeswoman said. Dr. Bob Cook,
the zoo's chief veterinarian, said that animals were taken inside
at night and that the virus primarily affected birds, not mammals.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani emphasized that it should be safe to return to the park
once it has been treated with pesticide. ``We did not send
everybody out of their homes and close down the area,'' he said.
``People should just go about their lives normally, except for one
night, stay out of the park, let us spray it and it will be back to
normal.`
</P>
<P>
   The city has already sprayed on Staten Island. More spraying is
planned for Tuesday night in Queens and bordering sections of
Brooklyn. Spraying has also taken place or is planned in many
surrounding communities, although some, like Nassau County on Long
Island and Bergen County in northern New Jersey, are holding off.
Pesticide campaigns _ using crews of city contractors that have
sprayers mounted on trucks _ had already been planned Monday night
in northeastern Queens and on Staten Island, in response to the
infected birds confirmed last week.
</P>
<P>
   The city is using synthetic pesticides, Anvil and Scourge, that
officials say are similar in composition to a natural pesticide
produced by chrysanthemum flowers, and that quickly break down when
exposed to sunlight or water or air. But the heavy reliance on
spraying is evoking increasing protest from some environmental
groups that say the mayor is overreacting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is taking an irresponsible course of action,'' said
Kimberly Flynn, a researcher for the New York Environmental Law and
Justice Project.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Cohen rejected those concerns. The spraying, Cohen
said, should kill about 90 percent of the mosquitoes present, which
means that a certain number infected with the virus may survive.
</P>
<P>
   While city residents and visitors should continue to use Central
Park without hesitation, he said, they should wear bug repellent
and consider wearing long-sleeved shirts, long pants and socks. The
recommendations are particularly important for the elderly and
young children, who are more susceptible to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquitoes found in Central Park and on Staten Island are
most active from dusk to dawn, when they are feeding, Cohen said.

MARC REISNER, AUTHOR ON THE ENVIRONMENT, DIES AT 51 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marc Reisner, an environmental writer and advocate best known
for his book ``Cadillac Desert: The American West and Its
Disappearing Water,'' died on Friday at his home in San Anselmo,
Calif. He was 51.
</P>
<P>
   He had cancer, said Joe Spieler, his literary agent.
</P>
<P>
   Reisner said in the early 1990s that his politics were
``undefinable radical to conservative Democrat with residual
radicalism _ especially on environmental issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cadillac Desert'' (Viking Penguin, 1986) was a seminal work
about the environmental cost of Western water projects.
</P>
<P>
   The book was applauded by Gladwin Hill, the former national
environmental correspondent for The New York Times, in a review in
The Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unlikely that most taxpayers will read `Cadillac Desert,'
but they should,'' Hill wrote. ``It's a revealing, absorbing, often
amusing and alarming report on where billions of their dollars have
gone _ and where a lot more are going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money has gone into federal water projects in the Western
states, _ some of the projects awesome, some scandalous but all
with an uncertain future,'' Hill added. Reisner, a former staff
writer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, ``has put the
story together in trenchant form,'' Hill wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``He details the Machiavellian competition,'' he continued,
between the Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation and the
Army Corps of Engineers. Reisner also ``recounts how huge sums have
been spent to benefit small numbers of influential people and
suggests painful days of reckoning lie ahead,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   The book spurred efforts to make reforms in water policy, and it
is still highly regarded. In an obituary of Reisner published
Monday, The San Francisco Chronicle called it ``an angry indictment
of water depletion in the American West'' and ``the seminal text on
the West's perennial water wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year ``Cadillac Desert'' was 61st on a list selected by a
panel from the Modern Library, a division of Random House, of the
100 best nonfiction books written in English during the 20th
century. It was a finalist for a National Book Critics' Circle
Award and was the basis of an award-winning four-and-a-half-hour
documentary film, also called ``Cadillac Desert,'' which was first
broadcast on PBS in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Reisner's book ``Game Wars: The Undercover Pursuit of Wildlife
Poachers'' (1991) was written after he followed the activities of
Dave Hall, an undercover agent for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, for years and combined the agent's stories with his own
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The book was praised in The Los Angeles Times Book Review, which
said: ``As in most books about the environment, there is a kind of
pall of doom floating over the text, but unlike most such essays,
this one has fights, busts _ in short, action. This time the good
guys strike back, and if the outcome of the war is in question, a
few battles are won here and there. This is a big attraction of the
book _ both for the reader and the agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Spieler said the rights to ``Game Wars'' had been bought by
Paramount Pictures, which is interested in adapting the book as a
feature film.
</P>
<P>
   Reisner's other works include ``Overtapped Oasis: Reform or
Revolution for Western Water'' (Island, 1989), which he wrote with
Sarah Bates, a lawyer. It is an analysis of water policy in the
West with recommendations for change.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, he was at work, as Spieler put it, ``on a book
about California and its history of, and inclination toward,
natural (and unnatural) disaster.'' Spieler said he, Reisner's wife
and Dan Frank, the editorial director at Pantheon, which was to
have published the book, would decide whether and how to proceed
with the manuscript, much of which Reisner had already written.
</P>
<P>
   Reisner contributed many articles to newspapers and other
periodicals. He also lectured widely on a variety of environmental
subjects in the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   He served as a consultant to the Pacific Coast Federation of
Fishermen's Associations in its efforts to secure the removal of
what environmental critics saw as outdated and only marginally
useful California dams, thereby making additional spawning areas
available to salmon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the PBS presentation of ``An American Nile,'' about the
Colorado River, won a Silver Baton for the filmmakers, Jon Else,
Sandra Itkoff and Reisner, at the annual Alfred I. duPont-Columbia
University Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Reisner was born in Minneapolis, grew up in several midwestern
cities and graduated in 1970 from Earlham College.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Lawrie Mott, whom he

KANSAS FORFEITS $2.6 MILLION EARMARKED FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY JOHN A. DVORAK, THE KANSAS CITY STAR   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As thousands of Kansas children go without health insurance, it
would seem the state could make good use of $2.6 million earmarked
by the federal government to fight the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But say goodbye to the money.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas could not spend it, so Kansas will lose it. Some of the
funds are, in effect, headed for Missouri to help the state budget
there.
</P>
<P>
   Slowness by the Kansas Legislature contributed to the snag.
</P>
<P>
   To forfeit $2.6 million is ``obviously a shame,'' said one
activist for children in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The predicament centers on the Children's Health Insurance
Program, which Congress passed three years ago to offer free or
reduced-price coverage for children whose families could not
otherwise obtain it.
</P>
<P>
   Each state operates a version of the program, and some of the
money comes from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas officials defend their program, saying they have achieved
considerable success despite leaving some of their money unspent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all wish we could have had all these children
covered and spent every last dime,'' said Bobbie Graff-Hendrixson,
who oversees the program as a senior manager at the Kansas
Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services, in Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she said, the program resulted in 39,000 children
receiving health-care protection in less than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done quite well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet thousands of children who could benefit do not. According to
U.S. Census Bureau estimates, as many as 20,000 Kansas children may
still lack insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had been able to find more children, we could have spent
more money,'' said Marcia Boswell-Carney, who monitors the
program's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what happened:
</P>
<P>
   States that did not get their programs running quickly enough,
or did not enroll enough children quickly enough, have federal
money left over from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   States that moved faster and enrolled lots of children promptly
spent all their money.
</P>
<P>
   Those states are slated to get a share of the leftover money,
according to the federal government. Missouri is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1998, when the children's insurance issue arose, Kansas
and Missouri took different approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates showed that 60,000 Kansas children lacked health
coverage, but the Kansas Legislature was not swift to act.
</P>
<P>
   Bureaucrats were unsure how to proceed. Different committees
conducted studies. Jousting over abortion affected the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature finally passed the necessary law.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri acted faster and developed its program differently than
Kansas did.
</P>
<P>
   By September 1998, Missouri was taking in children. Kansas did
not start until January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In all states the programs are aimed at the poor and at people
who work but do not have access to insurance through their jobs.
Income guidelines apply.
</P>
<P>
   Some states face a much bigger loss of funds than Kansas does.
Texas, which acted slowly on the children's insurance issue, is
slated to lose $450 million of federal money. Several states will
lose more than $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Melvin Neufeld, who helped set up the Kansas program,
said he was not upset about the loss of $2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what the Legislature believed was the correct thing to
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially the Legislature decided to set up a new program for
children's insurance. Missouri decided to operate through Medicaid,
an existing program to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Neufeld, who lives in southwestern Kansas, said some people
attached a stigma to Medicaid, considering it welfare and not
something they wished to use.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Neufeld acknowledged that if the Legislature had acted
faster, Kansas might have spent more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little slow getting going,'' said Gary Brunk,
executive director of Kansas Action for Children, a Topeka-based
activist group. ``It's obviously a shame that we need to return the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   But the state has been doing a good job signing up children, he
said. ``I'm pretty happy with how things have progressed,'' Brunk
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas tries to publicize its program widely. The state even
used billboards to inform families that insurance was available.
</P>
<P>
   People fail to join for a variety of reasons. They may not have
heard about the program, may not think they are eligible or may not
like to ask for government aid.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, 17,447 children are enrolled in the program. Missouri
has 64,250. In addition the Missouri program resulted in children
signing up for Medicaid who were not getting help before.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Vadner, who oversees children's insurance as director of
the Missouri Division of Medical Services, in Jefferson City, said
his state set out in 1998 to develop its program as rapidly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Additional funds from other states, he said, would go to offset
a tax that hospitals paid in Missouri to defray the cost of
children's insurance. Indirectly, he said, the money will help
hospitals provide indigent health care.
</P>
<P>
   How much Missouri might receive was not yet known.
</P>
<P>
   Vadner did not comment directly about the loss of money in his
neighboring state.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said: ``We certainly would be able to use that. It would
be a good thing for Missouri.''  &LR; tag1:To reach John A. Dvorak,
Kansas government and politics reporter, call (816) 234-7743 or

</P>
<P>
   Your family, depending on its income, may qualify for free or
reduced-price health coverage for children. Kansas and Missouri run
separate programs. Both operate somewhat like HMOs. Both cover
young people up to age 19. Monthly premiums may be charged.
Applying is not difficult. Missouri residents should call 1 (888)
275-5908. Kansas residents should call 1 (800) 792-4884.

COMIC BOOK HEROES DON'T ALWAYS SUCCEED ON-SCREEN   
</HEADLINE>
 
(Critic's Notebook)   By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his 1965 book, ``The Great Comic Book Heroes,'' which
features the best essay ever written on the subject, the cartoonist
Jules Feiffer described comics as ``movies on paper.'' Both art
forms exploit action and express character through movement. These
peculiarly American forms of juvenilia have probably forever
changed the fantasy lives of children, giving them the superpowers
to defeat the monsters in their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   In the preface to ``Justice League of America,'' a collection of
comic-book stories, Salman Rushdie reflects on how inspirational he
finds the adventures of these heroes. The touchingly faithful movie
adaptation of ``The X-Men,'' which leapt to a $54 million gross on
its opening weekend, proves that there's an appetite and an
audience for comic-hero movies. And its $23 million second weekend
ensured that more are to come; in the film business, nothing
succeeds like excess. The problem is that moviemakers take comics
too seriously, or not seriously enough.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasures that comics and movies provide are so similar that
it's criminal that so few films have managed to find the right
balance in adapting comic book superheroes to the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Though many movies have been inspired by comics in subtle ways,
some of the best action movies haven't been based on comics. ``The
Matrix,'' of course, is the finest example. It ingeniously steals
from so many sources _ Homer and the Bible, to name just two _ that
one couldn't find a docket big enough if charges were preferred.
</P>
<P>
   The film's writers and directors, the brothers Andy and Larry
Wachowski, used the pictorial vitality of comic books as the
movie's foundation. The action is orgiastic, as it often is in
comics, an energy that can't be contained. (The comic-book artist
Geof Darrow worked on ``Matrix'' 's'' visual scheme, and the
Wachowskis themselves have written comics.)
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Smith has unabashedly shown his love for comics in his
films; he even made the Marvel Comics mainstay Stan Lee the
onscreen voice of wisdom in ``Mallrats,'' a reason to forgive the
movie. Smith's ``Dogma,'' which ponders the vagaries of faith
within a ragtag group at various stages of belief, is a tribute to
Matt Wagner's comic ``Mage,'' which touches on the same issues but
with comic-book dynamism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mage'' is the Arthurian legend updated, in which Excalibur is
a baseball bat in contemporary Philadelphia. It is such a well-told
story that it is a natural for the movies, one that avoids the
dicey problem of costumes because none of the ``Mage'' characters
suit up for action in tights. Probably the reason ``Mage'' remains
unsullied by movie-industry hands is that Wagner isn't stupid; he's
seen the crummy treatment that film adaptations of comics have
received and has elected to save himself the humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Moviemakers look down on comics, fixating on their traditional
appeal to children instead of on the way the medium has matured in
the last 30 years. This sophistication has largely come from Marvel
Comics (birthplace of ``The X-Men'') and its creative powerhouses,
Lee and the artist-writer Jack Kirby. In the 1960s, they came up
with a black superhero _ the Black Panther, who was an African
prince and a totemic representation of his mythical country _ years
before Hollywood took its black audience seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who received the writing credits for most of the Marvel
superhero titles (the extent of his authorship has since been
called into question) got the connection between movies and comic
books years ago. During the 60s, he cunningly dropped the names of
the directors Alain Resnais and Federico Fellini into Stan Lee's
Soapbox, his pop-pop-pop self-promoting column that appeared in the
back of every Marvel comic. Lee wrote that these film artists made
a point of visiting Marvel's offices when they were in New York to
express their affection for what Marvel _ and Lee _ were doing for
the medium.
</P>
<P>
   The directors became as familiar to readers of ``The Uncanny
X-Men'' or ``The Amazing Spider-Man'' or ``The Incredible Hulk'' or
any of the other adjective-ridden Marvel superheroes as Marcello
Mastroianni was to Fellini aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   In responding to the often vapid print adventures of his
competitors, Lee was incredibly canny in the way he shaped
comic-book heroes and subverted the idiom. In the days when most
comic-book heroes had a sidekick or ward to function as a reader
surrogate _ apparently, adoption agencies in the Gotham City area
were quite lenient about allowing wealthy playboy bachelors to
adopt little boys _ Lee recognized that young readers didn't want
to stand next to the superheroes. They wanted to be the
superheroes.
</P>
<P>
   By exploiting this wish, Lee forged a strong rapport with his
readers; imagine that the teen-age protagonists in John Hughes
movies had superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Marvel heroes could catch a break, and the
grandiosity of their pain had a peppery bite. You can see why
Fellini would go for these stories, with their blend of fairy-tale
derring-do and proscenium-arch soap opera. Resnais, with his
silvered formality, got a kick out of the volatility of the art:
battles royal that sprawled all over the page and captured readers
with their surreal sensationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Lee, loyal Marvel fans like me, kids for the most
part, were exposed to film directors who accomplished, in their
way, what Marvel had managed for comics: they changed the
parameters of what was often considered a throwaway medium.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since Fellini and Resnais reached out to Lee to
express their admiration, movie adaptations of comic book heroes
have practiced a reverse alchemy. The evidence is that dusty aisle
in your local Blockbuster, with forgotten videos like ``Swamp
Thing,'' ``Spawn'' and ``Captain America.''
</P>
<P>
   For every ``Blade,'' which was very smart about the parts of the
comic book worth preserving and the ones that needed to be thrown
out, or ``Men in Black,'' which took a little-known comic book as a
point of departure, there was a ``Spawn,'' which was overblown and
inert. Or a ``Batman Forever'' and a ``Batman and Robin,'' which
seemed determined to return Batman to the triviality to which the
campy 60s television series had consigned him.

</P>
<P>
   You can work comics fans into a sweat on the coldest day of the
year by bringing up that incarnation of Batman. It's the series in
which Adam West slipped into a pair of tights that did nothing for
his figure, used that stop-and-start cadence that was often the
province of 60s television stars (did he and William Shatner take
the same correspondence course?) and engaged in playground versions
of fistfights with actors who were as out of shape as he was. Cesar
Romero, as the Joker, had so much contempt for his character that
he didn't even bother to shave his upper lip. With all that white
makeup covering his mustache, he looked like the inventor of the
``Got Milk?'' advertising campaign.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM HERE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Dark Knight was an object of ridicule long before that
60s series, with its Pop Art ``Pow!'' and ``Biff!'' In ``The Great
Comic Book Heroes,'' Feiffer dismissed him by noting, ``Batman had
to take off his rich idler's street clothes, put on his Batshirt,
his Batshorts, his Battights, his Batboots; buckle on his Batbelt
full of secret potions and chemical explosives; tie on his Batcape;
slip on his Batmask; climb into his Batmobile and go fight the
Joker who in one punch (defensively described by the author as
maniacal), would knock him silly.''
</P>
<P>
   It took the 1989 ``Batman'' movie by the director Tim Burton to
wash the bad taste out of the mouths of fans and prove that anyone
with an understanding of comics and film could get a comics movie
right.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Keaton, whose casting sent fans scurrying to write
letters of disapproval (they seemed incapable of grasping the
concept of acting range) gave an intense, subtle performance of the
type rarely seen in big-budget action spectaculars. His Bruce
Wayne, Batman's alter ego, was almost swallowed whole by anguish.
Burton's gift for art direction _ his animation background gave him
the visual instincts of a comic-book artist _ soothed the pain for
comics cognoscenti and gave Batman entry into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Batman'' was still deeply flawed _ its longueurs may
show too much of a Resnais influence _ it got all the surface
details right; Batman's devices seemed to have come from an Eastern
European Sony store. Keaton's heat gave the film's midnight-blue
coldness a volcanic center, and the movie's box-office assault sent
producers into comics stores looking for more champions of Truth,
Justice and the American Way.
</P>
<P>
   If Batman could be salvaged in the movies, as Superman was years
before, then anything was possible.
</P>
<P>
   What makes comic-book superheroes ideal material for commercial
movies may be the unbridled optimism of most of the classic
characters. The sunny disposition of Superman and Christopher
Reeves' adroit comedic performance in the movies epitomize why
comic books and movies are often called particularly American. When
they work, they belong together.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled lives of comic-book characters that Lee opened up
drifted into nihilism, which is now an intrinsic part of comics.
That grimness is best depicted by British writers, and a couple of
their dank British characters _ Judge Dredd and Tank Girl _
surfaced in motion-picture adaptations and sank quickly. They were
crushed by the films' obviousness: the producers thought that
audiences would understand the movies only if the characters were
oversimplified. That's the problem in making a movie about
characters who aren't as well-known as Superman or Batman. It's
thought that the characters have to be explained, instead of just
letting them define themselves through their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Moore, who is the most dazzlingly gifted writer in this
subculture, created the comics title ``The Watchmen,'' an
apocalyptic turn on superheroes that attracted directors like Terry
Gilliam. Budget considerations brought the project down; apparently
it would have cost almost as much to end the world on a movie set
as it would in real life. Another Moore concept that would have
been much cheaper to realize on screen, and is far more
interesting, is ``Miracleman.'' Essentially, it is Superman as a
horror story. And Moore even had the good sense to ridicule the
Miracleman's flamboyant costume.
</P>
<P>
   The ``X-Men'' comics, too, eventually veered toward gloom _ and
this aspect is the least interesting one of the ``X-Men'' movie _
though most of the heartstring plucking was closer to ``Days of Our
Lives'' than ``Triumph of the Will.'' Still, the ``X-Men'' movie
works harder than any other comics-hero film to lay out the
filigree that comics fans love. There has never been as much
material lifted straight from the comics and put in a picture as in
that movie, and fans are delirious because of it.
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``X-Men'' in movie theaters will pave the way for
another wave of superhero films. Other Marvel characters, whose
cheeks are tear-stained beneath their masks, will soon make their
way into theaters. A second ``Blade,'' to be directed by Guillermo
del Toro (``Kronos'') is being readied by the writer David Goyer,
who also wrote the script for the first movie. And, finally, after
years of flirtation with filmmakers like James Cameron and a
rights-ownership battle straight out of ``The Producers'' _
hundreds of people seemed to own 50 percent of the property _ ``The
Amazing Spider-Man'' is not far from production.
</P>
<P>
   Spidey was Marvel's most popular character before the X-Men
eclipsed him, and still defines the medium for most readers.
There's even talk of defibrillating the moribund Batman franchise
for the movies, with Darren Aronofsky (``pi'' and the forthcoming
``Requiem for a Dream'') behind the camera.
</P>
<P>
   In the Spider-Man comics, when the hero approaches a crisis
point _ which is more often than the A train does _ he has to
remind himself that with great power comes great responsibility.
These might be watchwords for the film industry with an eye on
comics as well, minding the slippery slope between inspiration and
slavish devotion. &QL;

LACK OF POLITICAL INTEREST BY YOUNG PEOPLE BOTH EXASPERATES,
FRIGHTENS  
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY STEVE KRASKE, THE KANSAS CITY STAR   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Steve Majors has seen the statistics. He's
heard the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   His generation does not care about politics. It doesn't care
about government or community affairs or helping neighbors. Voting?
You've got to be kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Majors, 20, doesn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become too complacent,'' Majors says, taking dead aim at
his peer group of 18- to 21-year-olds, 14 million of whom will be
eligible to vote for president for the first time in November. ``We
haven't faced a crisis. We haven't looked death in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has to give,'' he says. ``Or something needs to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Majors, a 1998 graduate of Kearney High School, certainly is not
complacent. This week he flies to Philadelphia, where he will take
his place as one of Missouri's 35 delegates to the Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   There he will rank as one of the three or four youngest of the
2,066 GOP delegates. But while getting involved comes as naturally
to Majors as taking a shower, most young people remain wholly
disengaged.
</P>
<P>
   Some statistics:
</P>
<P>
   - In 1972 half of all 18- to 24-year-olds voted. In 1996 only a
third did. In 1998 the total dropped to fewer than one in five,
perhaps the lowest in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   - Even with changes that have made voter registration easier,
only 49 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds were even registered to vote
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   - Being involved in democracy and voting is ``extremely
important'' to only 26 percent of young people, according to one
1999 survey.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys also show that voters between 18 and 24 are surprisingly
conservative in their political outlook. A poll released Monday
showed that young people preferred Texas Gov. George W. Bush over
Vice President Al Gore by 44 percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is heartening to Majors, and he is confident that Bush will
inspire some of his contemporaries to get involved. But it may not
be that simple.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Secretaries of State and other
groups have studied youth attitudes toward voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people today lack interest, trust and knowledge about
American politics, politicians and public life generally,'' noted a
nationwide survey the association released last year. ``In these
and other respects, the future for American democracy seems gloomy
indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey concluded that young people suffer an ``information
and skill deficit'' about the process of voting and of what it
means to be a citizen in a democratic society. The United States,
the report said, is in danger of becoming a divided nation of
voters and nonvoters.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation is coming on the scene that has never voted
before and has never seen its parents vote. That could lead to even
more desultory vote totals in years to come, said Kansas Secretary
of State Ron Thornburgh, who has overseen much of association's
young-voter project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very likely that voter turnout will plummet to 20
(percent) to 30 percent in the next two decades,'' he said. That
could pose hazards, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a 20 percent turnout, it becomes very easy for fringe
elements to control elections,'' Thornburgh said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall turnout has been dropping as well. In 1960, for example,
63 percent of the voting-age population cast ballots for president.
In 1996 49.1 percent did.
</P>
<P>
   The association study, however, also found reasons for hope. Six
in 10 respondents in its poll said government should help families
achieve the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   Still others noted that voluntarism rates had soared among young
people, though many of the most popular volunteer activities did
not involve politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is here that one sees the possibility of democratic
renewal,'' the association report said.
</P>
<P>
   But work still must be done on finding ways to reconnect young
voters to public life. One idea: Get candidates to focus more on
issues that concern younger people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one universal thing I got out of kids during nine days on
the road, and I heard it over and over again, is young people said
they weren't being listened to,'' said Erica Terry, a member of
MTV's Choose or Lose team that traversed the country this year
talking to young people. On Sunday, MTV will broadcast ``Choose or
Lose: Why Care?'' focusing on the youth vote.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of voters tune out when a candidate shows up on campus and
talks about school vouchers or improving elementary education,
Terry said. They would rather hear their needs addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids need money for school, to pay off their loans,'' she
said. ``Those are the things politicians should come to my town and
talk about. Not about whether grandma should get her prescription
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Another impediment, noted Karenna Gore Schiff, daughter of the
vice president, is the political system itself. Writing in
Newsweek, the 26-year-old Schiff said her contemporaries hesitated
to get involved because many assumed that the system was rigged in
favor of well-financed special interests.
</P>
<P>
   That, and the difficulty in obtaining objective information
about candidates, ``push us to take refuge in ironic detachment,''
she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political leaders should understand young people's
nonparticipation as a strong message in itself: The system needs to
be cleansed of special-interest money and made more accessible to
the grass roots of young America,'' Schiff said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though, candidates are not likely to focus on
young voters when their turnout remains so abysmal. Their attention
naturally drifts toward the 67 percent of Americans older than 65
who vote.
</P>
<P>
   At MTV, Terry said young people had to take the first step.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do a better job of hammering home this point: If
you don't vote, the politicians are not going to pay attention,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Majors, a junior at Truman State University in Kirksville,
his decision to get involved was instinctive. Although his parents
are not active politically, Majors was drawn into public affairs
because of his interest in how institutions work.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative, he worked for Republican presidential candidate
Alan Keyes earlier this year. Why didn't he back Bush then?

   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia _ The dream of a
Marxist-Leninist revolution remains improbably alive amid the
rolling cattle pastures and steamy coca fields of southern
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrillas in crisp, starched fatigues wear Che Guevara buttons,
strum old leftist jeremiads on guitars and pledge to bring Yankee
imperialism down to defeat once and for all. Three portraits of
Lenin grace the press office of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, in this boisterous small ranching town,
including one of the founder of the Soviet Union petting a kitten.
The pitted roads that run through the countryside are spruced with
signs that read ``No more torture'' and ``No More Gringo Military
Advisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Marxist guerrillas in nearby Central America laid down their
arms years ago, and those in neighboring Peru have been nearly
annihilated. As former guerrillas serve in the parliaments of
Venezuela, Bolivia and Uruguay and a Socialist serves as president
of Chile, the left has remodeled itself as a moderate, democratic
force throughout South America.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Colombia, Marxist guerrillas are fighting back
history, pushing around an established army, battling a right-wing
paramilitary force and prompting the United States to adopt a
growing military role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't read the book, but I have seen the movie, and we are
like the last of the Mohicans'' said Comandante Alfonso Cano, a
52-year-old member of the seven-man secretariat than rules the
FARC, the largest and oldest of several guerrilla groups still
operating in Colombia. ``There is a theory that socialism is dead
and history ends with capitalism. But have the people's problems
ended? No. With globalization, there's more poverty than ever, and
a crisis is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   A string of rebel military victories forced the Colombian
government in 1998 to give the guerrillas a demilitarized zone the
size of Switzerland as an enticement to negotiate, and the
guerrillas are using the zone to show what they can do even as they
stall at the talks.
</P>
<P>
   In what is dubbed ``Farclandia'' by some locals, the guerrillas
jawbone merchants to keep down prices of fuel and basic foods,
press workers to repair local roads and bridges, and mediate family
and property disputes in small claims courts they have organized
under military tents. They decree strict controls on guns and dry
laws to stop drinking late at night, and counsel prostitutes,
juvenile delinquents and husbands who abuse their wives.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the guerrilla territory are open to travelers and news
reporters and serviced by a commercial airline owned by the
Colombian air force. Over a weekend visit to this ranching town and
Los Pozos, which was not arranged with the FARC, the guerrillas
were in a carnival-like mood as they sponsored a youth conference
complete with clown acts and acrobatics.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas might seem quaint if it were not for their
efficiency at making war and dealing with cocaine traffickers.
Numbering more than 15,000 rebels, they have satellite phones that
give them a communications edge over the armed forces. They are
wily at wiretapping and cloning cellular phones, enabling them to
anticipate the government's moves. They even use computers at
roadblocks to check the bank accounts of drivers, allowing them to
pick out the richest for kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights and church groups accuse them of forcibly
recruiting young teenagers, kidnapping children as young as 4 and
executing suspected right-wing paramilitaries after secret trials.
</P>
<P>
   According to recent national polls, the guerrillas have the
support of less than 5 percent of the population and virtually no
support outside a few universities and coca-growing areas. But with
coca fields growing in their zones as bountifully as corn in
Kansas, they are surrounded by a lucrative cash crop. By their own
admission, the guerrillas ``tax'' traffickers and protect coca
growers from campaigns to eradicate the crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's logical that the revolutionary army has to finance
itself,'' said Comandante Mariana Paez, 37, who is a middle-level
commander. ``These coca growers are poor farmers, and the
traffickers exploit them. So the traffickers need to be taxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the winds of change blowing around the world, the
FARC's platform remains largely the same as when it broke from the
Colombian Communist Party to make war on the state in 1964, with
the group still demanding a radical redistribution of land and
wealth and a foreign policy that is independent of Yankee
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Socialists around the world supported perestroika, but we knew
better and criticized it,'' said Paez. Several young guerrilla
fighters, apparently parroting political lessons learned in their
daily indoctrination sessions, condemned Mikhail Gorbachev as an
undercover U.S. intelligence agent who single-handedly sabotaged
the entire Soviet bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The young rebels, many of them poor peasants who worked in the
coca fields before fumigation campaigns destroyed their livelihood,
admit that they know little of Marxist philosophy. But they praised
the guerrilla group for providing them with fresh clothes, good
food, free birth control, jewelry and self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   After the CIA, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the
Colombian police captured the top leadership of the Cali drug
cartel in the mid-1990s, smaller trafficking organizations took its
place and moved into the guerrilla group's zones for protection,
according to American and Colombian military and law enforcement
officials. The Colombian government estimates that the the
guerrilla group now earns more than $400 million a year as an
acolyte of the drug trade, even while it does not itself traffic in
narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial photographs of the region indicate that coca fields have
expanded and clandestine airstrips have multiplied since the rebels
were granted control of the area.
</P>
<P>
   With the FARC and a couple of small rebel groups now loosely
controlling 40 percent of Colombia's rugged territory, and coca
cultivation mushrooming, the Clinton administration persuaded
Congress last month to pass a $1.3 billion aid package for the
Colombian armed forces. Most of the aid will go to outfitting a new
anti-narcotics brigade with 60 attack helicopters, training and
intelligence tools to operate in the southern provinces of Putumayo
and Caqueta, a remote but extensive FARC stronghold and now the
center of the country's coca cultivation.

</P>
<P>
   In several interviews last week at their headquarters in nearby
Los Pozos, guerrilla commanders said they would continue to protect
coca growers from the coming ``invasion'' even as they spread the
war to other regions. ``The FARC is not going to stop fighting,''
said Comandante Raul Reyes, a 50-year-old member of the group's
secretariat and main rebel negotiator at the talks with the
government. ``We don't have to live in the jungle. We are growing
in the population centers like Bogota, Medellin and Barranquilla.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the rebels speak boldly of future victories, the people
who live in their zone of control grumble and express fears of
trigger-happy guerrillas at road checkpoints as well as of the
knock at the door at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are cannon fodder to them,'' said Guillermo Lombano
Gutierrez, a 46-year-old rancher who lives here. Lombano said he
watched four guerrillas come to his door on April 16, 1999, and
take away his 16-year-old son at gunpoint, accusing him of being a
paramilitary. Breaking down in tears, Lombano said the accusation
was a lie. He said he had been writing letters to guerrilla
commanders to find his son, and had not received a reply. ``They
care nothing for us as people,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The local office of the congressionally appointed ombudsman has
documented 41 disappearances at the hands of the guerrillas in the
demilitarized zone since its creation a little more than two years
ago. ``But we don't know all the cases,'' said Alvaro Castel, the
local office director, ``because people are afraid to denounce.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, local Roman Catholic Church workers have documented
15 cases of child recruitment by the guerrillas in the
demilitarized zone, including one involving a 13-year-old girl who
was allegedly used for sex by a comandante before a nun persuaded
the rebels to release her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a lot of rule of law,'' Joanne Mariner, a deputy
director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch, said of
the guerrilla-controlled zone. ``We have documented four
disappearances and saw no evidence in any of the cases that the
people had ties to the paramilitaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the disappearances and forced child recruitment,
Reyes snapped, ``Is this an interview or an investigation?'' Then
he said human rights groups that charged the guerrillas with such
crimes were ``misinformed by black propaganda.''

MARKETPLACE: BEAR STEARNS RALLIES AMID TAKEOVER TALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to adjust share figures in 4th graf.)  
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Let the bidding begin for the last free-standing
properties on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of UBS AG's agreement this month to buy the
PaineWebber Group for $12 billion, executives of the few remaining
independent financial-services firms are worrying about being left
alone at the dance. Monday, shares of Bear Stearns Cos. leaped 7.7
percent, to their highest level in almost two years, on an
analyst's report that the firm might be for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns officials have not publicly announced an interest
in selling the firm, and the analyst's report, which was published
Monday, said no deal appeared to be imminent. Neither James Cayne,
the firm's chief executive, nor the author of the report, Guy
Moszkowski, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, responded to phone
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some traders and investors bought shares on the hope that
the management of Bear Stearns would be willing to listen to
offers. The firm's shares rose $3.6875, to $50, on the New York
Stock Exchange. More than 3 million shares changed hands, about
five times normal daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that it's a very cheap stock apart from whether
there's a deal or not,'' said Larry Sondike, a portfolio manager
with the Mutual Series funds in Short Hills, N.J. ``We think we're
getting the possibility of consolidation for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Sondike would not say whether the Mutual Series funds, formerly
run by the activist investor Michael Price, had put any pressure on
Bear Stearns management to improve returns on the firm's lagging
stock. ``I trust that Bear Stearns management and board will do
what's right for all Bear Stearns shareholders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the report that lighted the fire under shares of Bear Stearns
on Monday, Moszkowski broached the subject of a buyout, saying that
Cayne seemed more receptive than ever to the idea. But he added
that Cayne had thrown out a minimum purchase price of four times
the firm's book value, the value of its assets minus liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   That amounts to about $120 a share, or about $19 billion, for a
firm whose stock had not traded above $50 in almost two years. UBS
snapped up PaineWebber for 3.5 times book value, and some boutique
investment banks have sold for steeper prices.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts said they doubted Bear Stearns would command a
premium like those even from a foreign bank seeking an instant
presence on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on the outside looking in and want to gain an
investment-banking footprint, it gets you into the game but you're
still a notch below'' the biggest investment banks like Goldman
Sachs Group, said Dean Eberling, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP;
Woods. ``Four times book is unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the wave of mergers and buyouts that has swept the
securities industry over the last several years, Bear Stearns has
been viewed as an iconoclastic holdout. A midsize investment bank,
it makes a lot of money in some businesses that other Wall Street
firms shun. Most notable among them is the clearing, or processing,
of trades for other, usually smaller, brokerage firms and hedge
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing is perennially profitable for Bear Stearns, which has
one of the biggest clearing operations, but it has taken on more
risk in recent years as regulators have sought to hold firms like
Bear Stearns responsible for the actions of the small brokerage
firms that make up their clearing clientele. Processing trades is
also much less alluring than the high-fee investment banking
practices of underwriting stocks of new companies and advising
corporations on mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Cayne ``believes strongly that the
firm's biggest problem is its image.'' It alluded to the firm's
role as clearing broker for A.R. Baron, a defunct brokerage firm
that prosecutors charged with bilking investors, and a recent court
order that the firm pay $111 million to a former customer.
</P>
<P>
   After that judgment reduced Bear Stearns' second-quarter
earnings by $96 million, Eberling lowered his rating on the firm's
stock from ``buy'' to ``market outperform.'' Eberling said he was
troubled by the firm's plan to spend heavily to build its
investment-banking operation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Moszkowski, in contrast, rates Bear Stearns a ``buy'' and says
he expects its price to rise to $60 within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth far, far more than $50 a share,'' said Sondike, who
manages the Mutual Shares fund and co-manages the Mutual Beacon
fund. Together those funds own about 4 million shares, or about 1
percent of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bear tends to really not get any respect,'' Sondike said.
``People erroneously tend to think it's a trading shop taking a lot
of risk. These are smart, risk-averse, profit-seeking people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was also attracted by the high level of inside
ownership of the firm. Cayne, he noted, owns about 4 million
shares. Monday, the value of those shares rose nearly $15 million.

AS MOVIE EXHIBITORS PUSH TOWARD AN UNCERTAIN ENDING, AMC IS
CONFIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- AMC -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY JENNIFER MANN, THE KANSAS CITY STAR   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wall Street has written a hold-your-breath cliff-hanger for the
movie exhibition business that, unlike many movies, isn't neatly
tied up in a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   Penciled into the plot is the dreaded word ``bankruptcy.'' And
no one knows for sure who's going to be left standing when the
credits roll.
</P>
<P>
   One movie exhibition firm, United Artists Theater Circuit Inc.,
which defaulted on a loan payment in April, is teetering on the
edge of the cliff and is expected to plunge into Chapter 11
bankruptcy any day.
</P>
<P>
   The question then becomes: Is there someone who comes after
United Artists? And if so, who is most likely to be next into the
bankruptcy chute?
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kuzio, fixed-income analyst for KDP Investments, said that
based on a ranking system his firm uses, Kansas City-based AMC
Entertainment Inc. has a 25 percent likelihood of defaulting on its
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Kuzio likened the exhibition industry to the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't make any money if you're flying around with empty
seats,'' Kuzio said. ``And in exhibition, there's too many seats
and not enough people to fill them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Brown, chairman of AMC, is scripting a different
ending for his company _ and it's a happy one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of dials that are flashing `warning' right now
on Wall Street,'' Brown said. ``I think we're all getting painted
by the same brush ... but we have a whole different situation than
many others.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition industry knows it has too many movie screens. The
rule of thumb is one screen per 10,000 people, so there should be
about 28,000 movie screens in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the screen count is somewhere between 35,000 and 38,000
screens, translating into a 25 percent to 37 percent capacity glut.
</P>
<P>
   Blame for the overbuilding, some say, belongs to Stan Durwood,
the longtime chairman of AMC who died a year ago. Durwood
revolutionized the industry when he pioneered the multiplex _ the
modern movie theater complex.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, Durwood had opened a megaplex, the Grand 24 in Dallas,
a movie house with 24 screens. As the Grand 24 drew droves of
moviegoers, competitors took notice.
</P>
<P>
   Soon everyone with a stash of cash or a credit line was jumping
on the megaplex bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Now the biggest players in the industry, including AMC, are
sagging under the glut of smaller theaters rendered obsolete by the
megaplexes. They're also trying to stay in the pack of those
building the mammoth movie houses. And building megaplexes and
taking outdated theaters out of commission are both costly.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, most exhibitors are losing money. For
instance, in the fiscal year that ended March 30, AMC lost $55.2
million, compared with a loss of $16 million the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The four largest exhibitors in the United States _ Regal, Loews
Cineplex Entertainment Corp., Carmike Cinemas Inc. and AMC _ as a
group lost $340 million in their most recent fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the huge losses, analysts on Wall Street have sharply
downgraded their debt ratings for almost every big exhibitor. The
only exception is Cinemark, and it is up for review soon with, in
the analysts' terminology, ``negative implications.''
</P>
<P>
   On just one day last month, Russell Solomon of Moody's Investors
Service axed ratings on $4.425 billion in debt held by the big four
exhibitors. Those cuts pushed everyone's debt deeper into the junk
bond pile.
</P>
<P>
   And just last week, AMC reported it had lost $13 million for the
quarter that ended June 30. Adjusted earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization _ a number that analysts study
to determine whether an exhibitor has enough money to service its
debt _ fell to $24.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Brown blames the bad showing on the last three weeks of June,
when film product petered out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just pure wind shear, those last three weeks,'' Brown
said. ``Until then, we were in the game in terms of making our
projections.''
</P>
<P>
   So what could happen once a film exhibition company files for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization?
