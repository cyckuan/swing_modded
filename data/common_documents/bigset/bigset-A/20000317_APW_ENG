   DE SOTO, Kan. (AP) -- It's a cold and damp Friday at Steve's Meat
Market, with temperatures nowhere near the sultry climes of
Abdirashid Sharif's native Somalia. But in his new U.S. home, this
Somali war refugee has discovered the familiar in rural Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   At an open-air market out back, Sharif and fellow Muslims buy
sheep, goats and cows then slaughter the animals themselves in
accordance with Islamic law. Muslims can eat only meat that is
halal, or lawfully slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   One day a week, as it has for at least 15 years, the small-town
Kansas butcher shop and slaughterhouse draws many Muslims,
transplanted to the Midwest from throughout the world. It's one of
a relative handful of such places serving an estimated 10 million
Muslims in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter or ''sacrifice'' is accomplished by a slash to a
restrained animal's throat following a prayer, and is permitted by
a religious exemption to U.S. Department of Agriculture rules.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, the USDA requires that the animal first be knocked
out with a stun gun. Muslims, who view the animal as a gift from
God, consider their method more humane.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're very religious people,'' said Dick Dabbs, a butcher at
Steve's Meat Market who sharpens the knife before each kill, and
then hoses the bloodied floor. ''The animal has got to be killed on
the first slash or they won't eat it. Once that vein is sliced,
that animal is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Such slaughters go on all year, but demand increases in the days
leading up to Eid al-Adha, the Celebration of the Sacrifice, which
this year fell on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Eid al-Adha marks the end of hajj, the pilgrimage Muslims make
to the Grand Mosque in the Saudi Arabian city of Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   During the feast, observed by an estimated 1 billion Muslims
worldwide, believers slaughter sheep, goats, cows or camels to
commemorate the prophet Ibrahim's readiness to offer his son's life
to Allah, or God. For his obedience, Ibrahim was given a sheep to
sacrifice instead.
</P>
<P>
   Steve's and Star Packing Co. in the old ''butcher town'' section
of St. Louis do a brisk business in goats, lambs and cows. Both got
started in halal slaughter when approached by Muslims, whose
numbers are growing in the region. Some 15,000 Muslims live in the
Kansas City metro area and up to 40,000 around St. Louis, according
to estimates of the Islamic Society.
</P>
<P>
   The largest U.S. centers of Muslims are Chicago, Detroit, Los
Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get Bosnians, Somalis, Pakistanis, Iraqis, Serbs,
Croatians. We're the United Nations,'' said Anthea Richmond of Star
Packing. She said her husband's uncle began providing halal
slaughter for Muslims in St. Louis 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely how many slaughterhouses provide similar services
around the nation is not known. Of 1,170 federally inspected
establishments, fewer than 10 are halal, USDA spokeswoman Beth
Gaston said. But that does not include the plants USDA inspects for
cleanliness but not for slaughter; that applies to cases where meat
is slaughtered for personal use but not for resale in specialty
markets.
</P>
<P>
   At Steve's Meat Market, the meat is processed, cut and bagged at
lightning speed. Co-owner Mitch Prudden said his Muslim customers
prefer to take it home very fresh in small chunks for stew meat.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Morgan, an Oak Grove, Mo., livestock dealer who sells live
animals behind Steve's, points to a Muslim woman loading a garbage
bag of meat into her minivan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It moves from hoof to baggie in one hour,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Muslim tradition, the meat is divided among family, friends,
neighbors and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic humanitarian relief organizations, such as the Islamic
African Relief Agency USA in Columbia, Mo., encourage believers to
parcel some of their ''sacrifice'' to the needy by contributing
toward the purchase of animals for use in Kashmir, Chechnya, Turkey
and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   When his turn came at Steve's, Abdirashid Sharif made quick work
of it, saying a prayer and then lowering the knife. For some who
followed him, the job was a grim necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like doing this,'' said Hassan Osman, another Somali,
whose grimace revealed his discomfort. ''But if you are Muslim, and
you buy a goat, you have to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   At Star Packing in St. Louis, Muslims with weak stomachs have a
way out. Every Thursday, Mohammed Waheed-uz-zaman Rana, a Saint
Louis University anatomy and neurobiology professor, conducts the
ritual slaughter for fellow Muslims in that city. Rana, from
Pakistan, figures he has killed thousands of animals over the last
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, begins with prayer: ''Oh God Almighty, this (animal) is
yours and I'm taking something from it. I ask permission of the
Creator to take this animal for us.''

US To Offer Ease on Luxury Imports
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a move to encourage reformists in Iran, the Clinton
administration is ready to announce a lifting of a ban on imports of luxury
goods and to offer a settlement of claims with Tehran, a senior U.S. official
said Thursday. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will make the offer in a
major policy speech here Friday to the American-Iranian Council, a private group
based in Princeton, N.J., that seeks better relations with Tehran. The partial
easing of sanctions and the offer to discuss claims each nation has against the
other will be coupled with a renewed proposal for formal talks, said the
official, who declined to be identified.

Vt. House OKs Gay 'Civil Unions'

   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- The Vermont House approved Thursday a bill to allow
gays to form ''civil unions.'' If the bill becomes law, the state will have gone
further than any other in recognizing same-sex couples. Vermont's Senate is
expected to approve the bill by the end of next month. However, the federal
government still would not recognize such unions with regard to such things as
immigration rights, Social Security and federal taxes.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials rocketed 499.19 points Thursday in a
record-shattering rally as investors poured money into blue chips that had been
battered by Wall Street's frenzy for technology stocks. The Dow Jones industrial
average closed at 10,630.60. The 4.9 percent rise was not the best-ever daily
percentage gain. The technology-laden Nasdaq ended up 134.77 at 4,717.39, having

Clinton Burdened By Ireland Impasse

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton appealed to leaders in the Northern
Ireland peace process Thursday to put aside their differences and work to
restore the British province's independent government. Clinton addressed the
annual dinner of the American Ireland Fund, attended by David Trimble, leader of
the pro-British Ulster Unionists party, and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, whose
party is allied with the Irish Republican Army. Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson suspended the province's nascent coalition government
last month because the IRA refused to give up its weapons. On Thursday,
Mandelson urged both sides to use their visit to Washington to restart the
process.

McCain: Bush Team Disrespectful

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain's supporters are accusing George W. Bush of
showing little respect for the senator and his political reform agenda, saying
''macho talk'' has killed hopes for an early endorsement that could be vital to
Bush's prospects in November's general election. In an interview with The New
York Times, Bush said he had no intentions of making concessions to McCain on
campaign finance reform. But the Texan and his advisers scrambled Thursday to
explain the remarks, fearing the fallout could further alienate McCain and his
independent-minded supporters.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray said Thursday he found no
credible evidence that first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton or senior White House
officials were involved in seeking the FBI background files on Republicans. Ray
said his office was ending the investigation with no prosecutions. The White
House has said the gathering of files was a bureaucratic blunder based on
outdated Secret Service lists of White House entry passholders.

   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- An appeal by the Exxon Corp. on the $5 billion

9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the verdict should not be thrown out because
of irregularities during jury deliberations. The appeal of the punitive damages
verdict was one of several filed by Exxon and co-defendant Joseph Hazelwood, who

<HEADLINE> Predators 2, Avalanche 2  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Ray Bourque scored his 399th career goal -- most by
an NHL defenseman -- and the Colorado Avalanche and Nashville
Predators skated to a 2-2 tie Thursday night, snapping Colorado's
six-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Patrick Roy made 17 saves and remained at 439 career
wins, eight short of Terry Sawchuk's NHL record.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque made it 1-1 late in the second period with his fourth
power-play goal for Colorado since joining the team 10 days ago in
a trade with the Boston Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Shjon Podein scored his 10th goal at 2:07 of the third period,
taking a pass from Martin Skoula in the slot and beating
Nashville's Mike Dunham, who had 34 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastien Bordeleau tied it with a shot from the slot at 17:52.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville's David Legwand scored the only goal in a first period
that saw both teams skate tentatively and create few scoring
chances, with Nashville holding a 4-3 edge in shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   At 15:03, Cliff Ronning sent a long pass into the boards to the
left of the goal. The puck ricocheted past Roy, who had left the
crease to chase it, and it angled to Legwand in the right circle,
who beat Roy before he could scramble back into position.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque tied it with his 14th goal, a power play at 17:30 of the
second period. The Avalanche stepped up their pressure on Dunham in
the period, outshooting the Predators 11-2 early in the period.
Bourque scored from just inside the blue line after taking a pass
from Joe Sakic.
</P>
<P>
   Bordeleau hit the post on a breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado had eight shots on overtime, but Dunham made several
acrobatic saves, including two off Peter Forsberg.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic extended his points streak to eight games.

<HEADLINE> Arizona 71, Jackson St. 47  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Arizona was ripe to become the NCAA
tournament's first top-seeded team to lose in the first round.
Jackson State wasn't quite the program to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wright had 19 points and 13 rebounds, Gilbert Arenas
scored 16 points, and Richard Jefferson added 14 as the Wildcats
beat Jackson State 71-47 on Thursday night in the West Regional.
</P>
<P>
   With injured 7-foot-1 center Loren Woods dressed in a red
T-shirt and a shell necklace as he cheered from the bench, the
Wildcats (27-6) were down to seven scholarship players for their
NCAA run.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed remotely possible the Tigers (17-16) could win.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona led 28-20 at halftime after shooting 30 percent
(8-of-26), and it might have been closer if not for Jackson State's
11 turnovers and 29 percent (8-of-27) shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were really tight,'' Arizona coach Lute Olson said. ''We
played like the three freshmen we had on the court. That was one of
the things we said at halftime. You've just got to loosen up and
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson was happy to move on to the second round, where the
Wildcats will face Wisconsin. The Wildcats, who were outrebounded
44-43, insisted they weren't thinking before tipoff it would be
easy to dispatch the 16th-seeded Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jackson State was very competitive,'' Jefferson said. ''They
went out there and worked their butts off. They shouldn't have been
intimidated by us.''
</P>
<P>
   They weren't. But eventually, Arizona wore them down.
</P>
<P>
   Arenas made 3-pointers on consecutive possessions midway through
the second half and Jefferson added another as the Wildcats buried
gritty but unpolished Jackson State with an 11-2 run.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just trying to hit big shots and come out with a lot of
electricity and get out team hyped up,'' Arenas said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona finished it by outscoring the Tigers 26-10 and holding
Jackson State to three field goals in the last 10:48.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did a good job defensively the whole game,'' Olson said.
''Offensively, we had a lot to straighten out at halftime. In the
second half, we were much more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Jones, a lanky 6-10 center, was a defensive presence,
altering shots and disrupting Arizona fast breaks. He also was
Jackson State's only consistent offensive threat, scoring 12
points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We outrebounded them, but they just hit more shots,'' Jones
said. ''We played as hard as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino Walker added 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers made a serious run in the second half, cutting into a
45-29 deficit by scoring eight straight points. When Walker's
jumper went through the net with 11:38 to play, it was 45-37 and
the Tigers were pumping their fists.
</P>
<P>
   They were too excited, it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson State left the Wildcats open on the perimeter, and
Arenas punished them by making his consecutive 3-pointers to push
the lead back to 51-37 with 10:13 on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a physical standpoint, we played even with them,''
Jackson State coach Andy Stoglin said. ''But we don't have the
shooters they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers' upset dreams faded when they went the next six
minutes without a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fans in Salt Lake had fun embracing Jackson State,
which finished fourth in the Southwestern Athletic Conference
during the regular season but reached the NCAAs by winning the
league's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson State's band and cheerleaders even drew big cheers when
they arrived with 7:42 remaining before halftime. It turned out the
bus driver was late getting to the hotel to pick them up.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona shot 41 percent (26-63), a number that must improve if
the Willdcats are to go deep into the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line was advancing to the second round, something
Arizona didn't do last season. The Wildcats will have to continue
without Woods, but that's a situation that won't be anything new.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the Pac-10 season, Jefferson was out with a broken
foot. The Wildcats also had a slew of defections, injuries and
other setbacks that left them with their seven scholarship players.

<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Chris Thunell scored 21 points as Southern
Illinois held on to defeat Colorado 94-92 in a first-round NIT game
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Winston attempted a 3-point shot at the buzzer that would
have given Colorado the win, but the ball bounced off the back of
the rim.
</P>
<P>
   At end of the game, Colorado coach Ricardo Patton threw the ball
at one of the officials as he left the court and had to be
restrained by three people as he stormed after the referees.
</P>
<P>
   Five players scored in double figures for Colorado (18-14),
including Jamahl Mosley with a career-high 27 points, in the highly
physical game against Southern Illinois (20-12).
</P>

   The Salukis led 46-42 at the half, but Colorado took over 62-61
on a basket by Jaquay Walls with 13:17 remaining.
</P>
<P>

Ricky Collum at 12:21 to start a 21-5 run that spanned the next
5:06.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Illinois finished the run with a basket by Thunell at
7:15 to give the Salukis their biggest lead, 82-67. Colorado
stormed back with an 18-4 run of their own including, seven points
each from Walls and Kyle Williams, to pull the Buffaloes within

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Lindros Still Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers captain Eric Lindros
remained hospitalized Thursday night with a post-traumatic migraine
headache, the result of a concussion suffered in a game two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, admitted to the hospital Wednesday, is expected to be
sidelined at least 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros was injured when he was hit in the jaw by Boston's Hal
Gill during the second period of a game March 4. He underwent an
MRI exam and MRA test, which examines the blood vessels in the
brain. Both were negative.
</P>
<P>
   The concussion is Lindros' fourth since March 1998, but is not
believed to be career-threatening. Eric's younger brother, Brett,
was forced to retire from the NHL in 1996 after suffering three
concussions with the New York Islanders and an undetermined amount
in juniors.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros could be released as early as Friday or Saturday, team
officials said. There has been speculation that Lindros may seek an
opinion from a specialist after he is released from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Bob Clarke angrily denied reports Thursday that
team doctors and trainers mishandled Lindros' injury.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros played four games after suffering the injury, but sat
out Monday's game at Phoenix. Flyers team physician Jeff Hartzell
said Tuesday that Lindros did not have a concussion. After
examining him Wednesday, Hartzell said Lindros has a Grade I
concussion, the least severe category.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very confident that our trainers did the right thing,
that our doctors are the best doctors you can get,'' Clarke said
before Thursday night's game against Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Inquirer, citing an anonymous source, reported
in Thursday editions that Lindros may have a Grade II concussion,
which includes memory loss. The report said the team training staff
knew for 10 days that Lindros was experiencing headaches and other
concussion symptoms, including vomiting, but had been treating him
with over-the-counter headache remedies and massages.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke called the report ''lies. ... Anyone can use unnamed
sources. It's not the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way you can get to the bottom of this is we're going
to ask Eric, when he gets out of the hospital, and the trainers and
the doctors to meet with you and answer all your questions,''
Clarke said. ''The speculation is very offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   In a radio interview Thursday, Clarke said Lindros' vomiting was
not any indication he had a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eric is one of the guys who throws up a lot of times, whether
it's between periods or before games,'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros was not available for comment. Carl Lindros, his father
and agent, could not be reached for comment. Clarke would not allow
Hartzell and the team trainers to comment until everyone involved
could speak together after Lindros' release from the hospital, a
team spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt there was something wrong when he got hit,'' Flyers
center Keith Primeau said. ''But he shook it off and we didn't
think twice about it until some of the symptoms started showing.
The guys he is closest to recognized the symptoms, but we're not
medical doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros' previous concussion occurred Jan. 14 against Atlanta.
It was a Grade II. The 27-year-old has missed 15 games this season
because of concussions and back spasms. He has missed 121 games in
his eight-year career, including the final seven regular-season
games and the playoffs last year because of a collapsed lung.
</P>
<P>
   During the radio interview, Clarke suggested Lindros hid his
injury .
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't speak for Eric, but I'm assuming Eric, like all
players, hides injuries,'' Clarke said. ''Players forever have felt
that's the courageous and right thing to do. If Eric feels he has a
headache, we didn't know he had a concussion. If he has a headache,
what are we supposed to do about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, who has openly questioned Lindros' toughness on other
occasions, amended his statement Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if he downplayed it. He played with it,'' Clarke
said. ''He was the best player on the ice for three of the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Flyers forward Rich Tocchet said the team realized Lindros was
ailing during a game against Colorado last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wasn't himself, he was sluggish,'' Tocchet said.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, the 1994-95 MVP, is third on the team with 59 points
with 27 goals and 32 assists.

<HEADLINE> Gonzaga 77, Louisville 66  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Here they go again.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga, the little Jesuit school that became the darling of
last season's NCAA tournament with its improbable run to the West
Regional final, knocked off Louisville 77-66 in the first round
Thursday night behind Richie Frahm's 31 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not a Cinderella team anymore,'' Gonzaga's Ryan Floyd
said. ''Last year was different because people didn't know who we
were. This year we're as talented as we were last year. We're not
expecting any Cinderella treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   As they were last year, the Bulldogs are seeded 10th in the
West. A year ago, their first victim was No. 7 seed Minnesota. This
time, the seventh-seeded Cardinals of coach Denny Crum couldn't
stop the scrappy and accurate 'Zags.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a season-high 24 turnovers, Gonzaga pulled away in the
second half with timely shooting and a tight defense that held
Louisville to 38 percent from the field. Crum, though, said the
Cardinals were more responsible for the lousy shooting than
Gonzaga's defense was.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had open shots all over the gym and we just couldn't make
them,'' Crum said. ''That's about as bad as we can shoot it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs (25-8) will play second-seeded St. John's in the
second round Saturday. St. John's beat Northern Arizona 61-56.
</P>
<P>
   Marques Maybin scored 21 and Nate Johnson 14 for Louisville
(19-12), making its 23rd NCAA appearance in Crum's 29 seasons at
the school. It was the second year in a row that the Cardinals lost
in the first round as a No. 7 seed.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Santangelo scored 16 and Axel Dench had 14 points, six
rebounds and six assists for Gonzaga, which shot 57 percent from
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Frahm, one of four seniors in the Bulldogs' starting lineup, was
4-for-8 from 3-point range and figured at both ends of the most
spectacular and decisive moments in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've scored 30 before so it's not a new thing, but it was
nice,'' Frahm said. ''The whole Frahm household is here to watch
it. This could have been the last game of my senior year if I
didn't have a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gonzaga leading 49-48, Louisville's Quintin Bailey was
headed for a breakaway stuff. But the 6-foot-5 Frahm, who had seven
blocks all season, somehow blocked Bailey's dunk from behind. At
the other end, Frahm sank a 3-pointer from the corner to the roar
of the big pro-Bulldogs crowd and Gonzaga led 52-48 with 10:51 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes people underestimate the athleticism of this team,''
Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. ''Richie is a very athletic two
guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey thought Frahm should have been called for a foul.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I was wide-open coming from halfcourt,'' Bailey
said. ''I turned around as I went up and he hit me. I believe it
was a foul, but the ref didn't call it and things can't change now.
It was a definite momentum shifter. Coach Crum got the technical
right after that and everything went downhill from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Crum said he didn't know why the technical was called.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked the guy and he said the whole bench jumped up,'' Crum
said. ''I said, 'So did 10,000 other people.' Everybody in the gym
jumped up.''
</P>
<P>
   The play triggered an 11-4 run that put the Bulldogs ahead 60-52
on Santangelo's bank shot with 5:50 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crowd goes crazy,'' Few said. ''That does nothing but
energize your team.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Frahm's block and 3-pointer put Gonzaga ahead for good,
there were 20 lead changes, 15 in the first half as Louisville
clung to a 39-38 lead at the break.
</P>
<P>
   Rashad Brooks' 3-pointer capped an 11-2 run that gave the
Cardinals a 32-25 lead with 6:05 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been down before, and seven points is nothing to go
calling home about,'' Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   After a Gonzaga timeout, Floyd, Frahm and Santangelo sank
3-pointers in a 9-1 spurt that put the Bulldogs back on top 34-33
with 2:45 to go.
</P>
<P>
   While the 'Zags were 8-for-16 from 3-point range, Louisville was
2-for-17. The Cardinals' Tony Williams, a 36 percent 3-point
shooter during the season, was 0-for-7. In his final collegiate
game, Williams scored nine points in the first half but was 0-for-5
from the field in the second and finished with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gonzaga beat Minnesota, Stanford and Florida and gave
eventual national champion Connecticut a major scare in the NCAA
West Regional final in Phoenix. This season, after coach Dan Monson
moved to Minnesota and quick guard Quentin Hall used up his
eligibility, Gonzaga struggled at times, but won the West Coast
Conference tournament with an overtime victory over Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga's Casey Calvary, the MVP of the WCC tournament, had two
spectacular blocks but took only two shots, both dunks on lob
passes. He finished with eight points.

   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Allen Phillips scored 23 points and
Scott Brakebill added 19 as Southwest Missouri State beat Southern
Methodist 77-64 on Thursday night in the opening round of the
National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   With SMU (21-9) ahead 23-21 with 10:12 left in the first half,
the Mustangs failed to scored on their next seven possessions while
Southwest Missouri ran off 11 straight points in taking a 43-31
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   SMU narrowed the margin to 48-42 with 16:58 remaining before
Southwest Missouri opened a 13-0 run to go up 61-42 with 14:12
left.
</P>
<P>
   Brakebill controlled the second half, scoring 13 points and
grabbing eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs shot just 34 percent from the floor, including
5-of-28 on 3-pointers, and 52 percent from the line.

   The win was revenge for Southwest Missouri, which lost to SMU on
Dec. 4 when the Mustangs took a 70-60 victory for the title of
Southwest Missouri State Pizza Hut Classic.
</P>
<P>
   DeWayne Floyd was SMU's leading scorer with 15 points and
Quinton Ross added 13.

</P>
<P>
   At Boulder, Colo., Chris Thunell scored 21 points to lead
Southern Illinois (20-12).

<P>
   Jose Winston attempted a 3-point shot at the buzzer that would
have given Colorado the win, but the ball bounced off the back of
the rim.
</P>
<P>
   At end of the game, Colorado coach Ricardo Patton threw the ball
at one of the officials as he left the court and had to be
restrained by three people as he stormed after the referees.

<HEADLINE> 7 Kids Die in Canada Road Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST.-JEAN-BAPTISTE-DE-NICOLET, Quebec (AP) -- Seven small children
on a day-care outing were killed Thursday when the minivan they
were riding in swerved out of control and crashed into an oncoming
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The three other children in the van were hospitalized with
serious head injuries, police said. The driver, whose son was among
the dead, and an adult passenger suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The van was taking the preschoolers to the country to sample
maple sugar when the crash occurred near this town, about 70 miles
north of Montreal. Police said the minivan careened into the
oncoming lane and was hit broadside by the other vehicle. The
accident site was about a mile from the daycare center.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the children were thrown onto a roadside field and were
still there when some parents arrived. ''It was a pretty horrible
scene,'' provincial police spokesman Daniel Lamirande said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims ranged in age from 2 to 5 years old. Police said
they did not know if they were wearing seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they didn't know what caused the minivan to swerve.
Government officials said an investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Kroeker, the driver of the other car, told television
station LCN that he saw the woman driving the minivan only at the
last second.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then it was the shock of seeing the kids everywhere in the
field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone will be saddened by this,'' said Charles Dupuis, who
lives in a farmhouse near the accident site. ''Everyone knows each
other here.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jean Chretien expressed his sympathies, while the
Quebec legislature held a minute of silence to remember the
children.

<HEADLINE> Maryland 74, Iona 59  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- No time like the postseason for Terence
Morris to live up to preseason expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, it's just time to play,'' Morris said with a shrug
after leading third-seeded Maryland past upstart Iona 74-59 on
Thursday night in the Midwest Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The junior forward who had a rocky regular season after being
tagged as the favorite for ACC player of the year honors had 22
points and 12 rebounds as the Terrapins (25-9) ran all over the
14th-seeded Gaels (20-11).
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of coming out like Cinderella, we came out like
Tinkerbell,'' said Iona coach Jeff Ruland, whose team fell behind
23-4 and never really recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland will face UCLA in the second round Saturday. The
sixth-seeded Bruins beat Ball State 65-57.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who came on strong toward season's end and played well
in the ACC tournament, had 14 points and 10 rebounds by halftime,
when the Terps led 38-25.
</P>
<P>
   ''My team just fed off me in the first half,'' Morris said. ''I
just wanted to set an example for the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Off-guard Juan Dixon, who added 20 points, said the Terps relied
on Morris, the only upperclassmen in their starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just knew we had to get him the ball. That's our
All-American. It starts with him and goes on down the line,'' Dixon
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Terps' lead was 60-32 midway through the second half when
the Gaels made it respectable behind Tariq Kirksay, the player of
the year in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference who scored 20 of
his 24 points after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were in awe of them a little bit in the first half,''
Kirksay said. ''They did a great job of stopping me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in the second half they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaels pulled within 12 points on Kirksay's 3-pointer just
inside the two-minute mark but that was as close as they'd get.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't finish them off,'' Morris said, but Terrapins coach
Gary Williams understood why
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there's a tendency when you're young, you don't have
that killer instinct,'' Williams said. ''I think that after 30
minutes we kind of stopped playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Terrapins, who lost four starters from last season's 28-6
team, including point guard Steve Francis to the NBA, got even
younger when sophomore small forward Danny Miller sat out with a
sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was hurt in the final of the Atlantic Coast Conference
tournament, and his injury forced Williams to rely heavily on
freshmen Tahj Holden in big lineups and Drew Nicholas in
three-guard sets.
</P>
<P>
   With freshman point guard Steve Blake running the Terps'
fast-paced offense, Maryland jumped out to a 23-4 lead before the
Gaels knew what had hit them.
</P>
<P>
   Blake was penetrating at will and kicking the ball outside to
Dixon or finding bulky center Lonny Baxter (12 points, 11 rebounds)
underneath the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter, Holden and Morris were too much for the Gaels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those three guys, they're difficult to stop all at once,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Kirksay gave Iona a 2-0 lead, then scored just one more basket
the rest of the half. His five baskets keyed a 14-2 run that pulled
the Gaels to 62-46 with four minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Ruland said his strategy for the game was to ''start off with a
good prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   But, thanks to Morris, the Gaels didn't have much of one
Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> Michigan St. 65, Valparaiso 38  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Watching Michigan State's defense on videotape
is nothing like facing the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Valparaiso learned that lesson the hard way Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had no open looks,'' Crusaders center Lubos Barton said.
''I tried to get open and I just couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither could any of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Applying the defensive clamps from the start, the top-seeded
Spartans got 15 points and eight assists from Mateen Cleaves and
rolled into the second round of the NCAA tournament Thursday night
with a 65-38 victory over 16th-seeded Valparaiso in the Midwest
Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State's tenacious defense limited the Crusaders to 25
percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wow, their on-the-ball pressure,'' said Valpo coach Homer
Drew, who used a his first timeout 44 seconds into the game and had
run out of his allotment by the 14-minute mark of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're so good at attacking the ball,'' he said. ''We tried
to penetrate and couldn't. They've got really long arms and they
are very quick. We tried to make some adjustments at halftime.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State (27-7), trying to get back to the Final Four for
the second straight year, will play eighth-seeded Utah in the
second round Saturday. Utah beat Saint Louis 48-45.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky, which needed double overtime to hold off St.
Bonaventure 85-80, will play Syracuse, a 79-65 winner over Samford,
in Saturday's other second-round game.
</P>
<P>
   Despite sharing the Big Ten's regular-season title with Ohio
State and winning the conference tournament, the Spartans weren't
guaranteed a top seed until Cincinnati lost star Kenyon Martin and
got bounced from the Conference USA tournament last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, many of Michigan State's players talked about the
responsibility that comes along with being a No. 1 seed.
</P>
<P>
   Then they showed the Crusaders (19-13) how serious they were.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's still going to be people who say we shouldn't be a No.
1 seed or that we can't shoot,'' Cleaves said. ''We can't worry
about what people say.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Jason Richardson had nine points and 10 rebounds and
Morris Peterson added 12 points for Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Barton led Valpo with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   A 16th seed has never beaten a No. 1 in the tournament, and any
thoughts Valparaiso, a Sweet 16 team in 1998, had of an upset were
gone shortly after pregame warmups.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State takes great pride in an in-your-face, man-to-man
defense. It's a tradition passed down through the years by the
Spartans, and in the first half Valpo got a full dose of the 2000
edition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defense keyed our offense,'' A.J. Granger said. ''Our
offense wasn't really clicking tonight, so we relied on our
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans hardly gave Valparaiso room to dribble, let alone
shoot, and after Milo Stovall made a 3-pointer with 17:18 left in
the half, the Crusaders missed 12 straight shots as they went 10:35
without scoring as Michigan State opened a 20-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''You think you've beat one of them,'' Valpo guard Milo Stovall
said. ''And then you run right into another.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton ended the drought with a 3-pointer from the wing with
6:43 left in the half, giving Valparaiso fans a rare chance to
cheer. But before they could get too giddy, Cleaves drilled a
3-pointer and then fed Richardson for a spectacular alley-oop dunk
as the Spartans opened a 25-8 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Valparaiso finished the first half just 6-of-26 from the floor
and made seven turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They played hard but just couldn't find the basket,'' Michigan
State coach Tom Izzo said. ''I thought they had some good looks,
some looks that they hit during the season. But tonight they just
weren't going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State didn't ease off after halftime. The Spartans
threw a couple of zone defenses at Valpo, which still couldn't get
an open look at the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't let up and they kept the pressure on constantly,''
said Drew, who was nonetheless pleased his team didn't quit.
</P>
<P>
   The Crusaders did manage to pull within 42-27, but Cleaves
scored seven points and Granger hit a 3-pointer as the Spartans
ripped off 12 straight points and eventually built a 30-point lead.

<HEADLINE> NYPIRG: Upstate could lose in reapportionment  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- At least one upstate Senate seat and two
Assembly seats could be lost to the New York City region and one
congressional seat overall because of its declining population in
the region, a citizen's advocacy group says .
</P>
<P>
   Upstate lost 40,000 people between 1990-99, according to an
analysis done by the New York Public Interest Research Group using
U.S. Census data from July.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, New York City, Long Island, Putnam, Rockland and
Westchester counties -- the downstate area -- picked up more than
240,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   That means when the state Legislature begins reapportionment
next year, the legislative lines will probably be redrawn to give
downstate areas -- New York City and the suburban counties --
additional seats at the expense of the upstate area, NYPIRG
spokesman Blair Horner said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The counties that lost the most people are Erie, Brooklyn,
Oneida, Broome and Onondaga. The ones with the greatest population
increases were Manhattan, Suffolk, Queens, Staten Island and
Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like the trends would be downstate because
reapportionment follows the Census figures,'' Horner said.
</P>
<P>
   Horner estimates that at least one upstate seat in the
Republican-controlled Senate will be shifted downstate, while at
least two seats in the Democrat-controlled Assembly will move
downstate.
</P>
<P>
   There is one caveat. After the 1980 population count, the state
Senate added a 61st seat. They could add more, thus diluting the
effects of any population shifts. The Assembly is limited to 150
seats.
</P>
<P>
   The only downstate areas to lose people were Brooklyn and the
Bronx, which together lost more than 42,000 people during the last
decade, Horner said. However, those districts probably won't lose
seats, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, lines there probably will be redrawn just to include
more people from higher-populated boroughs like Manhattan or
Queens, he said. ''Some or one of their legislators will be
representing a new borough or more of a new borough,'' Horner said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Horner wouldn't guess exactly which districts
legislators would change or what the new legislative map would look
like. ''The hidden artistic capabilities come out when they draw
these maps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers will run on the new district maps for the first time
in November 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Upstate also faces problems on the national government level.
The law limits the U.S. House to 435 seats and as the population
shifts, the Constitution calls for a redistribution of members
after each Census. If New York's population increase doesn't match
other states, it would lose one or maybe more seats.
</P>
<P>
   Upstate population losses mean that if New York loses any of its
congressional seats, that position will come at the expense of
upstate, Horner said. The first likely loss would be in the
Southern Tier or western New York, because those are places losing
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''After that, it becomes unclear,'' Horner said.
</P>
<P>
   Horner said he wants the state Legislature to make available on
the Internet the population figures and computer programs it will
use to figure out the Legislature's new district lines so regular
people can see what they are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want a more rational reapportionment,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Assembly bills aim to revive freed inmate's $12.5 million lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Two lawmakers are attempting to make it
easier for wrongfully imprisoned inmates to recover monetary
compensation from New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Bills by state Assembly Democrats Susan John and David Gantt of
Rochester could revive a $12.5 million lawsuit brought by a former
prostitute who languished in prison for nearly a quarter-century
before her 1973 murder conviction was overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Tyson's lawsuit before the Court of Claims was thrown out
last August because a long-buried jailhouse interview with a
material witness who initially claimed he didn't see her with the
victim was not viewed as new evidence, a requirement under state
law.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless the state chooses to prosecute her again, Ms. Tyson
cannot establish that she's not guilty,'' John said Thursday. ''I
think she is doing her best to get on with her life ... but this
would also give her an opportunity to get a measure of
vindication.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes in the law would give a handful of people
freed from prison because there was reasonable doubt about their
guilt ''the legal right to go to court and seek compensation'' by
proving their innocence, John said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the law was amended, Tyson, now 52, would still have to
prove she did not kill Philadelphia businessman Timothy Haworth the
night of May 24, 1973, and ''that is all she has ever wanted to
do,'' said her attorney, Bradley Kammholz.
</P>
<P>
   Haworth spent the day working as a consultant at Eastman Kodak
Co., then left his hotel around midnight to apparently solicit a
prostitute. He was battered with a brick and strangled with his own
necktie in an alley.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of physical evidence, Tyson and a fellow
prostitute, John Duval, were convicted on the basis of confessions
they insist were beaten out of them by police, and on testimony of
two teen-age runaways.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Wayne Wright, revealed in 1997 that he had lied
about seeing Tyson and Duval with the victim. Prosecutors then came
upon a synopsis of a police interview with the other teen, Jon
Jackson, in which he also denied seeing them with the victim --
contrary to what the teens had testified in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was freed in May 1998, Tyson had become New
York's longest-serving female inmate.
</P>
<P>
   While prosecutors decided not to retry her -- the city of
Rochester gave her $1.2 million in compensation -- they went after
Duval again. While Tyson had steadfastly maintained her innocence,
he had twice admitted his guilt before a parole board.
</P>
<P>
   At a retrial in which the defense maintained he lied to the
parole board to win his freedom, the 47-year-old Duval was
acquitted of murder on Feb. 3. He is also seeking damages for
unlawful imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> Love Canal's Lois Gibbs comes to aid of contaminated Buffaloneighborhood  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Environmental activist Lois Gibbs is coming
to the aid of a Buffalo neighborhood built on toxic waste, calling
it ''another Love Canal.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is like deja vu,'' Gibbs said Thursday after touring
Hickory Woods, where dozens of homes were built on or near
thousands of tons of cancer-causing coke wastes left over from
steel-making operations.
</P>
<P>
   Residents want to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs, who heads the Center for Environmental Health and Justice
in Washington, D.C., was a leader in the fight to clean up her
contaminated Niagara Falls neighborhood more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is another Love Canal,'' said Gibbs, who drew parallels
to her experience. ''We didn't know our homes were built on a dump.
We didn't know that when we dug in our yards we were endangering
our children ... The government allowed these homes to be built
knowing full well it was contaminated.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These people should be moved out today,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hickory Woods site was left vacant and blighted after the
departure of LTV Steel and other manufacturers in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Buffalo purchased and began redeveloping it later
that decade, using federal and state funds to build approximately
60 homes.
</P>
<P>
   The contamination was discovered later.
</P>
<P>
   City officials recently announced that LTV Steel and its former
sister company, Donner Hanna Coke Co., will pay $500,000 to clean
up waste. Mayor Anthony Masiello said he would continue to press
the steel companies to take responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he said, the Environmental Protection Agency
will conduct a soil analysis of the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should permit these experts to conduct their study and then
take appropriate action,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   But the residents do not want to wait. The city, they say,
should repurchase their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remediation is not what we want. We want out first, then they
can remediate later,'' said Linda Benns, a six-year resident.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowner Rick Ammerman cited numerous cases of cancer among
residents and accused the city of having ''a total disregard for
human health.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We hold those who planned this neighborhood improperly
responsible for that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Blake believes her 4-year-old son's vision and
developmental problems are due to exposure to lead and other
toxins.
</P>
<P>
   ''My son spends eight hours a day in school, in therapy,'' she
said. ''It's not fair to him.''

<HEADLINE> Physicians seeking union-like bargaining powers  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Workers of the world unite!
</P>
<P>
   Or rather, pediatricians, gynecologists and other physicians are
seeking to unite in union-like bargaining units which they say
would give them badly needed leverage in their dealings with health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   With one of the more formidable lobbying groups in Albany -- the
Medical Society of the State of New York -- behind the proposal,
influential legislators are listening.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Kemp Hannon, a Long Island Republican who chairs the
Senate's health committee, said he has been talking to Democratic
legislators in the state Assembly about drafting a bill to let
doctors organize.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tricky proposition technically, because the measure must
be structured in a way to legally circumvent federal antitrust
statutes.
</P>
<P>
   It may be even tricker politically trying to convince people
that doctors -- hardly regarded as an underpaid class of workers --
need help to make more money. Or at least that will be the reaction
of most to the notion of unionized doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Society is not using the word ''union'' in promoting
the legislation. It prefers the nebulous term ''collective
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not really a true union as you might think of the
union in a traditional sense,'' said Dr. Mark Fox, who is promoting
the issue on behalf of the Medical Society. ''This is a way for
physicians to come together and talk to one another about patient
care issues concerning the specific insurance plan and going to the
insurance plan and being able to sit at the table on an equal
footing with the plan and to discuss these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The fees doctors get for their services would be secondary
during those negotiations to issues involving the right of doctors
to treat patients free from what they regard as interference from
health maintenance organizations, the Medical Society insists.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said the result of tight controls by HMOs over the way
doctors treat managed-care patients has been the ''complete
disruption of the doctor-patient relationship and the sacred trust
that has existed between them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, HMOs see no reason to allow doctors to
unionize in New York, said Leslie Moran of the state Health Plan
Association. Patients' rights are protected by a series of new
measures, including an outside appeals process when HMOs deny
coverage to patients for procedures they consider medically
necessary, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moran added that HMOs now essentially collectively bargain with
independent practice associations, which are coalitions of doctors
who offer various services from the same location.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that about 30,000 physicians might be
eligible to form union-like bargaining units under the legislation
being discussed in New York. Their participation will depend on how
dominant HMOs are in their regions. Sponsors say that the more
customers a managed care company has, the less bargaining power
doctors have in dealing with those HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Some statewide authority -- the attorney general, perhaps, or the
state insurance or health departments -- would have to assume
oversight over the activities of the bargaining units, Hannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors would not be allowed to strike or stage boycotts under a
unionized setup.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Texas are the only ones who now have the right to
collectively bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the doctors' interest in hiking their own fees vs.
getting patients a better deal before HMOs is at the crux of the
debate over letting doctors collectively bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Hannon said he believes doctors' dissatisfaction with HMOs is
genuine, fueled by things like ''the need to spend countless hours
on the phone, justifying a series of tests which in their minds are
totally necessary for good health care.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to explore what's the proper balance out there
between making this affordable and making this accessible,'' Hannon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group, a
critic of doctors on many issues, said there is plenty of
self-interest involved in the doctors' unionization push.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is as much an issue of patient protection as it is fees,''
Horner said. ''But I am sure what drives this issue in terms of the
trade association is economic impact (to its members).''
</P>
<P>
   Moran, of the HMO trade organization, agreed that ''it is not a
convincing argument'' by doctors to say patients' rights and not
doctors' fees are behind their promotion of the unionization bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''When someone says, 'It's not about the money,''' she said,
''the chances are it is about the money.''

<HEADLINE> Utah 48, Saint Louis 45  </HEADLINE>
By RUSTY MILLER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Jeff Johnsen made an off-balance 3-pointer --
barely beating the shot clock -- with 1:43 left as Utah beat Saint
Louis 48-45 on Thursday night in the Midwest Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Johnsen's shot from his hip gave the Utes (23-8) their first
lead since early in the second half and gave coach Rick Majerus his
eighth first-round victory in as many tries at Utah.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnsen's shot put them ahead 46-44, John Redden hit a
foul shot for Saint Louis (19-14). The Billikens were just 9-of-22
at the line.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Cullen, who led Utah with 12 points, added a free throw with
11.5 seconds remaining before Alex Jensen added another with 9.6
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Saint Louis hurried the ball downcourt, with Redden whipping a
pass to a wide-open Dave Fergerson whose 3-pointer with a second
left bounded off the back of the rim as the final horn sounded.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-seeded Utes will face top-seeded Michigan State,
which routed Valparaiso 65-38, in Saturday's second round.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Jeffers led the Billikens with 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Hanno Mottola added 11 points for Utah, which hit just 9-of-19
free throws.
</P>
<P>
   There were seven ties and neither team led by more than five
points in a game marked by physical play, chest-to-chest defense
and poor shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Utah hit just 39 percent of its shots from the field to the
Billikens' 38 percent. The Utes were 9-for-21 from 3-point range,
but just 6-for-18 on 2-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   Saint Louis, surprise champions of the Conference USA
tournament, led most of the second half and was up 43-40 after
Jeffers' dunk with 2:59 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Cullen, averaging just 5.3 points, countered with a 3-pointer to
tie it. Redden then hit the back half of a two-shot foul with 2:19
left for a 44-43 Saint Louis lead.
</P>
<P>
   Utah had difficulty getting inside against the Billikens' sticky
man-to-man defense and Johnson ended up with the ball deep on the
left wing as the final second ticked off the shot clock. With a
defender in his face, he let fly with the shot by almost heaving it
at the basket.
</P>
<P>
   It provided his only three points of the game.

<HEADLINE> St. John's 61, Northern Arizona 56  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- St. John's barely avoided the biggest upset
on the opening day of the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Lavor Postell converted a three-point play with 10.9 seconds to
play and Erick Barkley made a key steal with three seconds left to
seal second-seeded St. John's 61-56 win over Northern Arizona on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by a spirited crowd, 15th-seeded Northern Arizona once
again came close to pulling off a tournament upset.
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks (20-11), who lost 65-62 to Cincinnati in the
1998 tournament, took their first lead of the second half on Cory
Schwab's 3-pointer with 29.1 seconds to play that made it 56-55.
</P>
<P>
   But St. John's wasn't flustered. Postell hit a leaner in the
lane and drew the foul. He hit the free throw to put the Red Storm
up two. The Lumberjacks called timeout and got the ball into the
front court before Barkley stole the ball from Dan Land.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley hit one free throw with 2.6 seconds left and Bootsy
Thornton rebounded the miss on the second shot and scored to ice
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm (25-7) advanced to play No. 10 seed Gonzaga, which
beat Louisville 77-66 earlier Thursday night. In the other two
games in Tucson, No. 6 Purdue beat No. 11 Dayton 62-61 and
third-seeded Oklahoma beat No. 14 Winthrop 74-50.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton led the Red Storm with 20 points, Postell added 12 and
Anthony Glover had 10.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's overcame a feisty Northern Arizona team and
enthusiastic fans, many of whom made the 4{-hour trip from
Flagstaff. Chants of ''N-A-U!'' reverberated throughout the arena
as the Lumberjacks players and coaches urged the fans on at every
timeout.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't enough to top a St. John's team that has been
surrounded by turmoil the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was suspended twice in February for a total of three
games for violating NCAA rules and has been the target of a probe
up until this past week. He and Postell met with investigators on
Monday but were cleared to play in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   None of that has affected St. John's, which has won 11 of 12
games since the first suspension on Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   But Northern Arizona nearly did what the NCAA couldn't -- end the
season for Barkley and St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   Seven-footer Dan McClintock used his six-inch size advantage to
score 18 points and grab eight rebounds for the Lumberjacks. Billy
Hix added 14 points and 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   But Northern Arizona's 3-point shooters, who carried them into
the NCAA tournament by hitting 16 of 27 in the Big Sky title game,
were held in check by the Red Storm's swarming perimeter defense.
</P>
<P>
   Land, the fifth most accurate 3-point shooter in NCAA history,
was 3-of-9 from long range and Schwab missed his first five
attempts before giving the Lumberjacks the lead on his jumper from
the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Arizona shot 7-of-23 overall from 3-point range.

<HEADLINE> Deputies Shot in Atlanta  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Two sheriff's deputies were shot Thursday night
while trying to serve a warrant against the former black militant
once known as H. Rap Brown, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they did not know whether Jamil Al-Amin, as Brown is
now known, fired the shots that wounded the Fulton County officers.
A manhunt was under way near downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies were trying to serve a warrant from suburban Cobb
County for aggravated assault against Al-Amin when they were shot
about 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think both officers kind of walked into this,'' Sheriff
Jacquelyn Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said one officer was in critical condition at Grady
Memorial Hospital with abdominal and leg wounds. The other was in
guarded condition with leg and arm wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin was a leader of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee and justice minister of the Black Panthers, which rose to
prominence in the 1960s. He once exhorted blacks to arm themselves,
saying ''violence is as American as cherry pie.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he has lived as the Muslim spiritual leader of
a community mosque and operated a small grocery in Atlanta's West
End. He has worked at trying to clean up drugs and prostitution in
the neighborhood since moving there in 1976.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Hits Texas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEANDER, Texas (AP) -- A tornado hit northwest of Austin Thursday
afternoon, tearing roofs and breaking windows at about a dozen
homes.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported, said Leander police Sgt. Greg Minton.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of this town of 6,000 people, about 22 miles northwest
of Austin, milled in the streets afterward, hugging each other and
taking pictures of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Shingles scattered front yards and patio furniture and jungle
gyms were strewn about.
</P>
<P>
   A fence post punctured the back wall of Larry Gregory's house,
entering a closet. Gregory said no one was home at the time, but
the closet was his family's tornado shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We never planned it like that, though,'' he said. ''It's
pretty chilling.''
</P>
<P>
   The tornado that hit around 4:20 p.m. was just miles from
Jarrell, where a tornado killed 29 people in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A second tornado touched down in Pflugerville, 13 miles
northeast of Austin, about an hour later. No damage or injuries
were reported, said Travis County Sheriff's Department dispatcher
Craig Miller.

<HEADLINE> Kashmir Hopes Clinton Brings Peace  </HEADLINE>
By LAURINDA KEYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Rolling out thin, spicy, biscuit dough
onto a charcoal-heated hot plate, baker Nazir Ahmad Runga was
worried. As he sat in his wooden shack on a Kashmir street of
shuttered shops, he wondered: Where will the next shooting or
explosion be?
</P>
<P>
   ''We never know from which side blood will flow,'' said Runga.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, he believes everything should be all right after
President Clinton comes to India for a visit beginning March 20 and
follows it with a brief stop in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will decide our fate so we will leave this hell,'' said the
40-year-old baker in his soiled tunic. ''He is the only one who
can.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems a bleak hope.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said the 1972 cease-fire line that bisects the
mountainous Kashmir region between India and Pakistan is ''the most
dangerous place in the world right now.'' He has offered to
mediate, but only if both countries ask -- which India has said it
won't do.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, which both
sides claim, has been the spark for two of the three wars between
the two countries since British colonialism ended a half-century
ago. Now both sides have nuclear weapons capability, and tensions
in Kashmir are high again.
</P>
<P>
   The root of the latest dispute is a Muslim fundamentalist-led
uprising that began in Indian Kashmir in 1989, prompting the Indian
army to deploy there. More than 25,000 people have died in the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   India says Kashmir is a bilateral problem that could be resolved
if Pakistan stopped supporting guerrillas who cross the border to
set bombs and kill security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan says it gives moral and political support, but no
money, weapons or training, to the Kashmiri militants who shelter
within its borders. Pakistani leaders want the international
community to get involved and implement a 1948 U.N. resolution
calling for an eventual plebiscite in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The sides battled on the snowy peaks of the Himalayas last
summer. India says it was battling the Pakistani army. But Pakistan
says it was local guerrillas holed up in stone bunkers who fought
off India's jets, artillery and infantry for nearly three months.
</P>
<P>
   The years of fighting have taken their toll on both combatants
and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Indian forces here are fighting guerrillas who can hide an
automatic rifle under the traditional long woolen cloak that most
Kashmiri men wear. They can place a land mine in a vegetable market
or slip up to an off-duty soldier in a crowded lane and kill him at
point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated and frightened troops and police are sandbagged in
bunkers every few hundred yards along the highways and city
streets. Kashmiris complain that they retaliate against civilians
by burning shops and houses and raping, beating and humiliating
entire villages in all-day roundups and identity checks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want independence,'' says Azi Begum Fatima, beating her
breast in a courtyard of a mosque in Srinagar, Kashmir's summer
capital. ''We are living in a miserable way under the ruthless
Indian occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. John Mukherjee, the regional Indian army commander,
acknowledged some human rights abuses but said many complaints were
unproved.
</P>
<P>
   ''No people anywhere would like to see this sort of activity
taking place,'' he said, commenting on the house searches and
identity checks. ''Which army wants to do this sort of job?''
</P>
<P>
   Tension and violence are increasing as Clinton's visit
approaches. Mukherjee said 42 militants were killed between Oct. 22
and Feb. 15. At least 15 civilians were killed by either guerrillas
or security forces in February.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years of bloodshed have changed the Kashmiri character,
says local writer Ali Imran.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a saying that even the skies weep when an innocent is
killed,'' he said. ''Now, there can be a blast and I hear it, but I
drive on down the other road without caring. It has changed me, our
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no formal curfew, Kashmiris try to get home
before sunset. If they can't, they drive with the lights on inside
their cars so they can be seen by increasingly trigger-happy
soldiers or police.
</P>
<P>
   All Kashmiris ''want is peace and stability,'' says Gen.
Mukherjee. ''There is never more than 5-10 percent of the people
who really support terrorists and insurgents.''
</P>
<P>
   Police and army leaders believe guerrilla groups are planning a
spectacular event to draw attention to Kashmir while Clinton is in
India. Members of the largest legal separatist group say they plan
protests, although most of their top leaders are in preventive
custody.
</P>
<P>
   For Runga the baker, Clinton is the best hope to make India and
Pakistan resolve their dispute. He speaks of the power of the U.S.
leader in messianic terms -- as do many Kashmiris, illiterate or
educated, in anticipation of the first American presidential visit
to India in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton should tell India to withdraw from Kashmir,'' says
Mohammad Jusuf Qurashi, giving a Koran lesson in the mosque
courtyard in Srinagar.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a superpower in the world,'' said Qurashi. ''He can do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's visit, Imran said, ''The people will be looking
with wide open eyes toward New Delhi to see if the gentleman on
whom they have pinned so many hopes is talking about them or not.''

US To Offer Ease on Luxury Imports
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a move to encourage reformists in Iran, the Clinton
administration is ready to announce a lifting of a ban on imports of luxury
goods and to offer a settlement of claims with Tehran, a senior U.S. official
said Thursday. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will make the offer in a
major policy speech here Friday to the American-Iranian Council, a private group
based in Princeton, N.J., that seeks better relations with Tehran. The partial
easing of sanctions and the offer to discuss claims each nation has against the
other will be coupled with a renewed proposal for formal talks, said the
official, who declined to be identified.

swerved out of control and crashed into an oncoming vehicle. The three other
children in the van were hospitalized with serious head injuries, police said.
The driver, whose son was among the dead, and an adult passenger suffered minor
injuries. The van was taking the preschoolers to the country to sample maple
sugar when the crash occurred near this town, about 70 miles north of Montreal.

Vt. House OKs Gay 'Civil Unions'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- The Vermont House approved Thursday a bill to allow
gays to form ''civil unions.'' If the bill becomes law, the state will have gone
further than any other in recognizing same-sex couples. Vermont's Senate is
expected to approve the bill by the end of next month. However, the federal
government still would not recognize such unions with regard to such things as
immigration rights, Social Security and federal taxes.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton appealed to leaders in the Northern
Ireland peace process Thursday to put aside their differences and work to
restore the British province's independent government. Clinton addressed the
annual dinner of the American Ireland Fund, attended by David Trimble, leader of
the pro-British Ulster Unionists party, and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, whose
party is allied with the Irish Republican Army. Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson suspended the province's nascent coalition government
last month because the IRA refused to give up its weapons. On Thursday,
Mandelson urged both sides to use their visit to Washington to restart the
process.

   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- An appeal by the Exxon Corp. on the $5 billion
Valdez oil spill civil verdict was rejected Thursday. The San Francisco-based
9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the verdict should not be thrown out because
of irregularities during jury deliberations. The appeal of the punitive damages
verdict was one of several filed by Exxon and co-defendant Joseph Hazelwood, who
was in charge of the tanker Exxon Valdez when it drove onto a charted reef in
Prince William Sound in March 1989 and spilled 11 million gallons of Alaska

St. John's Squeaks by N. Arizona 61-56
</SUBHEAD>

   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Lavor Postell converted a three-point play with 10.9
seconds to play and Erick Barkley made a key steal with three seconds left to
seal second-seeded St. John's 61-56 win over Northern Arizona on the opening day
of the NCAA tournament. Backed by a spirited crowd, 15th-seeded Northern Arizona
once again came close to pulling off a tournament upset. The Lumberjacks
(20-11), who lost 65-62 to Cincinnati in the 1998 tournament, took their first
lead of the second half on Cory Schwab's 3-pointer with 29.1 seconds to play
that made it 56-55. But St. John's wasn't flustered.

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics 117, Grizzlies 103  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Gary Payton scored 30 points and dished out 16
assists, one short of a career high, as the Seattle SuperSonics
handed the Vancouver Grizzlies their 10th straight loss, 117-103
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's points total pushed him past 13,000 in his nine-year
career with 13,018. Payton scored 40 in Seattle's 113-103 victory
at Vancouver on Monday, one off his career high.
</P>
<P>
   Sonics forward Vin Baker, who missed the last two games with a
strained left hamstring, scored 21 points and pulled down seven
rebounds. Brent Barry also hit for 21, including four 3-pointers,
for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Payton hit 7 of 10 shots in the first quarter and had six
assists and four rebounds as Seattle led 40-26. Vancouver never got
closer than five points the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dickerson led the Grizzlies with 24 points, Mike Bibby
scored 23 and Shareef Abdur-Rahim 22.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics swept the Grizzlies 4-0 on the season and are 9-0
overall at home against Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies trailed by as many as 16 points in the first
quarter, but scored the first eight points of the second, capped by
Bryant Reeves' dunk to get to 40-34. The Sonics rallied to go up by
10, but Dickerson's three-point play brought the Grizzlies to 64-57
at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson's jumper to start the second half got Vancouver within
five points. The Grizzlies got no closer the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Payton hit 7 of 10 shots in the first quarter and had six
assists and four rebounds as Seattle led 40-26.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who showed no signs of his injury, played 30 minutes. He
had eight in the opening quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle had a 17-6 run midway through the first period as it
turned a 11-10 advantage into a 28-16 lead. Baker had six points in
the run and Payton the final four points.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The 40 points given up by Vancouver in the first
quarter was a club record. ... Payton started his 299th consecutive
game Thursday, the longest active streak in the NBA. ... The loss
gave the Grizzlies a 5-68 all-time record in March. ... The
Grizzlies' game at home Friday against the Phoenix Suns starts a
nine-game homestand, the longest in team history ... Vernon Maxwell
needs just one more game to reach the 800 career mark in games
played.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Raises Round-Trip Fares  </HEADLINE>
By KARREN MILLS, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Northwest Airlines has taken the lead in a
new fare increase after spoiling two recent attempts by other
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest on Thursday raised round-trip fares throughout its
domestic system.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagan-based carrier's biggest increase, $20 to $40
round-trip, is in unrestricted fares. Northwest, the nation's
fourth-largest carrier, is limiting the increase to $10 to $20 for
round-trip excursion fares, the cheaper rates paid by vacationers
who plan in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines, Northwest's U.S. alliance partner, led
failed attempts to boost fares on Feb. 18 and March 10. Continental
had posted increases of between $10 and $30 for excursion fares in
February. Three weeks later, Continental tried again, boosting its
excursion fares by $20 and $40.
</P>
<P>
   Several airlines refused to follow Continental's lead in the
first attempt. Northwest and Southwest Airlines went against the
tide in the attempt last week.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest declined specific comment on its fare increases, which
also included varying hikes in unpublished senior, military,
Internet and consolidator fares.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest also raised its fees for excess luggage, transporting
pets, replacing lost tickets and other services by $5 to $25.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Terry Trippler, an airline expert with
1travel.com, agreed with the Northwest strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought Continental was going in the wrong direction,''
Trippler said. ''The Northwest increase makes a lot more sense.
It's more fair. I think this puppy's going to stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Other carriers did not immediately match the Northwest
increases, but Delta Air Lines and United Airlines were studying
them, spokesmen said. Fare hikes generally are rescinded if other
major airlines do not follow suit.

<HEADLINE> Source: BMW To Sell Rover to Ford  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE, AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. has agreed to buy British
truck maker Land Rover from BMW Group as part of BMW's exit from
its six-year struggle to turn around the ailing Rover car group.
</P>
<P>
   BMW and Ford were set to announce today details of an agreement
concerning the Dearborn-based auto giant's acquisition of the
luxury sport utility unit, according to a source close to the
negotiations who would speak only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes after BMW announced its plans Thursday to sell
the Rover passenger car division to Alchemy Partners Ltd., a
British investment group.
</P>
<P>
   The investment group will take on the Rover and MG brand cars,
including their plant in Longbridge, England, and recast the
venture under the new name MG Car Co.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, those operations have burdened BMW
with $1.25 billion in red ink and dragged down profit an estimated
28 percent last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Land Rover, on the other hand is considered the crown jewel of
the Rover lineup. The company sells four models of SUVs, two of
which -- the Range Rover and the Discovery -- are imported to the
United States. The company built about 160,000 vehicles last year.
</P>
<P>
   The source could not provide other details, and both Ford and
BMW declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's deal with BMW for Land Rover is yet another step in a
trend of global consolidation among automakers. Earlier this week,
General Motors Corp. took 20 percent of the Fiat Auto company from
its Italian parent, a few months after taking a similar stake in
the Japanese parent of Subaru.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers believe such deals will cut the massive costs of
designing and building new vehicles by allowing companies to share
components and factories around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, details on the BMW-Alchemy pact remained a matter of
contention late Thursday. BMW said the two sides were still
negotiating the fine print of the arrangement after the company's
supervisory board approved its outline.
</P>
<P>
   BMW did say, however, that shifting the operations to Alchemy
will set the company back $3 billion, in the form of a one-time
restructuring charge.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it was unclear whether the price of the deal was
rolled into that charge. Some even speculated BMW wooed Alchemy
into taking the loss-making venture by throwing in a cash
incentive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even getting Rover for free would not be attractive to most
people. It's a cash-eating company,'' said Christian Breitsprecher,
an auto analyst with Deutsche Bank. ''I'm pretty sure Alchemy's not
paying anything for the deal and is getting something on top.''
</P>
<P>
   BMW did unveil plans Thursday to roll out a new line of the
sporty, subcompact Minis from its Oxford plant in early summer 2001
and continue building the Rover 75 luxury model in Oxford on a
contract basis for Alchemy. The company also plans to finish
construction of its new Hams Hall engine factory in Birmingham and
begin production there.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to shed Rover caused strife at BMW, leading to the
resignation of three members of the management board. The board has
already filled two of those spots, with the third being shared by
chairman Joachim Milberg and chief financial officer Helmut Panke.
</P>
<P>
   The Rover line -- headquartered in Warwick, central England -- was
bought by BMW in 1994 mainly to gain access to Land Rover and flesh
out BMW's models at the less-expensive end of the car market. BMW
has already pumped $3.4 billion into Rover since buying the group
for $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The strengthening of the British pound since 1997 has made it
more expensive for the German company to build Rover vehicles in
Britain and export them to other countries in Europe where it earns
revenues in weaker currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about BMW closing down plants or pulling out operations,
the British government has earmarked a $240 million subsidy for the
company, which the European Union Commission is currently
scrutinizing under EU competition rules.
</P>
<P>
   Without the subsidy, union leaders say 16,000 of Rover's 30,000
jobs could be at risk.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Foodborne Illnesses Decline  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The rate of foodborne illnesses in the United
States has dropped again, but certain types of salmonella climbed
to the highest level since the government started keeping track
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated
Thursday that 76 million Americans suffer a foodborne illness each
year. The CDC said the rate for the nine disease-causing agents it
tracks was 40.7 cases per 100,000 people last year, compared with
51.2 per 100,000 four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Salmonella infections rose from 12.3 per 100,000 people in 1998
to 14.8 per 100,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Salmonella, which has more than 2,000 variations, is rarely
fatal but can cause severe stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea and
vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC said it was unclear why salmonella infections continued
to increase last year. But researchers noted that several 1999
outbreaks were linked to unpasteurized orange juice, mangoes and
uncooked sprouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''So we think we have not made as much progress in decreasing
the contamination of fruits and vegetables,'' said Dr. Patricia
Griffin, head of the CDC's foodborne disease epidemiology section.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the salmonella surge, other common foodborne diseases
continued to decline as progress was made in controlling outbreaks
of campylobacteriosis and shigella infections.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of campylobacteriosis, the most widespread cause of
food poisoning, fell from 25.2 cases per 100,000 people in 1997 to
17.3 per 100,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   And the rate shigella, which causes gastrointestinal symptoms
similar to salmonella, has dropped 44 percent since 1996, the CDC
said Thursday. Cases of E. coli 0157:H7 were down 22 percent in the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were based on preliminary data from the Foodborne
Diseases Active Surveillance Network, which collects data on seven
bacterial and two parasitic organisms from Connecticut, Georgia,
Minnesota and Oregon. Several counties in California, Maryland and
New York also report to the network.
</P>
<P>
   The survey covers about 9 percent of the U.S. population.

<HEADLINE> Texas Orders All Prisons Locked Down  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Texas' 86 prisons were locked down
indefinitely after an inmate was stabbed to death in the system's
latest major security breach.
</P>
<P>
   The order by the state's prisons chief means visitors are banned
and all 122,000 inmates are confined to their cells while
authorities search for weapons and other illegal items.
</P>
<P>
   The action in the nation's second-largest prison system came
after several incidents in which prisoners have been caught with
weapons or other illegal items. The number of attacks on guards
also has been escalating.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, just seconds before his execution, convicted
murderer Ponchai Wilkerson spit out a handcuff key while strapped
to the death chamber gurney at the Huntsville prison.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Wilkerson and another death row inmate, both armed
with makeshift weapons, held a guard hostage for 13 hours before
surrendering.
</P>
<P>
   In December, a guard was stabbed to death at the McConnell Unit.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday morning, an inmate was fatally stabbed by another
prisoner at the Coffield Unit, authorities said. Roland Rios, 41,
was attacked with a homemade steel weapon while a guard escorted
him to a shower in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''When word came of the Coffield homicide, the decision was made
to lock down the entire system,'' said Larry Todd, a spokesman for
the Department of Criminal Justice. He added: ''It is unusual to
have a systemwide lockdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The last lockdown was ordered in 1998 after a hostage incident
at a prison in Abilene and an attempted escape by seven death row
inmates from the Ellis Unit. One inmate drowned in a creek nearby.
The others, Wilkerson among them, surrendered after guards began
shooting at them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a combination of a number of things: spring
cleaning, location of some contraband, the handcuff key, the
Coffield murder this morning,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   All cells, cellblocks, recreation yards and work areas both
inside and outside prisons will be searched, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we find something that can be used as a weapon, we will
immediately seize it,'' Todd said. Todd said paper clips can be
braided into a spear, for example. Elastic removed from underwear
can be used to make a slingshot.
</P>
<P>
   The lockdown will last through this weekend and possibly through
the one after that, Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 26 jails and substance abuse units -- which hold
28,000 inmates -- will be searched but not locked down, and visitors
will be allowed.

<HEADLINE> Montserrat Celebrates Slave Revolt  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE BAY, Montserrat (AP) -- Far from Ireland, in the shadow of
a tropical volcano, residents of the ''other Emerald Isle'' are
celebrating a different kind of St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   In Montserrat, a hilly British territory settled by Irish
pioneers, people mix their annual celebration of shamrocks and
green beer with memories of an aborted slave revolt against Irish
planters in 1768.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a Caribbean amalgam of colonial culture and
African pride -- a weeklong fete with islanders dancing Irish jigs
one night, then mocking their one-time masters the next by cracking
whips and masquerading in tall hats like bishops' miters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are celebrating the rise of the slave freedom fighters, but
also the Irish Catholic element in our history,'' said historian
Howard Fergus. ''They both have a place in our St. Patrick's Day,''
which is celebrated Friday, the anniversary of the saint's death.
</P>
<P>
   While the southern part of Montserrat has turned gray and barren
from avalanches spewed by the Soufriere Hills Volcano, much of the
island still evokes Ireland, with rugged cliffs, rolling hills and
brilliant green vegetation. Places with Irish names such as
Sweeney's Well and Riley's Estate dot the map, and immigration
officials stamp passports with bright green shamrocks.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Patrick's Day traditions have suffered in recent years
as the volcano forced thousands of people from their homes and
two-thirds of the population abandoned the island. When the volcano
first roared to life in 1995, it sent avalanches of superheated
rock and gases into the largest towns and forced an evacuation of
the capital, Plymouth, and the island's only airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lost it a bit because of the volcano, but we're trying to
revive it now,'' said Fitzroy Martin, who was masquerading in early
festivities this week.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials trying to bolster the island's battered
economy have been promoting the celebration in Europe in hopes of
luring visitors from Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking back to remember what's valuable in our history,
but we're looking forward to try to see what kind of economic
benefit we can reap from its relics,'' said Kenny Castle, one of
the organizers of the island's celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish presence in Montserrat dates back to the 1630s, when
the first pioneers -- Roman Catholics -- sailed over from St. Kitts
because of friction with British Protestant settlers there.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish planters brought African slaves to work their sugar
cane fields. Soon the slaves outnumbered them 3-to-1 and began
rebelling.
</P>
<P>
   In 1768, the slaves planned an island-wide attack on St.
Patrick's Day, when the planters would be celebrating. Servants
were instructed to grab all the weapons they could find inside the
Government House while field slaves stormed the building with
rocks, farm tools, clubs and homemade swords.
</P>
<P>
   But someone leaked the plan, and debate over who's to blame
still continues. Local authorities punished the slaves severely,
hanging nine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was crushed cruelly,'' Fergus said. ''There is a myth that
the Irish, being oppressed by the British, were more humane, and
this exposes that lie.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decades after Britain abolished slavery in 1834, most
whites left the island. But their surnames were adopted by the
slaves and live on.
</P>
<P>
   In memory of the failed rebellion, organizers have recreated a
slave village where visitors will eat traditional foods such as
salted codfish and sweet potato ''dookna'' and play games such as
''Zig Zag Zaggett'' -- similar to marbles but played with cashew
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Children are to dance Irish jigs while adults perform the
heel-and-toe steps to heavy drumbeats.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a parody of Irish dancing to African music,'' said
government spokesman Richard Aspin. ''In the old days, the slaves
would peek in the windows on the Irish holidays and then parody
what was going on inside.''
</P>
<P>
   There will also be an Irish sing-along, a historical lecture by
former Irish Parliament member Michael Higgins and a special Mass
at the last remaining church. Montserrat's main place of worship,
St. Patrick's Church, is buried under volcanic ash.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all fun,'' Castle said. ''There are no hard feelings
between the cultures. What happened way back in history is past for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers remind islanders that St. Patrick himself was
enslaved by Irish raiders before he began converting Ireland to
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ''St. Patrick was a slave, too, so we can sympathize with him,''
said Chief Minister David Brandt.

<HEADLINE> Canucks 6, Sabres 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Markus Naslund had two
power-play goals and two assists as the Vancouver Canucks kept
their slim playoff hopes alive with a 6-3 victory over the Buffalo
Sabres on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cassels added four assists for Vancouver, which improved
to 4-1 in its last five home games. With 11 games remaining, the
Canucks are within six points of San Jose and Edmonton for the
final playoff spot in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Messier had a goal and two assists for Vancouver, and Felix
Potvin made 17 saves to improve to 6-5-3 since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon Ward, Doug Gilmour and Curtis Brown scored for the Sabres,
who lost their second in as many nights to remain in 11th place in
the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Ward gave the Sabres a 1-0 lead 3:05 into the first before the
Canucks scored three straight.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Morrison, acquired along with Denis Pederson from New
Jersey shortly before Tuesday's trade deadline for Alexander
Mogilny, had a goal and an assist in his Canucks debut.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison threw the puck at the net and it went off Sabres
defenseman Jason Holland and past a surprised Martin Biron at 4:53
to tie it 1-1. Naslund scored at 7:14, and Todd Bertuzzi with 39
seconds left in the first to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Brown pulled Buffalo within a goal 1:28 into the second, but
Vancouver answered with three straight goals to take a 6-2 lead
after two periods.
</P>
<P>
   Naslund scored his second of the game at 4:10 to make it 4-2. He
took a nice feed from Cassels and waited for a diving Jay McKee to
slide past him before roofing a wrist shot past a sprawling Biron.
</P>
<P>
   Mattias Ohlund scored a short-handed goal at 9:07 to make it
5-2, and Messier scored 1:11 later to make it 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour scored on the power play at 7:04 of the third to finish
the scoring. He added an assist, and has six points in his first
three games with the Sabres. Gilmour's assist on Brown's goal gave
him 873 in his career and moved into a tie with Phil Esposito for
14th place on the NHL career list.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks outshot Buffalo 32-11 the first two periods, and
35-20 overall.

<HEADLINE> Campaign finance reform bills pass key committee  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Republicans in the state Legislature are
railing against two campaign finance reform bills that would allow
candidates to pay for their campaigns with taxpayer money within
six years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The taxpayer financing is a mistake, and having a bill that
goes into effect in 2006 is phony,'' said House Minority Leader
Robert Ward, R-Northford.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would set up a voluntary, publicly funded
campaign finance system in 2006. Public money would be available
for candidates running for constitutional offices such as governor,
attorney general and treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would be paid for through a voluntary $5 check-off on
state income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate bill, public financing would kick in for the
2002 gubernatorial election, and would start in 2006 for all
constitutional and legislative offices. Residents would be allowed
to donate $5 to the pool that would be used to fund those
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Senate bill have said it will take 200 years to
raise enough money to publicly fund every campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who pushed the House and Senate bills through the
Appropriations Committee Thursday admit the proposals aren't
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are probably deficiencies in both bills, and they're not
going to be rectified here,'' said Appropriations Committee
co-chairman William Dyson, D-New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill passed on a 25-17 vote. The Senate bill was
approved 25-18. Both now head to the Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Republicans blasted Democrats for killing another
campaign finance reform bill which would have limited contributions
from political action committees, lobbyists and other special
interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal, which died in another committee earlier this
week, would have applied to all state offices. It made no
provisions for public financing of campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's have a meaningful discussion about real reform, which is
limiting proliferation of political action committees and special
interest money,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Brian Flaherty criticized the House bill for proposing
reforms only for constitutional offices, not legislative races.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we should be reforming the system for everybody
but the Legislature,'' said Flaherty, R-Watertown.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Andrew Fleischmann said the bill only targets
constitutional offices because candidates for those races scramble
to raise the largest amounts of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at the pattern of spending, it's clear that that
is where the most significant issue lies,'' said Fleischmann,
D-West Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans bolstered their argument against public campaign
financing by pointing to a Hartford Courant/Connecticut poll that
said 77 percent of those asked are opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 509 randomly selected adults showed that
68 percent of those polled say some reform is needed. The poll has
a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ''The perception is that honesty is missing from the election
process, but I've never seen it suggested that a new source of
money was missing from the election process,'' Flaherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills would impose spending caps for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House proposal, gubernatorial candidates could spend
up to $3.95 million for an election, and people running for
constitutional offices could spend as much as $523,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill allows gubernatorial candidates to raise $5
million. Candidates for other statewide offices could collect
$750,000. State senate races would be capped at $105,000 and
candidates in House races could raise $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''People want the amount of money spent in campaigns to be
controlled or capped,'' said Roy Occhiogrosso, a spokesman for
Senate Democrats. ''People think there is too much money involved
in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say spending caps aren't worth considering in light
of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that they are unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. John G. Rowland has said he is open to campaign
finance reform, but insists that it include legislative races.

<HEADLINE> Sun shining on solar power, clean energy as oil prices rise  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Fed up with high gas prices? Costly
heating oil leaving you cold? A group of alternative energy
advocates have some ideas for you.
</P>
<P>
   A four-day conference this week sponsored by the Northeast
Sustainable Energy Association brought together advocates for solar
power, electric cars and other alternative energy systems.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was not just for environmental types. One of
Thursday's keynote speakers was Michael Morris, chairman and chief
executive of Northeast Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these advocates have been waiting since the oil crisis
of the 1970s for the mainstream public to choose earth-friendly and
energy-efficient systems to build homes, cars and public spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The computer revolution, electric deregulation, environmental
concerns and costly fossil fuel could converge to create a great
opportunity, said Warren Leon, executive director of the energy
association.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a number of signs suggesting we could be on the
brink of a new era and a dramatic transformation to clean energy,''
Leon said.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said a key factor in clean energy is electric
deregulation -- a series of laws in states around the country that
ended electric utility monopolies and allow consumers to choose
their power suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Many laws, including Connecticut's, require utilities to use
more nonpolluting power sources, such as solar, wind power or
hydroelectric plants.
</P>
<P>
   The system will allow electric companies to market power from
these sources, to attract environmentally driven customers.
</P>
<P>
   The laws also encourage research into generating power by the
sun, wind or fuel cells -- miniature power plants that generate
electricity chemically.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said it is possible in 10 or 20 years that each home and
business will have a fuel cell system.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds crazy, Morris said, imagine believing 20 years
ago that people today would be walking around with cellular
telephones in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will create new roles for traditional utilities,
away from generating power toward maintaining and designing such
systems for homes and businesses, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   NU, the largest electric utility in New England, plans to merge
with Consolidated Edison Inc. of New York, making one of the
largest electric utilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Solar power providers hope to reap some of the benefit from
states' deregulation laws that put money into research.
</P>
<P>
   This winter's home heating oil price spike is encouraging people
to think about alternate ways to heat their homes, said Dan
Greenberg of Applied Power Corp., a Waltham, Mass. company that
installs and designs solar systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this continues, there's a good chance it will lead to an
uptick in business,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   For people bemoaning high gas prices, a new option is available:
electric-gasoline hybrid cars.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Robert Maddox, R-Bethlehem, three weeks ago got the
Honda Insight, a hybrid that goes 75 miles on a gallon of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The car, loaded with air-conditioning and other extras, cost
$20,495, said Maddox, who put the car on display at the conference.

<HEADLINE> Argentine President Presents Shift  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GRAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- When Argentina's former President
Carlos Menem needed to travel abroad, he flew aboard Tango 01, a
Boeing 757 that cost $66 million and came complete with a bedroom,
sauna and working space for a hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
   Recently elected President Fernando De la Rua has decided to
travel lighter. Returning from his first overseas trip, he
disembarked from a commercial jetliner like any other passenger,
got in line at the airport in Buenos Aires and paid his customs
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The news made headlines, and the message was not lost: De la
Rua, the 62-year-old who took office Dec. 10, has shown in his
first 100 days that he wants to bring greater openness and
austerity to the presidency after Menem's 10 years of flamboyant
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Playing up his squeaky clean image, De la Rua won election for
the center-left opposition Alliance in October, harnessing voter
weariness with Menem's two terms and several corruption scandals,
none touching Menem personally.
</P>
<P>
   Charging through his first three months in office, De la Rua has
surprised many with a vigorous, take-charge attitude. The former
Buenos Aires mayor has moved quickly to revive Argentina's stalled
economy and enact promises of a more austere government.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has proven to be a stronger executive than I think anyone
thought,'' said Riordan Roett, an analyst at Johns Hopkins
University. ''He's taken on some tough issues and it seems he's
making all the right moves.''
</P>
<P>
   The country is struggling to shake off a yearlong recession that
left the unemployment rate as high as 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to prune a large federal deficit, De la Rua pushed
through a highly unpopular tax hike. The additional funds should
help Argentina trim its federal deficit by $2.5 billion -- from $7.1
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an intelligent start,'' said political analyst Felipe
Noguera. ''I'm not sure the man on the street is happy, but he's
doing these things because they are expected to bring benefits in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua's crowning achievement to date has been House passage
of his proposal to overhaul the country's antiquated labor laws,
against the protests of the country's once-powerful labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   He also argued in favor of allowing companies to determine their
pay scales -- a power that until now rested in the hands of national
union leaders and kept foreign investors at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The early victories have comforted the International Monetary
Fund, which recently approved a key $7.4 billion standby loan for
Argentina, one of the world's most indebted nations.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say De la Rua is making other important advances.
</P>
<P>
   He has worked to recast Argentina's government as more
transparent, at the same time that authorities are investigating
accusations of corruption against some former Menem officials.
</P>
<P>
   But drawing the contrast with Menem is not always easy.
</P>
<P>
   In January, De la Rua refused to use Tango 01 for his trip to
Sweden, instead flying first class aboard a commercial airliner.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua pledged to sell the luxury plane once in office, but
has been forced to back down. With the aircraft now only attracting
half its original price tag -- the highest bid has come in at $30
million -- it would prove a huge loss for a government preaching
fiscal restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Many say they welcome the change in style.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't totally agree with De la Rua's policies,'' said
Gabriel Gomes, a 36-year-old furniture store owner. ''But he has
brought some public confidence back into the presidency.''

<HEADLINE> Governor appoints Wall Street honcho to review Nassau's finances  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki's appointment of Wall
Street's Frank Zarb to review the beleaguered financial situation
in Nassau County appears to be winning praise from both Democrats
and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb, the chairman of the National Association of Securities
Dealers -- which runs the NASDAQ stock market -- is being brought in
to determine the extent of the county's problems, as well as to
offer solutions to closing a budget gap predicted to hit $200
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important to have an independent review,'' Pataki said at
a press conference Thursday in Manhattan. ''This is simply a
gathering of information and options at this stage. I am confident
Mr. Zarb will have full access to everything he needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican County Executive Thomas Gulotta said he thought
Zarb's presence could ''be a very positive and constructive
force.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference where he described his own proposal for
dealing with the budget gap, Gulotta suggested Zarb ''can help to
create the bipartisan support and the strength of political will
that is going to be necessary to resolve this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli,
chairman of the Nassau Democrats, both endorsed Pataki's choice of
Zarb, but said a fiscal oversight board would eventually be
required to cure the county's budget headaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''Considering that Nassau County's financial situation is at
crisis levels, the need for an outside evaluation is appropriate
and responsible,'' Silver said in a statement. DiNapoli called
Zarb's appointment ''an important step toward coming together and
determining that there is a need for a fiscal oversight board.''
</P>
<P>
   The county's bond rating is currently one notch above junk
status; it's precarious financial position helped fuel a voter
revolt last November that saw the county's legislative body taken
over by Democrats for the first time since 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb is a former chairman of the Long Island Power Authority,
where he helped with the state takeover of the Long Island Lighting
Co. He also sits on the board of directors at Hofstra University in
Hempstead.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a complex nuclear formula,'' said Zarb, who noted
he is a business partner of Felix Rohatyn, who helped solve New
York City's financial crisis in the 1970s. ''It's a pretty straight
ahead business problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarb, who lives on Long Island, said he intends to spend the
next a week or so ''crunching numbers.'' Pataki said there was no
time limit attached to Zarb's assignment, though he expects a
solution ''in weeks, not months.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta's budget plan includes union give-backs, increases in
parks and other fees, deferred payments to the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority for maintenance of Long Island Rail Road
stations and other cuts.
</P>
<P>
   He warned of tax increases if no action is taken on his proposal
within 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is a lack of political will, a lack of bipartisan
support, a lack of effort on the state or local level in order to
bring this about then very clearly there is going to be no
alternative but to increase local taxes,'' Gulotta said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, county Comptroller Fred Parolla announced his
own plan for solving the financial problem, the centerpiece of
which was a proposal to refinance $800 million in debt service
costs over a 14-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ''There appeared to be some good elements ... that could be
useful in terms of an overall five-year comprehensive plan,''
Gulotta said.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned, ''you've got to be a little bit careful when
you're restructuring debt because what you're really talking about
is taking the same debt, spreading it out over a long period of
time and ultimately increasing the expense of payback.''

<HEADLINE> Suit Against Viacom Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Clearing a possible hurdle in its merger with
CBS, Viacom won a legal decision against Chris-Craft Industries,
its half-partner in the UPN television network.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling late Thursday by a judge in New York State Supreme
Court also sets the stage for a change in ownership of UPN, which
has been coming back in recent months with popular shows such as
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   In throwing out Chris-Craft's complaint, Judge Herman Cahn let
stand a legal provision Viacom had triggered six weeks ago under
which Chris-Craft must decide by Monday to either buy the other
half of UPN from Viacom for $5 million or to sell its half to
Viacom for the same price. Viacom must abide by whatever
Chris-Craft decides.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders have already approved the CBS-Viacom merger, but
the deal is still awaiting clearance from regulators. The companies
hope to close the merger next month.
</P>
<P>
   If Viacom winds up owning all of UPN, it must get permission
from the Federal Communications Commission to own two networks at
the same time, which is forbidden under current rules.
</P>
<P>
   The spat over UPN centered over a clause in the partnership
agreement stipulating that neither partner could own an interest in
another network. Chris-Craft claimed Viacom violated the deal by
agreeing to merge with CBS, but the court sided with Viacom's
argument that it has not broken the terms since its merger with CBS
has not closed.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom had triggered the ''buy-sell'' section of the UPN
partnership agreement six weeks ago after becoming frustrated with
its negotiations with Chris-Craft over the future of the network.
</P>
<P>
   The talks have been ongoing since last fall, when Viacom
announced its deal to merge with CBS. At the time, it was the
largest merger in the media business, but has since been surpassed
by the AOL-Time Warner deal announced in January.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom released a statement from its chairman, Sumner Redstone,
late Thursday: ''We are pleased that Judge Cahn has ruled in our
favor and look forward to resolving the ownership of UPN.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Chris-Craft did not return a phone call seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom has said it would like to own the other half of the
network, and believes it make UPN profitable, especially once it
completes its merger with CBS and draw on management talent there.
</P>
<P>
   Long a distant contender to NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox, UPN has been
coming back in ratings recently thanks to popular shows like
wrestling. But it still has yet to turn a profit and has lost more
than $900 million since being founded in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Chris-Craft, a former boat builder, owns 10 television stations
in major markets through BHC, many of which are affiliates of UPN.
Viacom's media properties include MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon,
Blockbuster and the Paramount movie studio.

<HEADLINE> Iridium Receives Many Bid Offers  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID E. KALISH, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A California telephone entrepreneur was among
the bidders for Iridium LLC as the satellite-based mobile phone
company tries to find a lifesaver before a midnight deadline.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear late Thursday whether a credible buyer could be
found in time to keep Iridium's 66 satellites in orbit. Motorola
Corp., Iridium's creator and biggest investor, was prepared at
11:59 p.m. tonight to shut down Iridium, soon disconnecting its
customers and letting the satellites burn up in the Earth's
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium and its investors were reviewing several bids to see
whether to submit them to a New York bankruptcy court on Friday, a
source familiar with the proceedings said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The bidders were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   One bidder to come forth was Gene Curcio, owner of Los
Angeles-based Crescent Communications Inc., a privately held
telecommunications company. Curcio was finalizing details crucial
to its offer, said Sa'id Mosteshar, a lawyer for Curcio.
</P>
<P>
   Mosteshar declined to give the size of his client's offer, or
the names of investors in the bid. But Curcio wants Motorola to
agree to continue operating Iridium's satellites for another 60 to
90 days, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are close to an agreement,'' Mosteshar said. Spokesmen for
Motorola and Iridium declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   After the three-month period, Curcio has arranged for General
Dynamics Corp. to take over operation of the satellites. Curcio
plans to use the Iridium system to provide mobile-phone service in
areas of the world poorly served by land-based phones, such as in
remote parts of Brazil, Africa and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium, which has mustered only 50,000 subscribers since
launching service in the fall of 1998, has debts of about $4.4
billion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Press India, Pakistan  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is taking a confrontational
approach on nuclear weapons in India and Pakistan, suggesting he'll
caution the nuclear neighbors that good relations with the United
States may depend on their exercise of restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will make clear our view that a nuclear future is a
dangerous future for them and for the world,'' Clinton said in
advance of next week's trip to the Indian subcontinent. He will
visit Bangladesh, spend five days in India and conclude his trip
with a brief stop in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's sharp words came even though many analysts of the
region have suggested he'll have little clout in persuading either
India or Pakistan to scale back their burgeoning nuclear and
missile programs, particularly in view of last fall's Senate
rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged such views, but in a videotaped address to
a Carnegie conference on nonproliferation said he would not accept
the nuclear status quo there. ''I will not do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said India and Pakistan have legitimate security
concerns, but that a nuclear competition endangers the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I'll stress that narrowing our differences on
nonproliferation is important to moving toward a broader
relationship,'' Clinton said. India and Pakistan stunned the world
with back-to-back nuclear tests in 1998. Although both nations have
said they plan no further tests, neither has made any movement
toward signing onto the test-ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday at a White House briefing, Sandy Berger,
Clinton's national security adviser, said ''our ultimate goal would
be to persuade them to give up their nuclear program.''
</P>
<P>
   Short of that, Berger said he was hoping that both nations would
demonstrate restraint in their nuclear programs and ''implement a
policy that does limit the expansion of these programs,'' adopt
policies banning exports of nuclear materials or technology and
sign and ratify the test ban treaty, even if the United States has
not yet ratified it.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's refusal to ratify the treaty, which has been signed
by more than 150 countries, was a major blow to the
administration's foreign policy. Of the 44 nuclear-capable
countries that must ratify the pact for it to take effect, only 20
have done so.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the United States also would continue to press both
India and Pakistan ''to stop the production of fissile material,
which is the fuel, in a sense, for nuclear weapons, and to join
with us in seeking to negotiate a fissile material cutoff treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first presidential visit to India in 22 years,
the first to Pakistan since 1969 and the first ever to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, Clinton will urge that deposed Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif be spared execution if he is convicted on charges of
hijacking, terrorism, kidnapping and attempted murder, Berger said.
He also said Clinton will be given an opportunity for a live
television address to press for a return to democracy after last
year's military coup and raise concerns about terrorism and
tensions over the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir and clashed
again last summer with more than 1,000 casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The bitterness escalated after a military coup in Pakistan in
October by Gen. Pervez Musharraf and the hijacking of an Indian
Airlines jet in December by Kashmiri militants.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pakistan has suggested it would welcome U.S. mediation
in the dispute over Kashmir, India has made it clear it does not
see such a U.S. role. Clinton simply will urge the two sides to
exercise restraint over Kashmir and resume dialogue, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   A major objective of the trip is to establish better U.S.
relations with India, clouded by years of mutual suspicion during
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 50 years, America's relationship with India has been
viewed through the prism of the Cold War and its aftermath,''
Berger said. ''President Clinton has been determined to get this
partnership on track for the benefit of Indians and Americans
alike. We want to deepen ties between our governments, our private
sectors, our scientists, our citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl R. Inderfurth, assistant secretary of state for South Asian
affairs, said the trip is ''long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This trip should have taken place two years ago, almost three
years ago,'' he said. But changes in government and the nuclear
tests led to the delay.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ''I think that the Indians are very appreciative of the
fact that we're coming. And that we're coming in a serious
fashion,'' Inderfurth added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Make Offer to Iran  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is set to declare
it will lift a ban on the import of luxury goods from Iran and
propose a settlement of claims in a bid to encourage reformists in
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   The net effect is to begin to reverse more than two decades of
estrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is making the moves in a
major policy speech here today to the American-Iranian Council, a
private group based in Princeton, N.J., that seeks better relations
with Tehran, a senior U.S. official told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The partial easing of sanctions and the offer to have claims
against each other adjudicated is being coupled with a renewed
proposal for formal talks, said the official, who spoke Thursday
night only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Iran, a Persian Gulf country that the Clinton
administration accuses of promoting terrorism, has not responded to
the U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Even as President Clinton this week extended sanctions against
Iran, the administration explored ways to encourage reformists
there.
</P>
<P>
   One way under consideration and then approved was to lift the
ban on imports of such Iranian goods as carpets, caviar and
pistachio nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Trade in oil, oil equipment and other major economic areas will
remain prohibited for Americans, said the official, who has read
Albright's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Another official, who also declined to be identified, said the
administration was determined to make ''significant gestures'' to
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. hostility to the Islamic fundamentalists who run the
country has its roots in the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
by revolutionaries in 1979 and the holding of Americans seized
there hostage in defiance of traditional diplomatic practice.
</P>
<P>
   Iran remains on the State Department's list as a sponsor of
terrorism, one of seven countries so branded. For Cuba, for
instance, this has meant an unwavering boycott and rhetorical
denunciations.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Syria, also on the list, is being courted by the
administration to make peace with Israel. Clinton has visited
Damascus and met with President Hafez Assad in Damascus and in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea was advised by American diplomats last week how to
get off the list and thereby become eligible for trade and economic
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Iran presumably would be barred from both as long as it is
deemed a supporter of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, a major U.S. complaint against Iran is that it
provides Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon with the weapons with
which they have attacked and killed Israeli soldiers based in a
buffer zone inside southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery is facilitated by Syria, which controls much of
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sanctions can be modified at any time,'' James B. Foley, a
State Department spokesman, said earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe there are important changes in Iran, and we are
considering ways to respond to those changes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conciliatory statements by Iranian President Mohammed Khatami
and then the election last month to parliament of candidates
considered moderate by some American analysts have accelerated
moves within the administration to open talks with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have questioned whether an easing of sanctions
would elicit a response or simply amount to a unilateral U.S.
concession.
</P>
<P>
   An easing of sanctions also may be interpreted as suggesting
that U.S. attempts to isolate Iran economically have not succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and other top U.S. officials have stressed that in any
formal meeting the administration would level charges that Iran
supports terrorism, is trying to sabotage Middle East peacemaking
and seeks weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the United States exempted agricultural and medical
products from sanctions on Iran and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are looking for ways to respond to changes in Iran, and to
advance prospects for a better relationship,'' Foley said. ''It is
something that is under internal consideration -- how best to
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Rodman, a former White House and State Department
official, said Thursday ''it behooves us to pay attention'' to
changes in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Rodman said in an interview, ''we shouldn't
be giving up all our leverage for free, which is why I would be
very careful in lifting sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, now with the Nixon Center, a private research group,
said most experts agree Iran's foreign policy ''is very inimical to
our interests.''

<HEADLINE> Oscar Awards Apparently Stolen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- A shipment of Oscars that were to
be handed out at this month's Academy Awards ceremony have
apparently been stolen, just weeks after thousands of Oscar ballots
were lost.
</P>
<P>
   ''The statuettes have turned up missing in the city of Bell and
we believe they have been stolen,'' Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences spokesman John Pavlik said late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to elaborate, saying Academy Executive Director
Bruce Davis would discuss the matter at a news conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Academy President Robert Rehme told The Hollywood Reporter
the statuettes were being shipped from Chicago when they
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were some Oscars that we had on a truck that are either
missing or stolen,'' Rehme said. ''We don't know how, where or why.
We never had them in our possession. We expect them to be returned,
but we're not sure. It's been two days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oscars hadn't been inscribed yet, Rehme said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear how many Oscars were taken. Pavlik said he
believed all 54 that were to be presented were missing, while Rehme
said ''a crateful'' had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   According to a brief statement from the academy, the Oscars
vanished from a dock used by Roadway Express, the academy's regular
shipping company. An after-hours message left with the Akron,
Ohio-based delivery company was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, sacks containing 4,000 ballots were
misrouted after delivery to the Beverly Hills Post Office by an
accounting firm. The Academy was forced to print and mail new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for returning the ballots was extended from March
21 to March 23, just three days before the awards show.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges N. Ireland Coalition  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GALVIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In personal and direct appeals, President
Clinton is urging key players in Northern Ireland to restore the
region's coalition government and avoid a renewal of violence.
''Whatever the differences,'' he said, ''it's not worth another
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke to a gala dinner attended by such influential
leaders as Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and David Trimble of the Ulster
Unionist Party before holding five separate meetings today and
hosting a St. Patrick's Day reception at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The president told the leaders joining more than 1,000 guests at
the annual America Ireland Fund dinner Thursday that he was proud
of the supporting role he had played in the peace process, noting
that ''the cease-fires now are measured in years, not weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   But he reminded them that his term in office was fast coming to
an end and admitted he was ''more burdened by the fact that I have
not found an answer to the present stalemate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I must confess as your friend that I still do not know the
answers,'' he said. ''But I do know life is fleeting, and
opportunities come, and also go. We have the chance of a lifetime
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson,
who suspended Northern Ireland's coalition government last month
because the Irish Republican Army refused to give up its weapons,
said he was ''growing impatient.''
</P>
<P>
   He used a news conference to chide both sides: ''Stop walking
away. Stop the silence. Stop the name calling. Stop the blame
game,'' he said. ''Get back to serious talks, serious business.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials cautioned against expecting any breakthroughs
from the meetings in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton sought to cast the situation in a positive light as
he prepared to welcome Adams and Trimble, along with Bertie Ahern,
the Irish prime minister; John Hume, the Social Democratic Party
leader who shared a Nobel peace prize with Trimble; and Seamus
Mallon, who served as deputy first minister of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last century began with bloodshed across Ireland, and
across the United States and our cities signs that read, 'No Irish
Need Apply,''' Clinton said. ''This one begins with the best hope
for Irish peace in our lifetimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson was meeting in Washington today with Irish Foreign
Secretary Brian Cowen. British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Ahern
plan to meet in Lisbon next week.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson's decision on Feb. 11 to close down the new coalition
government in Northern Ireland came after Trimble vowed to withdraw
his unionist party because the IRA had not begun disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leaders noted that May 22 was the deadline for total
disarmament of the IRA and outlawed pro-British groups under the
1998 Good Friday agreement overseen by former Sen. George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists have refused to go back into the coalition government
before the IRA starts doing away with its weaponry. But the IRA has
never clearly said whether it will disarm. Sinn Fein, eager to
regain its two posts within the suspended 12-member administration,
argues the IRA might eventually disarm -- but only if unionists
allow the four-party coalition to work without obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Washington, Adams said he considered the May
22 deadline now irrelevant because the government had been shut
down. Adams laid blame with those who he said ''confused and
subverted the entire process'' by making demands that were not part
of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were using their meetings with the Northern
Ireland leaders to press for a resumption of the coalition
government and to seek flexibility from Trimble, while urging Adams
to ensure that the IRA takes concrete steps toward decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
   ''The suspension was not caused by any failure of the
institutions themselves, nor by any violation of the agreement, but
by an internal political crisis focused on the issue of
decommissioning,'' the Friends of Ireland said in a statement
Thursday. The executive committee of the group, which is made up of
U.S. lawmakers, includes Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We encourage the political leaders to bridge this crisis of
confidence and secure the reinstatement of the institutions as soon
as possible,'' the group said. ''Their absence creates a gap which
the enemies of peace can and will exploit.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Views McCain as Political Ally  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. CHARLES, Ill. (AP) -- George W. Bush insists he and John
McCain could make a dynamic duo in Washington, with the senator and
would-be president working together on issues such as overhauling
campaign financing and shoring up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor and presumptive Republican presidential
nominee put the positive spin on their relationship Thursday after
seeming dismissive of his former rival in a published interview.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that the Arizona senator helped produce record turnouts
in early primaries, Bush told The New York Times, ''Well, then, how
come he didn't win?'' Asked whether McCain had raised his
consciousness about reform, Bush replied, ''No, he didn't change my
views.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides said Thursday that the ''macho talk'' had killed
hopes for an early endorsement of Bush that could be vital to his
prospects of winning in November.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Allbaugh, Bush's campaign manager, called John Weaver,
McCain's top political adviser, to say he regretted that the
newspaper story didn't include more of the nice things Bush had
said about McCain. Allbaugh also reached out to reassure McCain's
allies in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''People want to focus on areas where we disagree,'' Bush told
reporters in Springfield during a campaign swing through Illinois
that included a fund-raiser to help replenish his depleted campaign
kitty. ''I'm going to focus on areas where we agree, and there's a
lot of areas of agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   He named Social Security and campaign finance reform as
examples.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was equally deferential at later appearances in Wheaton and
St. Charles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to thank the senator for his campaign. I want to thank
the senator for his strong ideas on reform,'' he told a dinner of
over 1,300 DuPage County Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raiser in Wheaton, he said: ''I think it's very
important for us to recognize the contributions John made.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's effort at fence mending came as he fended off fresh
criticism from Democratic rival Al Gore and waded into a nasty
dispute between the National Rifle Association and President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He said the NRA had ''gone too far'' by accusing Clinton of
having ''blood on his hands'' for failing to enforce gun laws
before a deadly shooting last year in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   After Bush aligned himself with conservative groups during the
primary campaign, he is trying to shift back toward the political
center for the general election. Gun control is popular among
independent-minded voters, particularly the suburban women that
Bush and Gore are both courting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says the Texas governor does the bidding of the gun lobby;
Bush strongly denies it.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is a gun rights supporter, Bush said: ''There's ways
to debate the issue without casting aspersions on the president
like that. I just think they've gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published in today's editions of USA Today, Gore
called upon Bush to join him in backing pending federal legislation
to require mandatory child-safety trigger locks for new firearms,
end a loophole that exempts purchasers of guns at gun shows from
background checks and ban cheap handguns known as Saturday Night
Specials.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, campaigning close to home in Chevy Chase, Md., Gore
criticized Bush's five-year, $483 billion tax-cut proposal as
''economic snake oil.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president cast the fall election as a choice between
policies that underwrote the ''Clinton-Gore recovery'' and ones
that gave America the ''Bush-Quayle catastrophe,'' meaning the
recession that hit when Bush's father was president.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is so committed to this economic snake oil that ... he even
dismissed John McCain's campaign and said that he had learned
nothing from it and had no intention of taking any advice from the
McCain group,'' Gore said, accepting an endorsement from ACORN, an
organization of neighborhood groups.
</P>
<P>
   In a subsequent speech to the Amalgamated Transit Union in
Washington, Gore asked: ''How can somebody come before the American
people with a straight face and say let's get rid of what's working
and go back to what failed?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush took the criticism curtly.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to leave the money in Washington,'' the governor
said, referring to the lack of broad tax relief in Gore's agenda.
''He'll say anything to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Illinois swing marked his return to the fund-raising
circuit for the first time since mid-December. His
$1,000-per-person event in Wheaton was expected to raise $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's record-shattering $73 million campaign fund has
been largely depleted by the contest with McCain. His team plans to
raise up to $10 million in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   Both contenders were taking a long weekend off the campaign
trail, with Gore staying at home in Washington and Bush spending
the time at his ranch outside Waco, Texas.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Vote a Test of Fear  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Worrying about threats of a Chinese
missile attack or invasion has become a presidential election
tradition in Taiwan's young democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's vote could be a test of how scared Taiwanese are of
China's massive military just 80 miles across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Despite China's threat to invade Taiwan if the island declares
independence, the candidate who has come out in favor of a
permanent split with Beijing has a good chance of winning the close
three-way race. Such a victory could mean Taiwanese believe the
latest warnings of war with China are a big bluff.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji indicated that if
opposition presidential hopeful Chen Shui-bian won the vote, he
could spark a conflict with China. Zhu also wouldn't rule out
threatening military displays before the vote, saying ''wait and
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders ''are telling Taiwanese voters you have to
decide whether you want to vote for peace or war,'' said Yang
Kai-huang, a political science professor at Soochow University in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's language was harsh, but nothing like Beijing's response to
Taiwan's first direct presidential election in 1996, when China
lobbed nuclear-capable missiles near the island's two major ports.
The United States sent two aircraft carriers and other warships to
the region to cool tensions.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Beijing is worried that if Chen is elected, he would
declare independence for Taiwan. China and Taiwan split amid civil
war in 1949, and Beijing has repeatedly threatened to invade if the
island tries to break away permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese investors were spooked by that prospect early in the
week, sending shares down almost 6.6 percent on Monday. Prices slid
sharply again Thursday, prompting the government to intervene with
massive purchases, but today prices finished almost 1 percent
higher in calmer dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chen, a former Taipei mayor, has said he would only
move Taiwan toward independence if Beijing attacks, his Democratic
Progressive Party still opposes reunification with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, China stepped up its threats, saying it would use
force if Taiwan indefinitely rebuffed reunification talks.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Nationalist Party has tried to capitalize on the
tension, blaming Chen for stirring up China and assuring voters
that its candidate, Vice President Lien Chan, could best deal with
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   TV ads for Lien have shown young men marching off to war,
chanting a popular slogan of Chen's party, ''Long live Taiwan
independence!'' Other commercials show a Chinese submarine cruising
in the Taiwan Strait armed with nuclear-tipped missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Bi-khim Hsiao, a Chen spokeswoman, said the attack ads were
trying to ''demonize and radicalize'' Chen's party and were
upsetting ''domestic harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the duty of the government to alleviate tensions and
fear, but what they are doing is promoting fear,'' Hsiao said.
''The KMT (Nationalist Party) is the source of tension today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hsiao said Chinese individuals, who she would not identify, have
been meeting with DPP officials in recent months, preparing for a
possible Chen victory. Some have seemed genuinely interested in
understanding the party's views, while others simply delivered
anti-independence lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Although Beijing hasn't endorsed a candidate, it's widely
believed that it prefers Lien, a moderate who has never favored
independence. Like the other presidential hopefuls, Lien has said
he would expand trade ties with China if it doesn't compromise
Taiwan's security.
</P>
<P>
   The third major candidate is independent James Soong, a former
Nationalist leader expelled from the party for campaigning against
Lien. Beijing probably prefers Soong to Chen -- who is widely known
by his nickname, Abian -- but China may see him as less predictable
following the former Taiwan provincial governor's recent falling
out with the Nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''If James Soong or Chen Shui-bian gets elected, it means people
have less fear of Zhu Rongji's remarks,'' said Alice Kao, a former
lawmaker with the pro-China New Party.
</P>
<P>
   Many Taiwanese have returned from abroad to vote, and Wu
Chun-hsiung, a real estate agent from Los Angeles, went beyond his
civic duty and actively campaigned.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all busy business people, but we have to do something at
this critical juncture,'' said Wu, as he passed out Chen flags to
Taipei office workers during the morning rush hour. ''China is such
an imposing hooligan. If they can't accept Abian, we can't expect
any other candidates to ease tensions with Beijing either.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Attacks Gore Over IRS Attempt  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan congressional report describing
attempts by Vice President Gore's office to obtain IRS taxpayer
data for a union is now a presidential campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush said Thursday
that two calls to the Internal Revenue Service by two Gore aides
raise ''serious ethical questions.'' Gore's presidential campaign
countered that ''the only legitimate tax issue'' is Bush's
''scandalous tax scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush called on the vice president to further explain the 1997
contacts, described by the bipartisan Joint Taxation Committee as
''in violation of written White House policies.''
</P>
<P>
   White House staff members are prohibited from ''any
communication of any type with the IRS'' without approval of the
counsel's office -- except for someone's own personal returns. The
IRS treats taxpayer information as confidential and indeed rebuffed
Gore's aides, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's office says the contacts by the aides, including his
chief counsel at the time, were a ''simple status check.'' But the
committee's report said the information sought by the aides appears
to have been protected by tax confidentiality laws.
</P>
<P>
   From the campaign trail, Bush called the report a ''troubling
revelation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I call on the vice president to explain: Why did he seek to
obtain secret information, and what did he want to know and why did
he want to know it?'' Bush said in Springfield, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the contacts, coupled with Gore's campaign
fund-raising problems in 1996, ''aren't mistakes. These are habits.
They raise serious ethical questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign press secretary Chris Lehane accused Bush of
making ''wildly exaggerated accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   An IRS memo said Gore sought the information, which involved the
classification of a group of workers, in preparation for a meeting
with a union official. The matter was turned over to IRS
investigators, but no action was taken, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee report's main focus was to answer allegations by
nonprofit conservative groups that they were audited because of
their anti-Clinton views.
</P>
<P>
   The committee found no evidence to support that contention, but
determined that Gore's office and the Treasury Department
apparently tried in separate instances to obtain confidential
information. The IRS is prohibited by law from releasing specific
taxpayer data in almost all instances -- unless a taxpayer requests
his or her own information.
</P>
<P>
   Lindy Paull, the committee's staff director, said an IRS memo on
the contacts indicated that after one member of the vice
president's staff was unsuccessful in getting the tax data, a
second official made another effort ''to get the same
information.''
</P>
<P>
   The staffers making the calls, according to the memo, were
Kumiki Gibson -- Gore's counsel at the time -- and Joe Eyer, another
aide. Both contacts were on Jan. 28, 1997. Neither official still
works for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the second call, the IRS memo writer, in a portion
read to The Associated Press, wrote, ''I received another call from
a Mr. Joe Eyer who I believe ... said was Ms. Gibson's boss. He too
said he was counsel to the vice president.'' Eyer, in fact, was
assistant to the deputy chief of staff, Gore's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The memo also said, ''During the course of this conversation, at
some point I was reminded that the vice president was meeting with
the union president the next day.''

   Vice presidential spokeswoman Laura Quinn said Eyer was not

<HEADLINE> Issue Ads Spending at Record Pace  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest groups seeking to influence elections
and legislation are on pace to spend record amounts on TV and radio
ads, and the tone already is more negative than in past years,
according to a report released today.
</P>
<P>
   More than $114 million has been spent or committed to
advertising by outside groups, based on a study of advertising
between January 1999 and March by the Annenberg Public Policy
Center at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising includes more attack ads than in previous years,
with about 40 percent of them criticizing a candidate or specific
legislation. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the public policy
center, says that suggests the 1999-2000 election cycle will be the
most negative ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like there's going to be a lot of it and it's going
to be attack oriented,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ads early in an election cycle were evenly divided
among attacks ads, advocacy ads promoting a candidate or position,
and contrast ads comparing the two parties. Attack ads became more
frequent as the election neared, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   As of early March, 37 groups have spent or plan to spend $114
million on issue ads this cycle. That includes a $20 million to $30
million pledge by Citizens for Better Medicare, a coalition led by
the pharmaceutical industry, and $20 million by U.S. Term Limits,
which supports legislation to limit the terms of members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One in four ads deal with health care -- the most popular issue --
including several by groups trying to defeat the ''patients' bill
of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Big spenders on that issue include the American Association of
Health Plans, a managed care trade group, at $5 million; the
Business Roundtable, $5.5 million; the Coalition for Affordable
Quality Healthcare, $9 million and the Health Benefits Coalition,
$3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues addressed so far are the environment, gun control,
term limits and education.
</P>
<P>
   That advertising could help shape the public debate, Jamieson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ordinarily, the environment is not on the top of the issue
agenda,'' she said. ''The question is if you have enough
advertising back and forth, are you able to elevate it on the
national agenda? We don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Environmental Trust has spent $11 million,
Republicans for Clean Air, $2.5 million and the Sierra Club has
spent $180,000, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1995-96 cycle, the center estimated that $135 million to
$150 million was spent on issue ads by 27 organizations, about a
quarter of total political ad spending over those years. In
1997-98, the figures more than doubled to 77 groups spending an
estimated $275 million to $340 million.
</P>
<P>
   With eight months remaining until the November elections,
spending for the 1999-2000 election cycle is on pace to set a
record, the center concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike advertisements by candidates, issue ads are sponsored by
outside organizations and are subject to little or no regulation as
long as they are created independently and do not explicitly tell
viewers who to vote for.
</P>
<P>
   Precise totals for ad spending were not available because these
groups are not required to say how much they are spending or who is
donating the money that pays for the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the center gathers estimates from media reports and
independent groups that are willing to reveal their spending.

<HEADLINE> Singh, Waldorf Lead at Bay Hill  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON, AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Tiger Woods' thrilling comeback to win
Pebble Beach last month seems to have had a lasting impact on a lot
of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, when Jim Furyk won the Doral-Ryder Open by making
up a 6-shot deficit on the final nine, he attributed his
perseverance to being paired with Woods at Pebble Beach and
marveling at how he never gave up.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Vijay Singh used what he learned at Pebble to forge
a tie for the lead with Duffy Waldorf after the first round of the
Bay Hill Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Singh was within striking distance of the Pebble Beach lead in
the final round until he made a bogey on the par-5 14th.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of gave up a little bit,'' he said, ''I shouldn't have
stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't at Bay Hill. Despite a sloppy bogey on the opening
hole, followed by another bogey from the bunker on the par-3 second
hole, Singh hunkered down, made six birdies and signed for a 68.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the way it's been for the last year. I get frustrated
very early and make a mistake,'' he said. ''But I'm kind of
changing the attitude a little bit and trying to not let any
mistakes bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, meanwhile, returned from a two-week break as if he never
left the tour. With birdies on all of the par 5s and no serious
mistakes, Woods breezed around Bay Hill for a 3-under 69 that left
him one stroke back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hitting it pretty solid,'' Woods said. ''I came back
refreshed and ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at 69 was Honda Classic winner Dudley Hart and one-hit
wonder Mike Nicolette, the Ping Golf club designer who won Bay Hill
in 1983, quit the tour five years later and was as shocked as
anyone to be so close to the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not in their league,'' Nicolette said. ''Today, I was in
their league. Tomorrow, it's a municipal course round. I might
shoot 89.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson was 5-under for his last seven holes to salvage a
70, tied with players like Mark O'Meara and Stuart Appleby.
</P>
<P>
   The two kids from the 20-and-under league -- Sergio Garcia and
18-year-old amateur Aaron Baddeley from Australia -- both shot 75s.
Baddeley's round was particularly maddening, having played steady
golf except for a triple-bogey at the par-5 sixth. It could have
been worse. John Daly had an 18 on that hole two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Martin made a double-bogey on the last hole for a 74.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Hill has a strong field, with six of the top seven players
in the world ranking. That wasn't lost on Singh.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before the tournament starts, we kind of look around and know
who's playing,'' Singh said of a field that includes seven of the
top eight players in the world ranking. ''It makes you fight a
little bit harder out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh was beaten in the first round of the Match Play
Championship by Waldorf, who is quietly developing into a
consistent contender. Waldorf was among seven players who won twice
on the PGA Tour last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wins kind of boost your confidence,'' Waldorf said. ''But
I think there are times where you have to go out and be confident
even if you're not making the putts or playing as well as you think
you should. That's the only way you're going to get to the place
where you want to be, which is contending and winning
tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   That's never been a problem for Woods, who hasn't finished lower
than 20th in a stroke-play event since he tied for 56th at Bay Hill
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Woods showed no signs of rust. Facing trouble on his opening
hole, he hit a flop shot from thick rough on No. 10 to within an
inch of the cup to save par, and got around with only a few
glitches after that.
</P>
<P>
   He birdied all of the par-5s and had eagle putts on three of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really didn't get myself in a lot of trouble,'' Woods said.
The lone exception was a 3-wood he sprayed into the trees on 18,
forcing him to pitch back to the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the third time in 13 rounds as a professional that
Woods shot in the 60s at Bay Hill, not a bad score in tricky
crosswinds that began in the morning and never let up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything under par is pretty good,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   With Woods, anything near the lead is not too bad, either.

<HEADLINE> FCC Trys To Stem Area Code Demand  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The explosion of cell phones, pagers and fax
machines -- along with a monopoly era system for allotting digits --
is endangering one of the most basic forms of personal information:
the telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   The country could run out of area codes within the next eight to
10 years, requiring callers to punch in more numbers than they do
now. To prevent that from happening, federal regulators are looking
for ways to stem the rapid depletion of phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission was expected today to
adopt rules that would allow states to more efficiently allocate
and manage phone numbers, such as taking back phone numbers that
carriers are holding but not using.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC also is considering changing the system so that numbers
can be allocated in blocks of 1,000 -- instead of 10,000 -- to
carriers. Under the existing system, created before there was
competition in the phone market, competing local carriers acquire a
block of 10,000 numbers for every billing region they wish to
serve. An area code may cover dozens or hundreds of such regions.
</P>
<P>
   If a carrier has only 100 customers in a given region, the
remaining 9,900 numbers of the block are tied up.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have successfully implemented other methods of
allocating numbers. Illinois, for example, has been conducting
trials of giving out blocks of 1,000 numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, regulators were told by the administrators of the
numbering plan two years ago that they would have to add another
area code. But when the state examined the situation more closely,
it discovered that there were 3 million numbers that had been
assigned to carriers that were not being used.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC let the state institute measures that included requiring
carriers to use at least 75 percent of their number block or be
within six months of running out of their numbers before they can
ask for more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not trying to keep people from numbers they need,'' said
Trina Bragdon, staff attorney with the Maine Public Utilities
Commission. But the state wants to make sure the need is there
before allotting numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, the commission has granted ten states temporary
authority to implement measures to conserve phone numbers. The FCC
also has been looking at steps to ensure that carriers are asking
for numbers based on actual usage rather than projected need.
</P>
<P>
   The numbering system, which also covers Canada and the
Caribbean, began with 84 area codes being assigned in 1947.
Sixty-four codes were gradually added through 1994, according to
the North American Numbering Plan Administration, which oversees
the system.
</P>
<P>
   But then the number of area codes being assigned rapidly
increased, adding 23 in 1996, 44 in 1997, 28 in 1998 and 42 in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of competition in the local phone market, as well as
the popularity of new services like wireless, have contributed to
the pressure on the numbering system.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of that demand is racing in and that puts us in the unique
position we're in today,'' said John Manning, senior technical
liaison for the numbering administration.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say they want to minimize disruptions to consumers
and businesses. Each area code change forces people to learn new
dialing patterns, and many must upgrade equipment and reprint
business cards, stationery and advertising. Alarm companies also
must reprogram auto-dialing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators will continue to review some proposals that
would require a more extensive overhaul -- like charging carriers
for the numbers or adding digits to the numbering system -- that
could be implemented in the future.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Women's Tournament Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unable to finish the job on its first try, the Northeast
Conference is getting a second shot at Iowa State in the NCAA
basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   St. Francis, the Northeast Conference champion, plays Iowa State
tonight in the first round of the women's tournament. Though
third-seeded Iowa State is expected to handle its 14th-seeded foe
easily, the same was thought of the Iowa State men against Central
Connecticut on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Central Connecticut, also of the NEC, tied the game at 69 before
second-seeded Iowa State pulled away to an 88-78 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was getting excited watching the game, especially when it
was tied,'' St. Francis scoring leader Jess Zinobile said. ''People
didn't think the game was going to be that close at all, and I
think a lot of people are overlooking our team, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Midwest Regional game in Ames, Iowa, is one of 16 being
played at eight sites tonight in the tournament's opening round.
Sixteen more games are on tap Saturday, also at eight sites.
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranked Connecticut (30-1), which has a home game with
Hampton (16-14) in the East Regional, is the only No. 1 seed
playing tonight. The other top seeds are Tennessee in the Mideast,
Louisiana Tech in the Midwest and Georgia in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lift St. Francis (23-7) got from watching Central
Connecticut, Iowa State holds every advantage against the Red
Flash, starting with the Hilton Coliseum crowd, which will be
13,000 and loud.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones (25-5) also are much taller in the middle and they
have sensational outside shooters. Led by second-team All-American
Stacy Frese, Iowa State is averaging nine 3-point baskets a game
and has made as many as 18 in a single night.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have seven people that shoot the three, it's coming
from everywhere,'' St. Francis coach Myndi Hill said. ''We've got
to be on our feet, we've got to have our feet moving, get our heads
up and get around screens.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn (21-7) also will need some tough defense in its Midwest
Regional game with Southwest Missouri State (23-8) in State
College, Pa. Auburn has to worry about one shooter: national
scoring leader Jackie Stiles.
</P>
<P>
   Stiles averages 27.7 points and scored 56 in the semifinals of
the Missouri Valley Conference tournament. She has taken almost
twice as many shots as anyone else on the team and can score off
the dribble, coming off a screen, on the run or with spin moves.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to have a great defensive plan to stop her,'' Auburn
coach Joe Ciampi said. ''Every indication is good things happen
when she has the ball. To be the leading scorer and have your team
win 23 ball games says a lot about the person and the team.''
</P>
<P>
   After complaining about being sent to Iowa State for the first
round of the tournament the last two years, Oregon finally gets to
play at home. The Ducks (23-7), seeded sixth in the West, play
11th-seeded Alabama-Birmingham (19-12).
</P>
<P>
   Oregon point guard Shaquala Williams said she and her teammates
are loose and ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we don't have much to lose, because people aren't
expecting us to go out and play well after the first round,'' said
Williams, who led the Ducks to the Pac-10 championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't lose any respect, because we don't really have any.
So I think we can use that as a motivating factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Third-seeded Mississippi State (23-7) was to have been the host
for that subregional but could not guarantee enough hotel rooms.
The Lady Bulldogs play St. Peter's (23-7) in the other game on
Oregon's floor.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton is bucking history in its game with Connecticut. As a
No. 1 seed, the Huskies have won their first-round games by an
average of 40 points. They beat St. Francis 97-46 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll have to play one of the better games we've ever
played,'' Hampton coach Patricia Bibbs said. ''Whatever we do, we
better try to do it better than the 30 others that didn't get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   In Baton Rouge, La., Liberty (23-7) will make its fourth
straight NCAA appearance when it plays LSU (22-6) in the East
Regional. Liberty did not get past the first round in its three
previous trips.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first game is always a national championship game for
us,'' coach Carey Green said. ''Well, this is our national
championship game against LSU.''

<HEADLINE> New Wireless Technology Hold Promise  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wireless technology under development holds
the promise of letting phones and radios of the future be updated
as new cutting-edge services become available.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, called software-defined radio, could reduce the
need for consumers to get additional equipment or hardware to
access advanced services as they evolve.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a cellular phone containing the software could
download services over the airwaves like investment packages or
music -- the same way those features would be downloaded to a
desktop computer. The services could be upgraded over time, without
requiring additional hardware.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission today is beginning the
process of looking at the technology to see how it can be harnessed
to benefit consumers and more efficiently use frequencies.
Regulators want to make sure the technology would comply with
existing standards that govern the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has taken particular interest in software-defined
radio as a way to better manage the nation's airwaves. The
technology enables devices to seek out pockets of the airwaves that
are not being used locally and adapt to those frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if several broadcasters are covering the same
sporting match, they could use software-defined radios to seek out
frequencies that taxi drivers in the area might not be using in
order to broadcast, according to commission officials.
</P>
<P>
   It could be several years before consumers see software-defined
radio devices in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The technology can be compared to a computer that can handle
running different applications, said Stephen Blust, director of
technology strategy and standards for BellSouth Cellular and
chairman of the Software Defined Radio Forum, an industry group
working on the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Today, wireless devices are built for certain bands of
frequencies and other specifications. Making them operate on
multiple systems adds weight and size to the device, making it
unwieldy for consumers, Blust said.
</P>
<P>
   But using software-defined radio, a cellular phone would be able
to operate with disparate standards used by different mobile
services. One practical advantage would be to make it easier for
mobile phones to work wherever consumers go, giving them added
flexibility to choose which products they want.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just open a whole new vista with this,'' said Blust.
</P>
<P>
   The technology also has important consequences for public safety
personnel who use communication systems operating on different
frequencies. Software-defined radio helps to make these
incompatible systems work with each other.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   After watching other teams pull off a four-way trade
at the
winter meetings, Texas, Toronto and Montreal got together for a
three-way deal.
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, Toronto sent David Segui and $825,000 to Texas, which
then dealt Lee Stevens to the Expos. To complete Thursday's deal,
Montreal sent Brad Fullmer to the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how happy David would be DHing,'' Toronto manager
Jim Fregosi said. ''David will play more first with Texas than he
would have here.''
</P>
<P>
   Segui hit a combined .298 for Seattle and Toronto last season,
with 14 homers and 52 RBIs. A .285 career hitter, he was dealt by
Seattle on July 28 for pitchers Tom Davey and Steve Sinclair,
became a free agent after the season, then signed a $4,325,000,
one-year contract to stay with the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens batted .282 last season for the Rangers, setting career
highs with 24 homers and 81 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I figured that they would release me before they would trade
me,'' Stevens said. ''It's going to be tough leaving Texas, because
it's the only place I have ever really stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fullmer split last season between Montreal and Triple-A Ottawa.
He batted .277 for the Expos with nine homers and 47 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''My bat is my meal ticket,'' he said. ''I don't foresee any
problems as a DH, but I always thought my fielding was OK.'
</P>
<P>
   It was just three months ago that Colorado, Milwaukee, Oakland
and Tampa Bay joined for a nine-player deal at the winter meetings
involving Vinny Castilla, Rolando Arrojo, Jeff Cirillo, Scott Karl
and Aaron Ledesma.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, it was a high-scoring day as the San Francisco
Giants beat the Milwaukee Brewers 18-14, the Pittsburgh Pirates
defeated the Boston Red Sox 14-11 and the Cleveland Indians rallied
past the Kansas City Royals 11-10.
</P>
<P>
   At Scottsdale, Ariz., Milwaukee made eight errors and lost its
fifth straight.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Mark Loretta and first baseman Brian Banks made two
errors each for the Brewers, who have 13 in two games. Right
fielder Damon Hollins, pitcher Jim Bruske, catcher Creighton
Gubanich and second baseman Lou Collier also had error, but San
Francisco only scored three unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was probably one of the worst games you are ever going to
watch,'' Brewers manager Davey Lopes said. ''I'm not going to sit
here and criticize individuals. You can surmise it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Bradenton, Fla., Pat Meares went 4-for-4 with three RBIs and
hit two of Pittsburgh's seven home runs. Kevin Young, starting
pitcher Todd Ritchie, John Vander Wal, Bruce Aven and Keith Osik
also homered for the Pirates. Aven's shot was a grand slam in the
fourth inning. Israel Alcantara homered for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was just one of those Florida days at McKechnie Field
where the wind was blowing and took everything right out of the
park,'' Meares said. ''I don't put a whole lot of stock in this.
It's nice to get some hits, but spring training really doesn't
matter. None of this starts counting until April 3, when we start
playing for real.''
</P>
<P>
   At Winter Haven, Fla., Dave Roberts hit a grand slam and Enrique
Wilson capped Cleveland's nine-run ninth inning with a three-run
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's home run off Billy Brewer followed a two-run hit by
Jacob Cruz and Roberts' grand slam, both off Ken Ryan. It mirrored
Kansas City's 1999 regular season, when the Royals' bullpen blew 30
saves.
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
Twins 7, Reds 5:
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla., Ken Griffey Jr. hit his fourth home run of
the spring, a drive into the lake behind the right-field wall off
LaTroy Hawkins.
Dodgers 9, Mets (ss) 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Vero Beach, Fla., Shawn Green hit his first home run in a Los
Angeles uniform, and Devon White, F.P. Santangelo and Paul LoDuca
also homered. Mike Hampton allowed seven runs and 12 hits in 5 1-3
innings.
Orioles 9, Mets (ss) 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Port St. Lucie, Fla., Albert Belle and Greg Myers hit their
first home runs of the spring.
Astros 6, Braves (ss) 5:

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Investors Unfazed by tension  </HEADLINE>
By JOE McDONALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Yang Da-cheng hears China's threats to
attack his Taiwanese homeland. Then he gets back to work building
an amusement park for the children of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   As with Yang at his Shanghai Dream Park, thousands of Taiwanese
investors in China are conducting business as usual despite growing
tensions before Taiwan's presidential election Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   While the close economic ties make force less likely, China last
month spelled out its bottom line: It will attack if Taiwan goes
independent, foreign forces intervene or Taiwanese refuse
indefinitely to negotiate unification.
</P>
<P>
   But commercial relations with the mainland are so smooth, Yang
said, that officials don't need to reassure him, as they once might
have, that his $400 million project is in no danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''They understand us. They realize we're not political, and this
doesn't affect business,'' said Yang, president of the 700-member
Shanghai Association of Taiwan Businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese have been investing in China for a decade, binding the
two sides closer together even as political ties languish and the
rival governments trade gibes and threats. If this standoff had a
peace movement, its activists would be executives in sober blue
suits and their slogan would be, ''Make money, not war.''
</P>
<P>
   China has been the focus of Taiwanese investment since the early
1990s, when the island lifted a ban on business ties dating to the
two sides' split amid civil war in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Taiwanese have pumped some $30 billion into China
and created millions of jobs. Factories set up to take advantage of
low Chinese wages make shoes, umbrellas and other goods that bring
in billions of dollars in export revenues. There are an estimated
800,000 Taiwanese businesspeople on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   But Taiwan still bans direct travel, forcing businesspeople to
visit the mainland via Hong Kong and other offshore spots. And, to
avoid becoming dependent on its giant neighbor, Taiwan limits
individual investments in what it calls a ''patience policy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Even under such unhappy circumstances, investment and trade
will continue to increase,'' said Daniel Chen, executive vice
president of the Industrial Bank of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese companies have grown into a major commercial presence
in China, selling everything from office furniture to bottled
water. Dinghsin International Group claims the title of China's
biggest maker of instant noodles, selling 4 billion packets a year.
It has 22,000 employees in 30 mainland factories.
</P>
<P>
   And a new wave of companies from Taiwan's booming computer
industry is setting up factories both for export and to supply the
growing Chinese domestic market.
</P>
<P>
   Yang's Shanghai Dream Park, set on 200 acres where factories
once stood, also targets increasingly affluent mainland consumers.
Yang said it will employ about 2,000 people after its planned
opening next year.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist on the relationship, Chinese electronics maker
Bubugao Ltd. has imported Taiwan pop singer Chang Hui-mei to appear
in advertising on the mainland for its CD players and televisions.
</P>
<P>
   The latest escalation in China-Taiwan relations comes as Taiwan
prepares for Saturday's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Independence-minded Chen Shui-bian is a leading contender.
Although Chen has softened his earlier stance, saying he would only
declare independence if China attacked, his position has attracted
Beijing's ire.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Taiwan's biggest conglomerate issued a statement
Tuesday calling for whoever is elected president not to antagonize
China by advocating independence.

<HEADLINE> Papal Visit Signals Healing, Hurt  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- At the Western Wall, a 13-year-old boy shrouded
in an oversized white prayer shawl recites Torah passages under the
supervision of a black-coated rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's proud relatives ululate and toss sweets to celebrate
his bar mitzvah, the Jewish rite of passage to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Snapping pictures, Christian pilgrims take in the scene from
behind a low barrier a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   For many, it is their first direct encounter with Jewish ritual,
and lends immediacy to a 2,000-year-old question: Can two faiths
that so directly challenge each others' basic beliefs learn to
accept one another?
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, who will visit the Holy Land late this month,
has gradually steered his church of 1 billion followers away from
the centuries-old ''Teaching of Contempt'' that says the Jews'
exile was punishment for the crucifixion of Jesus. Instead, he has
affirmed the validity of the Jews' own, separate covenant with God.
</P>
<P>
   Still, persecution of Jews by Christians through the ages, from
the Crusades to the Inquisition to the Holocaust, has left deep
wounds, and the pontiff's March 20-26 visit has brought resentments
to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Posters denouncing the pope as an anti-Semite and a pagan have
appeared in ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods. Even mainstream rabbis
are uneasy about what they call the desecration of the Sabbath
being caused by the visit: Thousands of Jews will have to work on a
Saturday to protect the pope.
</P>
<P>
   But the tension cuts both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's governments, which rest on the support of
ultra-Orthodox political parties, have been perceived as
occasionally insensitive to Christian interests.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Christians, including Roman Catholics, are sometimes
denied access to Jerusalem's holy sites because of Israeli closures
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip -- a complaint recently raised by
the pope's envoy, Archbishop Pietro Sambi, on Israeli television.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest dispute in Jerusalem's Old City, a parcel of land
containing the ruins of a Crusader church -- which some say may have
been built where Jesus was sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate --
has been leased to a Jewish seminary for use as an outdoor
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In a further complication, Israel has been riled by the
Vatican's recent political agreement with the PLO, which challenges
Israeli control of all of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, dialogue often seems impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Rossing, an interfaith activist, said that for Jews --
already a tiny minority of 14 million in a world with 2 billion
Christians -- the biggest obstacle is evangelism, a core commandment
of Christianity. The actual number of converts is tiny, though --
about 2,200 out of an Israeli population of 6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Holsinger, a 55-year-old school nurse from Dayton,
Ohio, said it was her duty to try to convert Jews, albeit with
kindness and patience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe they (the Jews) are blinded for our sake,''
Holsinger said during a sightseeing stop at the Western Wall, the
last remnant of the Jewish Temple.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are the prayer warriors for them to see that the Messiah
has come,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli tour guide Daniel Rosenblum said that for many of his
Christian customers, especially evangelicals, acceptance of Judaism
seems difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''They always try to persuade me (to accept Jesus). It sticks in
their throat that I, as a Jew, am unwilling to accept that Jesus is
the Messiah,'' said the secular Rosenblum.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes non-acceptance turns into hostility, he said. At the
Wall, for example, some pilgrims snicker or crack jokes at the
sight of black-coated Jews swaying in prayer or tying phylacteries
around their arms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The change in Catholic doctrine is often slow to filter down to
the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Angelika Aschenbrenner, a Catholic pilgrim, said that as
recently as 15 years ago, priests in her hometown of Deckendorf,
Germany, told worshippers that Jews had defiled the communion
wafers and Catholics had to do extra penance for that sin.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's chief rabbi, Meir Lau, gives much of the credit for the
change in doctrine to John Paul II, who he called one the best
friends Jews have ever had.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the Catholic Church has not done enough to confront
its actions during the Holocaust and should condemn the failure of
World War II-era Pope Pius XII to speak out against the Nazi
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Lau, who like John Paul was born in Poland, will receive the
pontiff at his Jerusalem office on March 23 and accompany him to
Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial.
</P>
<P>
   In their last meeting near Rome in 1993, the pope told Lau he
remembered Lau's grandfather, a prominent rabbi in Cracow where the
pontiff lived before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The pope recalled how Lau's grandfather walked to synagogue on
the Sabbath, surrounded by dozens of grandchildren, and asked how
many had survived the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Five of 47, Lau said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope was deeply saddened by the answer, Lau said, and told
him mankind had an obligation to ensure the future of ''our older
brothers, the Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Lau's office, city worker Dudu Atias sandblasted
graffiti reading ''Don't meet with the Pope'' off the stone facade.
</P>
<P>
   Next to him, five activists of the tiny Jewish extremist group
Kach posed for TV cameras, holding anti-pope posters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tensions, many believe the very fact that the pope
is visiting Israel -- Pope Paul VI did not even mention the Jewish
state by name during his one-day drip in 1964 -- signals a turning
point.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important message (of the visit) is that the exile is
over,'' said Rabbi David Hartman, head of a Jerusalem seminary.
''There is no longer a notion of wandering Jews. They have regained
their biblical status of the People of the Covenant.''

<HEADLINE> Officer fatally shoots unarmed man in Manhattan  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A struggle with an undercover police officer
left an unarmed man fatally shot. Now police are trying to
determine whether the officer's weapon was fired accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   The early Thursday shooting -- the second fatal police shooting
this year -- happened just two weeks after police shot and killed an
unarmed man in the Bronx. Eleven people died in police shootings
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest shooting, Patrick Dorismond, 25, of East Flatbush,
Brooklyn, died from a bullet wound to the chest at St. Clare's
Hospital in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, three undercover officers from a narcotics
module of the NYPD's Gang Investigation Unit had been performing
drug buy-and-bust operations in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   They had made eight arrests Wednesday night involving drugs,
said Police Commissioner Howard Safir at a news conference Thursday
at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   At about 12:30 a.m. Thursday, the officers were near the Wakamba
Bar at 37th Street and Eighth Avenue -- a few blocks from Penn
Station and Madison Square Garden -- and one of the cops approached
two men standing in front of the location, Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men was Dorismond, who was employed by the 34th
Street Partnership -- a group of businesses in the midtown area -- as
part of its security force. Richard Dillon, the partnership's vice
president of security and operations did not release any
information regarding Dorismond's employment history.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said the officer engaged the men in ''a conversation
relative to drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the undercover officer asked the men where he could buy
marijuana. The men took offense, and a scuffle broke out, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The undercover officer was attacked by these two
individuals,'' Safir said. ''He was wearing a transmitting device
and he gave a signal that he was in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Detective Anthony Vasquez, who was standing about 20-30 feet
away, came to the aid of the officer, said Safir.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani added that Vasquez's firearm discharged
once during the altercation. ''Patrick Dorismond was hit in his
chest and subsequently expired,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   No drugs or other contraband were found on Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said police were investigating how the gun went off.
According to the police source, the undercover officer who was
allegedly attacked by the two men, told the District Attorney's
office one of the men yelled ''Get the gun!,'' which resulted in
the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Police could not immediately confirm alleged eyewitness reports
that Vasquez was hitting Dorismond with his service revolver when
it went off.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said Dorismond had been arrested three times in Brooklyn:
in 1987, when he was 13, for robbery and assault; in 1993 for
attempted robbery and assault; and in 1996 for criminal possession
of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez, 29, of Suffolk County, had three ''incidents'' on his
record, police said. In January of 1996, while he was still in the
Police Academy, he shot a Rottweiler that was attacking his family.
The shooting was deemed justified.
</P>
<P>
   In February of 1997, he pulled out his service revolver to break
up a fight in Pennsylvania, but he did not fire it and no one was
injured. Vasquez was placed on modified duty -- his gun and badge
were taken away and he was assigned to a desk job. He was returned
to full duty on Nov. 14, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Just four days before returning to full duty, Vasquez was
involved in a domestic dispute with his wife, but the incident was
deemed unsubstantiated, police said. Vasquez has been on the force
for almost five years.
</P>
<P>
   This shooting comes just two weeks after another undercover
officer fatally shot an unarmed man in the Soundview section of the
Bronx, blocks from where unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo was shot
and killed last year by four police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Ferguson, 23, was carrying heroin and fleeing police
when he was killed inside a Bronx apartment building on March 1.
The officers pursuing him had clearly identified themselves, police
said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson's death came days after a jury acquitted all four
officers of murder in the Diallo case, and it sparked some outrage
among residents who claim police officers can get away with murder
in minority neighborhoods. Both Ferguson and Diallo were black.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Giuliani urged citizens not to jump to conclusions
about the latest police shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone should allow the facts to be analyzed and
investigated without people trying to let their biases, their
prejudices, their emotions, their stereotypes, dictate the
result,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Reno Defends Refusal on Gore Counsel  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno is reluctant to
release a memo critical of her for retaining control of the
campaign finance investigation and defends her refusal to order an
independent counsel probe of Vice President Al Gore in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes she is tempted to release both the critical
memorandum as well as memos from other subordinates who advocated
the course she took, she said Thursday. Some Republicans in
Congress have regularly called for her resignation over these
decisions, which also have become grist for GOP attacks on Gore
during the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I often wake up in the morning thinking that (all the memos
should be released) or wake up in the middle of the night thinking,
yes, that's what we should do,'' Reno said at her weekly news
conference. ''But I have come to realize more and more that there
are institutional concerns that are extremely important.''
</P>
<P>
   Department staff lawyers, ''who give me such candid advice,
expect that their deliberative memos will not be released,'' Reno
said. ''And I want to make sure that future attorneys general are
not hampered by precedents that I might inappropriately
establish.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee, has subpoenaed the critical memo for a second time. It
was written in late 1998 by the department's campaign finance task
force chief, Charles LaBella, who has long been publicly known to
have advocated an independent counsel for campaign finance
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Burton subpoenaed the memo earlier, but he settled for being
allowed to read a copy of it after Reno argued release could
imperil pending investigations. He renewed his subpoena after some
excerpts leaked to the Los Angeles Times this month, including
LaBella's contention the department used ''gamesmanship,''
''contortions'' and ''intellectually dishonest'' double standards
to avoid an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the department was reviewing whether circumstances had
changed enough to allow release now but that she had yet to receive
a recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if White House fund-raising remains under investigation,
Reno replied, ''I don't want to foreclose any avenue down the road,
but at this time I do not have specific and credible evidence of
any violation by a person who was a covered person when the
Independent Counsel Act was in effect.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, when that now-expired act was still in force,
she rejected an independent counsel to look into whether Gore lied
to investigators in saying he did not know some of the money he
raised during office telephone calls was spent directly on the
Clinton-Gore re-election, which was prohibited, instead of on
general party advertising, which was permitted.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, LaBella, FBI Director Louis Freeh and a senior Reno
aide, Robert Litt, recommended an outside counsel; Lee Radek, head
of the criminal division's public integrity section, and other
aides were opposed, department officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went through it carefully and could show no instance where
he (Gore) knew that what he had said was false,'' Reno said. ''We
also found very clearly that he had no motive to give a false
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles was
ordered to turn over to the public integrity section an earlier
probe of Gore's appearance at a fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Independent Counsel Act ... prohibited the use of grand
jury subpoenas or immunity or anything such as that,'' Reno said,
so the public integrity division routinely took over such cases to
ensure compliance.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that the department recently obtained a conviction of
fund-raiser Maria Hsia in the temple case.

<HEADLINE> IRS Seeks 2,000 More Employees  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To reverse a steep slide in audits and other
enforcement actions, the Internal Revenue Service wants Congress to
approve the hiring of almost 2,000 more employees as part of a 9.5
percent budget increase.
</P>
<P>
   IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said unless the enforcement
decline is halted, taxpayers might be increasingly tempted to
cheat.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to at least level this thing off,'' Rossotti told a
House Appropriations subcommittee on Thursday. ''It's fair to say
these problems really are severe. Over time, they would undermine
the fairness and integrity of the entire tax system.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti is asking Congress for an $8.8 billion budget in fiscal
2001, an increase of $769 million over this year that would be used
to hire 1,934 new personnel, among other things. That would only
partially make up for the drop of nearly 10,000 front-line
enforcement employees between 1995 and 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get out of the audit business, every taxpayer's going to
know that,'' said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the decrease, Rossotti said, is the 1998 IRS
reform law aimed at improving taxpayer rights combined with a sharp
increase in overall workload. An estimated 4,500 employees -- many
of them from the compliance section -- were shifted into jobs
related to administering those reforms or improving customer
service.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, audits are down roughly by half from the mid-1990s,
Rossotti said. Sharp decreases have also occurred in such areas as
property seizures and liens imposed in delinquent taxpayer cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get this money, we will at least be able to reverse this
downturn,'' Rossotti said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government
Appropriations subcommittee were sympathetic to the IRS' struggles
in implementing the reform law. But some raised concerns about a
recent report describing the agency's chronic inability to keep its
own books.
</P>
<P>
   That General Accounting Office report released this month found
weaknesses in such areas as improper refunds, sluggishness in
correcting taxpayer accounts, poor tracking of agency property and
inefficient followup on unpaid tax assessments.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fairly inexcusable,'' said Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz. ''This
is something we don't tolerate in a company that owes taxes. This
bears directly on your ability to manage federal resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Anne Northup, R-Ky., added that the Republican-led Congress
was not willing to accept a decline in tax law enforcement as the
price of taxpayer-friendly reforms many lawmakers saw as necessary
to curb a heavy-handed agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of us in our districts were hearing complaints about the
type of enforcement that was going on,'' Northup said.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti said the IRS is working to improve its own internal
accounting, to replace 30-year-old computers at the root of many
problems and to continue training workers so the reform law will
work -- while still collecting the taxes that are due. But he said
the agency needs its 9.5 percent budget increase to address its
various problems.

<HEADLINE> Bill Improves Landowner Court Access  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Landowners claiming violation of their
constitutional rights in land disputes would have easier access to
the federal courts under legislation approved by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill, which passed 226-182 Thursday, argued
that the current system, where property owners must often spend a
decade battling with local and state authorities before getting a
federal hearing, is unjust.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate and the
Clinton administration has promised a veto, saying it would ''harm
neighboring property owners, weaken local public health, safety and
environmental protections and lower the quality of life'' in
communities by undercutting the authority of local officials.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed the House in similar form in 1997, states
that federal courts may not abstain from considering property
takings cases that involve solely federal claims. It also allows
landowners, once they have appealed their cases before local
authorities, to go directly to federal courts, bypassing the state
court system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Property rights claims are subjected to second class
treatment,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., author of the
legislation. ''That is the truth and we need to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution bars the taking of
private property for public use without just compensation. But
Canady said this right is violated by the ''Kafkaesque legal maze
that property owners are thrown into.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill faces opposition from environmental and consumer groups
and others, including the Conference of (state) Chief Justices, the
National League of Cities and the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore said the bill compromises the rights of
communities to decide what kind of development they want ''by
creating a threat of expensive litigation that would favor the
wealthy developer over the common homeowner.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., a champion of environmental
issues, said the bill would hurt many local communities trying to
control growth, keep out pornography shops or restrict industry.
''This bill disempowers citizens and their towns, cities and
counties and skews local zoning rules to give developers the upper
hand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert proposed a different version that would expedite the
path to federal courts in cases involving disputes with the federal
government but would not let landowners appeal local land use
decisions in federal courts. It went down, 234-179.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 2372.

<HEADLINE> Will Privacy Panel Stop New Laws?  </HEADLINE>
By TED BRIDIS, AP Technology Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even as the push for new laws protecting the
privacy of consumers on the Internet appears to be picking up
speed, two congressmen want to create a commission to study privacy
issues for 18 months and hold at least 20 hearings across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of new federal privacy laws -- who are encouraged by
recent pronouncements of support from public polls and by some
lawmakers -- offered lukewarm support, even skepticism for the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Jim Moran, D-Va., this week
introduced a bill to form a 17-member national privacy commission
to study for up to 18 months questions surrounding Internet
privacy, identity theft and protections for health, medical and
financial records.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the panel would hold at least 20 public
hearings nationwide before submitting a report about privacy
threats that includes recommendations whether new laws are needed.
The commission was expected to cost about $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Clinton administration has urged U.S. companies to
regulate among themselves ways they protect consumer privacy on the
Internet, such as under programs run by the Better Business Bureau
or Truste, which audit companies that volunteer to participate.
</P>
<P>
   The industry fears mandatory privacy rules that could raise its
costs even in these earliest stages of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be your way or the government's way -- your
choice,'' warned Orson Swindle, a member of the Federal Trade
Commission, in a speech this week to Internet companies. He urged
companies to do a better job safeguarding the privacy of their
customer data and for executives to review their Web sites'
promises to protect that information.
</P>
<P>
   But amid increasing public concerns about the threat of privacy
violations made possible by new technologies, some lawmakers and
other government officials believe it increasingly likely that new
laws are inevitable -- possibly as early as this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This whole thing of Internet privacy is just going to
explode,'' Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, told a meeting this week of
the Consumer Federation of America. ''Within a very short time
we're going to have strong privacy protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said the national privacy commission he envisions
wouldn't prevent Congress from considering related proposals, and
it could issue interim reports on specific privacy questions before
the end of 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would not foreclose individual privacy legislation from
going forward,'' Hutchinson said. ''The privacy commission bill can
move forward singularly as the only privacy protection effort, or
it can move forward in a complimentary fashion with other privacy
bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of new privacy laws, who generally argue that the
industry's self-regulation hasn't proved effective, weren't
impressed. Some suggested the commission could be a delay tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact it's a study commission is the reason privacy
advocates are at best lukewarm,'' said Marc Rotenberg of the
Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center. ''It's a
little late in the day to have a study commission. The mood in the
country right now is in support of some action.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If this should really be called the privacy procrastination
act, that's exactly what we don't need,'' said Jason Catlett of
Junkbusters Corp., a New Jersey-based privacy advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said that won't be the commission's tact.
</P>
<P>
   ''They yearn for a faster track, and I'm in sympathy for that,''
he said. ''As time goes on, political realism will set in. It's
difficult to get consensus on some of the individual (privacy)
efforts.''

<HEADLINE> 'No Credible Evidence' in FBI Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Angering a conservative group and some former
Republican appointees, Independent Counsel Robert Ray concluded
there is no credible evidence of criminal activity in the White
House's improper gathering of hundreds of FBI background files.
</P>
<P>
   Closing out the probe without any prosecutions is ''a
travesty,'' former Bush White House speechwriter Joseph Duggan said
in a statement. ''These 'raw' investigative files invariably
contain material that is not necessarily true, but almost certainly
is negative and embarrassing. ... The FBI improperly gave our files
to unauthorized and politically hostile individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said Thursday he could not investigate violations of the
Privacy Act of 1974, which are misdemeanors and therefore outside
the Independent Counsel's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Duggan, who said he will now ask the Justice Department to
investigate possible privacy act violations, is a plaintiff in a
lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch. The conservative group, which has
sued the Clinton administration on a wide range of issues, called
Ray's closing of the probe ''irresponsible and outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray also said there no credible evidence that former White House
counsel Bernard Nussbaum lied to Congress regarding the controversy
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have said an Army detailee, Anthony
Marceca, made a bureaucratic blunder in collecting the FBI files
based on an outdated Secret Service list of White House
passholders.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices rose Friday, boosted by record
gains on Wall Street and an encouraging economic report from the
Japanese government. The dollar edged higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 313.09
points, or 1.63 percent, to 19,566.32. On Thursday, the average
closed up 174.63 points, or 0.92 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 105.96 yen in afternoon trading, up 0.48 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its overnight level of
105.56 yen late in New York.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, technology and telecommunication stocks led
gains as investors were encouraged by record-breaking gains on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   In New York trading on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial
average rose 499.19, or 4.9 percent, to 10,630.60. That shattered
the Dow's previous record one-day rise of 380.53 points, set on
Sept. 8, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts in Tokyo said that the explosive growth in the United
States of Internet-related businesses -- and the bull market they
have helped create -- may be a preview of things to come for Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no reason everything we've seen in the U.S. -- in the
old economy and the new economy -- won't transfer over to Japan,''
said Robert Sasaki, head of the quantitative strategy group at
Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Also improving sentiment was the Japanese government's monthly
assessment of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Economic Planning Agency said that signs of recovery are
emerging in areas including corporate investment, although it added
that the nation's overall economic situation remains severe.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 28.65 points, or 1.74 percent, to 1,674.22.
The TOPIX closed up 40.14 points, or 2.5 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar edged higher amid lingering
fears that Japan's central bank will step into the market to block
further gains by the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan bought dollars and sold yen twice in the last
two weeks, and traders said financial authorities have kept
tensions high by conducting daily checks on the volume of dollars
that Japanese overseas investors plan to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo is concerned that a strong yen will cripple the country's
nascent economic recovery by cutting into the value of its
dollar-based export earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Among other currencies, the euro was quoted at 102.90 yen, up
from 102.34 late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell
to 1.8300 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8400 percent. Its
price rose 0.08 points to 99.74.

<HEADLINE> Rain Slowing Aid to Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- With heavy rains forecast for central
and northern Mozambique during the next five days, international
aid agencies are scrambling for ways to rush food to flood
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The British navy anchored a floating helipad at the mouth of the
swollen Save River on Thursday to speed food to 45,000 flood
victims near the central Mozambican town of Machanga.
</P>
<P>
   From deck of the ship Ft. George, five British helicopters will
deliver 153 tons of food to survivors gathered in 14 sites near
Machanga, said Lindsey Davies, a spokeswoman for the World Food
Program.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. food agency has delivered more than 2,600 tons of food
to flood victims since Feb. 11, more than half of it by airplane
and helicopter, Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to look at all ways to get food in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Monthlong flooding in central and southern Mozambique has killed
at least 492 people, left 330,000 homeless and caused an estimated
$250 million in damage to roads, bridges, railways and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Rain in central Mozambique has slowed some aid deliveries this
week, and there were renewed fears of flooding. The Zambezi and
Buzi rivers were reaching a ''critical level,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   International aid groups have said they would like to end their
dependence on helicopters by the end of March and distribute more
aid in trucks, which are less expensive and can carry larger loads.
But the continued rain has washed away some roads.
</P>
<P>
   ''The unpredictable weather that's hampering our road access
will continue to make helicopters a vital source of aid for those
who need it,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 aircraft in Mozambique are assisting with the aid
effort, most of them helicopters, aid officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of refugees have been going back to their devastated
towns and villages to begin rebuilding their lives despite the
government's urging that they remain in aid camps for now.
</P>
<P>
   Their return complicates efforts to deliver food and other
supplies, since aid groups now need to send assistance to the
refugee camps and the villages.
</P>
<P>
   After a ruinous civil war that ended in 1992, Mozambique's
economy had been recovering when the floods struck. The growth
rate, roughly 10 percent a year, is expected to fall this year
because of the disaster. The country remains one of the poorest in
the world.

IRS Seeks 2,000 More Employees

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To reverse a steep slide in audits and other enforcement
actions, the Internal Revenue Service wants Congress to approve the hiring of
almost 2,000 more employees as part of a 9.5 percent budget increase. IRS

<HEADLINE> Kohl To Return to German Parliament  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Only months ago, Helmut Kohl's legacy as Germany's
unification chancellor seemed unshakable, when crowds of hundreds
cheered him on the 10th anniversary of the Berlin Wall's fall.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the crowds most often seen around Kohl have been the
media stationed outside his Berlin apartment, trying for comment
about his Christian Democratic party's scandal. Kohl's home also
was the target of protesters last week who demanded that he face
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl was to return to his parliament seat today for the first
time in months, seeking to reclaim some of his tarnished legacy by
appearing for a ceremony honoring the East German vote that set the
stage for Germany's reunification.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal erupted after Kohl admitted last year he accepted up
to $1 million from sources he has refused to name, saying he gave
them his word. Anonymous donations are illegal in Germany, and
prosecutors have launched an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The former chancellor's silence also has sparked a parliamentary
investigation into influence-peddling during his 16 years in
government, which ended with his party's defeat in 1998. The
scandal has since grown to include secret accounts, falsified
financial reports and more illegal cash handovers during his
quarter century as party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from all of Germany's major political parties
are to speak during today's three-hour event in the Reichstag.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl wasn't scheduled to speak, although all eyes are likely to
be focused on him. He last appeared in parliament Nov. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's former right-hand man, Wolfgang Schaeuble, was pressured
out of the party's leadership last month by fellow conservatives
angry over his handling of the finance scandal. That means he moves
out of the first row in parliament to make way for the new faction
leader, Friedrich Merz.
</P>
<P>
   It was on March 18, 1990 that East Germans held their first
democratic parliament elections, electing parties that pledged to
reunite their country with West Germany. That summer, the
parliament voted to unify and Germany's two halves that had been
divided since World War II become one country again on Oct. 3,
1990.

<HEADLINE> Man Breaks Into Plane's Cockpit  </HEADLINE>
By MARY ANN LICKTEIG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A man allegedly broke into the cockpit of
an Alaska Airlines jet Thursday and attacked a pilot during a
flight from Mexico to San Francisco, according to an airline
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The man was subdued by crew members and passengers until the
plane landed in San Francisco at 7:50 p.m., Alaska Airlines
spokesman Jack Evans said. He was arrested and questioned by the
FBI and the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The co-pilot was taken to a hospital with minor injuries,
according to KRON-TV in San Francisco. Evans said he did not know
the pilot's condition.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 259 with 43 passengers and five crew members was coming
from Puerto Vallarta. It was scheduled to fly from San Francisco to
Portland, Ore., later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The attack happened at about 7 p.m. as the plane was above
Monterey, 115 miles south of San Francisco. During the scuffle, one
of the pilots used the intercom to ask for help from first-class
passengers, said airport spokesman Ron Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Several passengers went into the cockpit and wrestled the
assailant to the ground, Wilson said. The 40-year-old man was put
in plastic wrist restraints until arrival in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear what the passenger was upset about, although
KRON reported that he had been acting irrationally during the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines Flight 261 from Puerto Vallarta to San Francisco
crashed Jan. 31 off the Ventura County coast, killing all 88 people
aboard. On Feb. 7, sparks flew from one of the engines of an Alaska
Airlines flight that was leaving San Francisco after arriving from
Puerto Vallarta. No one was injured in that incident.

<HEADLINE> Committee Recommends Cancer Drug  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A drug that shows promise as a first-line
treatment for colorectal cancer could soon be approved by the Food
and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee on Thursday
recommended approval for Camptosar injection, made by Pharmacia &AMP;
Upjohn, in combination with other drugs as a first treatment for
patients with colon and rectal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Camptosar won FDA approval as a follow-up cancer treatment in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The committee unanimously recommended the earlier use following
reports from clinical trials in which patients who received the
drug showed delayed tumor progression and lived longer than those
without it.
</P>
<P>
   The drug would be used in combination with two other drugs,
fluorouracil and leucovorin.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects associated with the drug in clinical trials
included diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is not bound by advisory committee recommendations but
usually follows them.

<HEADLINE> Mohegan Indians withdraw development offer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The Mohegan Indians and a Boston real
estate firm have withdrawn their offers to develop the former
Norwich Hospital site, clouding the future of the property.
</P>
<P>
   Mohegan tribal leaders made their decision Thursday shortly
after learning that Gov. John G. Rowland is giving other real
estate firms in Connecticut the next six months to find a corporate
client for the 470-acre parcel.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston firm, Spaulding and Slye, said Wednesday they would
need at least twice as much time to find a client.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal Chairman Roland Harris said the move was not related to
Rowland's action.
</P>
<P>
   ''In these types of projects, you have to decide whether you
want to continue or not,'' Harris said. ''We've got a lot going on
here. Other options may come along.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribe had proposed a hotel, golf course, spa, condominiums
and other amenities at the former psychiatric hospital, located in
Preston across the Thames River from the Mohegan Sun casino.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said the tribe still wants to proceed, but not on the
Norwich Hospital property. He would not say whether other sites are
being considered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish the state of Connecticut well in finding another
developer, because it benefits us all,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Spaulding &AMP; Slye officials said the governor's move puts the
development process back to square one.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm kind of perplexed with what the state is attempting to do
here,'' said David Vickery, principal analyst. ''They're not going
to fulfill what they think they want in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   A local advisory committee chose the Mohegans and Spaulding &AMP;
Slye as finalist to develop the project from dozens of potential
developers that submitted proposals more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has been awaiting an economic analysis of both
proposals from the University of Connecticut and comments from the
Department of Economic and Community Development. The panel then
was supposed to make a final recommendation to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowland opened up the project to other developers, saying
Thursday that the fate of the site, vacant for several years, has
dragged on long enough. He said it is unfair for Three Rivers
Community-Technical College, which hopes to build a consolidated
campus on the site, to wait for Spaulding &AMP; Slye to find a client.
</P>
<P>
   The company had initially represented Pfizer Inc. in the
selection process, but the pharmaceutical giant eventually dropped
out of the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland's decision came after a meeting with the Preston
selectmen, who have voiced strong opposition to the Mohegans'
proposal. The selectmen said they believe the site is well-suited
for a corporate entity and claim the region needs diversity, not
just more casino jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth is, if the town wants to hold up anybody with zoning
and permitting, they can. They want to run this thing out for five
years, they can, with those issues,'' Rowland said. ''So responding
to the selectmen, I said, 'Okay, fine. We'll get five marketing
companies to market this thing and whoever brings somebody in,
we'll look at the proposals, see if something works.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Preston First Selectman Robert Congdon, however, does not
believe that the time frame laid out by the governor is sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that you market this piece of property in six
months,'' said Congdon. He said the advisory committee spent eight
months waiting for a consultant's report on the property. ''The
plan is destined to fail.''

<HEADLINE> Spitzer: Evidence against Port Authority head is rock solid  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The state attorney general, accused of
politically targeting a longtime ally of Gov. George Pataki,
promised to show ''rock solid evidence'' that the chief of the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey had perpetrated a real estate
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert E. Boyle, head of the bi-state agency, received
Pataki's full support on Thursday and vowed to battle the
allegations made by prosecutor Eliot Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Describing himself as ''enraged,'' Boyle said Spitzer's charges
were based on ''incomplete and inaccurate allegations that go back
10 years.'' The 26-page civil complaint was ''a political
lawsuit,'' Boyle said in an angry three-paragraph statement.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is a Republican, while Spitzer is a Democrat. Spitzer
quickly shot back that he would not back off the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have rock solid evidence to prove that Mr. Boyle breached
his duty,'' said Darren Dopp, spokesman for Spitzer. ''We'll prove
it in the court.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll have to, Boyle said. He announced that he would not quit
his $165,000-a-year job, and promised to fight charges that he
profited from an allegedly shady 1990s real estate deal involving a
nonprofit hospital where he served as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to stay on the lucrative PA job was backed by
Pataki, who praised his beleaguered appointee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little shocked that something dating from 1990, 1991,
was brought up,'' Pataki said about the suit. ''I'm surprised by
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki stopped short of saying that Spitzer was politically
motivated. The governor said he would not ask Boyle to resign, and
expressed support for Boyle's reappointment when his current term
expires next month.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki appointed Boyle to the Port Authority job in early 1997.
Prior to that, Boyle had served as president of the Javits Center --
another job provided by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, as treasurer for Pataki's inaugural and transition
committees, Boyle helped raise more than $2.5 million for the newly
elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle allegedly hid his financial interest in a Westchester
County building, then used his position as chairman of the Hudson
Valley Hospital Center to influence its decision to lease and
eventually buy the property, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Due to Boyle's ''improper conduct,'' hospital officials -- after
paying $530,000 to renovate the Croton Building -- paid $550,000
more for the building in 1993 than it would have cost two years
earlier, said the complaint by Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint seeks an unspecified amount in damages,
restitution and interest to be determined at trial. Also named in
the complaint were two people who served on the board at Hudson
Valley Hospital Center, Arthur Clements and Ruth Woolfe.
</P>
<P>
   The charge against Boyle, 63, of Croton-on-Hudson, first emerged
in the federal tax-fraud case of Albert J. Pirro, a prominent
Republican lobbyist and the husband of Westchester District
Attorney Jeanine Pirro.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation -- later dropped by the U.S. attorney's office --
described a real estate deal that he and Albert Pirro entered into
with the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's suit, which covers the same transaction, alleges that
Boyle ignored his legal obligations to protect the hospital in
favor of his desire to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, Boyle learned two things in early 1991:
that the hospital was looking for new office space and that a
building in nearby Croton-on-Hudson was up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle, after allegedly telling Pirro to buy the building, became
a secret 45 percent partner in Pirro's real estate company,
Distinctive Properties. Boyle then arranged for the hospital to
lease space in the building, which Distinctive Properties had
purchased in April 1991 for $950,000, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital spent $530,000 to renovate the building and hired
Rogene Industries, a construction company owned by Boyle, as
construction manager. The building was sold to the hospital by
Distinctive Properties in 1993 at a $550,000 profit.
</P>
<P>
   The bi-state Port Authority oversees the region's three airports
along with many of its bridges and tunnels.

<HEADLINE> BMW To Sell Land Rover Line to Ford  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE, AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- BMW Group is ending its vexing experiment
with its British-based Rover division, spinning off the
money-losing automobile unit to a British investment group while
agreeing to sell the profitable Land Rover line to Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ford CEO Jac Nasser said Thursday that the Dearborn-based auto
giant had a memorandum of understanding with BMW to buy Land
Rover's assets, and expected to complete the deal in the third
quarter of this year, assuming European regulators approve.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was valued at less than $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we think of our strategy of developing the premier
markets, particularly in off-road and 4x4 vehicles, we can't think
of a better group of brands and products than Land Rover,'' Nasser
said.
</P>
<P>
   BMW and Ford were to announce details of the agreement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes after BMW announced its plans Thursday to sell
the Rover passenger car division to Alchemy Partners Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   The investment group will take on the Rover and MG brand cars,
including their plant in Longbridge, England, and recast the
venture under the new name MG Car Co.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, those operations have burdened BMW
with $1.25 billion in red ink and dragged down profit an estimated
28 percent last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Land Rover, on the other hand is considered the crown jewel of
the Rover lineup. The company sells four models of luxury SUVs, two
of which -- the Range Rover and the Discovery -- are imported to the
United States. The company built about 160,000 vehicles last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser said Ford would get the four models of sport utility
vehicles made by Land Rover and Land Rover's manufacturing and
engineering offices, but no debt. Land Rover will join Jaguar,
Volvo, Aston Martin and Lincoln in Ford's Premier Automotive Group
for luxury vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's deal with BMW for Land Rover is yet another step in a
trend of global consolidation among automakers. Earlier this week,
General Motors Corp. took 20 percent of the Fiat Auto company from
its Italian parent, a few months after taking a similar stake in
the Japanese parent of Subaru.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers believe such deals will cut the massive costs of
designing and building new vehicles by allowing companies to share
components and factories around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the BMW-Alchemy pact remained a matter of contention
late Thursday. BMW said the two sides were still negotiating the
fine print of the arrangement after the company's supervisory board
approved its outline.
</P>
<P>
   BMW did say, however, that shifting the operations to Alchemy
will set the company back $3 billion in the form of a one-time
restructuring charge. Analysts said it was unclear whether the
price of the deal was rolled into that charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even getting Rover for free would not be attractive to most
people. It's a cash-eating company,'' said Christian Breitsprecher,
an auto analyst with Deutsche Bank. ''I'm pretty sure Alchemy's not
paying anything for the deal and is getting something on top.''
</P>
<P>
   BMW also unveiled plans Thursday to roll out a new line of the
sporty, subcompact Minis from its Oxford plant in early summer 2001
and continue building the Rover 75 luxury model in Oxford for
Alchemy. The company also plans to finish construction of its new
Hams Hall enine factory in Birmingham and begin production there.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITS  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's a march of thousands, but today, the St.
Patrick's Day parade was expected to beam a spotlight on two: Rudy
Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the city's main political man was set to walk in
today's parade, and the nation's leading lady was to make her debut
at the historic parade. And each step taken by the U.S. Senate race
opponents would be watched -- for distance to each other and
demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   But prayers came before politics.
</P>
<P>
   A Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral was to start the day. A major
figure could be missing this year: 80-year-old Cardinal John
O'Connor, whose health has been failing since he underwent brain
surgery in September. Church officials said he probably would not
greet marchers as usual in front of the cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   After Mass, the city's police force was preparing for another
kind of drama: the politics of sex, as represented by the Irish
Lesbian and Gay Organization, which was banned from marching.
</P>
<P>
   They planned a protest parade about 90 minutes before the 11
a.m. start of America's oldest and biggest St. Patrick's Day at
45th Street and Fifth Avenue. Walking from 59th Street down Fifth --
opposite the parade route -- the protesting marchers would end their
action at 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   As has become traditional, some will then turn around and try to
join the actual parade.
</P>
<P>
   And then, Giuliani was expected to kick off the event.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton created her own drama by just saying she would
participate -- against ILGO's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Though she had joined an inclusive Queens parade recently, ''it
doesn't matter where else you march, how many times you march, or
what spin you put on marching -- what matters is integrity,'' ILGO
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the 10th time the New York-based ILGO has been
barred from making marching under its own banner.
</P>
<P>
   The Ancient Order of Hibernians, a fraternal Catholic group that
runs the official parade, has repeatedly maintained its right to
exclude ILGO. And in February, a Manhattan federal jury ruled that
the city had not violated the group's First Amendment rights by
denying it a marching permit.
</P>
<P>
   The group's members aren't taking it calmly.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by an Irish contingent, ILGO predicted a massive civil
disobedience march for today with a cast of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The 239th annual march would feature shamrocks and ''Kiss me,
I'm Irish'' buttons.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the protesters were expected to wear ''Kiss me, I'm
queer'' buttons -- as they did Thursday afternoon for a reception
honoring them in the office of Manhattan Borough President C.
Virginia Fields.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering of more than 100 included 53 gays and lesbians who
traveled from Ireland, where they're allowed to march as official
groups in St. Patrick's Day parades.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm lesbian, queer, Irish,'' announced Ailbhe Smyth, head of
women's studies at University College in Dublin. ''But I have to
say that in Ireland, we no longer have this kind of intolerance,
this kind of homophobia, this kind of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite opposition from the Catholic group that organizes the
parade, Catholicism was not missing from the gathering in Fields'
office.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Roche, a lesbian from Cork, Ireland, wore a gold cross
around her neck and noted, ''I go to Mass.''
</P>
<P>
   At home in Ireland, said the 30-year-old chef, ''there's not
that much discrimination. Here, we're hidden away.''

<HEADLINE> Ireland Grows as Movie Setting  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A bit of blarney on the movie screen to go
with your pint of stout?
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for St. Patrick's Day, two movies about Ireland are
in theaters today, ''Agnes Browne'' and ''The Closer You Get'' --
the latest offbeat films catering to American audiences' interest
in all things Irish.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the kind of wonderful thing about Ireland at the
moment is that it's a country that feels it's on the rise.
Culturally, it's very confident,'' said Scottish director Aileen
Ritchie, who made ''The Closer You Get,'' a tale about a group of
lonely bachelors on Ireland's isolated west coast who advertise for
brides in an American newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until now, the film genre hasn't really exploited all the
talent that's there in Ireland,'' Ritchie said.
</P>
<P>
   The last 10 years or so have brought a string of Irish-themed
movies to U.S. theaters, dealing with politics and rebellion
(''Michael Collins,'' ''In the Name of the Father''), myth and
legend (''Into the West,'' ''The Secret of Roan Inish''), music
(''The Commitments,'' ''Hear My Song'') and the oddities of Irish
families (''Dancing at Lughnasa,'' ''The Snapper'').
</P>
<P>
   ''There seems to be an enormous amount coming out of Ireland
these days. Dare I say a glut?'' said Anjelica Huston, director and
star of ''Agnes Browne,'' the story of an impoverished Irish widow
coping with seven children. ''There's a lot of good stuff from
Ireland these days, very much like the wave of films that came out
of Britain in the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress lived her early years in Ireland and starred in the
last film by her father, legendary director John Huston, an
adaptation of James Joyce's ''The Dead,'' about a lively Dublin
holiday gathering and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Some Irish movies have become breakout hits, such as ''Waking
Ned Devine'' and ''The Crying Game,'' which received five Academy
Award nominations, including best picture, and a screenplay Oscar
for writer-director Neil Jordan in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland has caught Hollywood's interest in decades past with
such classics as John Ford's ''The Informer'' and ''The Quiet
Man,'' perhaps the quintessential St. Patrick's Day flick. ''The
Quiet Man'' starred John Wayne as an American boxer who returns to
the Irish town of his birth and takes up with the locals, including
hot-tempered Maureen O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're looking for an actress who represents Ireland,
Maureen O'Hara would be it,'' said Sean O'Malley, a member of the
Sons of Erin of Westfield, Mass. ''A beautiful woman, she's got
that temper, and certainly the fiery red hair. And playing with
John Wayne, who's all-American, I think in anybody's mind, you
can't beat it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish-born Jordan, whose other movies about Ireland include
''Michael Collins'' and ''The Butcher Boy,'' is among a cadre of
directors who have sparked Hollywood's current interest in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Others include Jim Sheridan, who co-produced ''Agnes Browne''
and directed ''My Left Foot'' and ''The Boxer,'' Alan Parker,
director of ''The Commitments'' and ''Angela's Ashes,'' and Stephen
Frears, who made ''The Snapper'' and ''The Van.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeding interest in the island has been news coverage of peace
efforts in Northern Ireland after 30 years of ''the troubles'' over
British rule.
</P>
<P>
   Frank McCourt's Pulitzer-winning memoir ''Angela's Ashes'' and
Irish fiction by such authors as Roddy Doyle (''The Commitments,''
''A Star Called Henry'') also have contributed. And music by Irish
performers such as U2, the Pogues, Van Morrison and the Cranberries
has helped drive Ireland's renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're the flavor of the month now,'' said Phyllis
Towey Brugnolotti, who grew up in Ireland and now is assistant
librarian at the American Irish Historical Society in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   When she went to college in London in the 1950s, ''it was very
bad to be Irish. It was the lowest level of society,'' Brugnolotti
said. She said it was a different story last summer, when she
visited England and a woman overheard her Irish accent at a
bookstore in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''This woman said, 'You're Irish, aren't you? You're so
lucky,''' Brugnolotti said. ''It was funny, because we never
thought of ourselves as people to be envied.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Head North  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS WAGNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Following Wall Street's lead, Asia's top three
stock markets rose sharply today, even though a two-day trading
frenzy of the Dow industrials left some analysts worried about what
may happen next on the jumpy U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the world's second largest economy, stocks roared
ahead at the opening and remained high all day, due in part to the
Dow's biggest-ever daily point gain Thursday. The Nikkei 225 Stock
Average closed 313.09 points, or 1.63 percent, higher at 19,566.32.
</P>
<P>
   Traders also were encouraged by a new government report giving
an upward assessment of the Japanese economy, which recently
slipped back into a recession. The report said parts of the
economy, including corporate capital investment and personal
consumption, were on a sounder footing.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the coming few days, I think the Tokyo stock market will
have good momentum,'' said Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at
Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's other two top stock markets earned even bigger gains,
following the lead of the Dow Jones industrials, which rocketed
nearly 500 points Thursday following a 320 point gain on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 723.99 points, or 4.43
percent, to 17,082.99.
</P>
<P>
   Traders credited Wall Street's record showing, but also said
they were relieved by the fact that China's military hasn't
attacked Taiwan because of its national election Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   During Taiwan's first direct presidential election in 1996,
China lobbed nuclear-capable missiles near the island's two major
ports. The United States sent two aircraft carriers and other
warships to the region to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Taiwan's military said things seem calm in the
80-mile-wide Taiwan Strait that separates Taiwan from China.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time the Chinese are only talking,'' one Hang Seng dealer
said in Hong Kong, which reverted to Chinese rule in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although Taiwan and mainland China have been governed separately
since splitting amid civil war 51 years ago, China views Taiwan as
a renegade province and is demanding quick progress in
reunification talks by the two governments. The outcome of
Saturday's vote for the three top candidates could conceivably
spark a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index opened sharply higher
today and ended the day at 2,094.47, 72.36 points, or 3.58 percent,
above Wednesday's tally. A holiday closed the market Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow industrials shot up 499.19 points Thursday
to close at 10,630.60 as investors poured money into blue chips
that had been battered by Wall Street's frenzy for technology
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning reversal of fortunes and came on the busiest
day ever in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. In just two
days, the Dow stocks wiped out more than 40 percent of their losses
over the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts remained wary that the rally might be nothing
more than another volatile day in a volatile year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this week's gains, the Dow still remained 9.3 percent
below its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week higher
across the board Friday on the back of the biggest-ever point gain
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index surged 723.99
points, or 4.4 percent, closing at 17,082.99. On Thursday, the
index had slumped 388.20 points, or 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers said the bulk of trading in Hong Kong took place in the
last hour, with investors snapping up banking and property stocks
following overnight gains on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones
industrial average rose 499.19, or 4.9 percent, to close at
10,630.60.
</P>
<P>
   Turnover was light because many investors stayed on the
sidelines amid concerns about Saturday's presidential election in
Taiwan. Relations between Taipei and Beijing will be further
strained if pro-democratic candidate Chen Shui-bian wins the Taiwan
elections, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained
313.04 points, or 1.63 percent, to 19,566.32. On Thursday, the
average closed up 174.63 points, or 0.92 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Wall Street's rally, the Nikkei was boosted by
the Japanese government's monthly assessment of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese Economic Planning Agency said that signs of
recovery are emerging in parts of the economy, which recently
slipped back into a recession.
</P>
<P>
   In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 105.94 yen,
up 0.46 yen from Thursday and also above its overnight level of
105.56 yen late in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore stocks also soared, bolstered by Wall Street's sharp
gains. The benchmark Straits Times Index rose 72.36 points, or 3.6
percent, to 2,094.47.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese market ended higher as buying by government funds
overcame weak sentiment on the last trading day before the island's
presidential election Saturday, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Taipei market's Weighted Stock Price Index rose 80.51
points, or 0.93 percent, to 8,763.27.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere:
</P>
<P>
   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher on the back
of Wall Street's record rally. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index
rose 35.05 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,999.31.
</P>
<P>
   MANILA: Philippine stocks rose in step with robust gains on Wall
Street. The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 16.31
points, or 1 percent, to 1,646.28.
</P>
<P>
   SYDNEY: Australian shares closed generally stronger, taking the
lead from their U.S. counterparts. The All Ordinaries Index rose
0.7 percent, or 23.2 points, to 3,203.4.
</P>
<P>
   SEOUL: Share prices closed higher. The Korea Composite Stock
Price Index rose 14.35 points, or 1.7 percent, to 855.57.
</P>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed higher. The
benchmark Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip stocks, rose
14.29 points, or 1.6 percent, to 934.78.
</P>
<P>
   JAKARTA: The key Composite Index rose 3.983 points, 0.68
percent, to 590.852.
</P>
<P>
   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher on selective buying in
energy and building stocks. The Composite Index rose 3.91 points,
or 1 percent, to 399.74.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HINKLEY, Calif. (AP) -- Roberta Walker knew something was wrong
when a utility giant agreed to buy her five-acre Mojave Desert
property for $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody around us was becoming sick, and cats, dogs, and
rabbits were dying,'' said Walker, whose curiosity triggered a
multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-year battle waged over contaminated water by Walker
and hundreds of Hinkley residents provided the background for the
new Julia Roberts movie, ''Erin Brockovich,'' which opens today.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, the street-smart, tough-talking title character
was the legal clerk who rallied Hinkley to sue PG&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great opportunity to send our message. Everything in
the movie is true,'' Brockovich said after a Ventura County
fund-raising showing of the movie Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Pruett, a spokesman for San Francisco-based PG&AMP;E, said
Wednesday he has not seen the movie but has viewed televised
previews.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look at this as a dramatization, not a documentary, and put
it in that perspective,'' he said. ''Any movie, including this one,
has an incredible luxury of taking facts and intermingling them
with drama to create a very entertaining movie.''

   Walker and her neighbors were among 650 plaintiffs in the 1993
lawsuit that claimed PG&AMP;E discharged toxic wastewater into
groundwater at its compressor station, exposing residents to
cancer-causing chromium 6.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E settled for $333 million four years ago. Another 300 former
Hinkley residents have a November court date in their follow-up
suit against the utility.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the scenes in ''Erin Brockovich'' were filmed last
summer in Hinkley, a farming community 130 miles northeast of Los
Angeles. Walker said Hollywood did justice to the reality that
haunted the town.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've changed some story lines, but for the most part it is
factual,'' she said. ''The script was accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Ed Masry, who handled the initial lawsuit and is
portrayed in the movie by Albert Finney, believes Walker was the
catalyst for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hollywood did an accurate rendition of the facts,'' he said.
''Erin worked night and day on the case for two years, and during
the trial more than a million pages of documents were scanned
through computers.''
</P>
<P>
   And Brockovich? She still works for Masry, heading the Masry &AMP;
Vititoe law firm's toxic research department.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Awards Apparently Stolen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- It's Hollywood's latest caper: Who
took the Oscars? Nine days before the Academy Awards, police today
searched for the coveted statuettes, which vanished from a trucking
company loading dock.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman John Pavlik said the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences said late Thursday that it is believed the Oscars
''have been stolen.'' He declined to give other details but said
the statuettes disappeared from Bell, a Los Angeles community about
15 miles from Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   According to a brief statement from the academy, the Oscars
disappeared from a loading dock used by Roadway Express, the
academy's regular delivery company. The company did not immediately
return a phone message.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't exactly clear how many Oscars were missing. Pavlik
said he believed all 54 that were to be on hand for the March 26
ceremony were missing, while Academy President Robert Rehme said
''a crateful'' was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment Tonight, a television magazine show, reported that
academy officials remained confident that replacement statues would
be available for the awards show. New statues are expected to
arrive from Chicago by March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at R.S. Owens, the Chicago company that makes the
Oscars, did not immediately return a telephone call today. The
company also makes the Emmys and a variety of other awards.
</P>
<P>
   Rehme told The Hollywood Reporter the uninscribed statuettes
were being shipped from Chicago when they vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were some Oscars that we had on a truck that are either
missing or stolen,'' he said. ''We don't know how, where or why. We
never had them in our possession. It's been two days.''
</P>
<P>
   Each Oscar is 13{ inches tall, is covered with gold-plated
britannium and weighs about 8 pounds. Awards are to be given out in
23 categories plus three special awards, whose winners have already
been announced. The precise number of statuettes given out will
depend on how many people wind up sharing awards in various
categories.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of the Oscar nickname -- the statuette is officially
called the Academy Award of Merit -- is unclear. One legend has it
that an academy official, Margaret Herrick, exclaimed in 1931 that
it ''reminds me of my uncle Oscar.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, sacks containing 4,000 ballots were
misrouted after delivery to the Beverly Hills Post Office by an
accounting firm. The Academy was forced to print and mail new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for returning the ballots was extended from March
21 to March 23, just three days before the awards show.

   Consumer Prices Jump in February
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices shot up 0.5 percent in
February, the biggest jump in 10 months, led by sharp increases in
fuel oil prices, gasoline and other energy costs. The big advance
in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, the most closely
watched inflation gauge, followed a modest 0.2 percent rise in
January, and was a slightly worse showing on inflation than many
analysts were predicting. They forecast that consumer prices would
rise by 0.4 percent. Last month's increase stemmed from a huge 4.6
percent jump in energy prices, the biggest gain since a 6 percent
rise in April.

   Agreement Reached in Boeing Strike
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A tentative agreement was reached today to end a
38-day strike by thousands of Boeing Co. engineers and technical
workers, one of the largest white-collar walkouts in U.S. history.
Members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in
Aerospace will vote on the pact Sunday. C. Richard Barnes, director
of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, said he was
optimistic about ratification of the three-year deal reached early
today after meetings in Washington, D.C. However, details of the
proposal were posted on the union's Web site. It includes cash
bonuses, a top demand of the union and a key issue in a strike that
had grown increasingly rancorous since it began Feb. 9.

   Bertelsmann Expected To Sell AOL Stake
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- German media Group Bertelsmann AG reportedly was
expected to announce today it is selling its half-interest in AOL
Europe to co-owner America Online Inc., for up to $8.5 billion. The
move has been expected since January, when AOL announced plans to
acquire Bertelsmann rival Time Warner Inc. ''Bertelsmann no longer
feels it needs to own an Internet service provider and instead is
concentrating on commercial agreements to sell its books,
magazines, music and movies on leading Internet sites, and on
creating its own Web portals,'' The Wall Street Journal reported on
its Web site today, citing a people familiar with the situation.

   BMW To Sell Land Rover Line to Ford
</P>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German automaker BMW said today that a
fundamental shift in currency values was critical to its decision
to split from British-based Rover -- both dumping the money-losing
car division and selling to Ford the profitable Land Rover off-road
vehicle line. Speaking at a news conference in Munich, BMW chairman
Joachim Milberg confirmed that the company would sell Land Rover to
Ford Motor Co. in a $2.91 billion deal, the details of which are
still to be worked out. BMW will instead concentrate on its own X5

   Viacom Wins Decision Over Chris-Craft

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Clearing a possible hurdle in its merger with
CBS, Viacom won a legal decision against Chris-Craft Industries,
its half-partner in the UPN television network. The ruling late
yesterday by a judge in New York State Supreme Court also sets the
stage for a change in ownership of UPN, which has been coming back
in recent months with popular shows such as wrestling. In throwing
out Chris-Craft's complaint, Judge Herman Cahn let stand a legal
provision Viacom had triggered six weeks ago under which
Chris-Craft must decide by Monday to either buy the other half of
UPN from Viacom for $5 million or to sell its half to Viacom for
the same price. Viacom must abide by whatever Chris-Craft decides.

technology stocks. The Dow jumped 499.19 to 10,630.60 -- an increase
of 4.9 percent, smashing the previous record point gain of 380.53
on Sept. 8, 1998, but nowhere near the record 15.34 percent jump on
March 15, 1933. The Dow is now up over 800 points in two days, or
about 8 percent. The Dow is still more than 1,000 points shy of its
record high. Even with the gain, the Dow is down 7.5 percent
year-to-date and off 9.3 percent from its Jan. 14 record high of
11,722.98.

<HEADLINE> Ex Ambassador Morris Abram Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Morris B. Abram, a lawyer, educator, ambassador
and American Jewish leader who served the administrations of five
U.S. presidents, has died of pneumonia, a spokesman for United
Nations Watch said today. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Abram died Thursday at a hospital in Geneva, said Michael
Colson, an official with the nonprofit organization Abram chaired
until his death. Abram had remained in the Swiss city since he
stepped down in 1993 as U.S. ambassador to U.N. organizations here.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan paid tribute to Abram, saying
he was ''stunned'' by the news of his death and ''will miss him
greatly.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While Mr. Abram was often critical of the United Nations, it
was always in the attempt to make it a better institution,'' Annan
said through his spokesman, Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Abram served on the prosecution staff at the Nuremberg
Trials. Over the next 20 years, he worked on the Marshall plan and
the Peace Corps as well as with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter,
Ronald Reagan and George Bush also appointed him to U.S. civil
rights commissions and other panels and international bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Abram, born June 19, 1918, in Fitzgerald, Ga., received degrees
from the University of Georgia, University of Chicago Law School
and attended Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar. A book he wrote
in 1948 about how to stop violence in his community led to anti-Ku
Klux Klan legislation, and he argued in favor of ''one man-one
vote'' in a landmark voting rights case before the U.S. Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   He was president of Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., from
1968-1970 and served as chairman of the National Council for Soviet
Jewry and as president of the American Jewish Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Abram published an autobiography titled ''The Day is
Short,'' describing his struggle with leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, he chaired the Conference of Presidents of
Major American Jewish Organizations and was named one of the 50
most influential Jews in the world in 1994 by the Forward
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce M. Ramer, national president of the American Jewish
Committee, said Abram was ''a giant'' who ''was dedicated to
righting the wrongs. He started with a passionate commitment to
civil rights in Georgia at a time when it was difficult to be in
that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Abram moved to Geneva in 1989 when Bush appointed him
representative to the U.N. offices based here. When he stepped down
in 1993, he joined with Edgar Bronfman, president of the World
Jewish Congress, to found U.N. Watch. The group monitors the United
Nations, and Abram was frequently critical of the world body's
treatment of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Abram is survived by his wife, Bruna Molina, and five children
from a previous marriage. The children -- three sons and two
daughters -- live in the United States, Colson said.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral is planned for Cape Cod, Mass., at a date to be
determined, he said.

<HEADLINE> First lady to march in St. Patrick's Day parade  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton was one of the few
prominent Democrats on Fifth Avenue today, fulfilling a promise she
made three months ago to march in the St. Patrick's Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   As she began her march up Fifth Avenue, accompanied by fellow
Democrats City Council President Peter Vallone, former Mayor Ed
Koch, and Reps. Carolyn Maloney and Joseph Crowley, she was met
with cheers of ''Hillary,'' but also a few boos.
</P>
<P>
   One group of young men shouted, ''Rudy, Rudy!''
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor has done so much for the city,'' said John Durkin,
of Sayville, on Long Island. ''He is absolutely awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Clinton's Republican rival for the
Senate, and Gov. George Pataki led the parade but not before taking
a shot at what he calls Clinton's carpetbagger status, saying he
hoped she doesn't get lost.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I've got some good guides to find my way,'' responded
Clinton, marching further back in the parade.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady began the day -- a dreary overcast day that
included a freezing rain and later light snow -- at a St. Patrick's
Cathedral Mass attended by about 5,000 worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   She sat several rows behind Giuliani inside the church but they
did not exchange greetings. After the Mass she attended a breakfast
hosted by Vallone at the Princeton Club where she told the group
she brought greetings from the president, who was meeting with
parties involved in the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
   She made a reference to her new status, saying, ''It is just a
great pleasure to be here as a New Yorker for St. Patrick's Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Clinton supporters, wearing stick-on shamrocks that
simply said, ''Hillary,'' got ready to line the parade route, which
was attended by spectators who stood at least 10 deep.
</P>
<P>
   She was one of the few prominent Democrats to march. Many
Democrats boycott the parade because the Irish Lesbian and Gay
Organization is not permitted to march.
</P>
<P>
   The parade is organized by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, a
Catholic fraternal group that excludes ILGO on the grounds that
homosexuality is not accepted by the Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 members of the Irish gay group held a protest before
the start of the parade and were arrested on disorderly conduct
charges when they tried to march down Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has said repeatedly that she wants to highlight
her support for the Irish peace process by taking part in the
parade, but she has also said she had hoped the parade would be
''inclusive'' of the gay group.
</P>
<P>
   Her reasoning did little to pacify angry ILGO members.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary came to New York and did not understand Irish
politics. She should not be marching in the main parade,'' said
ILGO member Maxine Wolfe, 58, of Brooklyn. ''She's hypocritical for
saying she's marching to support the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand their concerns about it not being inclusive,''
Clinton said when asked to respond to her Irish gay critics. ''But
this is a day also to honor the values and contributions of Irish
Americans.... when you're in public life you have to balance
competing values.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Rocket Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures rocketed higher in
early dealings today on the Chicago Board of Trade, buoyed by
long-term weather forecasts calling for more dry, warm weather in
the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean prices pushed to seven-week highs soon after the
National Weather Service's 30- to 90-day forecast was issued.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials first disclosed their drought concerns
earlier in the week, sparking a big rally in agricultural
commodities. But today's forecast indicates that the pattern of
above-average temperatures and below-average rainfall is likely to
continue for the next 30 to 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   A bullish soybean planting estimate released this morning helped
support the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Corn and wheat joined in the runup in prices, with investors now
anticipating a stronger threat to crops from dryness that has been
prevalent in the central United States since last July.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery rose 2 cents to $2.68\ a bushel; May corn
rose 4 cents to $2.39\ a bushel; May oats rose { cent to $1.21 a
bushel; May soybeans rose 10{ cents to $5.36 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and
pork futures were higher.
</P>
<P>
   April live cattle fell .32 cent to 71.80 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle fell .37 cent to 82.85 cents a pound; April lean hogs
rose .10 cent to 61.90 cents a pound; May pork bellies rose .08
cent to 93.40 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> First lady soundly booed at St. Patrick's Day parade  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton marched in her first St.
Patrick's Day parade today but was greeted by many along the parade
route with a resounding chorus of boos and shouts of ''go back to
Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by fellow Democrats City Council President Peter
Vallone, former Mayor Ed Koch, and Reps. Carolyn Maloney and Joseph
Crowley, Clinton ignored her vocal critics and kept smiling and
waving.
</P>
<P>
   The largest chorus came at St. Patrick's Cathedral, where parade
watchers stood two and three deep on the sidewalk. ''Find your own
state,'' some shouted. ''Go back to Arkansas,'' others screamed
out. Many preferred to hurl generic boos at the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   And while there were Clinton supporters cheering, they were
drowned out by the more vocal opposing crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rudy, Rudy,'' one group of young men shouted as she passed by.
''The mayor has done so much for the city,'' said John Durkin, of
Sayville, on Long Island. ''He is absolutely awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Clinton's Republican rival for the
Senate, and Gov. George Pataki led the parade but not before taking
a shot at what he calls Clinton's carpetbagger status, saying he
hoped she doesn't get lost.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I've got some good guides to find my way,'' responded
Clinton, marching further back in the parade.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady began the day -- a dreary overcast day that
included a freezing rain and later light snow -- at a St. Patrick's
Cathedral Mass attended by about 5,000 worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   She sat several rows behind Giuliani inside the church but they
did not exchange greetings. After the Mass she attended a breakfast
hosted by Vallone at the Princeton Club where she told the group
she brought greetings from the president, who was meeting with
parties involved in the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
   She made a reference to her new status, saying, ''It is just a
great pleasure to be here as a New Yorker for St. Patrick's Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Clinton supporters, wearing stick-on shamrocks that
simply said, ''Hillary,'' got ready to line the 45-block parade
route.
</P>
<P>
   She was one of the few prominent Democrats to march. Many
Democrats boycott the parade because the Irish Lesbian and Gay
Organization is not permitted to march.
</P>
<P>
   The parade is organized by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, a
Catholic fraternal group that excludes ILGO on the grounds that
homosexuality is not accepted by the Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-six members of the Irish gay group held a protest before
the start of the parade and were arrested on disorderly conduct
charges when they tried to march down Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has said repeatedly that she wants to highlight
her support for the Irish peace process by taking part in the
parade, but she has also said she had hoped the parade would be
''inclusive'' of the gay group.
</P>
<P>
   Her reasoning did little to pacify angry ILGO members.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary came to New York and did not understand Irish
politics. She should not be marching in the main parade,'' said
ILGO member Maxine Wolfe, 58, of Brooklyn. ''She's hypocritical for
saying she's marching to support the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand their concerns about it not being inclusive,''
Clinton said when asked to respond to her Irish gay critics. ''But
this is a day also to honor the values and contributions of Irish
Americans.... when you're in public life you have to balance
competing values.''
</P>
<P>
   City Comptroller Alan Hevesi, city Public Advocate Mark Green,
former Mayor David Dinkins and U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer are among
the Democrats conspicuously absent amid the bagpipes and marching
bands.
</P>
<P>
   But Green attended the morning Mass with Clinton, who accented
her outfit with a green scarf. ''I often come to Mass but I don't
march because I'm hoping some day it will be an inclusive parade,''
Green said before the service began.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 80.97; Nasdaq Gains 80.44  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks extended their gains today building on
the momentum from Thursday's extraordinary surge as the technology
sector once again took center stage.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 80.97 at 10,711.57 in
heavy trading at midday, adding to Thursday's 499.19-point surge,
the largest one-day point gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's bold advance during the previous two days, which
included a 320-point surge Wednesday, was a stunning reversal of
fortunes. In those two days, the Dow stocks wiped out more than 40
percent of their losses over the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher today. The Nasdaq
composite index was up 80.44 at 4,797.83. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 14.97 at 1,473.44.
</P>
<P>
   ''Momentum from yesterday's rally is carrying tech stocks
higher,'' said Paul McEnroe, a trader at Brown Brothers Harriman in
New York. ''But with the market's recent volatility, it's anybody's
guess where we take it from here.''
</P>
<P>
   The tech sector was leading the way today on both the Nasdaq and
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, Applied Materials rose 6 55/64 to 94 51/64, Sun
Microsystems rose 4} at 95{; and Qualcom rose 3[ to 136. On the
NYSE, Nortel Networks rose 8~ to 128|; and America Online rose 2{
to 64[.
</P>
<P>
   New inflationary pressure was also a consideration today.
Consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in February, the biggest jump in
10 months, led by a record increase in fuel oil prices and sharply
higher gasoline costs, the Labor Department reported. But excluding
the volatile energy and food categories, the ''core'' inflation
rate was a moderate 0.2 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   The figures appeared to cheer markets because they showed no
signs of a steep resurgence in inflation, something that would lead
the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates sharply. The Fed,
however, is widely expected to raise rates one-quarter point at a
meeting Tuesday, marking a fifth increase since June.
</P>
<P>
   In the inflation-sensitive market for government bonds, yields
on 30-year Treasury securities were flirting with a dip below 6
percent for the first time in nearly six months.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other unsettling factors is that today is a ''triple
witching'' day on Wall Street, a quarterly event that occurs when
contracts on stock options, index options, and index futures all
expire. Trading to settle such contracts often contributes to
market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   On the NYSE, declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6
margin, while volume came to 682.78 million shares at 11 a.m. EST,
up slightly from Thursday's record-shattering pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.38 to 575.62.

<HEADLINE> Agreement Reached in Boeing Strike  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KLASS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A tentative agreement was reached today to end a
38-day strike by thousands of Boeing Co. engineers and technical
workers, one of the largest white-collar walkouts in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in
Aerospace will vote on the three-year pact Sunday, and union
leaders recommended approval.
</P>
<P>
   The union said the deal includes guaranteed wage increases of at
least 9 percent over the life of the contract as well as cash
bonuses of up to $2,500, a key issue in a strike that had grown
increasingly rancorous since it began Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Condit, Boeing chairman and chief executive officer, said
the strike and negotiations were difficult, ''but the end result is
a very positive agreement for both SPEEA and the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit told a news conference that company executives would
study the financial impact of the strike over the weekend, along
with recovery plans. As the strike dragged on, Boeing came under
increasing pressure from a sagging stock price and from airline
customers impatient to receive their new jets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, our focus is to deliver every one of those 491
airplanes scheduled for delivery this year and to meet all our
commitments to military customers,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   A company demand for first-time employee copayments toward
health insurance premiums was dropped, the union said, and health
coverage would be extended to unmarried domestic partners of the
affected workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted respect for our contributions and a better future
for our families and our company,'' SPEEA executive director
Charles Bofferding said in a statement. ''We believe the tentative
agreement ... delivers on those demands and can make a strong
company stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence W. McCracken, a Boeing spokesman, would not say which
if any of the major changes sought by the company were included in
the settlement. A statement said company officials would not
discuss details of the agreement until after the ratification vote.
</P>
<P>
   In early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Boeing shares climbed 5 percent, or $1.68} a share, to $37.31\.
</P>
<P>
   C. Richard Barnes, director of the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service, said he was optimistic about ratification of
the deal reached early today after meetings in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parties, both parties, worked extremely hard,'' Barnes
said in a telephone interview from Washington. ''There seemed to be
a genuine level of satisfaction among both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The union represents about 22,350 Boeing employees, mostly in
Washington state, but also in Kansas, California, Florida, Oregon,
Texas and Utah. About 14,000 are dues-paying members.
</P>
<P>
   SPEEA leaders have said more than 17,000 employees went on
strike, mostly in the Seattle area. Boeing estimates put the number
at 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has said the number of commercial airplane deliveries has
been off by 50 percent or more, while military contracts also have
been hurt. However, production at the world's largest airplane
maker has continued since assembly employees are required by
contract to work regardless of what other employees do.
</P>
<P>
   The union said picketing would continue until the pact is
ratified.
</P>
<P>
   On the picket lines in front of Boeing's military division this
morning, strikers had mixed feelings about the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it'll get approved, but it's a compromise,'' said Dave
Keil, who works on the company's Joint Strike Fighter project for
the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't touch our benefits, and that was key for us,''
added picket captain Matt Renaud. ''Looking at it that way, it's a
win for the union.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first large strike in SPEEA's 56-year history, and
some members had questioned whether the white-collar workers were
willing to take on the company. The union's only previous strike
was a one-day walkout in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said the SPEEA settlement was reached because of ''some
new thinking'' but would not disclose the source or nature of the
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Key provisions of the settlement, as described on the union's
Web site, include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Guaranteed pay increases of 3 percent a year in the
professional unit and 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent for the
technical unit. In addition, additional money would be set aside
for discretionary pay hikes and promotional increases.
</P>
<P>
   Past SPEEA contracts and previous offers have been based mainly
on discretionary pay hikes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cash bonuses of $1,000 after 30 days, $500 following delivery
of 225 planes this year and $1,000 after the delivery of 491 planes
if that total is reached by March 1, 2001. If the targets are
missed through no fault of SPEAA-covered workers, the bonuses would
be paid anyway. Neither of the previous two offers included
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   -- Extension of health coverage to unmarried domestic partners, a
provision Boeing offered to non-union workers earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing withdrew demands for monthly health
insurance copayments, an increase in deductibles and reduced life
insurance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The strike drew attention for its solidarity. Last week, the
nation's most powerful union, the AFL-CIO, said it would give the
striking workers financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   Both the engineers and technical workers -- they are separate
units within SPEEA -- rejected two earlier offers, one by more than
98 percent on Nov. 11 and the other by closer margins Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of talks began Thursday morning in Washington
and included for the first time AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard
Trumka and James Dagnon, Boeing's senior vice president for
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence at the table ''was a tremendously important
factor,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very pleased that the longest and largest white-collar
labor dispute in the aerospace industry has been settled,'' Barnes
said in a statement. ''I want to commend the leadership of the
company and union for their hard work and their commitment to
reaching this agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The union had sought more guaranteed pay raises and cash bonuses
like those received by production workers represented by the
Machinists, Boeing's largest union. Boeing had insisted on mostly
selective pay increases, reductions in life insurance benefits and
some changes in health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations broke down Feb. 27 despite the efforts of Barnes,
and earlier this month, Boeing declared an impasse, which the union
disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's value has reportedly fallen by about $5.3 billion since
the walkout began and that strikers have lost more than $125
million in wages, based on a company estimate of $3.4 million a
day.

<HEADLINE> St. Patrick's Day parade spotlights Giuliani and Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's a march of thousands, but today the St.
Patrick's Day parade beamed a spotlight on two: Rudy Giuliani and
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the city's main political man led the parade, and the
nation's leading lady made her debut at the historic parade. And
each step taken by the U.S. Senate race opponents was watched -- for
distance to each other and demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, which appeared smaller than in years past, perhaps in
part because Mother Nature offered up a freezing rain and swirl of
light snow, did it's best to embrace the politics.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy posters and Hillary shamrock stickers were as common as
green hair and ''Kiss me, I'm Irish pins'' along the route.
Giuliani's hometown supporters turned out in force, including about
100 women from the National Women's Republican Club who held signs
that said, ''Hillary, you need more than a seat, you need a
couch.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all from New York,'' said Giuliani supporter Kathleen
McCreary. ''We aren't bused in like Hillary's supporters are.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady was booed loudly along the avenue and heckled
with shouts of ''Go back to Arkansas,'' and ''Find your own
state!'' Clinton, accompanied by fellow Democrats City Council
President Peter Vallone and former Mayor Ed Koch, ignored the crowd
and continued smiling and waving. Her supporters tried to cheer her
on but they were outshouted at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's right,'' Jimmy Whelan, 67, of West Orange,
N.J., said of the emphasis on the Senate race. ''This is supposed
to be a religious-based event more than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The day began that way with a Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral
attended by 5,000 people, including Gov. George Pataki, the mayor,
Clinton and Parade Grand Marshal Kevin Cahill, who is Cardinal John
O'Connor's personal physician and president of the Irish American
Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and Giuliani sat in the front row but not together, while
the first lady -- Giuliani's Democratic rival in the U.S. Senate
race -- sat several rows behind them.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-year-old cardinal, whose health has been failing since he
underwent brain surgery in August, did not attend. He also did not
greet marchers in front of the cathedral, where he traditionally
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a wonderful day but we were all saddened by the empty
chair on the altar,'' the governor said as he left the cathedral.
''We just pray for his health.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spoke at a breakfast hosted by City Council
President Peter Vallone, also wished the cardinal well. She said
she brought greetings from the president who ''as we speak is
meeting with the parties in the White House concerning the peace
process in Northern Ireland. He sends his best wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   She also made reference to her new status, saying, ''It is just
a great pleasure to be here as a New Yorker for St. Patrick's
Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani declined an invitation to attend Vallone's breakfast
because he was going to one hosted by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before the start of the parade, some 66 members of the
Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization were arrested when they tried to
march down Fifth Avenue from 59th Street to 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   The group did not have a permit and only marched one block
before police in riot gear stopped them. They were arrested without
incident and charged with disorderly conduct. An ILGO band played a
jaunty version of ''When the Saints Go Marching In,'' as police
made the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest St. Patrick's Day parade in the nation, which
stretches up Fifth Avenue from 44th to 86th streets and over to
Third Avenue, stepped off at 11 a.m. with Giuliani, Pataki and
Police Commissioner Howard Safir in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the start of the 239th annual march, Giuliani
mingled with a cluster of spectators holding up anti-Clinton
posters, including one that said: ''We've had our fill of Hill and
Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Giulliani, asked about Clinton's participation in the parade,
said he hoped she wouldn't get lost.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is her first parade. This is my 20th,'' he said. ''I've
lived in this state all my life, I've lived in this city all my
life. I've marched in this parade when I was a little boy. ... This
is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's participation angered the Irish gay group.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot support Hillary,'' Emmaia Gelman, 25, of the Bronx,
said at the ILGO protest. ''She cannot trade civil rights for
votes. She has shown that she has no moral center and that she does
not understand civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the 10th time the New York-based ILGO has been barred
from marching in the parade under its own banner.
</P>
<P>
   The Ancient Order of Hibernians, a fraternal Catholic group that
runs the parade, has repeatedly maintained its right to exclude
ILGO.

<HEADLINE> Aliens, Mayhem, All in a Day's Work  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Makeup artists Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf and
Kevin Westmore were confronted with the task of turning a
chubby-cheeked doll into a believable corpse for ''The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   ''So Kevin throws the doll on the studio sidewalk and he's
stomping on its head. A guy walks by and says, 'That's really sick,
buddy,''' recounts Montesanto-Medcalf.
</P>
<P>
   It's just an average day for the special effects experts who
conspire to make the Fox drama one of television's most ghoulish
and reliably chilling experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The truth isn't out there, as lead character Fox Mulder insists.
It's in the wizardry of technicians who can make us believe that
aliens have landed, that a patient has been barbecued in an MRI
machine, and that a handsome young actor is wizened and ill.
</P>
<P>
   A small army works behind the scenes of the show (9 p.m. EST
Sunday), which stars David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson as FBI
agents solving oddball cases while trying to expose a government
conspiracy possibly involving an alien invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The prop department alone has six to seven people, double the
usual number for a TV show, said property master Tom Day. There are
three people in Bill Millar's visual effects squad and an equal
number in the department run by Montesanto-Medcalf. John Vulich
contributes additional makeup effects.
</P>
<P>
   Some joined the series when production was moved to Southern
California two years ago, after five years of filming in Canada.
And they really love their work.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do nice beauty makeup but I also have a kind of sick mind
and can make people look disgusting as well,'' said
Montesanto-Medcalf, cheerily. If she's haunted by frightening
images, it's only professionally.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been up since 2 a.m. thinking of zombies because of
you,'' she chided Duchovny recently. An upcoming episode he's
written and directed is filled with undead souls, and
Montesanto-Medcalf had to devise a makeup scheme for them.
</P>
<P>
   Day's Fox studio prop room is filled with evidence of the mayhem
he regularly helps fake. There are boxes marked ''human guts,''
skeletons and a rainbow of body bags -- yellow, black and white
representing different law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Many items are custom-made, such as a machete that was shown
slicing into a scientist's shoulder in the season's opening
episode.
</P>
<P>
   A weapon with a cardboard ''blade'' patterned to fit snugly
against the actor's shoulder was created, then held in place with a
thin metal plate and straps. Makeup provided the bloody finishing
touch.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked great, but it was kind of silly to watch the guy
walk over to craft services and get himself a sinker and cup of
coffee in the morning,'' Day said.
</P>
<P>
   The aliens who make occasional appearances in the series are MIA
from this storage room.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a selection of alien bodies at another warehouse, the
ones with big eyes that look so friendly,'' Day said. ''As we use
them and they get more and more beat up ... then they become the
body of the guy from Florida who's just been eaten by the swamp
monster and is inside the bag.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as they don't complain, they'll go into any body bag
we can fit them into,'' Day said, a grin stretched across his face.
</P>
<P>
   Some props are benign. A baseball-themed episode last season
called for a mechanical bank. When a suitable one couldn't be
found, Day and his crew researched and engineered a bank with a
ballplayer whose hat tips in coins.
</P>
<P>
   ''All that happens in five or six days,'' Day said, referring to
the average prep time available for each episode. ''That's the part
that amazes me. How quickly it winds up happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The various departments collaborate on each episode. Although
division of labor is the rule, sometimes one unit -- such as CGI, or
computer-generated imagery -- will take the lead on a special
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''They decide by virtue of what gives them the most bang for
their buck, so to speak,'' Day said. The big-ticket effects, such
as giant spaceships, provide a respite for his department.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we read 'CGI' in the script, it's great. We're at craft
services (eating and relaxing) for those parts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For performers, the ''X-Files'' experience can be truly
memorable.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of times the actors are hired and think, 'Oh, I got a
part.' Then they read the script and go, 'Oh, my God, this is going
to happen to me?''' said Montesanto-Medcalf.
</P>
<P>
   In one episode involving poisonous snakes, a guest actor was
covered with prosthetic blisters that seeped a pudding-like
substance with the help of air pumps. For another episode, titled
''Theef,'' the MRI victim was ''burned'' by four makeup artists
working for eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''We put a bald cap on her. Then the hair people glued on yak
hair, which is wiry, that had been singed,'' said
Montesanto-Medcalf. A blend of acetate, gelatin and paint was used
to simulate charred flesh, with dog rawhide serving as exposed
bone.
</P>
<P>
   It was ''X-Files'' perfect. ''It looked so disgusting,'' said
Montesanto-Medcalf.
</P>
<P>
   Most actors are good sports, including the stars. Anderson was a
real trouper when subjected to a swarm of insects, including giant
winged beetles, in the season's first episode, while Duchovny was
equally game when facing live snakes, Day said.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny even relished being transformed into an elderly man in
one story, Montesanto-Medcalf said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only did he have to look old, he had to look diseased. So
he wasn't a good-looking old guy, that's for sure,'' she said.
''But he loved it. Everyone on the set was so amazed at how great
it looked and kept going up to him and saying 'You look
fantastic.'''
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be only one thing that can frighten an
''X-Files'' veteran -- sharp-eyed fans looking for flubs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a baseball bat is used in an episode in season two and I
bring out the same baseball bat for something in season seven,
there will be people who get on the Internet to carp,'' said Day.

<HEADLINE> Police union does about-face, urges parade boycott  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- There will be plenty of green in the
city's annual St. Patrick's Day parade. Just very little blue.
</P>
<P>
   In a late about-face, Syracuse police have decided to skip the
parade Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the 450-member Syracuse Police Benevolent Association
considered boycotting the parade because of grievances with Police
Chief John Falge but decided that their presence in the parade
meant too much to the community. Between 150 and 200 officers
usually march.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the police union opted to walk apart from Falge and his
deputy chiefs in a show of no confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The situation changed Thursday after Falge put out a memo that
officers not marching with him could not wear their uniforms. He
later issued a second memo saying officers could wear their dress
uniforms in the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Police union president Jeff Piedmonte said that took the wind
out of the officers' sails.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's the point of marching if the kids don't know who you
are?'' Piedmonte said.
</P>
<P>
   Police union board members voted Thursday afternoon to skip the
parade for the first time in its 17-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if I paid them if I could get most officers to
march,'' Piedmonte said, adding that he expected some officers to
still take part.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PBA and the banner won't be there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police have been without a contract since Dec. 31. Relationships
soured further when Falge sided against officers in an assault case
brought against a veteran officer who was suspended for four months
without pay for hitting a 12-year-old girl with a nightstick while
trying to break up a domestic dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Falge criticized officers after nearly 100 of them showed up in
uniform outside the courtroom in what they said was a show of
support for the accused officer. The victim's family, the police
chief and mayor all said the presence of the white officers lined
up on either side of the small hallway to the courtroom was
intimidating to the black family, and stirred racial tensions in
the community.
</P>
<P>
   Falge said Thursday he thinks the entire issue has been a
misunderstanding and hopes the department can move on.

<HEADLINE> Euro Rates Cited in Rover Sell-Off  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- BMW's decision to dump its Rover
off-road and passenger car lines reflects the growing rift between
countries using Europe's single currency and stubborn holdouts such
as Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The German automaker said Friday that the strong British pound
had hurt profitability and blamed the British government for not
doing more to keep it in line with the struggling euro. Britain
angrily retorted that the Rover sell-off was premature and
needlessly threatened thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We reached a limit in what we could tolerate in terms of
economic and business considerations,'' BMW chairman Joachim
Milberg said. ''We had to act now. We had to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Milberg said BMW lost $343 million in the past year alone simply
through a 12 percent increase in the value of the British pound
against the euro, which Germany shares with 10 other European Union
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece are EU members but do not
use the euro. Britain in particular has vehemently resisted
adopting the currency and stuck with the pound, which has remained
strong despite the euro's decline since its Jan. 1, 1999, launch.
</P>
<P>
   Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford Motor Co. will pick up Land Rover for
$2.9 billion, while British investment group Alchemy Partners Ltd.
has agreed to take over the MG and Rover passenger car line. BMW is
footing $3 billion in costs just to dump the loss-making car
venture.
</P>
<P>
   BMW shares dropped 5.5 percent, or 1.76 euros, to 29.99 euros
($29.09) Friday on investor disappointment that the company was
selling largely profitable Land Rover. The drop came in stark
contrast to the 13 percent increase BMW saw Wednesday when it was
leaked that it would shed Rover's car division.
</P>
<P>
   Milberg acknowledged that BMW's decision to ditch Rover was
influenced by weak sales, falling prices and shrinking market share
as well as currency problems.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted that exchange rates figured strongly in the
calculation because the strong pound made it more expensive to
build Rover vehicles in Britain and export them to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The policy of the U.K. government made the already difficult
situation at Rover even more acute,'' Milberg said.
</P>
<P>
   British officials brushed off the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never disguised the fact that the strength of the pound
has hurt some parts of manufacturing,'' said a spokesman for Prime
Minister Tony Blair, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
''The government is not going to devalue artificially because that
route has led in the past to economic failure and boom and bust.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the British government worries that 16,000 jobs are at
stake, particularly at a Rover passenger car plant in Longbridge
that will be run by Alchemy.
</P>
<P>
   A strong currency can encourage companies to move production and
jobs to cheaper countries, but it also helps quell inflation and
attract investors. Keeping that balance has been a sore spot
between Britain and the euro countries.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Ford is shifting production of its Fiesta compact to
Germany because of similar currency-related cost increases at its
Dagenham plant in England.
</P>
<P>
   BMW says the pound stood at 2.53 marks ($1.24) when it took over
Rover in 1994 and has since appreciated to 3.18 marks ($1.56).
</P>
<P>
   Analysts sided with the British government, saying BMW was
masking a more fundamental problem -- a 25 percent drop in sales
over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Exchange rates are a bit of an excuse really,'' said Mark
Little, an auto analyst with Deutsche Bank in London. ''The weak
sterling hasn't helped things at Rover, but the simple bottom line
is that the Rover brand just doesn't work any more. It doesn't have
the prestige and appeal it once had.''

<HEADLINE> Docs: Normal Life for Tiger Victim  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Doctors said today that Jayton Tidwell has
cleared the first hurdle in his recovery and they are optimistic
that the little boy whose right arm was ripped off by a tiger will
have a nearly normal life.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old remained in serious but stable condition today at
Memorial Hermann Children's Hospital, where surgeons reattached his
limb just above the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ''As of this morning, we've now cleared the first hurdle, which
is the first 24 hours worth of blood flow in and out of the limb,''
surgeon Dr. Mark H. Henry said today on NBC's ''Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   It will take about six months before physicians begin to learn
the extent of Jayton's recovery. The boy faces more surgery and
rehabilitation over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looks perfect. He couldn't be doing better than he is right
now,'' Henry said this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Jayton should be able to live a normal life, Henry said, though
he never will have full use of the arm. The boy is right-handed, as
far as Henry knew, but should be able to transfer functions to his
left hand if he needs to.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way he'll be 100 percent,'' Henry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengal tiger was kept in the back yard of the boy's uncle,
Larry Tidwell, in a working-class section east of Houston. The
animal attacked Wednesday afternoon when the child stuck his arm
through a gap in its chain-link cage, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor Tracy Olivas, who called the tiger a nice and even
passive animal, said she rushed from her home when she heard
Jayton's ''bloodcurdling scream.''
</P>
<P>
   While Olivas' husband and Tidwell's wife coaxed the tiger to one
side of the cage, Tidwell's son retrieved the boy's arm. They
packed the limb in ice, and a medical team took it to the hospital
with the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery to reattach the limb began Wednesday night and lasted
for nine hours. Henry said the necessary blood vessels and nerves
were reconnected before a crucial six-hour window had closed.
</P>
<P>
   Tidwell was cited for keeping a dangerous animal without a
permit, a misdemeanor punishable by a $500 fine. Tidwell told
reporters: ''We're not telling anybody anything. The No. 1 thing is
that baby right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivas said the declawed tiger, named Cheyenne, is a 4-year-old
female that weighs about 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It will be quarantined for 30 days in order to comply with state
laws regarding an animal that bites a person. Determined to keep
his pet, Tidwell told animal control officers he will renovate the
animal's pen to comply with state permit requirements. The cage
needs a roof and a cement floor, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Bodie Shivers as Death Valley Bakes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- California cornered the nation's hottest times
and chilliest moments last year, reporting the communities with the
most daily high and low temperatures in the 48 contiguous states.
</P>
<P>
   Death Valley, Calif., lived up to its hot reputation. It had the
nation's highest temperature 86 times in 1999, more than double the
runner-up, McAllen, Texas, which was hottest on 41 days, according
to an annual compilation in Weatherwise magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Death Valley also scored the year's hottest high, 123 degrees on
July 1. The lowest low was -43, recorded Jan. 1 at Tower, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the ledger, Bodie, Calif., a ghost town 50
miles south of Lake Tahoe, was the coldest place on 71 days,
followed by Wisdom, Mont., which was coldest on 45 occasions,
according to the report compiled by David Hickcox of Ohio Wesleyan
University.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the five cities recording the most daily highs were
Lake Havasu City, Ariz., 34 days; Laredo, Texas, 31 days; and
Lajitas, Texas, at Big Bend National Park, and Thermal, Calif.,
each with 27 days.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the coldest five were Shirley Basin, Wyo., coldest
on 24 days, and Tower, Minn., and West Yellowstone, Mont., 22 days
each.

<HEADLINE> Undercover Cop Shoots Unarmed Man  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Police were trying to determine whether an
undercover officer's weapon was fired accidentally in a struggle
that left an unarmed man dead.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's police shooting -- the second fatal one this year --
happened just two weeks after officers shot and killed an unarmed
man in the Bronx. Eleven people died in police shootings last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest incident, Patrick Dorismond, a black security
guard, died at a hospital from a bullet wound to the chest. No
drugs or other contraband were found on his body.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, one of three Hispanic undercover officers
performing drug ''buy-and-bust'' operations approached Dorismond,
25, and another man outside a bar a few blocks from Penn Station
and Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The officer engaged the men in ''a conversation relative to
drugs,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir said at a news conference
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The two men attacked the officer, and Detective Anthony Vasquez,
29, came to his aid, Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who also attended the news conference,
said Vasquez's firearm discharged once during the altercation.
Safir said police were investigating how the gun went off.
</P>
<P>
   Police could not immediately confirm witness reports that
Vasquez was hitting Dorismond with his service revolver when it
went off.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, another undercover officer fatally shot an
unarmed man in the Bronx, blocks from where unarmed immigrant
Amadou Diallo was shot and killed last year by four white police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   All the officers in the Diallo case were acquitted of murder,
sparking outrage among residents.

<P>
   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- Dorathy Yurkiewicz, a former rodeo
daredevil and stunt rider who turned in her spurs to become a
foster mother, has died. She was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Yurkiewicz, of Edison, who rode Brahma bulls, gave sharpshooting
demonstrations and had knives thrown at her, performed as Dot Cole
in the 1930s and 1940s after running off with her rodeo cowboy
lover at age 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''She never glamorized herself or thought about herself as
anybody special,'' said her daughter, Gail Lisa, 48. ''She'd rather
be remembered as a foster parent than a rodeo star.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Newark, Yurkiewicz was a feisty 5-foot-5-inch tomboy who
met and married 16-year-old Ted Cole after dropping out of high
school. The two toured with the Milt Hinkle Texas Rangers Rodeo,
the Sons of the Pioneers and the Roy Rogers rodeo companies.
</P>
<P>
   She made her mark as the first woman to ride a Brahma bull in a
national rodeo, according to the Women's Professional Rodeo
Association. ''Back in the days when rodeo was a big act, she was a
big part of it,'' said Jerry Gavin, a longtime family friend.
</P>
<P>
   Performing with her husband, she would be tied to a rotating
wheel while he threw knives at her. But she always insisted that he
have a couple of drinks first, according to Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were afraid that if he were sober, he'd try too hard and
he'd miss,'' Lisa said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, she spent nine days in jail after being pulled over by
police in New Jersey on the lookout for bank robbers. The police
found a cache of weapons, including a sawed-off shotgun, when they
searched her truck and didn't believe she was a rodeo sharpshooter,
so they jailed her.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, her rodeo colleagues verified her story and she was
released.
</P>
<P>
   ''She thought it was hysterical,'' said Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   In eight years with rodeos, she traveled all over America and
the world. But in 1944, her desire to raise a family prompted her
to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   Twice married, she had five children and raised 32 foster
children after moving to Union Beach. She never regretted giving up
the rodeo, but carried the memories of it with her for her whole
life. She taught her children rope tricks, yodeling, songs -- all
seven of her grandchildren and all seven of her great-grandchildren
learned ''You Are My Sunshine'' -- and other acts.
</P>
<P>
   Stricken by diabetes, which blinded her in her later years, and
liver problems, she remained active in community organizations. She
was a member of the Democratic Club of Union Beach, raised money
for the American Heart Association and was a member of the Cullen
Center for Seniors in Hazlet.
</P>
<P>
   And she yodeled all the way to the end. Her daughter recalled
her yodeling in the car on the way home from a doctor's visit last
Friday, two days before her death. ''She let out the most beautiful
yodel, in a very light tone,'' Lisa said.
</P>
<P>
   Yurkiewicz is survived by two daughters, two sons, a brother and
a sister.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services were Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Statues May Be Stolen  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- It's Hollywood's latest caper: Who
took the Oscars? Nine days before the Academy Awards, police today
searched for 55 of the coveted statuettes that vanished from a
trucking company loading dock.
</P>
<P>
   The Roadway Express trucking firm told the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences on March 10 that the Oscars were believed
stolen from a dock in the city of Bell, academy executive director
Bruce Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Roadway has posted a $50,000 reward for their return.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago manufacturer of the statuettes, meanwhile, was
making replacements on overtime, and they will be flown in next
week. Davis wouldn't give an arrival date.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to be a little coy about that just in case there's
an Oscar gang out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Los Angeles and Bell police departments, FBI
art-theft experts were investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Davis assured nominees there will be enough Oscars on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not the end of the Oscar show,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, sacks containing 4,000 ballots were
misrouted after delivery to the Beverly Hills Post Office by an
accounting firm. The academy was forced to print and mail new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for returning the ballots was extended from March
21 to March 23, just three days before the awards show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Three weeks ago we were kind of tiptoeing around saying,
'Things are going awfully smooth. Something's going to happen,' ''
Davis said. ''It's been a strange year.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked during a news conference if the heist might be a hoax to
stir interest in the presentations, Davis responded: ''It is not a
publicity stunt. There isn't much of a dearth of academy publicity
this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   Roadway officials declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Siegel, head of R.S. Owens Co., the Chicago company that
makes the Oscars, said he learned Monday that the entire shipment
of 55 statuettes had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were packed in cartons and there was no ID to indicate
they were anything special,'' Siegel said today.
</P>
<P>
   The academy has about 20 in storage. Owens employees will have
to work overtime for the company to make 35 in time for the
ceremony, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The academy said the shipment of Oscars, packed in 10 cases and
weighing about 500 pounds, has a value of about $18,000. Siegel,
who noted the shipment was insured, declined to say how much an
Oscar costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Department was called in to investigate,
but Officer Jason Lee said it was unclear exactly why. The theft
allegedly occurred at a Roadway dock in Bell, but police there
claimed they didn't know about a theft.
</P>
<P>
   Each Oscar is 13{ inches tall, is covered with gold-plated
britannium and weighs about 8 pounds. Awards are to be given out in
23 categories plus three special awards, whose winners have already
been announced. The precise number of statuettes given out will
depend on how many people wind up sharing awards in various
categories.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 13.34; Nasdaq Rises 62.77  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks pushed higher today, extending Thursday's
remarkable gains, as investors have once again grown enamored with
the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average pulled back from an earlier
surge in choppy trading but remained up 13.34 at 10,643.94 in heavy
trading at midafternoon, adding to Thursday's 499.19-point surge,
the largest one-day point gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's bold advance during the previous two days, which
included a 320-point surge Wednesday, was a stunning reversal of
fortunes. In those two days, the Dow stocks wiped out more than 40
percent of their losses over the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher today. The Nasdaq
composite index was up 62.77 at 4,780.16. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 9.97 at 1,468.44.
</P>
<P>
   The tech sector was leading the way today on both the Nasdaq and
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''The techs are rocking and rolling and the overall market is
acting very well given the recent runups. The Dow rose 800 points
in two days and it's still moving higher,'' said Alfred Goldman,
director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said the gains on both markets were surprising since
today is a ''triple witching'' day on Wall Street, a quarterly
event that occurs when contracts on stock options, index options,
and index futures all expire. Trading to settle such contracts
often contributes to market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, Applied Materials rose 7 5/16 to 95\, Sun
Microsystems rose 4] at 95[; and Qualcom rose 3 1/16 to 135 15/16.
On the NYSE, Nortel Networks rose 9{ to 129\; and America Online
rose 2\ to 63~.
</P>
<P>
   ''Momentum from yesterday's rally is carrying tech stocks
higher,'' said Paul McEnroe, a trader at Brown Brothers Harriman in
New York. ''But with the market's recent volatility, it's anybody's
guess where we take it from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Large brokerage firms were also up across the board, with Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter up 6 5/16 at 87 1/16, Merrill Lynch up 5 3/16
at 105 11/16, discount broker Charles Schwab up 5} at 55{.
</P>
<P>
   New inflationary pressure was also a consideration today.
Consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in February, the biggest jump in
10 months, led by a record increase in fuel oil prices and sharply
higher gasoline costs, the Labor Department reported. But excluding
the volatile energy and food categories, the ''core'' inflation
rate was a moderate 0.2 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   The figures appeared to cheer markets because they showed no
signs of a steep resurgence in inflation, something that would lead
the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates sharply. The Fed,
however, is widely expected to raise rates one-quarter point at a
meeting Tuesday, marking a fifth increase since June.
</P>
<P>
   In the inflation-sensitive market for government bonds, yields
on 30-year Treasury securities were flirting with a dip below 6
percent for the first time in nearly six months.
</P>
<P>
   On the NYSE, declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 8-to-7
margin, while volume came to 943.43 million shares at 2 p.m. EST,
down somewhat from Thursday's record-shattering pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.25 to 572.99.

<HEADLINE> Residential Hotel Fire Injures 14  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) -- An early morning fire at a
four-story residential hotel injured more than a dozen people.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. T. Mixon this afternoon said he was unaware of any
fatalities. Earlier, a man who answered the phone at the Highland
Park Department of Public Safety and gave his name as John Casatera
had said there was one dead.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen people were treated at two Detroit hospitals; seven of
them remained hospitalized this afternoon. At least two were
injured when they jumped from windows, while others suffered from
burns and smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said a man was clinging to an upper-story window for
several minutes before he fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were screaming, 'Hang on, hang on.' But he just couldn't
hang on any longer,'' said Sharon Joseph, 50. ''I can't imagine
what was going through his mind. And then he fell.''
</P>
<P>
   WXYZ-TV said the man was in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Ronald Parham said investigators believe the fire began
when a woman accidentally knocked over a burning candle in the
roughly 80-unit, 100-resident building.
</P>
<P>
   Highland Park, an impoverished city of about 25,000, was the
former headquarters of Chrysler Corp. before the company moved to
Auburn Hills.

   Nixon Eisenhower, who travels the country as an author, editor

<HEADLINE> Arnold Newman's Photos Displayed  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arnold Newman has snapped them all, from
Russian composer Igor Stravinsky to Nazi industrialist Alfried
Krupp -- with dozens of artists, poets and presidents along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Many are included among the 160 photos in the Corcoran Gallery
of Art's ''Breaking Ground'' exhibit which opens Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Newman pioneered ''environmental portraits'' with the subject in
surroundings representative of his or her life -- catching the human
animal in its native habitat.
</P>
<P>
   In the Stravinsky photo, his head and shoulders appear in a
corner of the photo, overshadowed by the raised lid of his grand
piano. The frame on the lid looks like a hugely exaggerated symbol
in a musical score, the one that shows a note is to be played flat.
</P>
<P>
   Krupp, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison at the Nuremberg
trials, sits bathed in an evil greenish-yellow light. Behind him
looms a prison-like factory, part of the industrial empire restored
to him when he was released.
</P>
<P>
   At 82, Newman thinks he may someday go back to painting, where
he started, but quit because he was too poor to finish art school.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's Al Hirschfeld, he's 97 and still at it,'' Newman
mused.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld, who actually will be 97 in June, is best known for
caricatures of entertainment figures. Newman has a pensive Woody
Allen on the dust jacket of his catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Active and talkative about history and politics as well as
photography, Newman led reporters through a preview of the show,
reliving his 62-year career. He explained that for important
historic figures he liked an intensely close-up portrait, ''showing
every pore.''
</P>
<P>
   President Truman posed for Newman soon after he left office in
1953.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't resist asking him afterwards: 'Mr. President, why
did you drop the bomb?''' Newman said. Truman talked to him for a
half-hour, convincing him that ''he saved thousands of lives, not
only American lives, but Japanese lives. The Japanese would have
fought down to the last baby,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Newman also told a story about Pablo Picasso, whom he
photographed in southern France a year later. Picasso asked him if
he would like to do Henri Matisse -- the aging painter who was one
of the leaders of the French impressionists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Picasso picked up the phone and started a long conversation,''
Newman recalled. ''My French is like that'' - he held two fingers
half an inch apart - ''but I could hear his tone going lower and
lower. Finally he put the phone down. 'Fini... fini... (finished),'
he said. Matisse died a few months later.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman's portrait of Picasso -- a single eye peering out of a
torn paper frame -- faces the title page of the show's catalog.
</P>
<P>
   ''People talk about piercing eyes,'' Newman said. ''It's usually
not true, but Picasso's eye went right through.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tech Stocks Push Europe Shares Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Rebounding technology, media and
telecommunications shares led European stocks mostly higher on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks companies in
countries that joined the single currency, ended up 5.29 points at
448.32, while the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index was up 56.1 points
at 5,231.4 and the Dow Jones Stoxx 50 Index rose 55.2 points to
4,989.0.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of shares in European companies rose
3.36 points, or 0.9 percent, to 393.74, with the telecoms, media
and technology subindexes performing strongly. Automotive, basic
resources and food and beverage stocks fell.
</P>
<P>
   The release of stronger-than-expected 3.2 percent gain in the
February U.S. consumer price index cost stocks some of their early
gains.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam's AEX Index rose 1.3 percent to 672.18. Internet
service provider World Online failed to live up to the excitement
surrounding its initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   London's FTSE 100 index rose a bare 0.8 point to close at 6,558.
</P>
<P>
   Milan's MIBtel Index rose 1.5 percent to 33,665, lifted by a 6.2
percent surge in blue chip Enel before the firm's entry on Monday
into the Eurostoxx 50 index.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris CAC-40 Index rose 0.7 percent to 6,304.28, helped by
France Telecom, which rose 6.9 percent. Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index
rose 1.7 percent to 7,710.92.

   Smith &AMP; Wesson OKs Safety Locks
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's largest gun manufacturer, Smith &AMP;
Wesson, has agreed to provide safety locks on its handguns within
60 days and to make them child-resistant within a year, the Clinton
administration announced today. Under the unprecedented deal
reached with the company by the departments of Housing and Urban
Development and Treasury and officials representing state and local
governments, Smith &AMP; Wesson agreed to a ''code of conduct'' for
sales and distribution of handguns. The company would sell its
products ''only to authorized dealers and distributors'' who also

   Moratorium Ordered on Rail Mergers
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government ordered a moratorium on
railroad mergers Friday while it considers new rules for such
combinations. The Surface Transportation Board issued the order
following hearings on the proposed $6 billion merger of Burlington
Northern Santa Fe and Canadian National Railway. That would have
created a network of 50,000 miles of track from Nova Scotia to Los
Angeles and the Gulf of Mexico to Vancouver, British Columbia. But
the proposal came on the heels of a string of mergers during the
1990s that caused rail car shortages, shipping delays and depressed
stock prices. The board said it has directed railroads not to
pursue further mergers until it adopts new rules, which should
occur within 15 months.

   Fuel Drives Up Consumer Prices
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A record rise in fuel oil prices along with a
steep increase in gasoline costs drove up consumer prices by 0.5
percent in February -- the biggest monthly gain since last April.
Economists said the news justifies a widely expected boost in
interest rates next week by the Federal Reserve to keep inflation
under control. The jolt in the Consumer Price Index, the most
closely watched inflation gauge, came from a huge 4.6 percent
increase in energy prices, the biggest jump in 10 months, the Labor
Department said today. It was a slightly worse showing on inflation
than many analysts were anticipating.

   Iridium Wants To End Phone Service

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Barring a last minute financial rescue, Iridium
LLC planned today to shut down its mobile phone service at midnight
and send its 66 satellites eventually crashing to earth. The
company told a U.S. bankruptcy court in a written filing that it
has been unable to find a qualified buyer and asked for permission
to use $8.3 million of its remaining money to close down. The move
would cut off service to 55,000 customers. Iridium's filing came
just hours before a scheduled hearing to determine the future of
the money-losing company, which has been beset by anemic consumer
demand and $4.4 billion in debts.

   SEATTLE (AP) -- A tentative agreement was reached today to end a

workers, one of the largest white-collar walkouts in U.S. history.
Members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in
Aerospace will vote on the three-year pact Sunday, and union
leaders recommended approval. The union said the deal includes
guaranteed wage increases of at least 9 percent over the life of
the contract as well as cash bonuses of up to $2,500, a key issue

$20 for leisure travelers who book ahead. Northwest announced its
higher fares Thursday, and by late evening American Airlines,
Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines had

West joined the pack this morning, making it likely that the
increase would hold up. Carriers generally only rescind fare hikes

Francisco Chronicle, which have been publishing under a joint

<HEADLINE> Dow Pulls Back, Falls 50.96  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rose across the board today,
creating a lone haven of stability in an otherwise volatile market.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average pulled back from an earlier
surge and dipped into negative territory in late afternoon trading,
falling 50.96 to 10,579.64. The benchmark average rose 499.19
points on Thursday, the largest one-day point gain ever.

<P>
   The Dow's bold advance during the previous two days, which

</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the late afternoon selloff could be attributed to
investors taking profits from the recent runup.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher today. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 56.98 at 4,774.37. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 4.54 at 1,463.01.
</P>

   Technology stocks were higher on both the Nasdaq and the New

<P>
   ''The techs are rocking and rolling and the overall market is

</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the old line stocks that make up the majority of the Dow
Jones average fell out of favor again late Friday. Alcoa fell 3
15/16 to 65, International Paper fell 2 5/16 to 38 5/16, and
General Motors fell 3 3/16 to 80 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Large brokerage firms shrugged off the volatility and were up
across the board. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rose 6 11/16 to 87
7/16, Merrill Lynch rose 4| to 105[, and discount broker Charles
Schwab rose 6[ to 55{.
</P>
<P>
   New inflationary pressure was also a consideration today.
Consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in February, the biggest jump in
10 months, led by a record increase in fuel oil prices and sharply
higher gasoline costs, the Labor Department reported. But excluding
the volatile energy and food categories, the ''core'' inflation
rate was a moderate 0.2 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   The figures appeared to cheer markets because they showed no
signs of a steep resurgence in inflation, something that would lead
the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates sharply. The Fed,
however, is widely expected to raise rates one-quarter point at a
meeting Tuesday, marking a fifth increase since June.

<HEADLINE> DNA Changing Limitation Statutes  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT TANNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With DNA solving crime after crime, some states
are extending or dropping the statute of limitations on prosecuting
rape and other violent offenses in case a genetic match that can
prove who did it turns up decades later.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes in the law challenge the legal tradition that says
prosecutors have to bring charges within a certain amount of time
after the crime -- a rule based on concern that evidence might get
lost and witnesses prove untrustworthy after many years have gone
by.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, statutes of limitations for serious offenses run for
four to six years, depending on the state.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers warn that dropping those limits would give
prosecutors too strong a hand.
</P>
<P>
   But such changes make sense to Michigan state Sen. William Van
Regenmorter, who heads his state's Senate Judiciary committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''The statute of limitations served a function, particularly in
pre-DNA days, with worries about memories fading. DNA doesn't rely
on memories. Those old arguments fade away when you have DNA,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, at least 180,000 rape kits -- evidence gathered from
a woman's body -- remain untested, according to the Justice
Department's National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Because crime labs are backlogged, kits that may provide the
proof to inextricably link rape victim and rapist can take years to
get tested. Meanwhile, statutes of limitations close the door on
prosecutors seeking justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every single day we reach a point that the rape that occurred
five years and one day ago is unprosecutable. And that victim has
no recourse whatsoever,'' said Chris Asplen, an assistant U.S.
attorney who directs the commission.
</P>
<P>
   New DNA evidence has already freed many defendants convicted of
crimes they didn't commit. It also helped prompt re-examination of
the death penalty in Illinois, where 13 men have been freed from
death row because of serious doubts about their guilt.
</P>
<P>
   DNA -- the genetic molecule that can identify one person out of
billions -- is now a crucial enforcement tool. State and national
databanks already contain more than 220,000 DNA profiles of
criminals and suspects.
</P>
<P>
   While legislators debate changing the laws, prosecutors and
police are already relying on DNA to buy themselves more time.
</P>
<P>
   This week, New York City prosecutors filed charges against a
serial rapist identified only by his genetic profile. In effect,
they escaped the state's five-year statute of limitations and
bought time to find the suspect. Authorities have done something
similar in Utah and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have already reshaped laws involving sexual
assaults. In 1997, Florida removed a statute of limitation on any
rape case where potential DNA evidence has been collected. That
year, Nevada eliminated its statute of limitations in rape cases.
In California, Hawaii, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York
and Wisconsin, lawmakers are now re-examining their statutes of
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Most proposed changes focus on rape, but some go further. New
York legislators want to cut the five-year limits on prosecuting
violent felonies such as robbery, rape and manslaughter. The state
already places no time limits on arson and kidnapping. Michigan's
Van Regenmorter wants no limits for all felonies with DNA evidence.
</P>
<P>
   This month in California, a House committee approved a measure
waiving the five-year limit on rape if new DNA evidence is
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, murder was considered too heinous to ever close
the books, so states place no time limits on such prosecutions. But
lesser crimes have always carried time limits.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Lefcourt, a past president of the National Association
for Criminal Defense Lawyers, said the statute of limitations
protects defendants whose fate depends on witnesses or records that
may be impossible to find after too much time.
</P>
<P>
   Lefcourt also questions how lawmakers can give prosecutors the
right to go to court with new DNA evidence, but not defendants who
claim wrongful convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Asplen, the federal prosecutor, agreed. ''It absolutely has to
go both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two states -- New York and Illinois -- guarantee convicted
criminals the right to test evidence in cases that pre-dated DNA
testing.

<HEADLINE> Bush Attacks Gore on Education  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. CHARLES, Ill. (AP) -- Taking aim at Al Gore, George W. Bush
is kicking off the general election ad wars with sharp criticism of
the Clinton administration's education record in a TV spot in a
handful of battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is responding with an ad of his own, airing in the same
media markets.
</P>
<P>
   Just days after wrapping up the GOP nomination, Bush wasted no
time in going after Gore over the air, charging that during his
watch reading scores have stagnated and U.S. students have
continued to rank near the bottom in math tests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore and Clinton had eight years, but they've failed,'' an
announcer says in the 60-second commercial. The ad also touts
Bush's record in Texas on education and his goals for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's ad hits right back.
</P>
<P>
   ''George W. Bush -- from South Carolina to New York he used dirty
politics to trash John McCain's record. Now he's running attack ads
against Al Gore,'' the ad says.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the ads, the first since Republican Bush and Democrat
Gore clinched their parties' presidential nominations, will run
through Tuesday in southern Illinois markets, including on stations
that reach into Kentucky, Iowa and Missouri. Bush made his buys
first, and Gore moved to match them today.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois holds its primary election on Tuesday, but the ad is
clearly intended as early groundwork for the fall. Education is
consistently one of the most important issues for voters,
particularly women. Beyond the battleground of Illinois, the ad
reaches Kentucky and Missouri, which are both likely to be sharply
contested in November.
</P>
<P>
   The ad comes a day after Bush worked to control the fallout from
an interview in which he seemed dismissive of former rival John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Texas governor said that he and McCain could
make a dynamic duo in Washington, with the senator and would-be
president working together on issues such as overhauling campaign
financing and shoring up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that the Arizona senator helped produce record turnouts
in early primaries, Bush told The New York Times, ''Well, then, how
come he didn't win?'' Asked whether McCain had raised his
consciousness about reform, Bush replied, ''No, he didn't change my
views.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain supporters said Thursday that such ''macho talk'' had
harmed hopes for an early endorsement of Bush that could be vital
to his prospects of winning in November.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Allbaugh, Bush's campaign manager, called John Weaver,
McCain's top political adviser, to say he regretted that the
newspaper story didn't include more nice things that Bush had said
about McCain. Allbaugh also reached out to reassure McCain's allies
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''People want to focus on areas where we disagree,'' Bush told
reporters in Springfield during a campaign swing through Illinois
that included a fund-raiser to help replenish his depleted campaign
kitty. ''I'm going to focus on areas where we agree, and there's a
lot of areas of agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   He named Social Security and campaign finance reform as
examples.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was equally deferential at later appearances in Wheaton and
St. Charles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to thank the senator for his campaign. I want to thank
the senator for his strong ideas on reform,'' he told a dinner of
over 1,300 DuPage County Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raiser in Wheaton, he said: ''I think it's very
important for us to recognize the contributions John made.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's effort at fence-mending came as he fended off fresh
criticism from Gore and waded into a nasty dispute between the
National Rifle Association and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He said the NRA had ''gone too far'' by accusing Clinton of
having ''blood on his hands'' for failing to enforce gun laws
before a deadly shooting last year in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   After Bush aligned himself with conservative groups during the
primary campaign, he is trying to shift back toward the political
center for the general election. Gun control is popular among
independent-minded voters, particularly the suburban women that
Bush and Gore are both courting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says the Texas governor does the bidding of the gun lobby;
Bush strongly denies it.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is a gun rights supporter, Bush said: ''There's ways
to debate the issue without casting aspersions on the president
like that. I just think they've gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published in today's editions of USA Today, Gore
called upon Bush to join him in backing pending federal legislation
to require mandatory child-safety trigger locks for new firearms,
end a loophole that exempts purchasers of guns at gun shows from
background checks and ban cheap handguns known as Saturday Night
Specials.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, campaigning close to home in Chevy Chase, Md., Gore
criticized Bush's five-year, $483 billion tax-cut proposal as
''economic snake oil.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president cast the fall election as a choice between
policies that underwrote the ''Clinton-Gore recovery'' and ones
that gave America the ''Bush-Quayle catastrophe,'' meaning the
recession that hit when Bush's father was president.

<HEADLINE> Utah Creates Pornography Czar Post  </HEADLINE>
By HANNAH WOLFSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Gov. Michael Leavitt signed a law Friday
that will make straight-laced Utah the first state with a
pornography czar.
</P>
<P>
   The czar, a prosecutor who has yet to be appointed, will help
local governments restrict or eliminate pornography.
</P>
<P>
   However, the appointee, whose title will be deputy attorney
general, will have little prosecutorial power and no jurisdiction
over the Internet or cable television.
</P>
<P>
   Pornography is a hot topic in Utah, where more than 70 percent
of the population belongs to the Mormon Church. Lawmakers have
already passed bills banning Playboy from prisons and barring
minors from viewing pornographic Web sites at public libraries. One
lawmaker recently branded a Planned Parenthood pamphlet on how to
use a condom ''pornographic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, pornography is not easy to come by in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ''The irony of all this is that there have not been that many
pornography cases lately,'' said Carol Gnade, director of the Utah
chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. ''This seems to be a
solution without a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican state Rep. Evan L. Olsen, who sponsored the
legislation, said his constituents asked him about the state's
obscenity standards after catching their children surfing for
cybersex.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt there's a lot of people who wanted to do something but
didn't know where to turn,'' Olsen said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation sets aside $75,000 next year and suggests
spending $150,000 in future years.
</P>
<P>
   Utah is the first state to name a general porn czar, though
other states, such as California and New York, have teams or
individuals responsible for investigating child pornography.

<HEADLINE> State senator says 'video voyeurism' should be crime  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Legislation has been introduced in the New
York state Senate to criminalize ''video voyeurism,'' which one
senator said Friday has created an entire subculture of sex
offenders with the help of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dean Skelos, a Nassau County Republican, said state laws
currently do not appear to bar the videotaping in public places of
unsuspecting people -- typically young women -- with hidden cameras.
Specifically, these ''video voyeurs'' angle cameras in ways that
can take images up women's skirts or down their blouses, Skelos
said.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the images are then collected or swapped on the Internet.
Skelos said entire sites devoted to ''upskirt'' or ''down blouse''
photographs are available, as is information on how to get the
special cameras needed for such surreptitious videotaping.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have discovered that a virtual
subculture of people who get sexual gratification from seeing such
materials has begun to crop up, Skelos said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must empower our local police departments to apprehend and
convict these sexual offenders,'' the legislator said. ''It is
crucial that we stay current with the advances in modern technology
and that we protect the privacy and dignity of our wives and
daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate legislation would make it a Class A misdemeanor to
secretly make such videotapes and a Class E felony to transmit the
images of people taken without their consent over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Convictions of Class A misdemeanors carry fines of up to $1,000
and jail sentences of up to a year in New York. A Class E felony
carries with it a prison sentence of up to four years.
</P>
<P>
   The new provisions are being added to legislation introduced
last year by Sen. Carl Marcellino, another Long Island Republican,
prohibiting other forms of unauthorized videotaping. That bill was
drafted in response to a case where a landlord had planted several
video cameras to secretly record the activities of his tenants,
said an aide to Marcellino.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Jan. 1, California has had a law making it a
misdemeanor to secretly photograph someone under their clothing for
sexual gratification.
</P>
<P>
   The California law was prompted by the discovery of hidden
cameras at Disneyland, the Garden Grove Strawberry Festival and at
the beach in Orange County, Calif. Many of the images of young
women taken at those tourist spots were placed on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   California law enforcement officials were unable to file charges
against the photographers because there was no specific law against
the activity.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation is pending in Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Barnstorming Putin Boasts of Capture  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin, whose tough
stance on Chechnya feeds his wide lead ahead of this month's
election, boasted on a campaign trip Friday that Russia is reducing
rebels to pathetic figures.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Chechen warlord Salman Raduyev, who was seized by
Russia this week, Putin said: ''He is one of those who terrorized
our country, the great Russia. But everybody saw that he does not
look like a terrorist (now). He is more like an animal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will reduce them all to the same condition,'' he said en
route from a campaign stop in Orekhovo-Zuyevo just east of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The capture of Raduyev was a boost for Russia's image as
outnumbered and outgunned rebels continue to bloody federal forces
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The warlord, once widely recognizable for his full beard and
dark glasses, was shown on Russian TV clean-shaven and without
glasses -- revealing severe injuries suffered in the previous
Chechnya conflict, including a deformed nose and eye.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, buoyed by wide public approval for the Chechnya
offensive, is recording support of about 60 percent in polls ahead
of the March 26 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The support appears to be largely the result of his firmness on
Chechnya and his promises to restore Russia's greatness, including
revitalizing its deteriorating armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops in Chechnya began voting in advance on Friday.
Commanders said they were overwhelmingly backing Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Even a soldier with a maverick streak thinks Putin's victory is
assured.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's already known that Putin will be elected; just to look
different, I voted against all the candidates,'' said Warrant
Officer Nadir Khachukayev.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's nearest challenger, Communist Party chief Gennady
Zyuganov, with support of about 20 percent in opinion polls, has
sharply criticized Putin for relying on ringing words about
greatness without releasing a plan for dealing with Russia's
complex economic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Putin on Friday expressed confidence in his prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wouldn't have made sense to enter the race if I didn't
count on success,'' he told TV reporters on a new commuter train
heading to Moscow from Orekhovo-Zuyevo, where it was made.
</P>
<P>
   The train itself underlined Putin's promises that Russia can
rebound from its troubles -- its shine and cabin TV monitors a sharp
contrast to the dingy, aging trains that are a part of daily life
for most commuters.
</P>
<P>
   He was accompanied by Moscow region Governor Boris Gromov, whose
gubernatorial bid the Kremlin opposed. Putin needs to secure
Gromov's support to strengthen his position in industrial cities
around Moscow -- the traditional turf of the Communists.

<HEADLINE> Gene Kelly's Brother Dies at 83  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Fred Kelly, a three-time Tony Award winner
and dance instructor who taught his older brother, Gene Kelly, how
to tap dance, died of cancer Wednesday. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Kelly also taught Queen Elizabeth how to dance and showed
John Travolta how to strut.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's son, Michael, said his father's first priority was
pleasing people.
</P>
<P>
   ''My dad was involved in every civic, charitable and religious
organization,'' Kelly said. ''He made time for everyone. People
were his hobby. He didn't golf, he didn't bowl, he entertained.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was born in Pittsburgh in 1916. He and his siblings
learned to dance at an early age so they could help teach classes
in their mother's dance studio. He earned money by performing in
talent shows during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, Kelly won three Tony awards for his lead performance in
''Time of Your Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Kelly entered the military during World War II, he
didn't stray far from the dance floor. He was called to Buckingham
Palace in 1944 to teach Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret to dance.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the 1950s, my brother Gene was at the palace for a command
screening of 'An American in Paris','' Kelly said in a 1996
interview. ''Gene's going through the reception line and Queen
Elizabeth comes running up to him and says, 'Oh, Mr. Kelly, is it
true you're the brother of Fred Kelly?'''
</P>
<P>
   Fred and Gene Kelly appeared together on film only once: In the
1955 ''Deep in my Heart,'' they performed ''I Love to Go Swimmen
with Women.''
</P>
<P>
   In additional to Michael, Kelly is survived by a daughter, two
sisters and eight grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A Mass was scheduled for March 25 at St. Pius X Church in
Tucson.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Statues Presumed Be Stolen  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- And the Oscar goes to ... hmmm,
where'd that statue go?
</P>
<P>
   In a comedy of errors worthy of a screenplay nomination, the 55
statuettes bound for the Academy Awards show are missing and
presumed stolen -- the latest embarrassing development in an Oscar
buildup that could prove more captivating than the ceremony itself.
</P>
<P>
   Academy officials said Friday the show will go on March 26 and
enough statues will be on hand. At a lighthearted news conference,
Academy executive director Bruce Davis said the Oscars have simply
fallen victim to a ''strange year.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We think everybody should watch the entire Oscar show to see
if we have enough on hand to get through the end of the show,''
Davis wisecracked. He joked that the Academy might hand out a
''really nicely engraved I.O.U.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Academy has about 20 Oscars in storage, and
manufacturer R.S. Owens Co. of Chicago is busy making replacements.
Oscar officials expect to have those delivered early next week.
</P>
<P>
   The statues were reported missing March 10 from a Roadway
Express loading dock in Bell, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same community where 4,000 Oscar ballots were
misplaced at a post office earlier this month. The ballots were
eventually found, but by that time, the Academy had printed new
ballots and extended the voting deadline by two days, to next
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As things turned curiouser and curiouser with the stolen
statues, Academy officials joked about the added drama. Academy
spokesman John Pavlik said he expects Oscar host Billy Crystal will
have a field day over the missing statues and ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've told Billy Crystal not to go anywhere near Bell, Calif.,
in the next couple of weeks,'' Davis said. ''It seems to be a
Bermuda Triangle for Oscar things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roadway Express trucking company, which shipped the statues
from Chicago, had no comment. Roadway has put up a $50,000 reward
to help recover the statues, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles and Bell police, along with FBI art-theft experts,
are investigating, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The 55 statues represented enough Oscars to give to all of the
winners on Academy Award night. But the exact number of statues
needed isn't known until the big night because some nominations go
to more than one person. For example, two people might win for
collaborating on a screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   The statues were packed in 10 boxes, all encased in shrink-wrap
on a pallet. At 8.5 pounds each, the 55 gold-plated statues would
have weighed about 470 pounds, meaning whoever stole them would
have needed a forklift and a truck, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturing cost of the statues was about $18,000, though
Davis said they have far greater intrinsic value. He said it would
be difficult for anyone to fence a stolen Oscar, but ''we don't
like having 55 Oscars floating out in collector circles.''
</P>
<P>
   The statues were not engraved, since the Academy does not know
the winners until the envelopes are opened awards night.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes were unmarked and Davis said he suspects whoever took
them did not know the cartons contained Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Roadway apparently did not have the statues under guard, Davis
said. The new statues will be shipped with tight security by plane
and will remain under guard until Oscar night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Siegel, who heads R.S. Owens, said the company will have
to work overtime to make new statues in time. ''We're doing a
month's worth in a week,'' Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the missing ballots and statues, the Academy has dealt
with reports that The Wall Street Journal was polling Oscar voters
to get a jump on the winners and a Web site that claimed to have a
short list of potential nominees the day before the nominations
were announced last month. The Web site's claim turned out to be
false.
</P>
<P>
   All the odd publicity may boost ratings for the Oscar telecast,
which slipped 18 percent last year. It was the second-lowest rated
Oscar telecast since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''Think of the fun Billy Crystal can have with this,'' said
Thomas O'Neil, who is writing a book about movie awards. ''Will he
be joking about Houdini vanishing acts?''
</P>
<P>
   Davis joked that if the ratings do go up, the Academy might
''possibly contrive to have a shipment stolen next year.''

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes U.S. Sanctions Move  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- The Iranian government said Friday that it
welcomes the Clinton administration's decision to lift a ban on
Iranian luxury goods like carpets, nuts and caviar.
</P>
<P>
   But while praising the move, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid
Reza Asefi did not indicate whether Iran would actually begin
exporting the items to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iran thinks it is positive and welcomes it,'' Asefi said on
Iranian television. ''And within the framework of Iranian laws, the
United States can export grain and medicine to Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not elaborate, but other Iranians also welcomed the news.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Saeed Laylaz, a commentator for several
reformist newspapers, said President Mohammad Khatami's reform
program begun two years ago is now bearing fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think breaking the ice of Tehran-Washington ties, like the
trend of reforms in Iran, is irreversible and is moving forward,''
Laylaz said.
</P>
<P>
   The moves were announced by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright at the American-Iranian Council in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, who became president in 1997, has encouraged increased
people-to-people contact with the United States, but has stopped
short of calling for talks.
</P>
<P>
   The United States severed relations with Iran after radical
followers of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini seized the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and took Americans hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our government should react positively but cautiously to this
decision. They should not become too excited about it just yet,''
Ahmad Ali Eradati, a retired civil servant, said in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. move signals a shift in Washington's policies and comes
after last month's legislative elections in Iran, in which
reformists took the majority of seats for the first time since the
1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Laylaz called Washington's move ''practical and positive,'' and
said Iran now must reciprocate. Allowing the imports, he added,
also will help the Iranian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Iran depends mainly on oil for income. An oil price slump in
1998 stripped Iran of billions of dollars in revenues. A nation of
62 million, half of whom are under the age of 25, Iranians are
struggling with more than 20 percent unemployment and high
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 11 months, revenues from exports of carpets,
pistachio nuts and caviar reached nearly $1 billion. Adding the
United States to the list of importers should help that figure rise
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very good prospect for us. There is great demand in
the United States for our carpets and I hope the Iranian government
responds positively to this gesture,'' said Farhad, a carpet
exporter, who spoke on condition he is not identified further.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Tribune, L.A. Times win Headliner honors  </HEADLINE>
With BC-NJ--Headliner Awards-List, 2-Takes
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The Chicago Tribune and ABC News have
captured top honors in the 66th annual National Headliner Awards, a
national journalism competition sponsored by The Press Club of
Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Announced Friday, the awards will be presented at a May 6
banquet at Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune won first place for public service and Best of Show
in the print division for its examinations of prosecutorial
misconduct and flaws in the death penalty system in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Ken Armstrong, Maurice Possley and Steve Mills, the
''Trial and Error'' series showed how prosecutors cheat and hide
evidence but are rarely punished for it. ''The Failure of the Death
Penalty in Illinois'' stories showed how bad lawyers, faulty
evidence and forced confessions have undermined the administration
of capital punishment in that state.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was powerful journalism,'' the Headliner judges wrote.
''The impact was profound. The governor of Illinois placed a
moratorium on all executions and lawmakers around the country are
now taking a close, hard look at the death penalty issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC News, and its Peter Jennings and Tom Yellin, won best
documentary and Best of Show in television for ''The Century,'' a
12-hour series examining the most extraordinary events of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   ''The judges recognize the enormous task undertaken to review
the century, bringing perspective and remembrances as we enter a
new millennium. Thank you, ABC News,'' the judges wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Times photographer David Bohrer won top honors in
that division for his ''unforgettable'' image of police officers
leading children away from the site of a shooting at the North
Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   KCBS radio in San Francisco was the top winner in radio, taking
first place in investigative reporting and Best of Show for ''MUNI
Workers Comp,'' a four-part series exposing abuses in the San
Francisco transit agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press won first place for coverage of a major
news event or topic by a news service or syndicate for its stories
on the alleged massacre of South Korean civilians by U.S. soldiers
at the village of No Gun Ri in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Other AP first-place winners were Helen O'Neill, for feature
writing; J. Pat Carter for spot news photography; Eric Draper for
feature photography and the AP staff for informational or
illustrative graphics.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,600 entries were received for the annual
competition.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Police Monitor Pilgrims  </HEADLINE>
By BASSEM MROUE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINA, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Officers scrutinized security screens
Friday for any sign of accidents, illnesses or the first shoves of
a stampede as 2.1 million hajj pilgrims wound down the annual
Muslim pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the hundreds of cameras placed along the pilgrimage
route were trained Friday on Mina, where pilgrims symbolically
stoned the devil. The city was the site of a stampede two years ago
that killed 180 people.
</P>
<P>
   Other cameras scanned pilgrims praying in Mecca's Grand Mosque.
</P>
<P>
   A bridge near the Jamarat -- the three pillars representing the
devil -- was packed Friday with tens of thousands of pilgrims. A
helicopter flew overhead and policemen urged people to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of ambulances were parked nearby, but by day's end all
had gone smoothly. The scene will continue Saturday and Sunday,
when the last of the pilgrims complete the ritual.
</P>
<P>
   This year's hajj has been one of the most trouble-free in years:
There have been no large-scale tragedies, although six women were
crushed to death at the Grand Mosque last week and five people have
died in traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hajj this year is considered better than the past ones,''
said Brig. Abdulaziz M. bin Saeed, commander of the Public Security
in the holy areas. ''Mecca is totally under control and we have two
new camera networks in the Jamarat area.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, fire tore through a sprawling, overcrowded tent city at
Mina, trapping and killing more than 340 pilgrims and injuring
1,500. In 1994, a stampede killed 270 pilgrims. The most deadly
hajj-related tragedy was a 1990 stampede in which 1,426 pilgrims
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dozens of cameras at Mount Arafat and Muzdalifah,
bin Saeed said there are 53 cameras in Mina and 650 in Mecca's
Grand Mosque. There have been fewer accidents this year, he said,
and more pickpockets have been arrested. Figures were not
available.
</P>
<P>
   In case something does go wrong, officers can guide policemen
and pilgrims via dozens of loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel so good, the Saudis are organizing everything and its
going normal,'' Mohammed Aref Khan a 42-year-old Pakistani said
after throwing stones at the pillars and leaving the area.
</P>
<P>
   Friday also marked the beginning of the three-day Ayam
al-Tashreek or ''days of drying meat,'' which follows Eid al-Adha,
the feast of sacrifice holiday celebrated throughout the Muslim
world with the slaughtering of sheep, cows and camels.
</P>
<P>
   And Friday was a good day for barbers, whose open-air shops were
packed with pilgrims paying $2.75 a piece for haircuts or to shave
their entire heads at the end of the hajj. Islam's founder, the
Prophet Mohammed, shaved his head after making the pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   The hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and is required at
least once in the lifetime of every Muslim who is financially and
physically able to perform it.
</P>
<P>
   After the devil-stoning ritual, which began on Thursday,
pilgrims head to nearby Mecca, where they circle the Kaaba, the
cubic stone in the center of the Grand Mosque, Islam's holiest
site.

<HEADLINE> Ramseys Launch Controlled Book Tour  </HEADLINE>
By SANDY SHORE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- John and Patsy Ramsey began a tightly controlled
media campaign Friday to launch their new book, which promotes the
theory that an intruder broke into their home and killed their
daughter three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of embarking on a nationwide tour to discuss ''The Death
of Innocence,'' the couple agreed to six interviews with local and
national media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf Zettersten of Thomas-Nelson Publishers, which published the
book, said the Ramseys let him decide which interviews to grant.
They were not accompanied by attorneys and they answered every
question, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book outlines events and evidence made public
previously.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys cite seven pieces of evidence they say point to an
intruder as JonBenet's killer, including an unidentified palm print
on the door to the room where her body was found; unidentified DNA
under the girl's fingernails; and an unmatched boot print found
near her body.
</P>
<P>
   They also refer to a theory by retired Colorado Springs Police
Detective Lou Smit that a stun gun was used on the 6-year-old
beauty queen.
</P>
<P>
   Smit was a prosecution consultant for 18 months before resigning
in 1998, contending the Ramseys were innocent. Since then, he has
worked with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys also identify several people in the book they
believe could be suspects, but police say all of them have been
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ''This book is a statement by people who have not been excluded
from the investigation,'' District Attorney Alex Hunter said Friday
through a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Mark Beckner estimated police spent half their time
looking at suspects outside the family.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have some questions we are trying to answer. We've
outlined what needs to be done and we're staying on course,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet was found beaten and strangled in the family's Boulder
home on Dec. 26, 1996. A grand jury disbanded in October after
investigating the case for 13 months. No charges were filed. Police
have said the Ramseys are under an ''umbrella of suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys wrote instead that they are under a ''parasol of
persecution,'' criticizing police as inexperienced officers who
worked on hunches instead of evidence and leaked information to the
news media.
</P>
<P>
   ''We understood that the police had to look at us, but we feared
they were looking only at us,'' John Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   The book includes a 1{-page chronicle of dates when the Ramseys
cooperated with police, a claim disputed by the police chief.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question we had trouble getting interviews,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys took turns writing sections of the book, describing
their grief, their frustration, their dreams of JonBenet.
</P>
<P>
   John Ramsey also explains the date of death on JonBenet's grave
-- Dec. 25, 1996: ''I selected December 25 because I didn't want the
world to ever forget what it did to our daughter on the day of joy
and peace, Christmas Day.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gov. Bill Owens said the Ramseys are trying to
manipulate the public into believing they are victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''What bothers me is they wouldn't talk when it mattered and now
you're not going to be able to pick up a publication or turn on the
TV without seeing them talking,'' he said. ''I just find it strange
behavior for them to try to become the victims.''

<HEADLINE> INS Allows Somalian To Seek Asylum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Immigration officials granted conditional parole to
an 18-year-old Somali man who is seeking political asylum after
claiming his life would be in danger from rival clans if he
returned home.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Kare Abshir Jama was released from Krome Detention Center
in Miami late Thursday after unidentified sponsors willing to
support him stepped forward, INS spokesman Rodney Germain said. He
would not identify the sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Jama arrived in the United States by himself Dec. 23, saying he
had no known living relatives left in Somalia. He had been in INS
custody since his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The INS initially blocked Jama's attempt to apply for legal
status through an INS program for abused or abandoned juveniles and
a federal judge said he lacked jurisdiction to hear the teen's
case.
</P>
<P>
   After the judge's ruling, an INS dentist examined Jama and
concluded from his teeth that he was an adult subject to INS adult
rules. Jama was then transferred from a juvenile center where he
had been staying to Krome, an INS detention center for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Jama's lawyer, Cheryl Little, commended the parole but cautioned
that her client still has to go through the difficult political
asylum application process.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll do our best,'' she said. ''At least we have some good
news now.''
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit, Jama said that when civil war broke out in
1990, he left Somalia with his father for a Kenyan refugee camp
before settling in Ethiopia. The teen wrote that in 1996, he saw
his father killed by bandits.
</P>
<P>
   Jama said he is from the minority Madiban clan and that he could
be killed by members of rival Somali clans if he returns to his
homeland.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal John O'Connor too sick to attend St. Patrick's Day Mass,parade  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS OLERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For 15 years every March 17, Cardinal John
O'Connor reigned on the cathedral steps, blessing children and
greeting thousands of St. Patrick's Day parade marchers. The ailing
leader of 2.4 million Catholics was forced to stay home on Friday,
disappointing his flock.
</P>
<P>
   Five thousand worshippers packed St. Patrick's Cathedral for the
pre-parade Mass, which is also attended by many New York and Irish
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''His eminence (O'Connor) joins his prayers with yours and with
the intercession of St. Patrick prays for your good health and
happiness,'' said Bishop Patrick Sheridan, pinch-hitting for the
cardinal, who has been ailing since undergoing surgery in September
for a brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We pray may God continue to bless him,'' Sheridan said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Zwilling, the cardinal's spokesman, said he was in his
residence adjoining the cathedral, and had not been in his
archdiocese office since March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big disappointment for him not being able to be here,''
Zwilling added.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, 80, has missed public Mass for the last several weeks,
including Ash Wednesday Mass and services. He has suffered partial
hearing loss and difficulty reading as a result of his illness.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're praying for him,'' said Ann Coyle of Bronxville, N.Y.,
attending the parade with two friends from Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think he'd be here, as much as I wanted him to be
here,'' added Coyle, a retired magazine business manager.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Mary Martin of the Franciscan Sisters of the Atonement
shivered on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral, as a freezing
rain and light snow fell. She made a 45-mile train trip from
upstate Putnam County to attend the cardinal's Mass, and was
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I miss the cardinal. That's why I came down here,'' she said.
''He's done everything for New York. The parade's not the same
without him.''
</P>
<P>
   On every St. Patrick's Day for the last 15 years, the cardinal
has stood on the steps of the cathedral for hours waving and
personally greeting marchers -- thousands of police officers, city
workers, commissioners, politicians and visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who attended the Mass Friday, said he
had greeted the cardinal in 15 previous St. Patrick's Day parades.
</P>
<P>
   ''I missed him at the Mass, and I missed him in front of St.
Patrick's. I'm very hopeful that he's going to make a full,
complete recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass, Gov. George Pataki said, ''We were all saddened
by the empty chair on the altar. We just pray for his health.''

<HEADLINE> Faeroes Negotiate With Denmark  </HEADLINE>
By JAN M. OLSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Denmark toughened its stance toward
the Faeroe Islands on Friday, saying the 18 rocky North Atlantic
islands would have to give up Danish subsidies within four years if
they wanted independence.
</P>
<P>
   The islands' nationalistic government and offshore oil prospects
have awakened old Faeroese dreams of political and economic
independence from Denmark, which provides them with $130 million
each year.
</P>
<P>
   Faeroese Prime Minister Anfinn Kallsberg and Hoegni Hoydal,
Faeroese minister for Home Rule affairs, presented Danish officials
with a plan to grant the islands independence but keep Denmark's
Queen Margrethe as their head of state and continue to link their
local currency to the Danish krone.
</P>
<P>
   They also want a 15-to-20 year transitional period, during which
Denmark would continue its subsidies, which account for one-third
of the territory's budget.
</P>
<P>
   But Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said Denmark
would only give the islands three to four years before cutting off
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not opposed to them becoming a sovereign state,'' Nyrup
Rasmussen said at a news conference, after four tense hours of
talks. ''But total independence leads to a complete halt of the
economical support.''
</P>
<P>
   Both groups said talks would continue, but offered no details.
</P>
<P>
   Independence is an emotional issue for many of the 45,000
islanders, who retain their old Faeroese language and flag and
generally refer to the islands as a nation. The people have
substantial autonomy, except in foreign affairs, military concerns,
courts and police.
</P>
<P>
   To secede from Denmark, the islanders would have to vote in a
referendum later this year. Independence would also require that
Denmark change its constitution -- a lengthy process that would
involve separate votes in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time the Faeroes, which have been Danish
territory for more than 600 years, have sought independence.
Earlier attempts in 1906 and 1946 failed when islanders rejected
the plans in referendums.
</P>
<P>
   The archipelago's economy relies heavily on fish sales and
exports, which make up more than 95 percent of its gross domestic
product. But Faeroe officials are pinning their future economic
hopes on oil. The government plans to launch the first licensing
round for offshore oil exploration in Faeroese waters, although it
has yet to set a date.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Squatters Ordered Off Farms  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- A judge on Friday ordered a group of
squatters, including black veterans of Zimbabwe's war for
independence, to end their illegal occupation of white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   The squatters, who have occupied more than 500 farms for the
past month, must leave within 24 hours, High Court Judge Paddington
Garwe ruled. He instructed police to help remove the squatters and
to ignore any counter-orders from President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   The squatters are led by veterans armed with spears, axes,
knives and guns. The judge's order to remove them goes against
statements from Mugabe and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mugabe said the squatters were protesting land
ownership by whites in the colonial era and that they could remain
on private properties until the government gave them their own
plots. Earlier, Police Chief Augustine Chihuri said police were
powerless to enforce private ownership laws in this case because
the occupations are political.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition groups have accused Mugabe of promising free land and
allowing the veterans to seize land in an effort to shore up his
collapsing support before elections in April.
</P>
<P>
   In February, 55 percent of voters here rejected a revised
constitution backed by Mugabe that would have empowered him to
seize white-owned land without paying compensation. The rejection
was Mugabe's biggest political defeat since he led the nation, then
known as Rhodesia, to independence in a seven-year bush war.
</P>
<P>
   Alleged government infringements of Zimbabwe's bill of rights
have long strained relations between Mugabe, 76, and the nation's
independent judiciary. Garwe's order was expected to again set the
two on a collision course.
</P>
<P>
   The judge issued his order in a closed hearing with lawyers
representing the veterans and a union of about 4,000 white farmers.
He instructed the police chief to deploy enough men to evict all
squatters who remain on private land, identify all the squatters
and properly investigate offenses committed on occupied farms.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans, who fought in the war that led to independence in
1980, blocked entry to the High Court building and chanted
revolutionary songs Friday as Garwe prepared his order.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours earlier, veterans assaulted a CNN television crew
that was filming them on a white farm northwest of Harare. Husband
and wife crew Bob and Amy Coen were treated and released for minor
injuries.

<HEADLINE> Paterson closes school for a second Islamic holiday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PATERSON, N.J. (AP) -- The closure of Paterson's public schools
for an Islamic feast day on Friday marks the second Islamic holiday
for such a closing in the state's third-largest school district.
</P>
<P>
   No other district in New Jersey closes for Islamic holidays,
said Mike Yaple, spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Students were off from school Friday for the first time for Eid
al-Adha, a festival marking the end of a Muslim's required journey
to Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years, the schools have closed on Eid
al-Fitr, which marks the end of the Islamic month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims within the Paterson district welcomed the latest
closure. Eid al-Adha is celebrated with a feast.
</P>
<P>
   ''Newark doesn't have it. Jersey City doesn't have it. They are
far behind,'' Lal Pathan, director of the American Muslim Council
of New Jersey, told The Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims comprise 21,000 of the more than 150,000 people in
Paterson, and account for about 3,700 school-aged children, Pathan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eid al-Adha is a three-day festival that starts on the 10th day
of the Muslim month of Thul-hijjah, which begins with the sighting
of the new moon. This marks the end of the hajj, the journey to
Mecca that a Muslim is required to make once in a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   However, starting dates of Eid al-Adha varies, according to
Islamic clerics and mosque officials who either rely on the moon's
sighting in Saudi Arabia or in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big problem for us right now,'' said Yaser El Menshawy,
chairman of the Council of Mosques of New Jersey, an organization
of mosques and Islamic groups. ''Within one town, you'll have
mosques celebrating it Thursday and some Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Muslims in Paterson at Masjid An-Nur Islamic Center
and the Islamic Center of Passaic County began celebrations on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the day, people visit one another and there's a lot
of going to each other's homes and eating there,'' said Imam Hamzah
Abdus-Salaam of the Masjid An-Nur Islamic Center.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, there are 45 recognized religious school
holidays, Yaple said.
</P>
<P>
   ''School boards can add religious holidays to its own
districts,'' Yaple said. ''But there's a fine line between church
and state. For instance, you can't close a school for religious
reasons, but you can close it for pragmatic reasons because
students can't be there.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuador OK For Banana Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Ecuador has received the go-ahead from the World
Trade Organization to impose $201.6 million in annual sanctions
against the European Union in their long-running banana dispute,
diplomatic sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The amount was specified by WTO arbitrators. The South American
nation had requested permission to impose sanctions to the value of
$450 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador, the world's largest producer of bananas, pushed last
year to impose the sanctions following a WTO ruling that the EU
banana import policy discriminates against Latin American
producers.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is already imposing sanctions of $191.2
million per year against the European Union over the same issue.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador has said its retaliation would consist of suspending
agreements on ''intellectual property,'' which require it to
respect copyrights and to pay for the right to broadcast music and
films.
</P>
<P>
   It sees this as a way for the developing country to take action
against the much richer EU without damaging its own economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Ecuador sanctions would apply to 13 of the 15 EU members.
Denmark and the Netherlands, which have consistently urged the EU
to agree to U.S. demands in the banana fight, would be exempted.
</P>
<P>
   The European rules were declared unfair by the WTO because they
favored bananas from former colonies in Africa and the Caribbean at
the expense of Latin American producers and their U.S.
distributors.

<HEADLINE> National Cathedral Gets $15M Bequest  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington National Cathedral on Friday
received a bequest of about $15 million, the largest in its 92-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   It was willed by Katherine Thomas, who came from Emlenton, Pa.,
and lived in suburban Rockville, Md. Born Katherine Gregory, she
died in 1994 at age 96.
</P>
<P>
   She left another $7.5 million to St. Albans School, which like
the cathedral belongs to the Protestant Episcopal Cathedral
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' bequests came from the sale of Windy Knoll, a dairy farm
in Rockville which her family bought during the depression of the
1930s and lived in afterwards. It was valued at $43 million when
she died.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was also a benefactor of Treatment and Learning Centers,
a nonprofit corporation, which named its school for children with
learning disabilities for her. The centers help children throughout
the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   Another bequest to the cathedral, $2.5 million from Paul Mellon,
will go into a special endowment fund, with the stipulation that
only the proceeds from the principal will be available to the
cathedral. Like his father, former Treasury Secretary Andrew
Mellon, Paul Mellon was also a longtime benefactor of the National
Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' bequest was not restricted.
</P>
<P>
   ''These gifts will provide additional support for our liturgical
and programmatic life, as well as help to ensure the ongoing
preservation of this house of worship for our nation,'' the Very
Rev. Nathan D. Baxter, dean of the cathedral, said in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Rixon of the cathedral staff said the money would be
especially helpful for bringing conferences and guest clergy to
Washington and for musical programs. It also can be used for
maintenance of the cathedral -- the world's sixth largest and a
leading Washington tourist site. It receives about a million
worshippers and visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Cathedral Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, the cathedral's
official name, is the seat of Bishop Ronald Haines, who heads the
Episcopal diocese of Washington.

<HEADLINE> Other Airlines Match Northwest Hike  </HEADLINE>
By KARREN MILLS, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Major U.S. carriers on Friday matched fare
increases launched by Northwest Airlines, boosting prices of a
round-trip domestic ticket by about $40 for business travelers and
$20 for leisure travelers who book ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest announced its higher fares Thursday, and by late
evening American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines
and United Airlines had boosted their fares.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways, Trans World Airlines and America West joined the
pack Friday morning, making it likely that the increase would hold
up. Carriers generally only rescind fare hikes if other major
airlines do not follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The round of increases came after Northwest refused to go along
with two recent attempts by Continental, its U.S. alliance partner,
to institute a fare increase that hit leisure travelers harder than
Northwest's increase.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest also added another perk for leisure travelers Friday,
reducing the prices of its lowest fares in certain markets, said
Bob Harrell of Harrell Associates, a New York travel consulting
firm that specializes in airline pricing trends.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the most part, those fares were not raised in their first
announcement,'' Harrell said. ''It is not unprecedented that they
raise fares at the high end and middle end, but lowest booking
levels get adjusted to market prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Trans World Airlines and US Airways also had sales in effect for
tickets purchased by midnight Friday, and Sun Country Airlines
extended to March 24 its $99 one-way fares for domestic leisure
bookings to 22 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell and George Wozniak, president of Hobbit Travel in
Minneapolis, agreed that the air-fare seesaw isn't likely to end.
Airlines tend to have fare sales about every six weeks, Harrell
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's this Pavlovian response (among consumers) that I'll
just wait until the next fare sale when I know what I'm going to
do. The airlines have to respond to the consumer,'' Harrell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody is going to start another fare war before Easter,''
Wozniak predicted. ''I'd wait until the end of April before buying
my tickets for summer travel.''
</P>
<P>
   The newest round of fare increases comes on top of a $20
round-trip fuel surcharge instituted earlier this year as airlines
continue to struggle with jet fuel prices that have soared in the
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Northwest did not specifically link its new increase to
fuel prices, fuel is Northwest's second-largest expense, after
salaries. Northwest spokesman Jon Austin said jet fuel is 20 to 30
cents a gallon higher than a year ago, and each penny of increase
costs the airline $20 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   As fuel costs doubled over the past 14 months, the airlines
imposed six fare hikes for leisure travelers and raised business
fares three times in 1999, said Tom Parsons, an airline industry
observer for Bestfares.com, an online discount travel service.
</P>
<P>
   That amounted to an increase of 14.5 percent to 17.5 percent for
leisure fares in 1999, Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new fare hike is largely to compensate for higher
fuel costs, Parsons said passengers shouldn't expect the airlines
to drop fares when fuel costs drop back down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guarantee you, when fuel is down, they're not going to make
any adjustment to those fares,'' Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest's fare increases also included varying hikes in
unpublished senior, military and Internet fares. Northwest also
raised its fees for excess luggage, transporting pets, replacing
lost tickets and other services by $5 to $25.

<HEADLINE> Arrest in Germany School Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSENHEIM, Germany (AP) -- The father of a 16-year-old student
who allegedly shot the headmaster of his boarding school was
arrested Friday on weapons charges after police found three illegal
weapons among the 46 guns in the family's home.
</P>
<P>
   The student apparently had a key to get to the guns, which
included 43 rifles, two machine guns and a military assault rifle.
Private citizens are not allowed to own the latter two types of
weapons in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth-grader allegedly returned to the Castle Brannenburg
school in the Bavarian town of Brannenburg on Thursday after having
been suspended the day before, shot the headmaster in a stairwell
and then turned the handgun on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they believe the boy was seeking revenge for the
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   His father, a 43-year-old businessman whose hobby was shooting,
had a license to own guns that did not cover the machine guns or
assault rifle. Neither the father's name, nor those of the
headmaster or student, were released.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at separate hospitals treating the 57-year-old
headmaster and student said Friday they both remained in critical
and life-threatening condition.
</P>
<P>
   The student had been expelled Wednesday from the boarding school
near the Austrian border because of his ''rebellious behavior'' and
sent home.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, he came back to the school with two
large-caliber guns and 100 rounds of ammunition, police said. When
he met the headmaster in a stairwell, he shot him in the neck, then
fired several shots at his own head.
</P>
<P>
   The headmaster, who had also taught the boy's computer science
class, had received the results of a drug tests earlier that day,
which police said showed the student had been using marijuana. He
was to have been expelled from the school he had attended for 2{
years.
</P>
<P>
   The other 94 students, who range in age from 12 to 18 and come
from across Germany to study at the coed school, were returned home
after the shooting and the school building remained closed Friday.

<HEADLINE> Koehler: IMF Should Focus on Crises  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Germany's Horst Koehler, poised to take the
helm of the International Monetary Fund, said Friday the
organization must emphasize preventing future financial crises by
monitoring countries' economies more closely.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler also said he was ready for discussions with
congressional and other critics who say the IMF has become too
expensive, powerful and secretive and want to scale down its
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The 182-nation, Washington-based organization has become one of
the world's most important financial institutions, bailing out
economies in the late 1990s as economic turmoil swept the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, 57, the head of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, said he expected the IMF's 24 executive directors
to formally select him as president next week after the withdrawal
of Japanese and American candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sense that there is broad support emerging from shareholders
but a decision still has to be made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An overwhelming majority of the IMF's members have signaled they
will back Koehler as the first German to head the agency since it
was established after World War II. But he will take office
weakened after a bruising five-month struggle to select a successor
to Frenchman Michel Camdessus, who stepped down as head of the IMF
in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union endorsed his candidacy Monday and his
accession became a foregone conclusion when the Clinton
administration endorsed him hours later after rejecting Germany's
first candidate as unqualified. Under an unwritten agreement, a
European has traditionally headed the IMF and an American has
headed the World Bank, its sister institution.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a red security badge marked ''visitor,'' Koehler held
his first news conference at IMF headquarters and said he felt ''it
is now more important for me to listen carefully before making any
specific statements on the role of the fund, listen to IMF
shareholders, to its staff but also to outside experts.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in the future, he said, the IMF should ''focus even
more on crisis prevention and we should make the best use of the
strength of this institution'' by providing countries with good
advice on sound economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if recent evidence of Russian attempts to mislead the IMF
over central bank activities indicated the IMF needed to change its
approach, Koehler said ''what happened in Russia ... reveals the
need to be more careful'' in future lending.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler said he was ''open to discussion and dialogue with the
U.S. congress about reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would hold similar talks with nongovernmental
organizations such as development and environmental groups because
''there is an obligation to explain'' IMF policies. Some of these
groups have threatened to disrupt the meetings next month of the
IMF and the World Bank. Koehler said he did not know if he would be
in office in time for these meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler agreed the selection process to choose a new IMF leader
''was not the best and should be reviewed and improved.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he looked forward to working closely with Stanley
Fischer, the American who filled in as acting director after
Camdessus left. He said he expected Fischer, who played a leading
role in resolving recent financial crises, to remain at IMF as No.
2 for some time.

<HEADLINE> 'Civil Unions' May Be Disappointing  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- With Vermont moving ever closer to
something resembling gay marriage, same-sex couples who might be
thinking about visiting the state so that they can enter into
''civil unions'' were warned Friday that they are likely to be
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there is no clear answer as to whether the new
status would be recognized by any other states.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they want to come here and stay here, they can'' take
advantage of the civil union law, House Judiciary Committee
chairman Thomas Little said. ''If people want to fly in for the
weekend and get a civil union license and fly home, it's unlikely
they're going to have their home state give it any legal
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a bill adopted by the House on Thursday and sent to the
Senate, gay couples would be granted all the rights and
responsibilities available under state law to married couples. Gay
couples who enter into civil unions and later decide to break up
would have to go through divorce-like proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a legal structure parallel to marriage, but it's not
gay marriage,'' said Rep. William Lippert, the only openly gay
member of the Legislature and a key architect of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it can be a model for other states for how to grant
rights to gay and lesbian couples without having to step into the
emotionally charged arena of gay marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee voted unanimously Friday to
pursue the same course as the House.
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairman Richard Sears said the vote was an important
statement to his own constituents and to opponents of gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that it tells them that whatever we're working on will
be a domestic partnership bill, but marriage won't happen in the
state of Vermont,'' Sears said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, same-sex couples would qualify for more than 300
rights and benefits that flow from marriage under Vermont law,
including inheritance, property transfers, medical decisions,
insurance and taxes. Couples could file a joint state income tax
return, for example.
</P>
<P>
   However, they would not be recognized as couples under federal
law, meaning they would not be receive the rights available to
married couples with respect to immigration rights, Social Security
and federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   There are no comparable civil union laws on the books anywhere
else. So, unless they are residents of Vermont, no couples should
assume that they could vacation in Vermont and go home with a civil
union license that would be recognized under the laws of another
state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gay and lesbian couples in other parts of the country should
not misunderstand that this is Vermont having gay marriage,''
Lippert said.
</P>
<P>
   Although national gay rights groups cheered the advance in the
cause of gay rights represented by the Vermont House vote, they
were disappointed the state did not legalize marriage for same-sex
couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the first time that the relationships have been
recognized at this level,'' said David Smith of the Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's largest gay rights group. ''However, it's
important to understand it's a separate system and you're creating
a separate set of laws for gay people, which is inherently
unequal.''

<HEADLINE> Markets Likely To Remain Volatile  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that blue-chip stocks have burst out of a
months-long slump, Wall Street analysts are wondering whether the
market's surge is the sign of a turnaround or just another volatile
swing in a volatile year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, the best-known barometer of the U.S. stock market, rose
a record 499.19 points Thursday, adding to a 320-point gain in the
previous session. With those two sessions, the blue-chip index
wiped out more than 40 percent of its losses over the last two
months. It also finished a week of the biggest point gain in
history and the steepest weekly percentage rise in almost 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Activity was choppy today as some traders sold shares to cash in
on the remarkable runup. Volume was slightly behind Thursday's
record-shattering pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow gryated in a relatively narrow range through much of the
day and closed down 35.37 at 10,595.23. Even with the slip Friday,
the rise of 666.41 points for the week was the greatest weekly gain
ever, surpassing the 586.68 points that had been the record since
the week ended July 2, 1999. The 6.71 percent rise in the Dow this
week was the most since a 7.85 percent of the week ended Aug. 2,
1984.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index gained 80.74 at 4,798.13.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq broke out of a three-day slump Thursday to finish up
134.77 points.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's gains were breathtaking, to be sure. But will the
newfound strength stick?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too soon to tell whether this is anything more than a
short-term head fake,'' said David G. Sowerby, vice president at
Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The market's gyrations this week have come amid extraordinarily
high volume. On Thursday, a record 1.48 billion shares changed
hands on the New York Stock Exchange as of the 4 p.m. EST closing
bell, surpassing the previous high of 1.35 billion set on Dec. 17,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, where volume typically exceeds that of the NYSE,
2.04 billion shares were traded. That made for a busy day, but fell
short of the record of 2.23 billion set March 1.
</P>
<P>
   With so many shares changing hands, it's become increasingly
common for market indexes to pitch violently throughout a session.
Years ago, a day in which the Dow moved up or down more than 100
points was considered remarkable. In the 52 trading days since Jan.
1, the Dow has subjected traders to 27 doses of triple-digit moves
either up or down.
</P>
<P>
   ''At these levels, you're going to get shakeouts from time to
time,'' Sowerby said.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just volatility that makes analysts question the
staying power of the market's gains. Most market watchers believe
the blue-chip stocks of the Dow were due for a rally, and the
technology stocks that dominate the Nasdaq were ready for a bout of
profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   But the factors that drove the U.S. stock market into its
bipolar state are still firmly in place.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among them: worries that burgeoning signs of inflation
will force the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates,
threatening corporate profits. Thursday's rally surprised some on
Wall Street because it came on a day when the government delivered
mixed news on inflation. There was more of the same today.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported this morning that consumer prices
shot up 0.5 percent in February, the biggest jump in 10 months, and
a slightly steeper gain than analysts had forecast. But excluding
the volatile energy and food categories, the ''core'' rate of
inflation rose a mild 0.2 percent in February, right on target with
many analysts expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ''As-expected data will encourage the markets,'' said Scott J.
Brown, chief economist at Raymond James &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The government reported Thursday that its Producer Price Index
showed that wholesale prices surged 1 percent in February, the
largest gain in nearly 10 years, as gasoline, home heating oil and
other energy costs rose. But the core rate was up a more moderate
0.3 percent, also in line with forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts consider the CPI a more significant barometer of
inflation, because it measures price pressures at the consumer
level.
</P>
<P>
   The PPI and the CPI were critical to investor sentiment this
week because they were the last major economic reports to be
released before the Fed's meeting next Tuesday. In a continuing
effort to keep inflation at bay, the Fed has raised rates four
times since last June, and many investors are expecting a fifth
rate hike on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rising rates have been largely responsible for the market's
split, and an increase on Tuesday could send blue-chip and
technology stocks back on their divergent paths, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, the old economy companies will be affected first if
rates go up,'' said Vernon Winters, chief investment officer at
Mellon Private Asset Management. ''They have borrowing costs that
technology companies just don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks, which get most of their funding from venture
capitalists and from selling their coveted shares, have risen on
the belief that they will best survive higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   But many Wall Street analysts aren't yet convinced of that
argument. Winters, for one, believes technology stocks remain
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had a moonshot in technology stocks,'' said Winters.
''Now they're feeling some of the gravitational pull of the
Earth.''

<HEADLINE> US Braces for China-Taiwan Tensions  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Taiwanese voters prepared to elect a new
president, Clinton administration officials and congressional
leaders braced for a possible escalation of tensions if the
pro-independence candidate wins Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   While senior officials generally remained guarded in their
comments, one said a victory by presidential hopeful Chen Shui-bian
of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party would ''yield
potentially the greatest reaction from China.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment referred to China's warnings that any move by Taiwan
toward independence could lead to military action against the
island.
</P>
<P>
   The official declined to talk about U.S. military preparations.
On Capitol Hill, a spokesman for Senate Foreign Relations Committee
chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., noted that Helms asked the Pentagon
two weeks ago to provide him with a personal briefing on defense
plans for Taiwan if China were to do ''something stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, on the eve of the last Taiwanese elections, the
United States dispatched two aircraft carriers and other warships
to the region after China lobbed nuclear-capable missiles near the
island's two major ports.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, seeking to avoid pre-election controversy,
reiterated that the United States wants to see a resumption of the
cross-strait dialogue as soon as the election is over.
</P>
<P>
   Don Oberdorfer, of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies, expressed concern Friday that Chinese
belligerency could sour post-election prospects for a productive
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this foundation of bad blood, the dialogue may not get
very far,'' he said. ''If the Chinese feel Taiwan is slipping away,
then we could be in for very serious problems.'' He called the
Chinese threats ''disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has steered away from expressing a preference
for any of the Taiwanese candidates in what is believed to be a
close race for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't support or oppose any candidate,'' State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said. ''We support the democratic process
on Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Thiessen, a spokesman for Helms, said, ''We'll be
comfortable with the any of the three candidates. It's a decision
entirely and exclusively for the people of Taiwan to make. They
don't need our advice and they don't need Beijing's.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most outspoken pro-Taiwan voice on Capitol Hill has
been that House Republican Whip Tom DeLay, of Texas. In a speech
Thursday, DeLay said the Clinton administration has embraced ''a
level of appeasement'' toward China more craven than Neville
Chamberlain's attempts to placate Germany on the eve of World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, DeLay spokesman Jonathan Baron said DeLay is hopeful
that ''communist China will set a new course and react to the
results of this weekend's elections with restraint and good sense.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has said he believes the U.S. cannot under any
circumstances allow the People's Republic of China to impose a
communist future on Taiwan,'' Baron said.

<HEADLINE> Asian, Europe Stock Markets Rally  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street settled down with a mixed
performance today, with the Dow industrials unable to build on its
stunning gains, as some traders took profits from two days of
remarkable advances. Even with a setback in the Dow, the stock
market's best-known indicator had its best weekly point rise ever
and its biggest percentage gain in nearly 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which surged nearly 500 points
Thursday in a record-shattering rebound, fell 35.37 to close at
10,595.23 in heavy trading. It spent much of the day swinging back
and forth in a relatively narrow range.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, the Dow's 666.41 point gain was the biggest point
rise in history, and the 6.71 percent increase was the largest
percentage gain since the week ended Aug. 3, 1984, when it rose
7.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index, which was lifted
by the Dow on Thursday, was up an additional 80.74 at 4,798.13.
</P>
<P>
   Asian markets, which closed today's sessions before Wall Street
returned to work, rallied on the heels of Thursday's stunning
gains. Stocks closed also closed higher in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Dow soared 499.19 points, or 4.9 percent, on
top of Wednesday's 320-point rally. Thursday's unprecedented rise
easily beat the record for the sharpest one-day Dow point rise ever
-- 380.53 -- which was set Sept. 8, 1998. But it was nowhere near the
record 15.34 percent jump on March 15, 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unsettling factors is that today is a ''triple
witching'' day on Wall Street, a quarterly event that occurs when
contracts on stock options, index options, and index futures all
expire. Trading to settle such contracts often contributes to
market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. markets also have been jittery about prospects that the
strong American economy and tight labor market would rekindle
inflation, prompting the Federal Reserve to be even more aggressive
in raising interest rates. The Fed has raised rates four times
since June and meets again Tuesday, when it is expected to increase
rates a fifth time.
</P>
<P>
   A Labor Department report today provided mixed signals but
seemed to calm traders' fears that central bankers would raise
rates by more than a quarter point. Yields on 30-year Treasury
bonds today were flirting with a drop below 6 percent for the first
time in almost six months.
</P>
<P>
   The government reported a 0.5 percent increase in consumer
prices in February, the biggest jump in 10 months. But after
excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the ''core''
rate of inflation rose a mild 0.2 percent in February, which was in
line with many analysts expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The government reported Thursday that its Producer Price Index
showed that wholesale prices surged 1 percent in February, the
largest gain in nearly 10 years. But the core rate was up a more
moderate 0.3 percent, also in line with forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Major European markets also rose modestly. In London, Europe's
largest market, the FTSE-100 closed up by less than 1 point,
Germany's benchmark DAX index was up 1.7 percent and the Paris CAC
40 index was 0.7 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's top three stock markets rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the world's second-largest economy, stocks roared
ahead at the opening and remained high all day, due in part to the
Dow's surge Thursday. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average closed up 1.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Traders also were encouraged by a new government report giving
an upward assessment of the Japanese economy, which recently
slipped back into a recession. The report said parts of the
economy, including corporate capital investment and personal
consumption, were on a sounder footing.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 4.4.
</P>
<P>
   Traders credited Wall Street's record showing, but also said
they were relieved by the fact that China's military hasn't
attacked Taiwan in advance a national election Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Taiwan and mainland China have been governed separately
since splitting amid civil war 51 years ago, China views Taiwan as
a renegade province and is demanding quick progress in
reunification talks by the two governments. The outcome of
Saturday's vote for the three top candidates could conceivably
spark a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index opened sharply higher
today and ended the day with a gain of 3.6 percent from Wednesday.
The market was closed Thursday for a holiday.

<HEADLINE> Ad comparing morning subway commute to livestock herding will bepermitted  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An advertisement comparing the morning subway
commute to the herding of livestock can be posted in subway cars
after all, a transportation agency said Friday after it was sued on
First Amendment grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a victory for both free speech and better subways,''
said Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the NYPIRG Straphangers
Campaign, after the Metropolitan Transportation Authority agreed to
allow the ad to run.
</P>
<P>
   The group had joined another mass transit advocate, the Regional
Plan Association, in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, the MTA said, ''After nearly two weeks of
extensive discussion and review, the MTA has withdrawn its
objections to posting on the MTA transit system an advertisement
from the straphangers campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Schwartz, an MTA spokeswoman, said there would be no
further comment. She declined to say whether the MTA now liked the
poster.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's not go down that road,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed after the MTA refused to approve an
advertising campaign that featured a poster of a crowded subway car
and the headline: ''With livestock it's called animal cruelty. With
people it's called a morning commute.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the headline is copy suggesting that subway overcrowding
can be reduced and wait times shortened by buying more subway cars
and running trains more often. It also called for a full-length
Second Avenue train line and improved signaling.
</P>
<P>
   The commute ad was one of two offered by the non-profit groups
to convince commuters to join a mass-transit advocacy coalition
urging political leaders to fund MTA improvements such as a new
subway line.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is meant to coincide with consideration by the New
York Legislature of a five-year, $16.5 billion capital plan which
the groups have criticized as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   A second ad shows a state-of-the-art subway station and train
with the headline: ''It's modern. It's reliable. Unfortunately,
it's not in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Other copy with the ad says, ''New York may be the world's
greatest city. But our mass transit system isn't keeping up with
the technology used in cities like Washington, San Francisco and
Paris. We deserve better.''
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, the MTA initially rejected both
advertisements on Feb. 29, but later decided to allow the second
ad.
</P>
<P>
   In a rejection letter regarding the crowded subway ad, the MTA
told the groups that use of the headline ''is directly adverse to
the commercial interests of the MTA, in that it is highly critical
of the MTA's performance and its current mass transit services.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This advertisement would discourage the use of the MTA's mass
transit services as well as negatively impact the morale of MTA
workers,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA changed its position after the New York Civil Liberties
Union filed the lawsuit on behalf of the mass transit advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was censorship pure and simple,'' NYCLU Executive
Director Norman Siegel said after the MTA agreed to let the ad run.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Deports Red Army Members  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH PANOSSIAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Four members of the Japanese Red Army, a
shadowy ultra-leftist group accused of terrorist attacks in the
1970s, were reportedly on their way back to Japan Friday after
Lebanon denied them asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon had refused to extradite the three men and a woman to
Japan, so it deported them on a flight to Jordan. But once in
Amman, they were handed over to Japanese diplomats who took them on
a private plane back to Japan, diplomats in Amman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Amman-based diplomats spoke on condition they not be
identified further, and Japanese Embassy officials in Amman refused
to confirm or deny the information.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's official Petra news agency confirmed that the kingdom
''refused to allow entry to the four elements of the Japanese Red
Army.'' The report said they ''went to another side,'' but it did
not specify where they went.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth Red Army member -- Kozo Okamoto, who participated in the
1972 killing of 24 people in Israel -- was granted asylum in Lebanon
due to health reasons, a government statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's events were the latest development in Japan's longtime
attempt to get Lebanon to extradite the Red Army members.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government wants the five to stand trial in Japan
on charges of staging bloody attacks around the world. But Lebanon
has cited the lack of an extradition treaty between the two
countries and said the Japanese government does not have evidence
confirming its accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Okamoto, 51, is the best known of the five: He was involved in
the 1972 attack on Israel's Ben Gurion airport that left 24 people
dead. He was freed by Israel in a 1985 prisoner swap with
Palestinian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese statement said Okamoto was granted asylum because
he is still suffering ''from physical and psychological injuries
that he sustained while in Israeli prisons.'' It said the committee
considering the asylum requests had found that Okamoto was the only
one of the five who actually participated in ''resistance
operations'' against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A prison official who would speak only on condition of anonymity
said Okamoto would remain at Roumyieh prison east of Beirut until a
place in Lebanon is found for him if he should choose to stay.
</P>
<P>
   The other Red Army members are Masao Adachi, 59; Kazuo Tohira,
46; Haruwo Wako, 50; and Mariko Yamamoto, 58. Last week, they and
Okamoto finished three-year prison terms for illegally entering
Lebanon, but they had remained in custody pending asylum decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Army members are considered heroes by many in Lebanon
and the Arab world for championing the Palestinian cause and
opposing Israel, which occupies a border zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lebanese capital, about 50 supporters of the Japanese
five protested outside Prime Minister Salim Hoss's Beirut residence
and clashed with riot police Friday night, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   At least four demonstrators were injured, and security forces
beat at least two journalists. They confiscated news photographers'
film of the clash.

<HEADLINE> Soybean, Corn Prices Soar  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fears that top U.S. farm crops will be hurt by drought this year
intensified Friday after new forecasts called for dry weather in
the Midwest through spring, sending soybean and corn futures
soaring on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets, gold sank to a seven-week low and cocoa fell.
</P>
<P>
   The latest drought fears emerged at the beginning of the week
when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned
that the central United States faces a serious drought threat
because of a critical lack of soil moisture, with no relief in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   It said Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana -- the top four
soybean-producing states and leaders in corn as well -- comprise the
driest area, prompting a strong runup in prices for the first half
of the week.
</P>
<P>
   When the National Weather Service reported after markets closed
Thursday that the outlook for the next 30 to 90 days is for
above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation, that
revived and accelerated the rally on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans, the leading U.S. crop, leaped to a 14-month high.
Corn, the No. 2 crop, reached a seven-month high.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government is beating the drought drum louder and
louder,'' said Tim Hannagan, head grains analyst for Alaron Trading
Corp. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   While there's still plenty of time for rains to replenish soil
moisture -- corn planting is still about four weeks away and soybean
planting is six weeks off -- corn prices surged 6 percent for the
week and soybean prices rose 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, soybeans for May delivery rose 12 cents to $5.37{ a
bushel; May corn rose 5{ cents to $2.40} a bushel; May wheat rose 6
cents to $2.72\ a bushel; May oats rose 1{ cent to $1.22 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increase, Hannagan said there's plenty of room for
prices to rise if a comparison with the last big drought year,
1988, is a reliable guideline. Mid-March prices that year were more
than $1 higher than they are now for soybeans and 40 to 50 cents
higher for corn, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure there's much more volatility to come,'' he said.
''We're going to have rain, and when you get a rain period coming
in you can expect some sharp breaks'' in the rally.
</P>
<P>
   But, ''it looks like we're still pretty cheap,'' the analyst
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gold prices fell again on the Comex division of the New York
Mercantile Exchange as traders positioned themselves ahead of the
last of five scheduled United Kingdom gold sales.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors believe the price will sink as a result of
Tuesday's auction by the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
   April gold settled down $2 at $285 per troy ounce.
</P>
<P>
   Cocoa reversed course from the seasonal rally that followed the
conclusion of big West African harvests, giving back all of
Thursday's big gains. Market-watchers called it a correction to an
overdone buying splurge the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   May cocoa fell $37 to $898 a ton on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP;
Cocoa Exchange.

<HEADLINE> World Mayors Plan Summit in Athens  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE CHAVRANSKI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Agreeing to work toward safety, social harmony and
respect for nature, more than 30 mayors from around the world
pledged Friday to make this week's inaugural summit a tradition and
planned a second gathering in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day Summit of World Mayors, which ended Friday,
illustrated ''a new model of cooperation -- modern, pragmatic and
adapted to the growing complexity of the world,'' Paris Mayor Jean
Tiberi said in a closing address.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting at the mayoral level provides a ''new breath in the
links of friendship among nations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quality of city life in the new millennium was the theme of this
week's summit, which brought together 33 mayors from five
continents to exchange views on running cities from Phnom Penh and
Johannesburg to Tunis and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   In a ''Declaration de Paris,'' the mayors agreed to work toward
safety, integration, social harmony and respect for history and
nature.

<HEADLINE> Bakery strike continues for second full day on Friday, reachesN.J.  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS GOSIER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- A strike that shut down Interstate
Bakeries Corp.'s New England operations continued for a second full
day on Friday and even reached down the East Coast to shut down one
of the company's bakeries in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   As about 1,400 Teamsters continued to stop the shipment of bread
and other baked goods, 400 members of a bakers' union stopped
working Thursday evening at the Drake's bakery in Wayne, N.J., said
Mark Dirkes, the company's senior vice president for marketing in
Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey workers returned to their jobs on Friday, but the
plant remained shut down because its drivers belonging to the
Teamsters union refused to distribute the product.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters blamed Interstate Bakeries for the strike, saying
the company refused to honor arbitration rulings on issues
including an unfair labor complaint. Company officials who contend
they were shut out of the arbitration process have asked a judge to
rule on whether the arbitration was valid.
</P>
<P>
   The pickets continued despite heavy snow Friday morning outside
the J.J. Nissen baking plant in Biddeford, site of the company's
only bakery serving its customers in New England.
</P>
<P>
   The transport drivers, sales representatives, shippers and
receivers left their jobs Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 Teamsters were based in Biddeford, while the rest
distributed the baked goods throughout New England, said Bill
Turkewitz, a representative of Teamsters local 340 in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The Biddeford bakery was shut down after about 500 bakery union
members refused to cross the Teamsters picket line. The plant makes
J.J. Nissen, Wonder Bread, Hostess and Drake's products.
</P>
<P>
   One of New England's largest supermarket chains stepped up its
orders from other suppliers to make up for the products that were
no longer coming from the Biddeford plant. The Hannaford Bros.
grocery chain still had plenty of bread supplies Friday,
spokeswoman Caren Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Customers should see no shortage unless they are looking for a
particular Nissen's product,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between the company and the union broke down
Thursday afternoon, and Dirkes said Friday that he was not aware of
any negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters held out the threat of expanding the strike to
thousands of other union drivers across the country. But Teamsters
officials responsible for the decision could not be reached Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Teamsters represent 130,000 drivers in its bakery
division, which includes Interstate Bakeries and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials maintained Friday that the company had plenty of
opportunity to participate in the arbitration hearings at the
center of the dispute and that the company is required to live by
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get to an arbitrator, those decision are final and
binding. We all know that,'' said Robert Piccone, a Teamsters
representative in South Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   One decision stemmed from a union complaint that the company was
placing all four its brands on the same trucks. Drivers are
supposed to carry only one brand at a time because each brand has a
different pay scales, the union says.
</P>
<P>
   Union workers also were upset because a fired driver was not
allowed to return to his job despite an arbitrator's ruling.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Jump in February  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A record rise in fuel oil prices along with a
steep increase in gasoline costs drove up consumer prices by 0.5
percent in February -- the biggest monthly gain since last April.
Economists said the news justifies a widely expected boost in
interest rates next week by the Federal Reserve to keep inflation
under control.
</P>
<P>
   The jolt in the Consumer Price Index, the most closely watched
inflation gauge, came from a huge 4.6 percent increase in energy
prices, the biggest jump in 10 months, the Labor Department said
Friday. It was a slightly worse showing on inflation than many
analysts were anticipating.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the volatile energy and food categories, prices were
mostly well-behaved. The ''core'' rate of inflation rose a mild 0.2
percent in February, the same-sized gain recorded in January and
was right on target with many analysts' expectations, something
that heartened some economists and investors.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones stock average pulled back from an
earlier surge and fell into negative territory as some investors
cashed in on Thursday's record-setting 499.19-point gain. The Dow
closed down 35.37 points to 10,595.23, but still ended the week
with a gain of 666.41 points, a 6.7 percent increase. The Nasdaq
finished the day higher.
</P>
<P>
   First Union's chief economist, David Orr, summed up Friday's
report as ''a tale of two CPI's: one awful, the other one tame.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a distinction that may be lost on average consumers, who
are paying higher prices at the gasoline pump to drive to work and
shelling out more to heat their homes, economists acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truckers and New England homeowners scoff at the
economists who say inflation is still well-contained despite the
spike in energy prices,'' Orr said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, however, shouldn't worry that the country is heading
down a path toward the high inflation seen in the 1970s, economists
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are absolutely not heading in that direction,'' said
Stephen Cecchetti, economics professor at Ohio State University.
''In the '70s, the increases in consumer prices were across the
board. They were everywhere. In today's and other recent (CPI)
reports, the increases in prices were not broad-based at all.
There's not much to worry about here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates four times since
June to slow the supercharged economy and keep inflation from
escalating. Many analysts expect the Fed will raise rates for a
fifth time Tuesday and said the CPI report justifies such a move.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Fed has to do something and it will next week,'' said
economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   The 0.5 percent rise in consumer prices last month, following a
modest 0.2 percent increase, was the biggest monthly gain since a
0.7 percent increase posted in April.
</P>
<P>
   A whopping 34.6 percent gain in fuel oil prices -- an all-time
monthly high -- propelled overall consumer prices higher last month.
So did a 6.3 percent rise in gasoline prices, the largest gain
since April. Natural gas prices rose by 1.7 percent, the biggest
increase since September, while electricity prices went up by 0.8
percent, the largest increase since July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Production limits by oil-producing nations and increased demand
because of the winter weather accounted for the rise in energy
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said she would ''watch the extent
to which higher energy prices are being passed on to consumers''
but said that outside of the energy sector, inflation was quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Higher energy bills took their toll on airfares, which rose 3.8
percent in February, the sharpest gain since October.
Transportation prices, also reflecting more expensive fuel costs,
rose 1.3 percent, the biggest increase since April.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil prices hit the $34-a-barrel mark on March 8, the
latest in a series of nine-year highs. In many places, gasoline
prices have edged close to $2 a gallon. But there's been rumblings
that the oil-producing nations will raise output, something that
would push prices down.
</P>
<P>
   Food prices, meanwhile, rose a sizable 0.4 percent, the largest
increase since October 1998, as rising prices for beef, pork and
fresh fruits more than offset falling prices for poultry and fresh
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the report, tobacco products, including cigarettes,
rose a sharp 2.1 percent, the largest increase since September,
reflecting companies bumping up cigarette prices to pay settlement
costs for tobacco lawsuits.

<HEADLINE> Crude Prices Drift Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Crude prices dipped below $31 a barrel as
sentiment toward lower oil prices continued to prevail on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. Other energy futures fell as well.
</P>
<P>
   Since hitting a high of $34.20 on March 7, crude prices have
drifted lower amid pledges of an increase in oil production by OPEC
and non-OPEC countries later this year.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Friday, President Clinton said he had talked with
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd about the need to stabilize oil prices at
levels that satisfy both producing and consuming nations. Saudi
Arabia already has said it favors increasing production.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody's struggling now to find a consensus,''
Clinton told reporters when asked about the high oil and gasoline
prices during a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
   West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery fell 18 cents
to $30.91 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   In other energy prices, April heating oil fell .31 cent to 71.72
cents a gallon, April unleaded gasoline fell .55 cent to 93.43
cents a gallon and April natural gas fell .66 cent to $2.785 per
1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, May Brent crude from the North Sea fell 22 cents to
$26.56 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Irish Leaders Hold Talks  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GALVIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed a parade of
Northern Ireland's quarreling leaders to the White House, hoping to
use the cheer of St. Patrick's Day to nudge them toward compromise.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he urged them to avert a return to violence,
politicians on both sides of Northern Ireland's sectarian divide
remained skeptical Friday about chances for a quick end to the
stalemate over the Irish Republican Army's weapons and Britain's
decision to shutter the coalition government established under the
1998 Good Friday Accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good news about Ireland is that even though the
institutions have been taken down over the difference between the
parties on decommissioning, no-one wants to go back to the way it
was or give up the peace process,'' Clinton said. ''We need to
restore a process that will eventually lead to all the requirements
of the Good Friday Accord being observed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton welcomed Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who started
the St. Patrick's Day ceremonies at the White House by presenting
Clinton with a crystal bowl brimming with shamrocks.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern said that he believes all parties remain committed to
peace, but ''It is not easy things that we're asking anybody to
resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks easy on paper,'' he said. ''But the fact is that
there are huge, deeply held fears and mistrust. Confidence has to
be restored.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also met with David Trimble, leader of the main
Protestant party the Ulster Unionists; Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams;
John Hume, leader of the moderate Roman Catholic Social Democratic
and Labor Party, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize with Trimble; and
Seamus Mallon, Hume's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials cautioned against expecting breakthroughs.
Arriving at the White House, Trimble said his party has not ruled
out rejoining the government, but he demanded concrete evidence the
IRA will begin decommissioning weapons, or disarming.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did it last time on the basis of an expectation which had
been encouraged by Sinn Fein,'' he said. ''If we do it again, then
it has to be against a background of absolute certainty that this
time they will decommission within an appreciable period of time of
the formation of the executive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein's Adams blamed the British government for the impasse,
arguing it exceeded its authority in suspending a government that
voters in Ireland and Northern Ireland had approved.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one, and the British government especially, should be
vetoing what the people have voted for,'' Adams told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Adams conceded that the ''guns issue'' had to be dealt with, but
he countered Trimble's suggestion that the arms problem be solved
before the government can go back to work. He appealed to
Irish-Americans not to lose hope in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ''Keep your eyes on the prize,'' he said. ''The only way the
reactionaries, the only way the 'No' men ... will win is if the
rest of us give up. And Sinn Fein isn't giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern said resolving the situation before Easter will require
''a determination by all the parties to implement the Good Friday
agreements in full, to stop talking about reviews or amendments,
just concentrate about what's already on paper.''
</P>
<P>
   The British government's decision on Feb. 11 to close down the
coalition government in Northern Ireland came after Trimble
threatened to withdraw his party because the IRA had not begun
disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Sinn Fein, the political ally of the mainly Catholic
IRA, noted that May 22 is the deadline for disarmament of both the
IRA and outlawed pro-British groups under the Good Friday agreement
overseen by former Sen. George Mitchell of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has not definitively said whether it will disarm. Sinn
Fein, eager to regain its two posts within the suspended 12-member
administration, says the IRA eventually may disarm, but only if
unionists allow the four-party coalition to work without
obstruction.

<HEADLINE> Tandy Changing Name to RadioShack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Tandy Corp. is changing its name to
RadioShack Corp. in what the company called a sign of confidence in
the future of its electronics stores.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason we want to change the name is simple: Tandy is
RadioShack and RadioShack is Tandy,'' said Leonard Roberts, the
Fort Worth-based retail company's chairman, president and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Tandy owns or franchises about 7,100 RadioShack stores in the
United States, selling electronics accessories, phones, computers
and other gadgets. The company has closed, sold or cut back other
chains, including Incredible Universe, Computer City and McDuff, to
focus on RadioShack.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Friday that it recently filed the proposed name
change with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The change
would require approval by stockholders, who are scheduled to vote
on the issue May 18 in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Tandy has gone through several major changes since its creation
as a leather goods business in 1919. The leather craft and hobby
stores were eventually spun off into a separate company. In 1963,
Tandy bought RadioShack, which then had nine stores in New England.
Other chains were bought and sold.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Tandy bought Amerilink, a cable-installation company,
and announced a $100 million investment from Microsoft Corp., which
will create kiosks within RadioShack stores.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said the company would preserve the legacy of founder
Charles Tandy by keeping his name on the headquarters building.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Tandy rose $3.12{ to $46.50 in trading at 4:30 p.m. on
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Strip in Netherlands  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The opening session of an
international conference on global water problems was disrupted
Friday when protesters ripped off their clothes to protest a
Spanish dam project.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian Water Minister Mahmoud Abu Zeid looked on in silence as
a man and woman disrobed in front of the speakers' podium to reveal
the name of the controversial dam painted on their backs and
buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   Other activists did not strip, but scaled the walls of the
conference hall and hung from the ceiling to protest what they
claimed was the conference's intention to sidestep crucial
environmental issues like the Itoiz dam project in northern Spain's
Navarra province.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch Crown Prince Willem Alexander stepped to the podium and
asked for restraint from the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The protest overshadowed the start of the five-day,
U.N.-sponsored Second World Water Forum, which will discuss new
ways to ease water shortages and improve environmental and sanitary
conditions worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   After the morning interruption -- police had to use a bolt-cutter
to remove one protester who chained herself to a chair -- the 3,500
delegates from over 150 countries moved on to working sessions and
talks on the conference's main declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The conference will study ways to bring clean drinking water to
the one-sixth of the world's population that lacks it. The
organizers of the conference have called for $180 billion in annual
global spending on water problems, more than double the current
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   But not all participants agree that more money will be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a drastic change in our whole attitude towards
water,'' said Ismail Serageldin, chairman of the World Commission
on Water. He said alternative water sources need to be identified
before existing supplies dry up.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wildlife Fund criticized the conference's approach,
saying not enough attention was being paid to the danger that
tapping new water sources could endanger the natural habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Health and social development will also be main themes at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''Three million children die each year because of poor access to
sanitation,'' said Richard Jolly, head of an international group
for hygiene and sanitation, the Water Supply and Sanitation
Collaborative Council.
</P>
<P>
   Jolly called for help to communities and families, rather than
expensive, high-tech water projects.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers from some 150 countries will take part in the two-day
event at the end of the forum, in what is expected to be the
largest ever gathering of government ministers for water affairs.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Lash Out in Education Ads  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the first ad salvos of the general
election, George W. Bush is going after Al Gore on education and
Gore is hitting back at Bush for opening with a negative tone.
</P>
<P>
   Just days after the two clinched their parties' nominations,
Bush was out first with his spot, which is filled with smiling
children but a razor-sharp message: ''Clinton and Gore had eight
years, but they've failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, the vice president responded with an ad of his
own: ''On the issue of education, America deserves a real debate,
not more negative ads from George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither campaign is spending much money on their opening ad
buys, but they signal an early start to what is sure to be a
vigorous tit-for-tat over the airways.
</P>
<P>
   Each ad makes selective use of education statistics, which can
be sliced in a myriad ways to prove a point. The Bush ad highlights
the worst of the national statistics. The Gore ad finds the worst
numbers out of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is spending less than $100,000 to air its
60-second ad in six Illinois media markets, some of which reach
into neighboring battleground states of Missouri, Kentucky and
Iowa. Friday afternoon, the Gore campaign said it would air its
spot, also 60 seconds, in the same markets and would spend about
the same amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   With limited dollars remaining for the four months before the
party conventions, Gore had hoped to hold off for a while before
beginning TV advertising. But when Bush prepared to go on the air,
Gore advisers decided they had to respond immediately. They said
their ad might be up as early as Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   So while it's just nearing springtime on the calendar, the fall
campaign appears to be under way.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly eight months before Nov. 7, ''the general election has
begun,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the University of
Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communication, who studies
political ads.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are running in markets across Illinois, with the notable
exception of the expensive Chicago market. Illinois holds its
primary election on Tuesday, though the ads are clearly intended as
early groundwork for the fall. They will air in Champaign, Peoria,
Rockford, Quincy, Harrisburg and Davenport, Iowa, which is on the
Illinois border. Quincy also reaches into Iowa, and Harrisburg
reaches Kentucky and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're able to reach four key swing states for the fall
election,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore ad opens with what has become a familiar charge: that
the other side went negative first. It then proceeds to criticize
Bush's Texas record, much in the same way that the Bush ad
criticizes the national record.
</P>
<P>
   ''George W. Bush -- from South Carolina to New York he used dirty
politics to trash John McCain's record. Now he's running attack ads
against Al Gore,'' the Gore ad says.
</P>
<P>
   Education consistently ranks at the top of voter concerns,
particularly among women, whose votes could be decisive in the
fall. Since he wrapped up the nomination, Bush has been focusing
tightly on education, making it a daily theme. On Thursday, for
instance, he held an education forum at a school in Springfield,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll out Friday shows Bush and Gore neck and neck with
voters on the issue of education, though other polls show Gore with
an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's education plan would remove many of the federal
regulations that govern the spending of education money. To keep
the money that aids the poorest children, schools would have to
show they are making improvements. Otherwise, the federal
government would give the cash directly to parents, who could use
it to send their kids to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed a massive new federal investment -- $115
billion over the next ten years, to be paid for out of the
projected budget surplus -- to triple the number of charter schools,
provide universal access to kindergarten, modernize old schools and
construct new ones, recruit new teachers, and give raises to
high-performing instructors.
</P>
<P>
   In his ad, Bush charges that under the Clinton-Gore
administration, national reading scores ''stagnated.'' But it
doesn't mention that they had been dropping through the 1980s.
Staying the same in the 1990s was arguably an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   And Jamieson noted that Texas scores followed the national
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's attacking Gore in an area in which he didn't make an
improvement in Texas,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> New 'Exorcist' Test Released  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICIA M. LaHAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- More than 25 years after the horror movie
classic ''The Exorcist'' won Award and Golden Globe awards, a new
version of the film was released Friday in three college towns as a
preview to its national release later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Exorcist -- The Version You've Never Seen'' will terrify a
new generation of movie-goers here and in Austin, Texas and Ann
Arbor, Mich., with a full reel of material restored to director
William Friedkin's 1973 version.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw it once when I was young and I really liked it. It
scared the hell out of me,'' Isiah McPherson, 21, said while
waiting to buy tickets for himself and his girlfriend, Dana
Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the best-selling novel by William Peter Blatty, the
film graphically depicts the demonic possession of a 12-year-old
girl (Linda Blair) and the efforts by a priest (Max von Sydow) to
exorcise her demons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very scared,'' Stephens said. ''In fact, I've been trying
to get him to let me out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, Blatty said Friday that scaring movie-goers was
not his original intention.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I wrote the novel and also when I wrote the screenplay,
frightening people was not my primary intention. It was the
furthest thing from my mind,'' he told Atlanta radio station WSTR.
''I meant it as a supernatural detective story and a psychological
thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those waiting to see the movie at the Beechwood Stadium
11 theater Friday afternoon weren't even born when the film was
first released.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new scenes is an eerie depiction of the girl, Regan,
''spider walking'' down a flight of stairs upside down and chasing
two other characters.
</P>
<P>
   An elaborate scene that required a contortionist stuntwoman held
aloft by a deep-sea fishing pole was left out of the film
originally, Friedkin said, because he feared audiences would not
accept something so bizarre at the beginning of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the version that the author first saw and has always
wanted,'' Friedkin said recently. ''The restored new footage -- plus
one or two little surprises -- make the film more suspenseful, as
well as spiritually deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Blatty said he first saw the unedited version of the movie with
many of the scenes restored in this new release.
</P>
<P>
   ''It took my breath away,'' he said. ''I thought it was just
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Blatty said he and Friedkin have debated since the movie's
release whether some scenes cut for length should have been
restored.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months ago, after watching some of the outtakes, Friedken
finally admitted the lost scenes improved the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we left the building, on the Burbank lot, he laughed and
said 'Bill, after 26 years I am finally understanding what you were
trying to do with this movie,' '' Blatty said.
</P>
<P>
   The original film was a critical and a commercial success,
winning awards on at least two continents and becoming the second
biggest money-maker in American cinematic history, after the 1972
classic ''The Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Blatty won an Oscar for the screenplay and the film was awarded
a Golden Globe for best picture in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Real March Madness Is On Wall St.  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Forget about college basketball. The real March
Madness broke out this past week in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks, which had shot up to stratospheric levels in
recent months, were trampled. Blue-chip stocks, given up for dead
earlier this year, roared back to life.
</P>
<P>
   The shift was swift and fierce. Nonetheless, most analysts feel
it helped restore balance to a market that had lost all sense of
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rapidity and the violence of the move was stunning, but in
a bull market that's had such a long run, it's healthy,'' said
Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen
Securities in New York. ''For the time being, the unbridled move up
in the Nasdaq is over.''
</P>
<P>
   From Monday to Wednesday, the technology-dominated Nasdaq fell
466 points, or 9.2 percent below the record high of 5,048.62 set
March 10. For a short time on Thursday, the Nasdaq fell farther,
plunging into what Wall Street calls a ''correction'' -- a drop of
at least 10 percent that sometimes signals a turning point for the
worse.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time this year that the Nasdaq fell steeply.
The highly volatile index tumbled 404 points from Jan. 4 to 6. From
Jan. 26 to 28, it lost 280 points.
</P>
<P>
   But during both of those routs, technology stocks so thoroughly
ruled investor sentiment that the broader market collapsed, too,
unable to function without its brash, successful leaders.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, investors shoved the money they pulled from
technology stocks into old-fashioned blue-chips and other consumer
product and industrial stocks, a shift so strong that the Dow Jones
industrial average smashed through its record for a one-day point
gain, rising 499.19 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the move were large money managers who tried to
capitalize quickly on the shift in market momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ''Five years ago, there would have been four committee meetings
before moving money around like this,'' said Pradilla. ''Today, the
meetings occur on the fly and you just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the week, the Dow gained 666.41 points, or 6.7 percent, its
biggest weekly point gain ever, and its best percentage gain since
7.9 percent in August 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's newfound strength was enough to lift the entire market
higher -- including the now-vulnerable tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which lost 466 points from Monday to Wednesday,
gained back nearly half of the decline by Friday, leaving it only
250 points lower at week's end.
</P>
<P>
   The balance between the stocks of the old and new economies had
-- at least momentarily -- been restored.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market was acting a bit more rationally,'' said Ned Riley,
chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
''Investors realized that (blue chips) have fallen about as much as
they're likely to fall, and at this point, they're very good
bargains.''
</P>
<P>
   The market's volatility has increased this year because so many
investors have given up their old ''buy and hold'' philosophy in
favor of momentum-driven trading.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks caught fire because their success last year
attracted more and more money -- from institutional clients,
frenzied day traders, and ordinary folks who retooled their 401(k)
plans and mutual funds to focus on the market's top performers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that the Nasdaq's velocity was unsustainable,
prompting the stocks of many small tech companies -- such as
semiconductor component maker PMC Sierra -- to double in less than
three months.
</P>
<P>
   ''The valuations of many of those stocks had become ludicrous,''
said Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Nasdaq's turnaround began when the market's
composite index first closed above 5,000 on March 9. Computerized
''sell'' programs kicked in with the big new milestone, and selling
gathered steam as investors used the 5,000 mark as an excuse to
take profits.
</P>
<P>
   The last straw came on Tuesday, when President Clinton announced
an agreement with Great Britain to openly share genetic research.
While the true impact of the agreement isn't yet clear, fast-rising
biotechnology companies that plan to sell such data saw their share
prices sliced in half.
</P>
<P>
   That debacle inflicted wide-ranging damage on investor
psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of unproven companies on the Nasdaq, and they
can make investors' attitudes shift very quickly,'' Riley said.
''Their fortunes have not been tested through various market and
economic cycles.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, analysts expect technology stocks to resume their
leadership in the market. As companies begin reporting their
first-quarter earnings in mid-April, most market watchers expect
established technology companies to outperform their ''old
economy'' brethren while Internet companies that aren't profitable
will at least show rising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq stocks -- computers, networking, the Internet -- are
the ones that are really changing the world,'' Pradilla said. ''For
the most part, we still want to be in tech.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Down 35.37  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An across-the-board surge in technology stocks
couldn't prevent a modest selloff among large old-line companies
Friday as the Dow industrials faltered after two days of stunning
gains. Even with the mild setback, the Dow still had its biggest
weekly point gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   Market analysts said mild profit-taking Friday in the wake of
Thursday's record-setting 499.19-point gain sent Wall Street's
best-known indicator slipping late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average pulled back from an earlier
surge and fell 35.37 to 10,595.23.
</P>
<P>
   But the benchmark index still ended the week with a gain of
666.41 points, the biggest weekly runup ever for the Dow,
surpassing the previous record of 586.68 set the week ended July 2,
1999. The 6.71 percent rise for the week was the biggest since the
7.85 percent in the week ended Aug. 3, 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's bold advance this week, which included a 320-point
surge Wednesday, wiped out more than 40 percent of the average's
losses over the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw some profit-taking in some selective areas,
specifically the drug sector. But it wasn't a wholesale selloff,''
said Paul McEnroe, a trader at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, judging from the recent market volatility, it's
anybody's guess where we go from here,'' McEnroe added.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher Friday. The Nasdaq
composite index closed up 80.74 at 4,798.13. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 6.00 at 1,464.47.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were higher on both the Nasdaq and the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''The techs are rocking and rolling and the overall market is
acting very well given the recent runups. The Dow rose 800 points
in two days and it's still moving higher,'' said Alfred Goldman,
director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said the uniform gains among tech stocks was surprising
since today was a ''triple witching'' day on Wall Street, a
quarterly event that occurs when contracts on stock options, index
options, and index futures all expire. Trading to settle such
contracts often contributes to market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, advancers included Applied Materials, up 7 59/64
at 95 55/64, and Sun Microsystems, up 5] at 96[. On the NYSE,
Nortel Networks rose 8\ to 128, and America Online jumped 3 3/16 to
64 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Old-line stocks that make up the majority of the Dow Jones
average fell out of favor late Friday. They included drug companies
Merck, down 2\ at 62}, and Eli Lilly, down 3 5/16 at 61 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Large brokerage firms, meanwhile, shrugged off the volatility
and were up across the board. Charles Schwab rose 5 9/16 to 55
5/16.
</P>
<P>
   New inflationary pressure was also a consideration Friday.
Consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in February, the biggest jump in
10 months, led by a record increase in fuel oil prices and sharply
higher gasoline costs, the Labor Department reported. But excluding
the volatile energy and food categories, the ''core'' inflation
rate was a moderate 0.2 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   The figures appeared to cheer markets because they showed no
signs of a steep resurgence in inflation, something that would lead
the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates sharply. The Fed,
however, is widely expected to raise rates one-quarter point at a
meeting Tuesday, marking a fifth increase since June.
</P>
<P>
   In the inflation-sensitive market for government bonds, yields
on 30-year Treasury securities flirted with a dip below 6 percent
for the first time in nearly six months.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-7 margin on
the NYSE, where volume totaled 1.29 billion shares as of 4 p.m.
EST, down slightly from a record 1.48 billion in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.54 to 574.78.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.6 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 1.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
rose 0.01 percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 0.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush Lead Shrinking Among Men  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush has seen his huge lead among
male voters cut in half by Al Gore, largely on the strength of
increased confidence in Gore's skills with the economy, a
bipartisan poll suggests. The two are running close among women
voters -- a cause of concern for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a time when Al Gore was doing so poorly among men,
one wondered if women could make up for it,'' said Celinda Lake, a
Democratic pollster who conducted the Voter.com-Battleground Poll
with Republican Ed Goeas. ''Now he's only 12 points behind among
men.
</P>
<P>
   The poll released Friday showed Bush with a 48 percent to 44
percent edge over Gore in the presidential race, down from a
13-point Bush lead in the same poll in January.
</P>
<P>
   The margin did not change substantially when poll respondents
were presented with a choice that paired Arizona Sen. John McCain
with Bush and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley with Gore. But
the data indicated McCain's presence could make a big difference in
competitive congressional races, and Goeas suggested McCain could
be a very valuable campaigner for candidates in those districts.
</P>
<P>
   Both pollsters noted Gore has improved his standing with the
public in many areas in the past two months, while Bush has slipped
to make the race very close.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a Republican perspective, the fact that Bush is even or
leading is something of a surprise and we'll take it,'' said Goeas.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who has focused his campaign heavily on his
economic role in the Clinton administration, is getting more credit
for his abilities on that issue. The candidates now are rated about
evenly on their ability to ''keep America prosperous.'' And that
played a role in cutting the margin that Bush, the governor of
Texas, held as recently as January, the poll indicated.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed advantages for Republican Bush in voters'
concerns about the nation's moral climate. But a little anxiety
actually could help Gore, suggested Democrat Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ''When voters are a little jittery, they are less likely to jump
ship,'' she said. ''If things were to take a more negative turn,
then obviously that would be bad for the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore had a 22-point advantage over Bush among poll respondents
on the question of experience, while Bush led on the question of
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has an advantage among Hispanics, a group that generally
identifies more with the Democratic Party. And Democrats need to
establish their traditional advantage among women voters to fare
well in November, Lake said.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll showed Gore with 48 percent support compared with
43 percent for Bush among women, a bit better for Gore than in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very identifiable problem,'' Lake said of Gore's
failure to open a wider lead among a group that is usually
Democratic-leaning. ''It's moms who are values-oriented and give
Bush credit on education.
</P>
<P>
   ''George W. Bush runs some education ads that would make most
Democrats weep,'' she said, noting ads that call for ''education
for every child in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If women were as enthusiastic for Al Gore as men are for
George W. Bush, Al Gore would be ahead,'' Lake said. ''A clear
factor in the race is the gender gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush led among men, 52 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll indicated Bush and Gore are about even in the public
view on many issues and candidate qualities, and the 2000
presidential election is likely to be ''one of the most competitive
in history,'' said Goeas.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that 56 percent of American voters said they were
conservative. The poll did not offer the category of moderate,
forcing people to choose between various degrees of liberal or
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of surveyed Americans described Gore as at least
somewhat liberal and seven of 10 described Bush as at least
somewhat conservative, suggesting to Goeas that ''Gore has some
work to do to get in line with the right-of-center American
electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority of likely voters have a favorable view of Gore, 52
percent, and slightly more have a positive view of Bush, 58 percent
in the telephone poll of 1,000 likely voters taken Sunday and
Monday. The poll had an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   When likely voters were asked which one issue was the most
important for the president to deal with, one in five chose
restoring moral values. Bush usually fares well in the polls on
that issue. Other top issues were improving education,
strengthening Social Security and improving health care. Gore leads
on the issues of Social Security and health care, while the two
were closely matched on education.

presidential
contender Patrick Buchanan in an interview Friday with The
Associated Press:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''I'm out of the Republican Party for good.''
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Clinton White House, the Clinton-Gore
administration does not deserve to be reinstalled in power. But I
do not believe that the performance of the Republican establishment
in the last four years justifies their automatic claim to the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he's demonstrated the grasp of foreign policy or
international affairs that would justify putting the presidency of
the United States in his hands.''--On George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   ''The vice president has had eight years in the White House.
That's as high quality experience as you can get.''--On Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''The American electorate is more ready to roll the dice then it
has ever been in my lifetime. The allegiance to the two parties is
smaller than it's ever been. The willingness to take a look at a
third party is greater than it's ever been.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ''I got back the word that he sort of welcomed me into the party
but he'd prefer not to have a phone call.'' -- On Ross Perot's
reaction to Buchanan's offer to talk before the conservative

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lifts Some Iran Import Bans  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a dramatic shift, the Clinton
administration invited Iran on Friday to enter a ''new
relationship'' with the United States to stabilize the Persian Gulf
and reverse more than two decades of icy distance.
</P>
<P>
   Lifting a ban on U.S. imports of Iranian luxury goods, Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright said both the United States and Iran
had fought conflicts begun by Iraq's ''lawless regime'' and they
should work together to reduce tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iran lives in a dangerous neighborhood,'' Albright said in a
landmark speech. ''We welcome efforts to make it less dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tehran, Hamid Reza Asefi, an Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman, said of the speech and the lifting of a U.S. ban on
imports of caviar, rugs and some other luxury goods: ''Iran thinks
it is positive and welcomes it.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication that Iran was taking the Clinton
administration up on its proposal for formal talks. ''Dialogue must
take place devoid of sanctions,'' said Hadi Nejad Hosseinian,
Iran's ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iran will seriously consider the steps announced this morning,
and is ready to adopt proportional and adequate steps but is not
prepared for drastic change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not expecting any rapid reaction to it,'' Albright said
of the dramatic American overtures.
</P>
<P>
   But she told reporters enthusiastically that ''a new chapter in
our relationship'' was opening. ''Iran and the United States must
move together in a balanced way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iran is obviously a country of strategic importance,''
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative drew mixed reactions on Capitol Hill. Sens. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., and Dick Lugar, R-Ind.,
reacted favorably.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., called the move unprincipled.
''Principled foreign policy stands up to terrorism,'' Mack said in
a statement. And Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., called it
premature. He said Iran should compensate American victims of
Iranian terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., and 10 other House Democrats
wrote President Clinton condemning ''unilateral concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Rodman, a former White House and State Department
official, commented: ''I am not against a few gestures, but we
should continue to husband our leverage so long as significant
aspects of their policy are profoundly hostile to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert McFarlane, who headed the National Security Council in
1984, said the administration was moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem lies, however, in our dealing with a fragmented
government in Tehran in which the pragmatists may not be able to
deliver as a consequence of the clerics' dominant role,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League,
said it was premature to begin normalizing relations ''with a
nation that has sponsored international terrorism, developed
weapons of mass destruction, has shown continual hostility toward
the state of Israel and is about to try 13 innocent Jews on
trumped-up charges of espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, said, ''We have
not yet seen performance from the Iranian government, and the
United States has made other unilateral concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While the Iranian people have spoken, we have not seen any
change from the government on domestic or foreign policy, including
terrorism, the peace process and weapons of mass destruction,''
Hoenlein said in a telephone interview from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the planned trial next month of 13 Iranian Jews on
charges of espionage for the United States would be a ''barometer''
of U.S.-Iranian relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Surely, the time has come for America and Iran to enter a new
season in which mutual trust may grow,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Her speech and remarks later at a news conference contained a
string of deferential and near-apologetic statements.
</P>
<P>
   She said the United States has relations with a number of
countries less democratic than Iran, has no intention of
interfering in the country's domestic affairs and recognizes that
Islam is central to Iran's cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Albright said the shah's government, which was overthrown
by reformers who, in turn, were dislodged in an Islamic revolution,
was brutal to the Iranian people, and that the United States had
been ''regrettably shortsighted'' in its policy of tilting toward
Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither Iran, nor we, can forget the past,'' Albright said.
''It has scarred us both.''
</P>
<P>
   In that vein, Albright called the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran in 1979 disgraceful and traumatic to the Americans held
hostage for more than a year. She also criticized Iran as a
supporter of terrorism, an opponent of Mideast peacemaking and as
bent on acquiring weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Conciliatory statements by Iranian President Mohammed Khatami
and then the election last month to parliament of candidates
considered moderate by some American analysts set the stage for the
administration's overtures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Albright said, ''We need to see some effect on their
external policy. We haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the Clinton administration would look for ways to
increase contacts between American and Iranian scholars, artists,
professionals, athletes and nongovernment groups. ''We believe this
will serve to deepen bonds of mutual understanding and trust,'' she
said in her speech to the 3-year-old American-Iranian Council, a
private group.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Albright offered U.S. cooperation in settling claims the
two countries have against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have concluded the time is ripe to broaden our
perspective,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Phone, Web Competition Rules Upheld  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An appeals court Friday largely preserved new
federal rules meant to open local phone markets to competition.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, however, found some parts of the Federal
Communications Commission regulations implemented last spring are
too broad. The rules generally were intended to make it easier for
upstart local phone companies to install equipment at facilities
belonging to the major players in the local markets -- the Baby
Bells and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   The rules were also meant to help newer companies that want to
provide both traditional local phone service as well as high-speed
Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by and
large backed the FCC's rules. But the court found parts impart
overly broad authority to the newer entrants.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, the court challenged the commission's interpretation of
a statute that says major phone companies had to make room for
whatever equipment rival companies believe is necessary to get
access to the local phone network from the facility.
</P>
<P>
   In its rulemaking, the FCC explained this to mean any equipment
that is ''used or useful'' for connection to the phone network --
even if that equipment might have other completely unrelated
functions.
</P>
<P>
   GTE Corp. and other companies that had challenged the
commission's rules argued that this could open the door for
competitors to put in equipment beyond what is required, trampling
on the rights of the big carriers. The court said this view had
merit and sent that part of the rule back to the FCC for
clarification.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney associated with the petitioners hailed this part of
the court's decision as a victory, saying that it will prevent the
big carriers from losing control over their buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The petitioners had also protested the commission's decision
last spring to allow competing companies the option of being able
to rent a tiny amount of space at the facility of major local phone
companies, rather than being forced to rent a 10-foot by 10-foot
fenced enclosure, which can be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   On that point, the court said the petitioner's arguments went
too far and that the commission has the authority to order such
space-sharing. But the three judge panel did say that the FCC had
not demonstrated why the competing company -- rather than the major
local phone provider that owns the facility -- should determine
where to put their equipment. The court sent these portions back to
the FCC for further clarification.
</P>
<P>
   The court also upheld the commission's ruling for how the large
carriers would recover their costs.
</P>
<P>
   FCC officials said they viewed the decision as a win and that
the challenged portions of the rules were only peripheral.

<HEADLINE> R.J. Reynolds Switches Ad Agency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. has replaced the
advertising agency that created the ''No Bull'' campaign for its
Winston brand, but says the new agency will continue to develop the
same theme.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, the nation's second biggest cigarette maker, said
Friday it has hired Doe-Anderson Advertising and Public Relations
of Louisville as the lead agency for Winston.
</P>
<P>
   The agency replaces Long Haymes Carr Advertising of
Winston-Salem, N.C., named to create Winston advertising in 1996.
In 1997 it developed the ''No Bull'' approach that called attention
to the absence of non-tobacco additives in the cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   With help from the ad campaign, Winston's market share rose in
1998 for the first time in 25 years, the company said. Winston's
share slipped in 1999 to 4.92 percent of the market from 5.2
percent in 1998, Reynolds officials estimated. It ranks behind
Doral and Camel as Reynold's third best-selling brand.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Leary, vice president of marketing at the Winston-Salem
based Reynolds, said the company was ''constantly evaluating ways
to strengthen the marketing communications for its brands'' and
felt the new agency would help in ''further evolving'' the ad
campaign in ''clear, engaging and contemporary ways,''
</P>
<P>
   Long Haymes Carr will continue handling media planning and
buying for all of Reynolds tobacco brands.
</P>
<P>
   Doe-Anderson had not handled tobacco advertising assignments in
recent years until taking on some special project work for Reynolds
late last year, agency chief executive Dave Wilkins said. Its
clients include National City Bank, based in Cleveland, and the
Valvoline Instant Oil Change brand.
</P>
<P>
   Jim White, chief creative officer at Doe-Anderson since October,
had been creative director at Long Haymes Carr when the ''No Bull''
campaign for Winston was introduced in August 1997, Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds spokesman David Howard said White's association with
Doe-Anderson was only one of many factors that went into the
decision to award the account to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Doe-Anderson nor Reynolds disclosed the size of the
Winston account.

<HEADLINE> Sunday Waco Re-Enactment Scheduled  </HEADLINE>
By SHERRI CHUNN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The government's credibility will be put to the
test this weekend when critical portions of the 1993 assault at
Waco are re-enacted at a military base with tanks, a helicopter and
camouflaged gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The re-creation could challenge the government's unequivocal
assertion that federal agents fired no shots at the Branch Davidian
compound in the final hours of the 51-day siege.
</P>
<P>
   The test is pivotal for the Davidian plaintiffs who are suing
the government for wrongful death in a case headed for trial in
mid-May. Much of their case is built on their claim that government
operatives fired into the compound as flames raced through the
wooden building, cutting off the sect members' only avenue of
escape.
</P>
<P>
   Sect leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died during the
April 19, 1993, inferno that consumed the compound several hours
into an FBI tear-gas operation designed to flush them from their
holdout. Some of the dead were killed by the blaze, others by
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour demonstration, scheduled for Sunday if the weather
is favorable, is designed to answer a question central to the
investigations being conducted by Congress and a special counsel:
What caused the dozens of rapid-fire bursts of light that appear on
FBI infrared surveillance footage taken during the siege's final
moments?
</P>
<P>
   Infrared experts hired by the plaintiffs, as well as one
retained by a House committee, contend the flashes represent
gunfire from government positions and a smattering of return fire
from the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials are adamant that the Davidians died by their own
hands, and have suggested that the flashes came from sunlight
glinting off pools of water, metal or other debris on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   During the test, aircraft with infrared cameras will fly over
Fort Hood -- 50 miles southwest of Waco -- as gunmen in combat garb
fire weapons similar to those carried by federal agents and
Davidians alike.
</P>
<P>
   Infrared experts will compare the resulting footage with the
FBI's 1993 tape to determine whether the muzzle flashes during the
test have thermal signatures similar to those of the bursts of
light recorded nearly seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian lawyer Michael Caddell predicted results from the test
could be known the next day. ''I think we've got an obligation to
release the results, good, bad or indifferent as soon as
possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The re-creation, which will be closed to the media and public,
was ordered by the federal judge presiding over the Davidian case.
It was requested by special counsel John Danforth, the former
Republican senator from Missouri who was appointed last fall by
Attorney General Janet Reno to re-investigate the resurgent Waco
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day, the American people need to feel
satisified that this question has been thoroughly investigated, and
that it has been resolved one way or the other,'' Caddell said.
''And I think at the end of this test, we'll know.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mike Bradford, one of the government's lawyers in
the case, said: ''When you look at those (1993) tapes, you don't
see people. You just see a glint. Our position has been if there
were people out there moving around, you'd see them.''
</P>
<P>
   While the government suggests there can be no shots fired
without shooters, the plaintiffs argue that the agents weren't
detected because the temperature of their clothing was similar to
that of the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's office wouldn't comment on the cost of the
demonstration and who will pay it. Congressional sources didn't
know either.
</P>
<P>
   Before the test begins, tanks will disturb the soil and crush
glass, aluminum and other debris to help reproduce conditions from
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Two aircraft equipped with infrared cameras will circle over the
test site: the FBI Night Stalker plane used at Waco, with its
since-upgraded infrared camera; and a Lynx helicopter on loan from
the British navy. The helicopter's infrared camera is much like the
one used in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   While the aircraft hover, Danforth's investigators and military
personnel will fire an array of weaponry, including rifles, pistols
and grenade launchers with both non-burning tear gas rounds and
military-issue, pyrotechnic gas grenades.
</P>
<P>
   It was the FBI's admission last August that potentially
incendiary tear gas canisters were fired at the Davidians' compound
-- Reno's orders to the contrary -- that revived the controversy and
led to Danforth's appointment and the congressional inquiries. The
government has insisted the canisters were fired well before the
blaze broke out.

<HEADLINE> E-ZPass on New Jersey Turnpike system off until August  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey Turnpike commuters hoping
electronic E-ZPass technology would get them past long lines at
toll plazas on hot summer days will have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic sensor system, scheduled to be in place May 22,
will not be ready until Aug. 1 at the earliest, according to
turnpike authority director Edward Gross. And even the postponed
date remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Gross said there have been construction delays in setting up
specific toll booths with the sensor equipment and surveillance
cameras needed for the E-ZPass system to work properly. He said the
prime contractor, Adesta Transportation, formerly MFS Technologies,
reported it would have about 84 of the 157 toll lanes ready by the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Gross said turnpike officials decided this was not adequate and
could create traffic hazards and confusion. He said Adesta believes
it could have 140 E-ZPass lanes ready to go on Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a slippage in the construction schedule, and last
week we took a very, very good look at the progress of
construction,'' Gross said. ''Our conclusion was that we could not
make May 22 and deliver a quality system that would work
efficiently and safely.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Just the testing alone for this system is going to be at least
30 days,'' Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   The silver lining to the delay is that a scheduled toll increase
of 20 percent on the turnpike will not begin until E-ZPass is up
and running.
</P>
<P>
   Gross said it is important to make sure the electronic toll
systems work perfectly before the E-ZPass system makes its debut
because if there are problems, commuters will lose confidence in
E-ZPass and will not sign up for it.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of damage to trust would be difficult to recover. ''It
would represent a tremendous setback in the advancement of
electronic toll collection,'' Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   E-ZPass tolls are in place at all of the crossings into New
York, on the Atlantic City Expressway and at northern toll plazas
on the Garden State Parkway from Union to Bergen counties.
</P>
<P>
   But Gross said the turnpike is a different matter because
E-ZPass cannot be implemented at a single toll point.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're opening all at one time, 28 plazas, 157 lanes, and they
all have to work and integrate with each other, and work
perfectly,'' Gross said.

'American Buffalo' Is Uneven   
An AP Entertainment Review, 
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The beat has been bobbled in the Atlantic
Theater Company's revival of David Mamet's ''American Buffalo,'' a
play whose profane banter demands a certain staccato rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   The play's sense of urgency as well as some of its humor has
been softened a bit, too, in this uneven production, which has
opened off-Broadway as part of the theater's season-long salute to
Mamet.
</P>
<P>
   We are in a world of petty thieves, bumbling con men who can't
plan -- much less carry out -- the heist of a rare coin collection.
The setting is a Chicago junkshop presided over by Don, a
garrulous, goodhearted fellow who takes a fatherly interest in
Bobby, his dimwitted young assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Mamet is a master of macho conversation, and ''American
Buffalo'' is filled with the bluster and bullying of male bonding.
He has created one of his most completely realized characters in
Teach, the third member of this gang who couldn't shoot straight.
</P>
<P>
   Teach is a loudmouth, a nervous boor whose obscene rantings
overcompensate for his insecurities. As played by the hyper William
H. Macy, Teach dominates the evening. A veteran Mamet performer,
Macy knows his way around the playwright's style of writing, mining
its comic moments as well as its dramatic fireworks for all their
theatricality.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Baker Hall, who portrays Don, is less secure. Hall has a
great craggy face, perfect for the older man who has seen a lot in
life. Yet Hall's delivery often seems tentative, unable to sustain
the tension that the play demands. As Bobby, Mark Webber captures
the lad's dumb, almost vacant wonder.
</P>
<P>
   To really cook, ''American Buffalo'' has to have all three of
its players in top form, batting that ribald dialogue back and
forth with the ease of tennis pros.
</P>
<P>
   That's because not much happens in the course of the evening, as
this inept trio plan the heist. They argue a lot, and there's more
than a hint of violence, but even with that tension, director Neil
Pepe hasn't been able to inject much vitality into the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Kevin Rigdon's junkshop setting fills the wide stage
with the leftover debris of modern life, providing an authenticity
that the production itself rarely achieves.

<HEADLINE> Conflict Surrounds Iran Pistachios  </HEADLINE>
By KILEY RUSSELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- California farmers are worried the Clinton
administration's decision to lift a 14-year ban on Iranian
pistachio imports will leave U.S. markets vulnerable to attack by a
heavily subsidized foreign industry and end up cutting into their
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   California growers, who account for about 35 percent of the
world's pistachio production, say the administration's move to ease
trade restrictions on Iranian luxury goods, including pistachios,
could dramatically reduce prices for the American product.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is another example of the Clinton administration
sacrificing domestic industries that they see as non-significant in
the name of publicity for themselves or their foreign relations
program,'' said Chuck Nichols, a Hanford pistachio farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Hamid Reza Asefi, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman was
quoted on Iranian television: ''Iran thinks it is positive and
welcomes it. And within the framework of Iranian laws, the United
States can export grain and medicine to Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not say whether Iran would begin exporting carpets,
caviar, fruits and nuts to the United States -- items Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright says are now permitted.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how much enthusiasm Iranian growers will have for
American markets because huge tariffs imposed on the pistachios in
1986 weren't lifted with the import ban.
</P>
<P>
   There is a 283 percent combined duty on the raw nuts and a 318
percent charge on the roasted nuts, said California Pistachio
Commission President Karen Reinecke.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happens when Iran gets the news today and they're all
excited and want to ship to the U.S., but they won't be able to?
It's kind of an empty promise from the U.S.,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The tariffs, the highest ever imposed for an agricultural
product, were the result of huge government subsidies granted to
Iranian farmers and the tendency of Iranian exporters to dump
pistachios on the U.S. market below market price.
</P>
<P>
   Reinecke said eventually the United States will review Iranian
trade practices and may reduce or eliminate the tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   But, until they are sure that growers aren't being subsidized by
the Iranian government and won't undersell U.S. growers, the
tariffs should remain in place, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year absence of Iranian competition has been an
unparalleled boon to California farmers, who grow almost all the
pistachios produced and sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the year before the ban was imposed, the California
crop was valued at $76.4 million and was grown on 34,243 bearing
acres. Last year, 71,000 acres produced $160 million.
</P>

<HEADLINE> FCC Tries To Stem Area Code Demand  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling a neighbor down the block used to be a
seven-digit endeavor. But in more and more cities, it's become an
11-digit ordeal as area codes multiply to cope with the explosion
in technology -- the separate lines for computers, cell phones,
faxes and pagers. And with the country running out of eligible area
codes, those numbers could get even longer.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the pressure for new area codes, the Federal
Communications Commission adopted rules Friday to free up unused
numbers that phone companies hold in reserve. The FCC's action also
dismantles a monopoly era system for allotting digits, taking into
account new local phone competition and burgeoning demand for
telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
   ''Around the country, people are plugging into the network and
using it more,'' said FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. While that's a
good thing, he said, it means that outdated methods for
distributing numbers must be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Some projections forecast that the country could run out of area
codes within the next eight to 10 years, requiring callers to punch
in more numbers than they do now. And each area code change forces
people to learn new dialing patterns, and many must upgrade
equipment and reprint business cards, stationery and advertising.
Alarm companies also must reprogram autodialing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In its most sweeping action, the commission undid a decades-old
system of allocating numbers to local carriers in blocks of 10,000
for every billing region they wish to serve, replacing that with a
1,000-number system.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the old system was that if a carrier had only
100 customers in a given region, the remaining 9,900 numbers of the
block were tied up, unavailable for users elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The commission laid out Friday a national plan to shift to
giving local phone companies 1,000 numbers at a time, a system that
will apply to wireless companies by 2002 as well.
</P>
<P>
   Others measures the FCC adopted include taking back those
numbers that carriers are holding but not using.
</P>
<P>
   So they can't hoard numbers in the future, phone companies will
also have to show their actual demand for new numbers, rather than
their projected need, before they are given new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Ten states, operating under commission authority, already are
using some new approaches to conserve numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In California, which has experienced a rapid addition of area
codes in recent years, telephone companies starting Friday got
access to a new pool of numbers in the 310 area code in West Los
Angeles. That's because carriers have sent back some 767,000 unused
numbers for redistribution.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, regulators were told two years ago they would have to
add another area code. But when the state examined the situation,
it discovered 3 million unused numbers that had been assigned to
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC let the state institute measures that included requiring
carriers to use at least 75 percent of their allocation or be
within six months of running out before they can request more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not trying to keep people from numbers they need,'' said
Trina Bragdon, staff attorney with the Maine Public Utilities
Commission. But the state wants to make sure the need is there
before allotting numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The numbering system, which also covers Canada and the
Caribbean, began with 86 area codes assigned in 1947. An additional
64 were gradually added through 1994, according to the North
American Numbering Plan Administration, which oversees the system.
</P>
<P>
   But then the area codes rapidly increased: 23 more in 1996,
another 44 in 1997, 28 in 1998 and 42 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators will continue reviewing proposals that would
require a more extensive overhaul -- such as charging carriers for
the numbers or adding digits to the numbering system -- that could
be implemented in the future.

<HEADLINE> Report: Clinton Gets License Delay  </HEADLINE>
By KELLY P. KISSEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- An Arkansas committee that will
determine whether President Clinton should keep his law license has
given him until April 21 to respond to a request that he be
disbarred, a conservative legal group said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had asked the state Supreme Court's Committee on
Professional Conduct to give him until Feb. 19, 2001, to respond to
allegations that he is unfit to be a lawyer in Arkansas. Clinton's
lawyer, David Kendall, said the president wanted to wait until the
month after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   In a fax provided The Associated Press by the Southeastern Legal
Foundation, which filed the complaint, the committee's chairman
said it decided to give Clinton until April 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeastern Legal Foundation wants Clinton disbarred for
giving false or misleading testimony during the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case. A federal judge who found Clinton in contempt of
her Little Rock court last year filed a separate complaint but did
not request a specific penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased they have a clear date,'' said Matt Glavin,
president of the Atlanta-based conservative foundation. ''We're
anxious to see how he defends the indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall did not immediately respond to a call to his Washington
office, and Clinton's Little Rock lawyer, Stephen Engstrom, refused
comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court ordered the Committee on Professional
Conduct to take up the case Jan. 27. The Atlanta group had
complained to the high court that its disbarment request was going
nowhere.

<HEADLINE> Findings From New Presidential Poll  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Some detailed findings from the
Voter.com-Battleground poll on
the 2000 presidential race concerning key voter groups and issues.
<TEXT>
<P>
   VOTER GROUPS
</P>
<P>
   Women: Gore had 48 percent to 43 percent for Bush. Gore ran
strongest among retired women and black women while Bush ran
strongest among white suburban women and mothers. They were about
even among Hispanic women.
</P>
<P>
   Men: Bush is at 52 percent with Gore at 40 percent. Gore has
trimmed his deficit among men by half as more men saw Gore as
capable of keeping the country prosperous. Both women and men saw
Gore as experienced, but men were more likely to see Bush as a
strong candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Parents: Bush was favored by more than 20 points among parents,
including among mothers. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said
''moms will be a real battleground.'' More than a fourth of mothers
said moral values were their top concern.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics: Bush was at 51 percent and Gore at 45 percent, while
Hispanics overwhelmingly identify themselves as Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan Democrats: Bush has a 52-39 lead among Reagan Democrats,
those who voted for Ronald Reagan and were Democratic at the time
of their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Independents: The two candidates about evenly split the
independent vote, an area where Bush had held a double-digit lead.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics: The candidates are about even among this
Democratic-leaning group.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats: Gore has increased his support among Democrats, with
more than eight of 10 backing him as they started seeing Bush as
more of a Republican after the primary battles.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans: Bush has very strong support among Republicans,
with nine of 10 in the party saying they support their nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   Bush issues: A fourth of Bush supporters said moral values was
the top issue with other issues grouped in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore issues: Education was ranked first, followed by Social
Security and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Education: Bush and Gore were running about even on an issue
that is of crucial interest to Democratic voters and also is a top
priority for parents and women.
</P>
<P>
   Guns: Bush and Gore were running even on the issue of guns, an
issue that Democrats hope will be a wedge issue, especially for
women voters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's influence: McCain's presence on the ticket didn't
dramatically change the dynamic of the race, a 48-42 Republican
advantage with him on the ticket and 48-44 for Bush without him.
But in key congressional districts, his presence on the ticket made
a big difference in the presidential race. GOP pollster Ed Goeas
suggested McCain would be very effective campaigning for candidates
in those districts.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Complains About U.N. Reports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Rwanda complained Friday of what it called
a ''pattern'' of attempts to discredit the government in recent
U.N. and media reports on Angola sanctions violations and Rwanda's
1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan Ambassador Joseph Mutaboba accused opponents -- whom he
defined as Hutu extremists responsible for the genocide, and their
supporters -- of trying to smear the Tutsi-led government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it deliberate? Yes, I think it is,'' he told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Mutaboba repeated his government's rejection of a U.N. report
that said Rwanda allowed diamond and arms dealers to operate
relatively freely on behalf of Angolan rebels in the Rwandan
capital, Kigali.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions imposed on the UNITA rebels bar arms and fuel sales
and also ban diamond exports by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot say that they did not come. They may have come,''
Mutaboba said of the traders. ''But to go and say that they had
Rwandan authorities' backup, protection and so on, that's totally
wrong and it's a serious allegation.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for the independent panel that wrote the report to
produce solid evidence to back it up.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a question about the 1994 genocide, Mutaboba also
sharply criticized a recent report by a Canadian newspaper that
Tutsis with links to the current government may have participated
in an assassination that helped spark the massacres.
</P>
<P>
   The report said three Tutsi informants had told U.N.
investigators that they helped shoot down a plane carrying Rwanda's
Hutu president in 1994 -- an attack that sparked the massacre of an
estimated 500,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of President Juvenal Habyarimana had long been
thought to have been the work of Hutu extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Mutaboba said he had been unable to locate the report and that
he doubted its existence. U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard has said the
U.N. war crimes prosecutor's office would have no comment on leaked
reports.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Tribune Wins Headliner Award  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The Chicago Tribune and ABC News have
captured top honors in the 66th annual National Headliner Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The awards sponsored by The Press Club of Atlantic City will be
presented May 6.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune won first place for public service and Best of Show
in the print division for its examinations of prosecutorial
misconduct and flaws in the death penalty system in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Ken Armstrong, Maurice Possley and Steve Mills, the
''Trial and Error'' series showed how prosecutors cheat and hide
evidence but are rarely punished for it. The stories showed how bad
lawyers, faulty evidence and forced confessions have undermined the
administration of capital punishment in that state.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was powerful journalism,'' the Headliner judges wrote.
''The impact was profound. The governor of Illinois placed a
moratorium on all executions and lawmakers around the country are
now taking a close, hard look at the death penalty issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC News, and its Peter Jennings and Tom Yellin, won best
documentary and Best of Show in television for ''The Century,'' a
12-hour series examining the most extraordinary events of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   ''The judges recognize the enormous task undertaken to review
the century, bringing perspective and remembrances as we enter a
new millennium. Thank you, ABC News,'' the judges wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Times photographer David Bohrer won top honors in
that division for his ''unforgettable'' image of police officers
leading children away from the site of a shooting at the North
Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   KCBS radio in San Francisco was the top winner in radio, taking
first place in investigative reporting and Best of Show for ''MUNI
Workers Comp,'' a four-part series exposing abuses in the San
Francisco transit agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press won first place for coverage of a major
news event or topic by a news service or syndicate for its stories
on the alleged mass killings of South Korean civilians by U.S.
soldiers at the village of No Gun Ri in 1950 during the early days
of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Other AP first-place winners were Helen O'Neill, for feature
writing; J. Pat Carter for spot news photography; Eric Draper for
feature photography and the AP staff for informational or
illustrative graphics.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,600 entries were received for the annual
competition.

   But the patient doth inherit the earth. Or at least they inherit
the buff and bare-chested D'Angelo, who happily made up for their
wait.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old Virginia native smoothly delivered song after
song with an often-falsetto croon reminiscent of Al Green and the
former Prince. Throughout his ambitious, almost-three-hour
performance, D'Angelo deftly played with themes of good and evil,
and took people on a tour of black music so steeped in Africa,
gospel, jazz, salsa and soul that it all appeared to be one when he
finished.
</P>
<P>
   While his lyrics carried more of what inarguably sells -- sex and
sin -- it was an honest effort that showed mad love and respect for
his real and musical ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   The show was funky. The show was real. Harking back to the
spirit of Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye, he gave his audience a
slice of a tune called the ''Devil's Pie.'' He threw out the gaiety
of home and hearth in the playful ''Chicken Grease.'' And stroking
on melody, he gently rattled hormones with the one song that has
gotten continuous R&AMP;B airplay, ''Untitled (How Does it Feel).''
</P>
<P>
   That song speaks most clearly to D'Angelo's easy claim -- rivaled
only by Lauryn Hill -- to being the next best independent artist
after Prince. He croons like him. He defies reason sometimes just
like him. (How does anyone play nearly every instrument and write
every song on an album?)
</P>
<P>
   It's impressive, but you do hope for a polite parting of the
ways because it's hard to tell where Prince stops and D'Angelo
begins.
</P>
<P>
   The band and D'Angelo wore black in the first half, then smartly
donned white modern and tribal outfits in the second half.
Backdrops included stained glass windows and a wooden fence with
signs advertising sin.
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the millennium, when it's acceptable to question
the big picture, God -- like sex -- sells well, too. And perhaps
D'Angelo knows it.
</P>
<P>
   Keyboardist James Poysner often laced the thick sounds of the
organ under D'Angelo's vocal lines like an exclamation point, not
unlike in black churches when the music backing a pastor's words is
almost as important as the words themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The young audience stomped its feet like the good preacher-boy
instructed.
</P>
<P>
   Even the absence of rapper Q-tip, who was supposed to open the
show, didn't seem to faze anyone. Mos Def filled in.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz wonderchild Roy Hargrove, who leads his own quintet and big
band, and regularly performs and records with legends in his field,
showed humility as a backup musician in D'Angelo's court. The
10-piece band gave off a strong and pleasant vapor of the past, a
la Earth, Wind and Fire.
</P>
<P>
   If D'Angelo stays true to his instincts and sheds some of his
very-'90s fixation on the old school, he seems destined for even
greener pastures.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. tour ends April 30 in Charlotte, N.C., after stops in
Washington, D.C.; Cleveland; Los Angeles and Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Former RI Tax Official Found Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID RISING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The city's former deputy tax assessor
was convicted Friday in the FBI-dubbed ''Operation Plunder Dome''
scandal in which bribes were accepted for lower property taxes at
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you believe that?'' a crying Rosemary Glancy asked family
members after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found Glancy, 47, guilty on all seven counts, including
attempted extortion and mail fraud. She will remain free on bail
until her sentencing June 1, and her attorney, Kevin Bristow, said
she could face years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   All six people indicted in the case have now either pleaded or
been found guilty. The FBI, which amassed more than 100 secretly
recorded conversations on video and audio tapes, said its
investigation is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Glancy's hands often shook during the 8-day trial, and Bristow
said the 26-year city employee was almost made ''physically ill''
by the testimony against her, impeding her from taking the stand in
her own defense.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, a handful of City Hall employees gathered
to support her.
</P>
<P>
   ''We left City Hall just after the announcement was made,'' said
Allison Chiaverini, who worked for Glancy in the tax department.
''There were literally wails of anguish.''
</P>
<P>
   Former city employee Bernadette Pagliaro said Glancy was
convicted ''because of what a no-good bum says.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagliaro referred to numerous statements made by former tax
board chairman Joseph Pannone that implicated Glancy in the scheme.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Rose described Glancy as Pannone's
''right arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Pannone's conversations with FBI cooperating witness Anthony
Freitas, captured on tape, were the crux of the prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
   The government withdrew its plea agreement with Pannone in
January, saying he had failed to fully cooperate. Pannone faces a
possible life sentence on 14 counts of extortion, conspiracy and
mail fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes played at Glancy's trial raised questions about the
role of Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr., Providence's longest serving
mayor. He has not been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Richard Rose said former tax board member David Ead
described arranging a $10,000 payoff to ''the man downtown,'' while
Pannone boasted Cianci gave him tips on how to take bribes without
getting caught.
</P>
<P>
   Cianci called the accusations ''fantasy,'' and said Pannone's
banter caught on tape made him sound like a ''Goodfellas wannabe,''
referring to the 1990 mob film.

<HEADLINE> FBI Mole in Payoff Probe Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE ROBINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- An undercover mole for the FBI who slipped
bundles of cash to Chicago politicians while wearing a wire in an
anti-corruption investigation was sentenced Friday to three years
and three months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   After the sentencing, federal officials said that corrupt
contractor John Christopher's role was the key to their most
successful undercover operation in Chicago. But they also said
there was no way they could overlook the crimes he committed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's well known, for those of you who are fishermen, that in
order to attract bottom feeders you usually use the stinkiest bait
that's available,'' said John Johnson, deputy chief of the FBI's
Chicago office. ''John Christopher was just that. Stinky bait. He
attracted the bottom feeders and those were the people that ideally
we wanted to catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher's eight-year odyssey through some of the murkiest
reaches of Chicago politics resulted in federal convictions against
18 officials and their associates, including six City Council
members.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher pleaded guilty to two counts of misdemeanor tax
fraud and one felony count of bankruptcy fraud as part of a deal in
which he agreed to serve as the government's undercover mole.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Elaine Bucklo to show some
lenience and give him a sentence lower than the 33-month minimum
under federal sentencing guidelines. She refused, saying he had
gone uncharged for a number of criminal acts while working with the
FBI, including illegally dumping a huge mound of trash and dust on
Chicago's West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher also admitted exchanging $200,000 in ''old money''
stored for years by mobsters for fresh bills. But he wasn't charged
for that.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've already gotten the benefit of your cooperation,''
Bucklo told Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had anything to say, the husky contractor, who
according to U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar has mob connections, said
in a barely audible voice: ''I'm really sorry for what I did in my
past life. ...
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a big mistake, and I have an opportunity to lead a good
life now, if I could have that chance,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Brothers Accused of Synagogue Arsons  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE LAWRENCE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Two white supremacist brothers charged
with murdering a gay couple were accused Friday of setting fire to
three synagogues and a medical center that houses an abortion
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Matthew Williams, 32, and James Tyler Williams, 29,
have been in jail since July, when they were arrested in the
shootings that month of Winfield Mowder and Gary Matson.
Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty on the murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   The latest indictment accuses the brothers of conspiracy, arson,
and destruction of religious property. The charges carry up to 235
years behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ''The object of the conspiracy was to destroy and close
synagogues and reproductive health services facilities and to
thereby provoke further incidents of violence and to intimidate,
terrorize and harm Jews, providers of reproductive health services
and other groups of persons whom the defendants regarded as
inferior or undesirable,'' the indictment says.
</P>
<P>
   The June 18 synagogue fires caused more than $1 million in
damage. The brothers, who are from Palo Cedro, were also charged in
a July 2 arson at the Country Club Medical Center, which houses an
abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Williams, who uses the name Matthew, has told news
organizations that he alone was responsible for the slayings and
fires. Investigators said Tyler Williams' handprint was on the
pistol used to kill Matson and Mowder on July 1 at the couple's
home in Happy Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Since the arrest, Matthew Williams has repeatedly professed
anti-Semitic, anti-gay and white supremacist beliefs. He recently
grew a Hitler-style mustache and has said he wants to wear a
Nazi-style uniform in court.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Williams said his defense in the murder case will be
based on his belief that the Bible condemns homosexuality. His
brother has not talked to the media.

<HEADLINE> Shippers Applaud Merger Moratorium  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KOENIG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The fate of their $6 billion merger in doubt,
officials of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. and Canadian
National railroads said Friday their next move will be consulting
the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Surface Transportation Board on Friday ordered railroads to
suspend all merger activity while it writes new rules for
consolidations over the next 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   The board was responding to a barrage of complaints from
shippers, who say service on the nation's freight railroads has
declined due to recent mergers, and from rival railroads.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate effect of the board's action was to stop in its
tracks the deal to merge Fort Worth-based Burlington Northern with
Canadian National. The deal was announced last December.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they doubted the merger would go forward if the
courts uphold the transportation board's moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they're going to want to wait around 15 months
and keep the merger on the table,'' said Jill Evans, an analyst
with J.P. Morgan. She suggested the two railroads would instead
form an alliance that falls short of a merger.
</P>
<P>
   The transportation board acted after four days of hearings in
which shippers protested snarled railroad lines and late deliveries
that followed Union Pacific's 1996 purchase of Southern Pacific
Rail Corp. and last year's purchase this year of Conrail Inc. by
Eastern railroads CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of Burlington Northern and Canadian National would
create the largest railroad in North America, with about 50,000
miles of track from coast to coast in the United States and Canada.
It would be called North American Railways and be based in
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Krebs, chairman and chief executive of Burlington
Northern, said his company would review the transportation board's
decision ''to determine what appropriate legal action we can
take.''
</P>
<P>
   If the board decision withstands a court challenge, Krebs said
in a statement, the result would be to punish Burlington Northern
and Canadian National ''because of the failures of other
railroads.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Canadian National said bluntly that his company
was launching a legal challenge to the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Shippers viewed the moratorium as a victory, but only a limited
one.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us, the issue is competition, not the timing of the
moratorium,'' said Mike Heimowitz, a spokesman for the Chemical
Manufacturers Association. ''The board needs to put conditions on
these mergers that will encourage competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Shippers have gone to the Surface Transportation Board and
Congress seeking rules changes including help for ''captive
shippers'' -- those served by only one railroad. But Evans said
Friday's decision probably means Congress won't get involved in the
issue anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the moratorium, shares in the companies rose. Analysts
said rail stocks had been depressed lately because of uncertainty
over the transportation board's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington Northern shares rose $1.25 to $22.25, and shares of
Canadian National rose 93} cents to $28.

<HEADLINE> Deal Ends Boeing Engineers' Strike  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- With its profits and share price sagging and its
customers clamoring for delayed jets, Boeing Co. cut a deal Friday
to end a 38-day strike by its engineers, one of the largest ever by
white-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative three-year contract gave a surprising, resounding
victory to the 13,000-member Society of Professional Engineering
Employees in Aerospace, which won raises, bonuses and extended
health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today is the day that the relationship between The Boeing Co.
and SPEEA has changed forever,'' said Charles Bofferding, executive
director of the union, who helped engineer the agreement. ''Today
they understand what we mean by respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The union will vote on the contract on Sunday, and the engineers
and technical workers could be back on the job at the world's No. 1
maker of passenger jets as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The contract grants wage increases of at least 9 percent and
cash bonuses totaling $2,500 over 12 months, while the company
extended health coverage to domestic partners of workers.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing originally offered no guarantee of pay increases and
asked workers to pay part of their health insurance premiums,
demands that angered workers and triggered the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing chairman and chief executive Phil Condit acknowledged
Friday that the company's attitude toward the union has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of us have a greater understanding of what is meant by the
issue of 'respect,''' he said. ''One day I hope we can all look
back on this as a turning point, a time when we more clearly
recognized the importance of listening to and seeking to understand
one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members told union officials they did not like the fact
that the bonus money was tied to job retention and performance --
$1,000 30 days after the workers come back, $500 after Boeing
delivers 225 planes, and another $1,000 if Boeing meets its
delivery goal of 491 aircraft by March 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''My response to that is, at least there is bonus money,''
Bofferding said. ''Their previous offers didn't have any, and we
held out for it because our members wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's engineers design planes and inspect them prior to
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Their union has long been overshadowed by the powerful
Machinists union, whose members actually build the planes. The
engineers' union counts only about 13,000 members among the 22,000
eligible to belong. Its only other walkout lasted for just one day
in 1992, and the union had no strike fund when the current dispute
began.
</P>
<P>
   This time, 17,000 employees stayed out.
</P>
<P>
   The Machinists stayed on the job, but deliveries of commercial
aircraft were down significantly in February and were practically
nonexistent in March.
</P>
<P>
   Important Boeing customers such as American Airlines and United
Airlines missed deliveries and had to adjust their maintenance and
flight schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's costing us money,'' United spokesman Joe Hopkins said
earlier this week. ''We rely on Boeing for a wide variety of
services, and we've had to postpone some modifications because of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing stock dropped about 10 percent and the company warned
that its profits for the first months of the year would be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Condit told a news conference Friday that company executives
would study the financial impact of the strike over the weekend,
along with recovery plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, our focus is to deliver every one of those 491
airplanes scheduled for delivery this year and to meet all our
commitments to military customers,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   The strike came at an awkward time for Boeing. The company was
only beginning to recover from two abysmal years in 1997 and 1998,
when its commercial aircraft division suffered heavy losses due to
snarled production lines and delayed deliveries. As it reorganized,
the company announced it would cut more than 40,000 of its 228,000
workers. The commercial division recovered in 1999, delivering a
record 620 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts, who were initially split on how the strike
would affect the company, agreed Friday that Boeing's recovery
would likely continue unabated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see a long-term effect here,'' said Joseph Campbell of
Lehman Brothers. ''They will pick up the pieces, put their
shoulders to it and bring home every Year 2000 prediction that
they've made.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing shares gained $2.38 to $38 Friday as of 4 p.m. Friday on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   On the picket lines in front of Boeing's military division
Friday, strikers had mixed feelings about the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it'll get approved, but it's a compromise,'' said Dave
Keil.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't touch our benefits, and that was key for us,''
added picket captain Matt Renaud. ''Looking at it that way, it's a
win for the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit, himself an engineer and former member of the engineers
union, said he would create a task force to help improve relations
between engineers and the company.

<HEADLINE> UN Urged To Act on China, Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Two prominent human rights organizations urged the
U.N. Human Rights Commission Friday to put aside political
considerations and get tough on abuses in China and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of rights violations in the two areas are expected to
cast a long shadow over the session of the 53-nation Rights
Commission which opens Monday and runs through April 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are quite a few untouchables'' at the commission, said
Isabelle Scherrer of Amnesty International. ''China has been one
for many years ... and we'll see whether this year the commission
can finally break its deadlock,'' Scherrer told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Human Rights Watch also demanded the
commission address abuses committed in the Chechen war and Chinese
crackdowns on dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government announced Jan. 11 that it would seek a
resolution criticizing China. Last year's U.S. bid to rebuke China
failed, as did seven previous attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has been able to mobilize support from developing
countries, which dominate the commission, to block discussion of
its record. Both sides will be lobbying members heavily.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, China has engaged in its most concerted crackdown on
dissent in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting China earlier this month, U.N. human rights chief Mary
Robinson asserted that right violations in China have worsened in
the past year. Robinson's scheduled visit to Russia and Chechnya
starting March 31 is expected to provide impetus for the commission
to take up rights issues there.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and other international officials have protested the
large number of civilian casualties in Russia's campaign against
Chechen rebels, and have called for independent investigations into
alleged torture and other abuses. Russia has denied the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Among other nations expected to face scrutiny at the commission
are Iran, Iraq, Myanmar and Cuba, all of whose records were
censured last year.

   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A Mexican senator was elected president
of the Latin American Parliament on Friday, becoming the first

   The parliament represents 22 legislatures from Latin America and

<HEADLINE> Bishop Leaves Troubled Chiapas State  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- Departing from
trouble-plagued Chiapas state, a Catholic bishop said Friday that
paramilitary groups are posing an increasing threat in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Raul Vera told reporters there were ''worrying signs''
that paramilitaries and police were working together in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems that the use of force has been chosen to resolve the
conflicts in the region,'' said Vera, former adjunct to
controversial Bishop Samuel Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   Vera had expected to succeed Ruiz, who resigned when he turned
75 last year, but the Vatican announced Vera's transfer in December
to a post in the northern city of Saltillo,.
</P>
<P>
   Vera was assigned to the San Cristobal diocese in 1995 to
counterbalance Ruiz's advocacy of Indian rights. Officials and
landowners said Ruiz sided with leftist Zapatista guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   However, Vera quickly became an ally of Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   The government denies paramilitary groups even exist in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas staged a brief uprising in Chiapas in January
1994 to demand democracy and Indian rights. Peace talks are
stalemated.

<HEADLINE> Former hostage, father of bombing victim criticize advances toIran  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The prospect of warmer relations with Iran
drew a chilly reaction Friday from a former hostage and the father
of a bombing victim who both have gone to court to try to make Iran
pay for terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Anderson, who holds Iran accountable for his seven years
in captivity in Beirut, said the Iranian government should ''take
responsibility for its acts and offer compensation to American
victims'' as a prerequisite for improved relations.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Flatow of West Orange, N.J., who blames Iran for the
1995 bombing in the Gaza Strip that killed his daughter, Alisa,
said the Clinton administration is putting ''caviar, carpets and
pistachio nuts'' before dealing with terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ''What troubles me,'' Flatow said, ''is nobody is saying to the
Iranian government: 'Look, you've been the prime sponsor of
terrorism. Send us a clear signal you're out of the business.'''
</P>
<P>
   Both men reacted after Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
announced that the Clinton administration will lift a ban on U.S.
imports of Iranian luxury goods in a step toward ''a new
relationship'' between the countries.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by Anderson, former chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, was released through the
office of Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Flatow, Anderson and three other hostages held with Anderson in
Beirut -- David Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio and Frank Reed -- all sued
Iran in American courts under a 1996 law allowing Americans to seek
damages from nations that sponsor terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Iran declined to send any representative to court to respond to
the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Flatow won a judgment for $247.5 million. Jacobsen, Cicippio and
Reed won judgments totaling $65 million. Anderson, whose nearly
seven years in captivity in Lebanon made him the longest-held
American hostage, is awaiting a federal judge's ruling on his
request for $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has collected a penny. The Clinton administration has
opposed efforts to collect the judgments from frozen Iranian
assets, arguing that unfreezing the assets could result in
retaliation against U.S. diplomatic properties abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Albright told Congress last month that she was willing to work
with terrorism victims and their families to find a way to help
them collect. Flatow said he has yet to receive any such help.
</P>
<P>
   Mack and Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., are pushing legislation
that would help Flatow, Anderson and others collect judgments from
frozen assets. The Clinton administration opposes the bill.
</P>
<P>
   After Albright's announcement, Mack accused the administration
of ''unprincipled and inconsistent foreign policy.'' Lautenberg
said an easing of sanctions is premature.
</P>
<P>
   Flatow said it is possible that improved relations with Iran
will help him get the damages he won. But, he added, ''This is not
about the money. Frankly I think I'll never see a nickel, the way
things are developing. (But) I think we're entitled to an
accounting from Iran.''

<HEADLINE> Phase-in of new auto test resumes in April, officials pledge toprevent system shutdown  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- State transportation officials promised
Friday that when the kinks are worked out of a tougher emissions
test and it is implemented again, motorists will not have to wait
in line for hours at inspection stations like they did in December.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid systemwide failures, the test will be gradually phased
in at various inspection stations. State officials will closely
monitor the shift by Parsons Infrastructure and Technology, said
Dick Kamin, director of the Division of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Phase-in of the enhanced test and of safety tests will begin
soon at the 15 busiest stations.
</P>
<P>
   If problems arise as these stations make the transition,
officials should know it before there can be widespread failures --
and the accompanying long lines and frayed nerves of motorists and
short tempers in the governor's office and Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Commissioner James Weinstein said the state has
given Parsons Infrastructure until June 30 to complete the
transition, but he said his office will watch progress closely and
react swiftly to snafus. His agency was criticized for failing to
monitor the company's progress leading to the December problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have worked very hard with the contractor to make sure that
they live up to their responsibilities,'' Weinstein said. ''I can't
tell you how many all night meetings we have had with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Waits this month have been an average of 13 to 21 minutes,
depending on the station and type of test being used, Weinstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 32 Division of Motor Vehicles inspection stations are
conducting tests in 110 lanes, but nearly half of those lanes have
been using the old emissions and safety tests since January. They
reverted to the old tests to cut waiting times.
</P>
<P>
   The updated test was kept in place at the rest of the stations
and wait times there have been reduced as equipment problems were
corrected and computer documentation of cars was simplified.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said he expects five to 10 of the lanes using the old
test to switch back to the newer test in April. The enhanced test
measures tailpipe emissions in conditions that simulate driving,
while the old test is applied to cars that are idling. The new
version also tests for a broader range of pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said the system will never bee free of some delay for
motorists, especially at busy stations during peak hours. ''There
are going to be periods of the month where there are going to be
waits.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamin noted that motorists receive their registration renewal
notices in the mail six to eight weeks before the month in which
their inspection is due, and he said they are free to get their
cars inspected earlier to select the least congested times of the
day and of the month.

<HEADLINE> Greek Fisherman Finds Son's Body  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A fisherman made a tragic discovery when
he hauled in his fishing nets Friday, finding the body of his son
who had been missing for a month, the merchant marine ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Panagiotis Vettas, 22, fell overboard on Jan. 26 during a
fishing trip with his 60-year-old father, Giorgos, southeast of the
Kimolos Island, 90 miles southwest of Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews and the coast guard were unable to locate him, and
the search was called off after a few days, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   But as Giorgos Vettas hauled in his fishing nets Friday off the
coast of an Aegean island near where his son had disappeared, he
found they contained the remains of his son.
</P>
<P>
   The body was being examined by a coroner, and port police were
investigating the case.

<HEADLINE> Former Executive Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former Disney Internet executive who
admitted flying to California to have sex with an e-mail
acquaintance he thought was a 13-year-old girl pleaded guilty
Friday to crossing state lines for the illegal tryst.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick J. Naughton entered the plea in federal court to one
count of interstate travel with intent to engage in criminal
activity. He could face up to 15 years in prison when he is
sentenced on June 5. He will remain free on a $100,000 bond until
then.
</P>
<P>
   Naughton, 34, of Seattle, was arrested in September at the Santa
Monica Pier. As part of the plea bargain, he admitted that he had
flown from Seattle primarily to have a tryst with ''KrisLA,'' a
supposedly 13-year-old girl he had met in March 1999 in an Internet
chat room.
</P>
<P>
   The ''girl'' actually was an undercover FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   At his trial in December, Naughton contended that he believed
the girl was really an adult woman, and that they were both playing
out a sexual fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Naughton's guilty plea rebukes his prior claim that his chat
on the Internet was only a fantasy,'' said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman
for the U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   A call seeking comment from Donald Marks, Naughton's attorney,
was not immediately returned Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of his plea bargain, the government agreed to
dismiss two other charges of possession of child pornography and
use of the Internet to attempt to induce a minor to engage in
criminal sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   The jury in December had deadlocked over the Internet and
sex-travel counts, but convicted him of the pornography charge.
However, that charge was later dismissed after a judge ruled it was
based on an unconstitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   Naughton had faced a March 21 retrial on all three counts and
could have faced up to 35 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Naughton, a former Disney Go Network executive, was fired and
lost $15 million in stock options when he was charged.
</P>
<P>
   He co-wrote the Java computer language and also wrote programs
for the Go Network designed to screen out foul language and
pornographic images.

<HEADLINE> Officials Praise Smith &AMP; Wesson  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gun maker Smith &AMP; Wesson's agreement Friday to
childproof its guns with safety locks was met with praise from
government officials and gun-control advocates and silence from the
National Rifle Association, which has engaged in a public war of
words with the White House this past week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, a gun manufacturer is stepping forward and attempting
to ensure that its products are not used to kill or injure
Americans,'' said Mark Pertschuk, legislative director of the
Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.
</P>
<P>
   While the NRA declined to comment on the agreement, the National
Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms trade organization, said in
a statement that Smith &AMP; Wesson's decision was an ''ill-conceived
action on the part of one of the most revered names in the American
firearms industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am deeply disturbed by the fact that Smith &AMP; Wesson has
allowed the Clinton-Gore Administration to manipulate the company
in this manner,'' said foundation president and CEO Robert Delfay.
''Smith &AMP; Wesson has ... run off and cut their own deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident that no other major manufacturers will
desert,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the company would include safety locks with
all of its handguns and pistols and would not produce new handguns
that accept magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
The company also would also not advertise products in a manner that
might appeal to criminals or juveniles. In exchange, state and
local governments would drop lawsuits seeking damages for gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers praised the agreement, but cautioned that more still
needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ''Though we hail Smith &AMP; Wesson for taking a pro-active approach
to the problem of violence in our country, this step does not mean
gun crimes will go away,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla.. ''We must
redouble our efforts to enforce existing laws and prosecute all
violent criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., the author of a bill that would require
all handguns be sold with child safety devices, said the company's
voluntary action should be mandatory for all gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This much is clear: The more distance we put between kids and
guns, the more senseless deaths and injuries we can prevent,'' Kohl
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pertschuk said that despite the agreement, the remaining
municipal suits against the gun industry should still be pursued
vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call with President Clinton, mayors and city
officials from around the country expressed satisfaction, but St.
Louis Mayor Clarence Harmon said the pact was just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Suffice to say, something monumental has happened in this
country,'' said. ''We think this is the breaking of the dam, that
much more will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, campaigning in New York, promised to continue
to fight for gun safety legislation if elected to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I urge cities, including New York City ... to bring all
possible leverage upon the gun industry to do the right thing by
our children,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Smith &AMP; Wesson OKs Safety Locks  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a deal heralded as a way to save children's
lives, gunmaking giant Smith &AMP; Wesson agreed Friday to install
locks on its weapons to make them more childproof. In exchange,
governments would drop lawsuits seeking damages for gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, reached after two months of negotiations
involving the company, state and local officials and the Clinton
administration, establishes an unprecedented ''code of conduct''
for selling and distributing handguns. President Clinton expressed
hope that other gun companies will follow Smith &AMP; Wesson's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''A decision to enter this agreement, we realized, would not be
popular with everyone,'' Smith &AMP; Wesson President Ed Shultz said in
a conference call broadcast at a news conference where the deal was
announced. ''But we believe ... it is the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter posted on its Internet site, Smith &AMP; Wesson said
that since 1997 it has provided a lock with every weapon shipped
and that the weapons are shipped in lockable boxes. The company did
not address whether the locks were put onto the guns before
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declared the agreement an act of ''courage and vision''
by Smith &AMP; Wesson. In a conference call with local officials, he
hinted that governments on all levels ought to remember the gun
manufacturer when it is time to purchase supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Smith &AMP; Wesson stuck their neck out here,'' Clinton said. ''I
think all of us, including the federal government, in our
procurement policies -- if we are really serious about making
America safer -- ought to send a clear signal that we appreciate
what they did. This is a happy day.''
</P>
<P>
   The gun industry greeted the deal with uncertainty, although
some companies said they already take safety measures like those to
which Smith &AMP; Wesson agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have supplied trigger locks with all our firearms for
almost two years,'' said Wesley Lang, vice president of marketing
at SigArms in Exeter, N.H. The company also plans to soon market a
gun with an internal, electronic locking system, Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   Beretta USA, the Maryland-based U.S. division of the Italian
gunmaker, didn't have enough details about the agreement to comment
on it. ''Smith &AMP; Wesson didn't advise anybody in the industry, that
we know of, about what they were doing, at least not any of the
particulars,'' said spokesman Jeff Reh.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms industry
organization, condemned Smith &AMP; Wesson, saying it had ''violated a
trust with their consumers and with the entire domestic firearms
industry'' by entering the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an ill-conceived action on the part of one of the most
revered names in the American firearms industry,'' said Robert
Delfay, the foundation's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   John Michael Snyder, of the Citizens Committee for the Right to
Keep and Bear Arms, said Smith &AMP; Wesson's decision wouldn't
infringe on citizens' rights. At the same time, he said, it would
not, by itself, prevent deaths like that of 6-year-old Kayla
Rolland, shot by a first-grade classmate in Michigan, who found the
weapon in the home where he was staying.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think politicians have jumped on this issue in an attempt to
make political points for themselves,'' Snyder said. ''I don't
think it deals with the problem, which is sociological.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush said
the Texas governor was optimistic about the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush supports child safety locks and other measures
to keep guns out of the hands of juveniles and criminals,''
spokesman Ari Fleischer said. ''He is pleased Smith &AMP; Wesson has
chosen to provide safety locks and encourages gun owners to use
them to protect children.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson agreed to include safety locks with all of its
handguns and pistols -- external locks to be on the weapons in 60
days and internal locks to be installed within two years. New
firearms would not be allowed to accept magazines that hold more
than 10 rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Smith &AMP; Wesson will devote 2 percent of firearms revenues
every year to developing ''smart'' technology that limits a gun's
use to its rightful owner. The gunmaker, in addition, will not
advertise or market its products in a way that appeals to juveniles
or criminals, such as ads claiming guns are fingerprint-proof.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, federal, state and local governments agreed to
dismiss pending suits against Smith &AMP; Wesson and refrain from
filing new suits. The Clinton administration had been threatening
to bring a national lawsuit against the industry if manufacturers
failed to enter negotiations aimed at increasing gun safety.
</P>
<P>
   City officials were jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an excellent concept, a great first step,'' said New
Orleans Mayor Marc Morial, whose city filed the first lawsuit in
October 1998. ''I know that it will save the lives of many children
in this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's deal affects only Smith &AMP; Wesson, biggest of the eight
major gun manufacturers. Also signing the agreement were the states
of New York and Connecticut; Dade County, Fla.; and the cities of
Atlanta; Berkeley, Calif.; Bridgeport, Conn.; Camden, N.J.;
Detroit; Gary, Ind.; Inglewood, Calif.; Los Angeles; San Francisco;
and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said other localities would sign as
well. In the meantime, the Clinton administration would continue
with its plans for other lawsuits against other gunmakers, said
Andrew Cuomo, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement provides for new safety and design standards,
including:
</P>
<P>
   --A second ''hidden'' serial number inside the gun to counter
criminals who obliterate visible serial numbers.
</P>
<P>
   --A handgun design that would make it difficult for a child
younger than 6 to fire the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Under the code of conduct, Smith &AMP; Wesson would sell its
products only to authorized dealers and distributors who would be
allowed to sell those firearms at gun shows only if all sellers
perform background checks on buyers. A dealer or distributor would
have its contract with the manufacturer terminated if ''a
disproportionate number'' of crimes were traced to the weapons it
sells.

<HEADLINE> Strike Halts Interstate Bakeries  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS GOSIER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- A strike that shut down Interstate
Bakeries Corp.'s New England operations continued for a second full
day on Friday and even reached down the East Coast to shut down one
of the company's bakeries in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   As about 1,400 Teamsters continued to stop the shipment of bread
and other baked goods, 400 members of a bakers' union stopped
working Thursday evening at the Drake's bakery in Wayne, N.J., said
Mark Dirkes, the company's senior vice president for marketing in
Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey workers returned to their jobs on Friday, but the
plant remained shut down because its drivers belonging to the
Teamsters union refused to distribute the product.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters blamed Interstate Bakeries for the strike, saying
the company refused to honor arbitration rulings on issues
including an unfair labor complaint. Company officials who contend
they were shut out of the arbitration process have asked a judge to
rule on whether the arbitration was valid.
</P>
<P>
   The transport drivers, sales representatives, shippers and
receivers left their jobs Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 Teamsters were based in Biddeford, while the rest
distributed the baked goods throughout New England, said Bill
Turkewitz, a representative of Teamsters local 340 in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The Biddeford bakery was shut down after about 500 bakery union
members refused to cross the Teamsters picket line. The plant makes
J.J. Nissen, Wonder Bread, Hostess and Drake's products.
</P>
<P>
   One of New England's largest supermarket chains stepped up its
orders from other suppliers to make up for the products that were
no longer coming from the Biddeford plant. The Hannaford Bros.
grocery chain still had plenty of bread supplies Friday,
spokeswoman Caren Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Customers should see no shortage unless they are looking for a
particular Nissen's product,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between the company and the union broke down
Thursday afternoon, and Dirkes said Friday that he was not aware of
any negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Examiner Sold After 112 Years  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE LOCKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In 1887, an eager young man begged to take
the helm of his family's ''miserable little sheet'' of a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The paper was the San Francisco Examiner. The young man was
William Randolph Hearst. What happened next became legend.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst used his father's millions to build an empire
commemorated in the veiled fiction of the movie ''Citizen Kane,''
an empire that would eventually include everything from slick
glossies like Cosmopolitan to Web sites like Women.com and trade
publications.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, a new chapter in the Examiner's history opened as the
Hearst Corp. announced it was selling the paper to the San
Francisco Independent, a free paper.
</P>
<P>
   The sale clears the way for Hearst to consummate its purchase of
rival San Francisco Chronicle and appears to keep alive the often
scrappy Examiner-Chronicle wars, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   It also is the latest twist in a newspaper saga that includes
earthquakes, fires, three shootings, one angry mob and the
thundering futility of Casey at the bat.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner began with a card game in the rambunctious
post-Gold Rush days of 1880.
</P>
<P>
   Mining, real estate and ranching millionaire George Hearst got
the then-unprofitable, 5,000-circulation Examiner as partial
payment on a gambling debt.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, his son, William Randolph Hearst, asked to
take over ''our miserable little sheet.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have begun to have a strange fondness for our little paper --
a tenderness like unto that which a mother feels for a puny or
deformed offspring,'' Hearst wrote to his father. ''I should hate
to see it die now after it had battled so long and so nobly for
existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Backed with several million dollars from his father, the
23-year-old Hearst installed new presses, sent correspondents to
Asia, Mexico and Europe and recruited the likes of cartoonist
Thomas Nast and writers Jack London and Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Chronicle had an equally colorful beginning. That
paper began as the Daily Dramatic Chronicle, founded by the de
Young brothers, Michael and Charles, with a $20 gold piece they
borrowed from Michael's landlord.
</P>
<P>
   Writing florid prose and carrying pistols for protection, they
took on scoundrels of all types and became the dominant paper among
more than 100 in the frontier city.
</P>
<P>
   The paper started as free theater reviews but later switched to
news as the Daily Morning and Evening Chronicle. In 1879, the paper
made news of its own when Charles de Young shot and wounded mayoral
candidate Isaac Kalloch after Kalloch insinuated that the de
Youngs' mother ran a house of ill repute. The following year,
Milton Kalloch, Isaac's son, burst into the Chronicle newsroom and
shot and killed Charles de Young.
</P>
<P>
   In 1884, Michael, by then known by the more august M.H. de
Young, was the target of an attack when outraged sugar baron Adolph
Spreckels fired on him after the Chronicle published critical
articles. De Young survived.
</P>
<P>
   In 1905, the two papers struck a rare, collegial note, when the
Examiner lent its presses to the Chronicle after a mob set fire to
the Chronicle's building to demonstrate disagreement with the
paper's choice of candidate in a city election.
</P>
<P>
   That accord held a year later when the great earthquake of 1906
and its fires destroyed both papers' offices, sending them over to
Oakland to publish a joint Call-Examiner-Chronicle edition at the
obliging Oakland Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later came a milestone of a different sort when the
Examiner published the now-classic poem, ''Casey at the Bat.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1913, M.H. de Young reported that he had bought the Morning
Call and would fold it into the Chronicle. Public outrage forced
him to sell it to Hearst, who reopened it as an afternoon paper,
leaving just the Examiner and Chronicle in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers reached a truce of sorts in 1965 when the
Chronicle and Examiner combined their business operations but kept
their editorial department separate. The Call was folded into the
Examiner, which took the afternoon slot.
</P>
<P>
   But as with all afternoon newspapers, readership declined.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle, with a daily circulation of more than 456,000, is
now the largest newspaper in Northern California and the second
largest on the West Coast. The Examiner's circulation is 107,000
daily.
</P>
<P>
   While other papers were folded into newspaper groups, the
Chronicle and Examiner remained in private hands. Will Randolph
Hearst III, grandson of the founder, was publisher of the Examiner
from 1984-1994 and remained on the board. But the last descendant
of the de Young brothers was ousted from the Chronicle's management
in 1994 among bitter infighting among family members.
</P>
<P>
   De Young's granddaughter, Nan Tucker McEvoy, rejected a Hearst
Corp. offer of $800 million in 1993 for the Chronicle Publishing
Co., which included other newspapers, TV stations and book
publishing companies.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the potential for a huge payout outweighed the
family's sentimental ties to their media company.
</P>
<P>
   What's next for the Examiner?
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea,'' said Editor Phil Bronstein.
</P>
<P>
   But new owner and publisher Ted Fang was firm on the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saving the Ex today has made history,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> FedEx Faces Discrimination suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
filed suit Friday on behalf of a Federal Express delivery driver
who was fired for wearing a beard.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Augusta, contends
FedEx violated Khaleed Abdul-Azeez' religious rights and says the
company is violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with its policy
prohibiting employees in customer-contact positions from wearing
beards.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Express beard policy includes an exception for
anyone who needs to wear a beard for medical reasons, but not for
religious reasons, the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   It says Abdul-Azeez requested an exemption to accommodate his
Islamic beliefs, which require males to wear beards, but Federal
Express refused to accommodate him.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Azeez, hired as a delivery driver in Augusta in November
1998, was placed on unpaid about 10 days later and was told to find
a job in a non-customer contact position, said Steve Tapper, an
EEOC attorney in Atlanta. After Abdul-Azeez failed to find a
satisfactory position, he was fired March 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks back pay and punitive and compensatory damages.
It also asks that the company be forced to stop religious
discrimination in its employment and hiring practices.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in FedEx Corp.'s legal and public relations offices
did not return calls seeking comment Friday. Federal Express is the
world's top package transport service, delivering more than 3
million packages daily.
</P>
<P>
   Tapper said Federal Express, based in Memphis, Tenn., has 30
days to file a response.

<HEADLINE> Iridium Wants To End Phone Service  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID E. KALISH, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Iridium LLC gave up its search for new backers
on Friday, and a bankruptcy judge gave the mobile phone company
permission to cut off service to 55,000 customers and destroy its
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not have a qualified bid,'' William Perlstein, a lawyer
representing the debt-plagued company, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Arthur Gonzalez at an afternoon hearing in Manhattan. In all, more
than 80 parties had been contacted in the futile search for new
investors, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Judge Gonzalez gave Iridium permission to halt
service and ''de-orbit'' its $5 billion constellation of 66
satellites by sending them to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere, a
process that may begin in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But until the de-orbiting plan is finalized, the satellites will
be kept running and limited phone service will continue in North
America and possibly other regions of the world, said Motorola
Corp., the lead investor in Iridium and the operator of the
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, which is also a partner in the North American service
provider, said it will be up to the independent Iridium affiliate
for each region to continue to offer temporary service. A Motorola
spokesman wouldn't rule out any last-minute rescue by a new
investor, but said the decision to keep the service going for now
was a courtesy to customers, rather than a sign that Iridium might
still be saved.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling on Friday capped a stunning corporate
embarrassment for Motorola and other major companies who funded the
often quixotic quest to link up the remotest reaches of Earth with
powerful mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium's tortured saga began looking hopeless two weeks ago
when wireless phone pioneer Craig McCaw scrapped plans to expand
his budding satellite empire with a bailout of the company.
</P>
<P>
   While Motorola has said it will shut off the mobile phone
service at midnight on Friday, pulling down the satellites is a
longer process that may take up to two years, Perlstein said. The
satellites would be moved four at a time into a lower orbit, where
they would ultimately burn up in the earth's atmosphere, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge gave Iridium approval to spend $8.3 million to start
closing its business, including paying severance to employees. That
doesn't include the estimated $30 million to $50 million it will
cost to destroy the satellites and prevent them from crashing into
other objects circling the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium filed for bankruptcy court protection from its creditors
last August, unable to make payments on some $4.4 billion of debt,
but hoping to reorganize and turn profitable.
</P>
<P>
   While Iridium has more than tripled its subscriber base since
last summer, the customer count was still well shy of the levels
needed to keep the company afloat without another cash infusion
from Motorola and its other hesitant backers.
</P>
<P>
   The service, launched in late 1998, stumbled out of the starting
gate amid complaints about large clunky phones and prohibitive
prices -- as much as $3,000 per phone and up to $7 per minute for
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the phones and calls were cut sharply last summer,
but too late to restore customer confidence, especially with an
aggressive new rival named Globalstar introducing service in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a substantial issue as to whether there was a
sufficient market for satellite telephone service,'' said Joseph
Bondi, the chief restructuring officer for Iridium said. ''It just
hasn't been demonstrated there would be sufficient demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continuous uncertainty Iridium customers faced in
recent months, some who truly benefitted from the unique service of
a satellite telephone network were disappointed by Friday's news.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've actually sent the (Iridium) phones with some climbers
heading out on a plane tomorrow to Tibet,'' said Todd Tibbetts,
co-founder of MountainZone.com, a Web site that provides updates on
climbing expeditions up Mount Everest in Nepal and other major
peaks around the world. The climbers would use Iridium phones to
dictate stories and provide audio clips for the Web site, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Iridium phones have been great. The climbers would throw
them in their pockets and just take them out and make a call,''
said Tibbetts. Now they'll have to go back to using two-way radios
that are bigger, heavier and less reliable. ''We had this glimpse
of how things could be when Iridium was running.''

<HEADLINE> Landslide Kills 22 in Peru  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AYACUCHO, Peru (AP) -- A landslide of mud and rock swept through
an isolated hamlet in Peru's southern Andes, killing at least 22
villagers, authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred late Thursday when the rain soaked slopes
of a low-lying mountain ridge gave way, releasing an avalanche that
traveled more than a mile at high speed before striking the small
community of Uralla, 190 miles south of the capital, Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Civil defense teams rushed to the village Friday with medicine,
food and blankets for the survivors, said Ernesto Molina Chavez, a
regional government administrator in the highland city of
Huancavelica, 40 northwest of the community.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez told The Associated Press that 22 people were killed,
roughly half the campesinos who lived in the hamlet. The region's
peasant farmers typically cultivate small plots of potatoes and
corn and raise livestock, including hogs, llamas and alpacas.
</P>
<P>
   Landslides are common in Peru's high Andes during the rainy
season, which runs from October through March.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Air Mechanics Allege Pressure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Sixty-four mechanics at Alaska Airline's Seattle
maintenance hangar told company officials they'd been ''pressured,
threatened and intimidated'' to cut corners on repairs, prompting
the airline to put a top manager on leave while it investigates.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration and airline officials began
interviewing the mechanics after the airline told the agency about
the complaints, which came in a letter delivered to the carrier on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines also notified federal prosecutors and the
National Transportation Safety Board, which is probing the Jan. 31
crash of Alaska Flight 261 off the California coast in which 88
people died.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said in a statement nearly all major
components of the MD-80's tail section have been recovered and the
agency announced the completion of its field study.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also said investigators had found no grease on a crucial
portion of the jackscrew that helped control the movement of Flight
261's horizontal tail stabilizer, long a focus of the crash probe.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the plane's manufacturer said the part normally
should be lubricated, but he refused to speculate about what the
NTSB finding might mean.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Times reported on its Web site Friday that the
mechanics' letter was triggered by concerns over a recent repair to
the horizontal stabilizer and jackscrew assembly on an Alaska MD-80
jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics allege the plane was fixed properly only after
heated discussions.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman Mitch Barker said the agency was aware there had
been recent ''debate'' at Alaska Airlines over a horizontal
stabilizer repair. He said the plane was returned to service in
proper condition.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the letter by 64 mechanics quoted by the Times said
workers were ''directed ... to do things specifically
contradicting'' federal aviation regulations, and alleged they had
been ''pressured, threatened and intimidated ... in the daily
performance of our work.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Alaska Airlines said about 12 mechanics had been
interviewed and that it would immediately ground any planes found
to be potentially unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Falla, the leader of the airline's Seattle maintenance
base, was placed on administrative leave, the airline said. He
could not be reached by telephone. His lawyer predicted he would be
exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Robert Falla has never knowingly allowed any aircraft to go
into service that was not airworthy or (that) failed any safety
standard,'' said a statement from his lawyer, Scott J. Engelhard.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is already the subject of a criminal investigation
over alleged maintenance violations at its Oakland, Calif.,
maintenance base.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury in San Francisco is investigating whether
supervisors signed for repairs that weren't done or that they
weren't authorized to approve.

<HEADLINE> Slain Student's Parents in San Jose  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC NUNEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- The parents of a slain American
college student met with the Costa Rican investigators Friday to
discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to come down here, see for ourselves how she lived
and died,'' said Emily Eagan's father, Charles, after the session.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Eagen, of Ann Arbor, Mich., and her friend Emily
Howell, of Lexington, Ky., and were found by a roadside Monday in
the Caribbean coast town of Cahuita, about 90 miles east of San
Jose. Both were 19.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests have been made in the killings. Jorge Rojas, the
director of the country's Judicial Police, said about 20 agents
were working full-time on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lot hope in the case. I believe by the end of the
week or the start of the next one we could have an arrest,'' he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Eagen met with Rojas but gave no details of the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a difficult time for us,'' Eagen said in a brief
statement, asking reporters to leave the family alone.
</P>
<P>
   Eagen was accompanied by his wife, Shirley, their daughter Sarah
and the U.S. consul in San Jose, Janet Webber.
</P>
<P>
   Police still have no motive, though they have discarded robbery
as a reason for the killings. Investigators still haven't
determined if the women were sexually assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas said police had identified a man described as ''a
friend,'' who was seen late Sunday with the women. Rojas did not
say if the man was under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Two witnesses came forward with information on the burning of
the sports utility car the women were driving, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths have shocked this Central American country, whose
reputation for safety and stability in an otherwise turbulent
region has helped attract thousands of U.S. retirees, about $1
billion annually in tourism and more than 1 million tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Eagen said his daughter wrote her family back in Michigan
describing a country of ''friendly people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In her letters and e-mails, Emily always said how she loved
Costa Rica,'' he added.

Clinton Plans To Ease Fuel Prices

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials said today the president
is planning ''modest'' proposals to help ease high fuel prices but will make no
decision on drawing on the government's oil reserve until OPEC ministers meet
later this month. Clinton is expected to announce the additional measures as
part of his radio address tomorrow. No details were provided. Meanwhile, the
president appealed to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for a
''substantial production increase'' -- big enough to rebuild depleted reserves

make them more childproof. In exchange, governments would drop lawsuits seeking
damages for gun violence. The agreement, reached after two months of
negotiations involving the company, state and local officials and the Clinton
administration, establishes an unprecedented ''code of conduct'' for selling and
distributing handguns. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms
industry organization, condemned Smith &AMP; Wesson, saying it had ''violated a

over Gore in the presidential race, down from a 13-point Bush lead in the same

<HEADLINE> Life To Cease Monthly Publication  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The American magazine industry will lose one of
its oldest and best-known titles in May when Life publishes its
last monthly issue. Parent company Time Inc. will continue to put
out occasional issues for special events as well as books that
carry the Life brand, however.
</P>
<P>
   The decision marks the second time that Time Inc. has pulled the
plug on the magazine. Started as a weekly in 1936 by publishing
pioneer Henry Luce, who also founded Time and Fortune magazines,
Life was suspended from regular publication in 1972 and brought
back as a monthly in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   During the intervening years, it put out special issues such as
year-end collections of photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine had been ''modestly profitable'' for the past
several years, Time Inc. editorial director Henry Muller said
Friday. But poor growth prospects in coming years as well as the
need to reallocate resources to new magazines led to the decision
to retire Life from regular publication.
</P>
<P>
   Life's circulation has hovered around 1.6 million for the past
several years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ever since Life was relaunched, it's been a difficult business
proposition,'' Muller said. ''It was a general-interest magazine at
a time that most others were going toward special interests. It was
a magazine launched for nostalgic reasons rather than a clear
conception of who the audience for that magazine was.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Inc. has an aggressive program of magazine launches this
year, with four new titles: Real Simple for women; eCompany Now, a
technology and business publication; a large-print edition of Time;
and an Australian edition of InStyle, the celebrity gossip title.
</P>
<P>
   Muller also attributed the decision to suspend Life on recent
changes in the circulation industry, such as consolidation of
wholesalers, that put further pressure on the magazine's profits.
</P>
<P>
   A former publisher of the magazine, however, said Life began to
go downhill in the late 1980s with weaker editorial product and a
smaller format that robbed the magazine of its unique feel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't the terrific, elegant magazine it should have been
as a monthly,'' said Chuck Whittingham, who was publisher of the
magazine from 1978 to 1987. ''When they reduced the size, they made
a huge mistake. They didn't really follow the concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Life will live on as a publisher of books and special issues of
the magazine, which will come out to mark major events a few times
a year. The company also hopes to expand its Web site offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the loss of such a major fixture of the publishing scene
resonated with industry insiders, who bemoaned the demise of Life
as a regular publication.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had been looking a lot healthier,'' said Melissa Pordy,
the director of print advertising at Zenith Media Services Inc.
''They have such a strong franchise name and it's really
unfortunate that it couldn't sustain itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Inc., which also puts out Sports Illustrated, Money, People
and InStyle, is one of the largest magazine companies in the
nation. It is part of the Time Warner media conglomerate, which
agreed earlier this year to be acquired by America Online.

CN Upset With U.S. Moratorium on Proposed Rail Merger
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Canadian National Railway's ambitious plan to
merge with U.S. giant Burlington Northern Santa Fe received a
stunning setback Friday when the U.S. government ordered a
moratorium on all railway mergers for at least 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Surface Transportation Board issued the order following
hearings on the proposed $6-billion US merger of Texas-based BNSF
with Montreal-based CN, Canada's largest railway.
</P>
<P>
   CN reacted immediately, calling the ruling ''against the public
interest'' and said it has already filed an appeal with the U.S.
Court of Appeal in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of the Canadian and U.S. railways would have created
the largest North American railway with 80,000 kilometers of track
from Nova Scotia to Los Angeles and the Gulf of Mexico to
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. regulatory board said it wants to consider new rules
for such combinations, because the proposal came on the heels of a
string of U.S. mergers during the 1990s that caused rail car
shortages, shipping delays and depressed stock prices.

More Atlantic Natives Say They Will Defy Fishing Regulations
</P>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- An attempt to keep the peace in
Atlantic Canada's troubled fishery appeared to unravel further
Friday when some native bands threatened to make their own rules
for the impending season, rather than sign agreements with the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian Brook band in eastern Nova Scotia said it won't meet
with a federally appointed negotiator and will fish for lucrative
lobster without Ottawa's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   The defiance comes as James MacKenzie, hired by the federal
Department of Fisheries and Oceans to resolve the simmering
dispute, continues his sweep through the Maritimes in a bid to
reach deals with natives before the lobster season opens in May.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie is trying to persuade bands to sign agreements that
would allow them access to the commercial fishery while imposing
limits on what some natives say are untouchable treaty rights.
</P>
<P>
   Many say they don't need to negotiate since last year's Supreme
Court of Canada decision proved that Mi'kmaq and Maliseet people
have the right to earn a moderate livelihood from fishing, hunting
and gathering based on 18th-century treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Others charge that the negotiator is simply trying to woo
natives into compliance with promises of federal funding.

Children Killed in Crash of Vans Are Mourned
</P>
<P>
   ST-JEAN-BAPTISTE-DE-NICOLET, Quebec (AP) -- With seven white
roses, little Stephanie Madore remembered each of her playmates
killed in a horrific crash involving two minivans.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by her parents Friday, the five-year-old placed the
flowers and a drawing of her friends on orange wooden barricades
that replaced the metal guardrail strewn near Thursday's accident
scene.
</P>
<P>
   The young girl was just one of several people who passed by the
crash site either to look or lay flowers. Tears streamed down some
faces.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Auger, who ran the family day-care center, was driving
the minivan with the 10 children in tow when she lost control and
swerved into the opposite lane.
</P>
<P>
   She was broadsided by the driver of another minivan, sending her
vehicle over the guardrail and tossing many of the kids into a
nearby field. Her son was among the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Both Auger and the other driver, Wayne Kroeker, suffered minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A distraught Kroeker held a news conference at a hospital in
Nicolet to express his sympathy for the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   One of the surviving children remained in critical condition
Friday, while another was in stable condition. One child was sent
home Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Coroner Raynald Gauthier said Friday at least two of the
children were buckled up because their bodies had ''very definite
marks that they were wearing seat-belts.''
</P>
<P>
   Provincial police have said they will speak to Auger when she
recovers from shock.
</P>
<P>
   The funerals will likely be held early next week but the exact
day has not been set.

Accused Nazi Collaborator Given More Time To Answer Charges
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- An 80-year-old Montrealer, accused of joining a
murderous German-controlled police unit in 1941, will contest the
allegations -- but not for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Justice Department's war-crimes unit contends Walter
Obodzinsky lied by withholding information about his collaboration
with Nazi forces in his native Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Obodzinsky, a Canadian citizen since 1955, had been given until
Friday to challenge the allegations that he deliberately concealed
his role in war crimes and should be deported.
</P>
<P>
   But the deadline has been pushed back, Max Wolpert, the
war-crimes unit's acting deputy director, said in an interview from
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   He said the extension was granted after Obodzinsky's lawyer,
Johanne Doyon, said she wanted to use the right to question a
government representative before filing a defense statement.
</P>
<P>
   Obodzinsky is the first person to be prosecuted under new 1998
Federal Court rules, which allow a default judgment if no defense
is filed and if a judge finds the government's evidence is
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Wolpert said he expects Doyon to question a representative from
the Immigration Department in May and to file a statement of
defense the next month.

<HEADLINE> Taipei Mayor Mellows His Style  </HEADLINE>
By ANNIE HUANG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- As mayor of Taipei, Chen Shui-bian quickly
earned a reputation as a flamboyant corruption-buster, shaking up
the Taiwanese capital's lazy, inefficient government.
</P>
<P>
   He cleaned up the streets, shut down brothels and improved
traffic. But he was also criticized for pushing policies through
without gaining sufficient consensus, and was tossed out of office
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While his re-election bid went down in defeat, it gave Chen a
chance to fashion himself into a presidential candidate. He
mellowed his flamboyant style and nurtured the air of a more
tolerant leader.
</P>
<P>
   He also toned down his support for Taiwan independence, which
has in the past spooked many voters who feared it would lead to war
with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chen has said he would only move Taiwan toward
independence if Beijing attacks, his Democratic Progressive Party
still opposes reunification with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The DPP governs 70 percent of Taiwan on the local level with its
track record of fighting corruption -- which voters blame on the
Nationalists who have run Taiwan unchallenged for so long.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nationalists have controlled the president's office
since the island broke away from China amid civil war in 1949.
Taiwanese have been wary about letting the 13-year-old DPP take
control of state affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, who at 49 appears youthful and energetic, appeals to many
Taiwanese with his charisma and persistence, qualities he began to
display two decades ago as a defense lawyer for political
dissidents opposing the ruling Nationalists' repressive rule.
</P>
<P>
   Chen won key endorsements in the days before Saturday's
presidential election and began attracting large, enthusiastic
crowds at rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Born Feb. 18, 1951, Chen was the son of a poor sugar cane
laborer in southern Tainan County. After earning a law degree from
the elite Taiwan National University, he got involved in politics
defending political dissidents during Taiwan's martial law era,
which ended in 1987 after 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was jailed for eight months in 1986-87 for publishing a
dissident magazine. His wife, Wu Shu-jen, was run over three times
by a truck in what many believe was a politically motivated murder
attempt in 1985. Paralyzed from the waist down, she often appears
with Chen at rallies and is a close adviser.

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Gun Lawsuit To Proceed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A federal judge has ruled that the city of
Cleveland may proceed with its lawsuit against the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was issued Tuesday by U.S. District Court Judge
Donald C. Nugent, who rejected a gun-industry request to dismiss
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   James Dorr, an attorney representing the gun industry, said
Friday that no decision had been made whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the city sued gun makers to try to force the industry
to share the cost of police, ambulance and hospital services needed
because of gun-related violence.
</P>
<P>
   The industry said gun makers should not be held accountable for
criminal use of a legal product.

<HEADLINE> 2 Detained in Russia Car Bombing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Federal security agents detained two suspects in
connection to last fall's car-bombing that killed a St. Petersburg
city council member, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Oct. 20 blast killed Viktor Novoselov, who had been confined
to a wheelchair since losing his legs in an assassination attempt
several years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   No details were given about the arrests. Two other suspects have
been charged in the case.
</P>
<P>
   St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, has a high crime
rate. Killings that police describe as contract hits are frequent,
but rarely solved.

<HEADLINE> Parade Spotlights Giuliani, Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The green-clad marchers, bagpipe bands and hope
for peace in Northern Ireland took a back seat to politics Friday
at America's oldest and biggest St. Patrick's Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani basked in the adoration of the crowds,
while first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was taunted by shouts of
''Go back to Arkansas!'' as she walked along the Fifth Avenue
parade route.
</P>
<P>
   The 239th annual march was a key event for the likely opponents
for a U.S. Senate seat. Rudy posters and Hillary shamrock stickers
were as common as green hair and ''Kiss me, I'm Irish'' pins along
the route.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone liked the parade's political bent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's right,'' Jimmy Whelan, 67, of West Orange,
N.J. ''This is supposed to be a religious-based event more than
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 15 years, Cardinal John O'Connor did not
attend the festivities. The 80-year-old cardinal's health has been
failing since he underwent brain surgery last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization was banned from marching
under its banner for the 10th time. Before the parade began, 66 of
the group's members were arrested and charged with disorderly
conduct for marching without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   In Savannah, Ga., dark clouds gave way to sunshine in time for
the 176th St. Patrick's Day parade, where thousands lined the
streets of the coastal city famous for serving up green grits,
green eggs and -- of course -- green beer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just wall-to-wall people, I can tell you that,'' police
spokesman Bucky Burnsed said.
</P>
<P>
   The parade, which this year featured 300 entries, is the
nation's second largest after New York.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Mo., Jody Watson, who is in her 70s and known as
''the lone piper,'' led more than 200 groups in the city's 28th
annual parade. A 3-year-old girl was critically injured when she
fell off a float and was run over.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers estimated the crowd at about 500,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   The parade was brought to a halt at 13th and Grand by
matrimonial bliss. It was there that Whitney Hollon, 36, and Kevin
Albright, 35, were married by a county judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to get married, but Valentine's Day was too early
and anything later was too late ,'' Albright said. ''Her sister
said 'Why not the parade?'''

Taiwanese Begin Voting
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- As the three top candidates running to succeed
President Lee Teng-hui wrapped up their campaigns, the election on Saturday was
too close to call. But there was a very real possibility the ruling Nationalist
Party could lose the presidency for the first time since Taiwan was separated
politically from China in 1949. In order to stand a chance at the polls, Chen
Shui-bian, the candidate from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party has
had to back off from his party's independence stance. Chen said he would declare
independence only if China attacks.

Gunmaker Agrees To Install Locks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gunmaker Smith &AMP; Wesson agreed today to install locks on
its weapons to make them more childproof. The company also will devote 2 percent
of firearms revenues every year to developing ''smart'' technology that limits a
gun's use to its rightful owner. In exchange, governments would drop lawsuits
seeking damages for gun violence. The agreement was reached through negotiations
with state and local officials and the Clinton administration. The National
Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms industry organization, condemned Smith &AMP;
Wesson, saying it had violated a trust with consumers and the domestic firearms
industry.

DNA Changing Limitation Statutes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With DNA being used to solve crime after crime, some states
are extending or dropping the statute of limitations on prosecuting rape and
other violent offenses in case a genetic match that can prove who did it turns
up decades later. Such changes in the law challenge the legal tradition that
says prosecutors have to bring charges within a certain amount of time after the
crime -- a rule based on concern that evidence might get lost and witnesses
prove untrustworthy after many years have gone by.

Mozambique Food Shortages Feared
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- A U.N. agricultural expert said Friday that
thousands of Mozambican flood victims could face further hunger unless their
fields dry up enough for planting soon. Saturated soil and a shortage of seed
are threatening the start of the planting season, which traditionally begins in
early April. If the farmers can't plant, they'll miss the September harvest,
meaning they will be dependent of food aid until April 2001, the World Food
Program said last week.

by its engineers, one of the largest ever by white-collar workers. The tentative
three-year contract gave a surprising, resounding victory to the 13,000-member
Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, which won raises,
bonuses and extended health coverage. The union will vote on the contract on
Sunday, and the engineers and technical workers could be back on the job at the

<HEADLINE> New 'Exorcist' Gets Limited Release  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICIA M. LaHAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- More than 25 years after the horror movie
classic ''The Exorcist'' won Academy and Golden Globe awards, a new
version of the film was released Friday in three college towns as a
preview to its national release later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Exorcist -- The Version You've Never Seen'' will terrify a
new generation of moviegoers here and in Austin, Texas, and Ann
Arbor, Mich., with a full reel of material restored to director
William Friedkin's 1973 version.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw it once when I was young and I really liked it. It
scared the hell out of me,'' Isiah McPherson, 21, said while
waiting to buy tickets for himself and his girlfriend, Dana
Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the best-selling novel by William Peter Blatty, the
film graphically depicts the demonic possession of a 12-year-old
girl (Linda Blair) and the efforts by a priest (Max von Sydow) to
exorcise her demons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very scared,'' Stephens said. ''In fact, I've been trying
to get him to let me out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, Blatty said Friday that scaring movie-goers was
not his original intention.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I wrote the novel and also when I wrote the screenplay,
frightening people was not my primary intention. It was the
furthest thing from my mind,'' he told Atlanta radio station WSTR.
''I meant it as a supernatural detective story and a psychological
thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those waiting to see the movie at the Beechwood Stadium
11 theater Friday afternoon weren't even born when the film was
first released.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new scenes is an eerie depiction of the girl, Regan,
''spider walking'' down a flight of stairs upside down and chasing
two other characters, one of the few scenes that drew gasps from
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   An elaborate scene that required a contortionist stuntwoman held
aloft by a deep-sea fishing pole was left out of the film
originally, Friedkin said, because he feared audiences would not
accept something so bizarre at the beginning of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the version that the author first saw and has always
wanted,'' Friedkin said recently. ''The restored new footage -- plus
one or two little surprises -- make the film more suspenseful, as
well as spiritually deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's most famous scene, showing Regan's head spinning 180
degrees and projectile vomiting, originally astounded viewers but
drew laughs at Friday's showing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't as scared as I thought I would be,'' said Amanda
Janilus, 27, who attended Friday's screening but had never seen the
original.
</P>
<P>
   Blatty said he first saw the unedited version of the movie with
many of the scenes restored in this new release.
</P>
<P>
   ''It took my breath away,'' he said. ''I thought it was just
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Blatty said he and Friedkin have debated since the movie's
release whether some scenes cut for length should have been
restored.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months ago, after watching some of the outtakes, Friedken
finally admitted the lost scenes improved the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we left the building, on the Burbank lot, he laughed and
said 'Bill, after 26 years I am finally understanding what you were
trying to do with this movie,' '' Blatty said.
</P>
<P>
   The original film was a critical and a commercial success,
winning awards on at least two continents and becoming the second
biggest money-maker in American cinematic history, after the 1972
classic ''The Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Blatty won an Oscar for the screenplay and the film was awarded
a Golden Globe for best picture in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Official Had US Bank Account  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The top law enforcement official who
apparently committed suicide last week had a bank account in
California, in addition to $1.6 million already found in safe
deposit boxes, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexico City attorney general's office said it did not know
how much Juan Manuel Izabal Villicana had in his account at the
California Commerce Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Izabal, chief of the federal attorney general's
administrative branch, was found March 8 with a bullet wound to the
head and a pistol in his hand. His death occurred a day after bank
officials told him they accidentally had found $700,000 in his safe
deposit box and had notified authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In what officials described as suicide notes, Izabal said the
money was ''difficult to explain,'' though he insisted it wasn't
connected to drug trafficking. Izabal had administered finances at
the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Handwriting analyses of the notes confirmed that they had been
written by Izabal, the attorney general's office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After Izabal's death, two more safe deposit boxes in his name
were discovered. The three boxes contained a total of $1.625
million in cash and traveler's checks.

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Rich Parent made 34 saves as the
Tampa Bay Lightning extended their unbeaten streak to three Friday
night with a 3-1 victory over the New Jersey Devils, who clinched a
playoff spot despite the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Johnson, Fredrik Modin and Todd Warriner scored for Tampa

semi-breakaway at 2:58. Johnson beat Martin Brodeur with a high
shot to the glove side.
</P>
<P>
   Modin extended the Lightning lead to 2-0 at 3:27 of the second
period with an unassisted goal. Sergei Nemchinov turned the puck
over to Modin in the neutral zone. He made the Devils pay for the
mistake by drilling a wrist shot past Brodeur from the high slot.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils broke through against Parent at 7:55 of the second as
Lemieux knocked in a rebound of a Nemchinov shot.
</P>
<P>
   Parent held the Devils off in the third with 11 saves, including
a spectacular diving stop against Lemieux with 14 minutes
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Warriner sealed the win on a power-play goal with 39.4 seconds
remaining.

   PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) -- No. 8 Rutgers withstood a first-half
barrage from Anna Kinne and then blew the game open with a 26-4
second-half run in beating Holy Cross 91-70 in the first round of
the NCAA women's tournament on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Usha Gilmore had 14 points, Shawnetta Stewart 13 and Tasha
Pointer 11 as the second-seeded Scarlet Knights (23-7) advanced to
a matchup here on Sunday against 10th-seeded St. Joseph's (25-5),
which beat seventh-seeded Texas 69-48.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers' 21-point margin of victory doesn't show how much of a
scare the 15th-seeded Crusaders (23-7) and Kinne, who had 28
points, gave their Big East Conference opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot League player of the year, Kinne hit 6-of-7
3-pointers and scored 19 points in the first half in keeping Holy
Cross within 41-37. The spunky 5-foot-6 guard added only nine more
in a performance that even had Rutgers fans on their feet when she
left with about two minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights ended the Crusaders' upset hopes by turning
up the defense and scoring the first 12 points of the second half
to lead 53-37 with just over 15 minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Pointer had six points in the initial 12-0 spurt and eight in
the game-winning run. Gilmore added six and Stewart had four in the
run.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers hit 11 of its first 15 shots in the final 20 minutes.
Holy Cross made 2-of-9 from the field to start the second half and
had six turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights opened eight-point leads three times in the
first half, but each time Kinne hit a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanette Paukert added 15 points for Holy Cross.

<P>
   STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- All-American Shea Ralph had 20 points and
top-ranked Connecticut overpowered Hampton 116-45 in the NCAA East
Regionals Friday night, reaching triple digits for the eighth time
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton had trouble from the start running with the stronger,
faster and deeper Huskies, who matched a tournament record for most
points in a half with 65 in the first 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Pirates had just one player taller than 6 feet, and
UConn (31-1) ran off to a 25-4 lead, getting most of its points in
transition. Ralph had nine points in that run, all on breakaways.
She was one of six Huskies in double figures. UConn's reserves
contributed 52 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies had 39 points off 27 turnovers and finished with 17
steals. The taller Huskies easily dominated the boards 44-28.
All-American Svetlana Abrosimova and reserves Paige Sauer and
Tamika Williams had five rebounds apiece. Hampton's Felicia Bryant
had a game-high 10 boards.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-seeded Lady Pirates (16-15), winners of the Mid-Eastern
Athletic Conference tournament, were making their first appearance
in the tournament. The Huskies have made the last 12 NCAA
tournaments and won their only national title in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   LaShondra Dixon had 15 points and Kiandra Poteat scored 10 for
the Lady Pirates.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 110, Pistons 82  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COYNE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers avoided
another lackluster start and began a new winning streak Friday
night, holding the Detroit Pistons to their lowest point total of
the season in a 110-82 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal scored 35 points, including 19 in the second
half, Kobe Bryant rebounded from his worst performance of the
season with 25 points and Glen Rice added 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start at Washington on Thursday night cost them
their 19-game winning streak, the Lakers started the game Friday
night with a 5-0 spurt, took a 12-point lead early in the second
quarter, opened a 19-point lead in the third and never let the
Pistons back in it.
</P>
<P>
   The 82 points matched the Pistons' lowest scoring game of the
season, a 104-82 loss to Miami on Jan. 31. The Lakers have won
seven straight against Detroit at The Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The undersized Pistons had no one to stop the oversized O'Neal
as a trio of centers tried unsuccessful to push the 315-pound
center from under the basket. But even fouling did not help, as
O'Neal shot 5-of-7 at the line.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, coming off a season-low seven points against the
Wizards, scored 25 despite sitting out half of the second quarter
with three fouls. Rice scored all but two of his 19 points in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Stackhouse led the Pistons with 18 points on 4-of-16
shooting. The Pistons only shot 35.3 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Hill, who got in foul trouble early and sat out much of
the second quarter, scored only 12 points on 5-of-12 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Hill hit a 17-foot jumper at 12:43 of the second quarter to cut
the Pistons' deficit to 22-21. O'Neal then scored seven points
during a 14-3 run that gave the Lakers a 36-24 lead.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal started the run by converting a three-point play and
Bryant capped it with a 17-foot jumper.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers led 54-44 at the start of the second half and used a
9-2 run to open a 63-46 lead. O'Neal later converted another
three-point play to give the Lakers a 74-55 lead with 5:05 left in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Lakers are 18-1 in the second night of back-to-back
games. Entering Friday, the rest of the league was 181-260. ... The
last time the Lakers lost consecutive games was before the start of
their 19-game winning streak, losing to Houston and San Antonio.
... Jerome Williams played with a taped right shoulder because of
an elbow he received in Wednesday night's game against Orlando. ...
Wynonna Judd, who is performing at The Palace over the weekend with
her mother Naomi, sang the national anthem before the game.

<HEADLINE> No.5 Notre Dame 87, San Diego 61  </HEADLINE>
By JR ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Ruth Riley and Niele Ivey scored 14
points apiece as No. 5 Notre Dame beat San Diego 87-61 Friday night
in the first round of the women's NCAA tournament Mideast Regional.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (17-13) had no starter taller than 6 feet and couldn't
contend inside with Notre Dame's front court led by the 6-5 Riley.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish (26-4), wearing green on St. Patrick's Day rather than
their usual gold home uniforms, saw an 18-point lead slip to single
digits in the first half after some sloppy play. Notre Dame
maintained a 20-point lead most of the second half even though most
starters played sparingly in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Up 44-33 less than two minutes into the second half, the Irish
went on a 13-3 run punctuated by Danielle Green's floating finger
roll to go up 57-36 with 15:05 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Siemon scored 13 and Green had 12 as every player on the
Notre Dame roster scored.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish went up 31-13 11:00 into the game with Riley
dominating inside. The All-American hit her first six shots as the
Irish scored 22 points inside in the first half to San Diego's six.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Irish became sloppy, committing nine first-half
turnovers. They lost their double-digit lead twice in the closing
minutes of the first half before Siemon's putback at the buzzer
gave Notre Dame a 42-31 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Susie Erpelding scored 19 to lead the Toreros, who were
outrebounded 32-19. They also shot 19-of-49 (39 percent) while the
Irish were better than 63 percent (28-of-44).

<HEADLINE> Ky. Police Protest Chief's Dismissal  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CHAMBERS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Police took to the streets Friday in a
second protest of Mayor Dave Armstrong, who fired their chief for
approving awards of valor to officers who fatally shot an unarmed
car theft suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 people marched several blocks from the police union
hall to a park across from City Hall. Police from several
departments, along with supporters, carried signs that read
''Armstrong's wrong,'' and ''Support police not felons.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Gene Sherrard was fired March 2, the day after officers
Chris Horn and Paul Kinkade received medals for valor for their
role in the May shooting death of 18-year-old Desmond Rudolph as he
was attempting to flee in a stolen truck. Armstrong said the
commendations were ''insensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards to white officers who shot Rudolph, who was black,
prompted outrage in Louisville's black community, and protesters
picketed the police awards banquet.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Kinkade and Horn offered to return their awards to
the city in an effort to calm tension between Armstrong and police.
Three other officers who received awards but were not involved in
the controversial shooting said Friday they were returning theirs
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were given these medals with honor, and we now today would
like to return them because someone has tarnished these medals,''
officer D'Shawn Johnson said to the rally.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who is also white, had called on police to cancel
Friday's demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's only purpose is to divide,'' Armstrong said.

<HEADLINE> Passengers Subdue Man on Plane  </HEADLINE>
By KIM CURTIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A hulking, incoherent man muttering threats
and shedding his clothes broke through the locked cockpit door of
an Alaska Airlines jet, attacked the crew and lunged for the
controls before he was wrestled to the floor by terrified
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Police had no motive for Thursday night's attack on Flight 259,
which was making the same Mexico-to-San Francisco trip as an Alaska
Airlines jet that crashed in the Pacific in January, killing all 88
people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   A co-pilot using a fire ax fended off Peter L. Bradley, a
6-foot-2 carpenter weighing 250 pounds after Bradley screamed:
''I'm going to kill you'' as he grabbed for the controls, according
to an affidavit from FBI agent Margaret Eason.
</P>
<P>
   During the struggle, the pilot pleaded for help over the
intercom, and five to seven passengers sprang into action, tackling
Bradley and sitting on him while crew members put him in plastic
handcuffs and held him in a seat until the plane landed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fortunately all the guys moved quick and he ain't dead and
we're not dead,'' said passenger Robert Benjamin, 56, of West Linn,
Ore., who helped restrain Bradley. ''I was scared to death.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight was carrying 43 passengers and five crew members. The
co-pilot needed eight stitches to close a cut in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley appeared in court Friday with a black eye, cuts and
scratches on his face from the struggle. He had spent the night at
a hospital for observation and was in federal custody on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A judge ordered a psychological evaluation for Bradley and
scheduled a hearing for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 39, of Blue Springs, Mo., faces charges of interfering
with flight crew members and attendants. He could face up to 20
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not try to hijack the MD-83 jet but threatened to
kill people on board, the airline said. He threw his shoulder
against the locked cockpit door and broke it open 40 miles outside
of Monterey, Calif., authorities said
</P>
<P>
   He ''was going for the throttle and fuel controls,'' said police
Sgt. Joe Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't overemphasize the heroics that went on tonight,'' said
Reilly, referring to the passengers and crew. ''They averted a
tremendous disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Before breaking into the cockpit, Bradley had been roaming the
aisles, speaking nonsense and taking off his socks and his shirt,
Reilly said. He repeatedly switched seats, disobeying orders to
stay put.
</P>
<P>
   Eason's affidavit said Bradley pulled a folding pocket knife on
one passenger and asked: ''Do you want to kill me or something?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley eventually sat in first class, where, Reilly said, he
made this threat: ''I'm going to kill all of you. Keep away from
me,'' while simulating the shape of a gun with his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot had been called out of the cockpit at one point to
help the crew with Bradley, but he became more agitated, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin crew ''really were helpless against this guy,''
Benjamin's wife, Donnie.
</P>
<P>
   ''What really scared me was when he tried to open up an exit,''
said Chris Honochick, 37, a 225-pound former college football
player from Salem, Ore., who helped subdue the man.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley stormed the cockpit, the plane took a sudden dip,
passengers said. Honochick wrenched the man backward and they both
toppled into the aisle, where Benjamin and at least three other men
climbed on top in a gang tackle that put almost half a ton of
muscle to work to subdue him.
</P>
<P>
   With all that weight on top of him, Bradley passed out for a
moment and his feet and hands were lashed with plastic ties while
Honochick kept him in a wrestling hold, the passengers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't about to let go,'' Honochick said. ''Not until we had
this guy so he couldn't move.''
</P>
<P>
   The men put him in a chair and surrounded him as the pilot
finished the descent to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Missouri said they have no record of problems with
Bradley other than two traffic violations in 1979, when he
apparently moved to Blue Springs. The citations were not drug- or
alcohol-related.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's public defender, Ron Tyler, said Bradley has no
history of substance abuse or psychiatric problems. Neighbors said
he has a wife and a teen-age son. Both were en route to the San
Francisco Bay area Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd characterize him as a laid-back kind of guy. I never saw
any behavior that would make me think otherwise,'' said Earl
Anderson, a neighbor in their working-class neighborhood in the
Kansas City suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Magistrate Bernard Zimmerman put off concluding Bradley's
arraignment until he had more information.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a rather puzzling and bizarre incident and without
knowing why it happened I have to be concerned that it may happen
again,'' Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   After a delay to gather evidence, the flight continued to
Portland, Ore., arriving just two hours late.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third incident this year involving the same Alaska
Airlines route. On Feb. 7, sparks flew from one of the engines of a
plane leaving San Francisco after arriving from Puerto Vallarta. No
one was injured.

<HEADLINE> Taiwanese Begin Voting  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwanese could shake the delicate status
quo that has preserved peace between China and Taiwan in a vote
Saturday that will give them an untested leader facing growing
pressure to negotiate with a bellicose Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The race to succeed President Lee Teng-hui was too close to call
as the three top candidates wrapped up their campaigns Friday night
to the sounds of blaring air horns, fireworks and deafening
applause.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a very real possibility the ruling Nationalist
Party could lose the presidency for the first time since Taiwan was
separated politically from China when communist forces captured the
mainland in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   When polls opened at 8 a.m. local time Saturday, the retiring
Lee was among the first of Taiwan's 15 million eligible voters to
cast his ballot. People began lining up early for the election,
which was expected to attract a large turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Under overcast skies, Lee's chosen successor, Vice President
Lien Chan, told reporters at a Taipei poll that he was confident of
a win.
</P>
<P>
   ''The weather is very good. The election turnout should be
great,'' Lien said.
</P>
<P>
   After voting at a Taipei elementary school, Chen Shui-bian of
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party told reporters that he
would immediately pursue talks with Chinese leaders, who have made
it clear they dislike him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Permanent peace in the Taiwan Strait is going to be our
biggest goal,'' Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   With a hoarse, raspy voice, Chen campaigned close to midnight
Friday, addressing a rally of about 400,000 supporters in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most important time for the democratic movement
and isn't it the most beautiful time indeed?'' said Chen, whose DPP
party has ruffled Beijing by advocating independence for the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has had to back off from his party's independence stance to
stand a chance at the polls, saying he would declare independence
only if China attacks. But in remarks clearly aimed at Chen,
Beijing has loudly warned any such step would lead to war.
</P>
<P>
   Chen saw his potential opening when the Nationalists split,
kicking out party star James Soong after he mounted an independent
candidacy instead of supporting Lien.
</P>
<P>
   The three top candidates were in a statistical dead heat last
week when a government ban on releasing poll results went into
effect. But as the race wound down, Chen built momentum and picked
up key endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Chen took pains to show he, too, will try to deal with China
rather than lead Taiwan and China into a war that analysts say
neither side can really afford as their economies become more
closely intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   Bi-khim Hsiao, a Chen spokeswoman, said that Chinese
individuals, whom she would not identify, had been meeting with
party officials recently, preparing for a possible Chen victory.
Some seemed genuinely interested in the party's views, while others
simply delivered anti-independence lectures, Hsiao said.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of Taiwan's second direct presidential election will
replace Lee, who during 12 years in office has often been an
irritant to Beijing but became more so last summer on his
insistence the two sides deal with one another on a
''state-to-state'' basis.
</P>
<P>
   China views Taiwan as a renegade province that must someday
reunify with the mainland, by force if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji sought to sway Taiwanese
voters by indicating that if they pick Chen, Taiwan could find
itself on the brink of war.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's language was harsh, but nothing like Beijing's response to
Taiwan's 1996 election, when China fired nuclear-capable missiles
near the island's two major ports. The United States sent in
warships to cool tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists also sought to portray Chen, a former Taipei
mayor, as an unstable threat to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Using Chen's nickname, Lee warned some 80,000 supporters Friday
night: ''Abian has no experience. You can't depend on him. He's too
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The divided Nationalists fielded a lackluster candidate in Lien,
a long-serving politician and academic who had problems developing
rapport with many ordinary Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing wants Taiwan to rejoin the motherland under a so-called
''one country, two systems,'' model China used as it reclaimed
financial center Hong Kong from Britain in 1997 and the gambling
enclave of Macau from Portugal last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Washington has hinted it would defend Taiwan from a
Chinese attack, the United States recognizes Beijing as the
legitimate government of China and says it wants peaceful
reunification achieved through negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday in Tokyo that
both sides should end their ''war of words'' that often has
threatened to destabilize Asia.

Smith &AMP; Wesson To Make Guns Safer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gunmaker Smith &AMP; Wesson agreed today to make its weapons
more childproof by including safety locks with all of its handguns and pistols.
The company also will devote 2 percent of firearms revenues every year to
developing ''smart'' technology that limits a gun's use to its rightful owner.
In exchange, governments would drop lawsuits seeking damages for gun violence.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms industry organization,
condemned Smith &AMP; Wesson, saying it had violated a trust with consumers and the
domestic firearms industry.

Bush Attacks Gore on Education
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ST. CHARLES, Ill. (AP) -- Taking aim at Al Gore, George W. Bush is kicking
off the general election ad wars with a TV spot that is sharply critical of the
Clinton administration's education record. The ad also touts Bush's record in
Texas on education and his goals for the presidency. Gore's ad hits right back.
''George W. Bush -- from South Carolina to New York he used dirty politics to
trash John McCain's record. Now he's running attack ads against Al Gore,'' the
ad says.

Taiwan's Presidential Voting Begins
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- As the three top candidates running to succeed
President Lee Teng-hui wrapped up their campaigns, the election on Saturday was
too close to call. The ruling Nationalist Party could lose the presidency for
the first time since Taiwan was separated politically from China in 1949. Chen
Shui-bian, the candidate from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party has
had to back off from his party's independence stance in order to stand a chance
at the polls. Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji this week sought to sway Taiwanese
voters by indicating that if they pick Chen, Taiwan could find itself on the
brink of war.

DNA Changing Limitation Statutes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With DNA being used to solve crime after crime, some states
are extending or dropping the statute of limitations on prosecuting rape and
other violent offenses in case a genetic match that can prove who did it turns
up decades later. Such changes in the law challenge the legal tradition that
says prosecutors have to bring charges within a certain amount of time after the
crime -- a rule based on concern that evidence might get lost and witnesses
prove untrustworthy after many years have gone by.

Mozambique Food Shortages Feared
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- A U.N. agricultural expert said Friday that
thousands of Mozambican flood victims could face further hunger unless their
fields dry up enough for planting soon. Saturated soil and a shortage of seed
are threatening the start of the planting season, which traditionally begins in
early April. If the farmers can't plant, they'll miss the September harvest,
meaning they will be dependent of food aid until April 2001, the World Food
Program said last week.

High-Tech Visa Allotment Exhausted
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It took less than half the fiscal year to exhaust the
annual allotment of visas for skilled foreign professionals, the government said
today. The announcement likely boosts the prospects for congressional action
temporarily raising the ceiling on the visa program. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service, given authority by Congress to dole out 115,000 H-1B
visas for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, said it already has handed out
74,300 visas and has more than 45,000 petitions pending.

Roy Henderson:
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Roy Henderson, a baritone famed for his
performances of Frederick Delius' works and a teacher of Kathleen
Ferrier, died Thursday. He was 100.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson learned to sing while serving with the Artists Rifles
during World War I.
</P>
<P>
   He studied at the Royal Academy of Music, and got his first
major break in 1925 in a performance of Delius' ''Mass of Life,''
which he sang at short notice at a Royal Philharmonic concert.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, Henderson was regarded as the ideal Delius
baritone. He sang on the first recording of Delius' ''Sea Drift''
and in the premiere of ''Idyll.''
</P>
<P>
   He also performed all the Elgar oratorios and choral works, and
sang Count Almaviva in ''The Marriage of Figaro'' at the 1934
opening night of the Glyndebourne summer opera festival.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's last singing performance was on March 29, 1952 in
the role of Christus in Bach's ''St. Matthew Passion'' at Southwark
Cathedral, the Anglican cathedral on the south bank of the Thames
in London.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson met Ferrier in 1942,and she later asked Henderson to
teach her. She went on to become one of Britain's renowned voices
of the century.
Sonny Hine:
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Sonny Hine, who owned and trained Skip Away, winner
of the 1997 Breeders' Cup Classic and the 1998 Horse of the Year,
died Friday of cancer. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Hine had been training thoroughbreds since 1948 including Guilty
Conscience, Technology, Skip Trial, Norquestor, Dawn Quixote, Amber
Pass, Chip, Patton, Bet Big and Cojak.
</P>
<P>
   But his best horse was Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 3-year-old Skip Away finished second in the Preakness
and Belmont Stakes before winning the Jockey Gold Cup over Cigar, a
two-time Horse of the Year who won 16 consecutive races.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the Breeders' Cup the following year, he won the
Pimlico Special, Hollywood Gold Cup, Woodward Stakes and Donn
Handicap in 1998. Skip Away retired with career earnings of $9.8
million, second only to Cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Hine also worked as a fingerprint specialist for the FBI and
later as a State Department investigator in Hong Kong during the
Korean War. He was fluent in the Chinese dialect of Mandarin, and
intercepted and translated messages during the war.
Charlie Holt:
</P>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- Charlie Holt, who took New Hampshire's

</P>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Choreographer and award-winning entertainer
Fred Kelly, who taught his famed older brother, Gene Kelly, to tap
dance, died Wednesday of cancer. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly won three Tony Awards for his lead Broadway performance in
''Time of Your Life'' in 1940. He was also a dance instructor whose
students included Queen Elizabeth and John Travolta. He taught the
queen how to dance and Travolta how to strut.
</P>
<P>

could help teach classes in their mother's dance studio. During the
Depression, he earned money by performing in talent shows.
</P>

television in the early 1950s and directed ''The Steve Allen
Show.'' He opened a dance studio in 1955 in Oradell, N.J., and also
joined the faculty of Pace University that year, where he remained
a dance instructor for 24 years. During that time he also
choreographed the Ice Capades.
</P>

Lothrop Worth:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lothrop Worth, a cinematographer whose career
stretched from the silent era to the 3-D craze of the 1950s, died
on Thursday at the Motion Picture &AMP; Television Hospital. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Melrose, Mass., Worth started his career as a still
photographer in the late 1920s but quickly moved into motion
pictures, working as a camera operator and cinematographer.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most remembered films was the 1957 cult hit, ''I Was
a Teenage Frankenstein.''
</P>
<P>
   He also worked with many of the biggest stars of his time,
including Orson Welles, Gary Cooper and James Cagney.
</P>
<P>
   Lothrop and his late wife, Jean, were also charitable donors to
the motion picture hospital, where a wing was dedicated in their
honor in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he gave 150 television sets to the retirement home in
memory of his wife. In January, he helped fund a new medicine
program at the hospital.

daredevil and stunt rider who turned in her spurs to become a
foster mother, died on Sunday. She was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Yurkiewicz, who rode Brahma bulls, gave sharpshooting
demonstrations and had knives thrown at her, performed as Dot Cole
in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, Yurkiewicz ran off with her 16-year-old rodeo cowboy
lover, Ted Cole, whom she later married. Together, they toured with
the Milt Hinkle Texas Rangers Rodeo, the Sons of the Pioneers and
the Roy Rogers rodeo companies.
</P>
<P>
   She made her mark as the first woman to ride a Brahma bull in a
national rodeo, according to the Women's Professional Rodeo
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Performing with Cole, she would be tied to a rotating wheel
while he threw knives at her. But she always insisted that he have
a couple of drinks first.
</P>
<P>
   She had five children and raised 32 foster children after moving
to Union Beach. She taught her children rope tricks, yodeling,
songs and other acts.

<HEADLINE> 76ers' Iverson Returns To Lineup  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson served his suspension, even if
he didn't learn a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   One after after sitting out the 76ers' loss to the Miami Heat on
Thursday night after missing the morning shootaround, Iverson
returned to the lineup and had 24 points and nine assists to lead
the Sixers to a 99-97 victory over the Utah Jazz on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, who reacted angrily to the suspension and said he felt
''betrayed'' Thursday night, wasn't entirely remorseful after
Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe I'll do it again, maybe I won't,'' said Iverson, who was
booed upon his introduction Friday. ''If I'm sick, I'll call in to
say I can't make it. I'm gonna do what's best for Allen Iverson's
health and I'll definitely think of my teammates when I make the
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson maintained that a headache is a good enough excuse to
miss practice. He reportedly hosted a party at a South Beach
nightspot the night before the Miami game.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I don't feel well, I don't feel well,'' he said. ''Maybe my
headaches are different than yours. I felt it could've been handled
another way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixers coach Larry Brown said he hopes the matter has been
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope there's closure to it and it's over,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson has had several problems with the Sixers during his
four-year career, and this suspension was a culmination of a series
of missed practices. Iverson has missed practices this season for
reasons ranging from a snowstorm to his daughter's illness.
</P>
<P>
   ''The suspension wasn't just about one practice,'' Brown said.
''I should have handled it sooner. You can't have rules for one guy
and rules for the rest of the team. You have to care enough about
each player to be on time, to get to practice and be responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson said he called the team trainer, took two ibuprofen and
went back to sleep on Thursday morning instead of attending
practice.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Billy King said he called Iverson's room shortly
thereafter, but there was no answer.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't talk about the other incidents, people will look
at you like you're crazy,'' Iverson said. ''If you just go on this
one incident, you look bad. You have to throw the other part into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, 24, was suspended for a game once before when he missed
a practice in New York three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Iverson lashed out at Brown after being benched for
the final 20 minutes of a loss at Detroit. Iverson said then he
should be traded if Brown was unhappy with him.
</P>
<P>
   Team president Pat Croce said the latest incident is over.
</P>
<P>
   ''Allen is smart enough to learn from these episodes,'' Croce
said. ''Every family has squabbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Croce said he was ''stunned'' to hear Iverson say he felt
betrayed by the suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked him, 'What do you mean betrayed by the franchise? I am
the franchise,''' Croce said. ''He said 'I didn't mean you.' I
think that was Allen just being defensive.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Iverson is the only player he has suspended in his 28
years of coaching. Brown, 59, appeared fed up with the entire
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a team to worry about, not just one guy to cater to,''
Brown said. ''I just want to coach, not worry about guys being
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson's teammates said the incident is behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he means anything by his mistakes,'' Matt Geiger
said. ''A mistake is only a mistake if you do it twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Snow, who has been critical of Iverson in the past, said,
''I hope we're mature and professional enough to let these things
pass us by.''

<HEADLINE> Bomb Threat Evacuates French Theater  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Police evacuated a theater where the Vienna
Philharmonic orchestra was performing Friday after receiving a bomb
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Music-lovers and musicians had to leave the Theatre des
Champs-Elysees halfway through the program of music by Brahms but
they were allowed back some 30 minutes later after police searched
the theater and declared it safe.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not give any further details of the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Before the concert began, the audience was given leaflets in
which the orchestra distanced itself from ''racist'' remarks of
Austria's far-right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   The arts in Austria have become embroiled in the controversy
surrounding the entry of the Freedom Party into the country's
governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Austria has been politically isolated in Europe since the
Freedom Party, formerly headed by Joerg Haider, entered the
coalition government in February.
</P>
<P>
   The outrage stems from Haider's opposition to immigration and
rapid European Union expansion, as well as previous statements
praising some Nazi policies. He has since apologized for those
comments.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Release Isaiah Rider  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Isaiah Rider was released by the Atlanta Hawks on
Friday night after he refused to accept a three-game suspension for
showing up late for a game.
</P>
<P>
   Rider called himself the scapegoat for the Hawks' problems and
accused two of his teammates, Dikembe Mutombo and LaPhonso Ellis,
of going to team management with allegations of marijuana abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not fun to be with a team that doesn't want you around
and is looking for a reason to get rid of you,'' said Rider, who
led the Hawks in scoring but had been used sparingly since he
showed up late for a March 9 game against San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Rider, who has continually run afoul of team rules since he was
acquired from Portland in August, was told after the last incident
that he would be suspended for three games if he was late again.
</P>
<P>
   When he showed up 10 minutes late for Friday night's game
against Boston, general manager Pete Babcock told Rider he couldn't
play.
</P>
<P>
   The two talked in the tunnel leading to the court for most of
the third quarter. Rider turned down the three-game suspension and
asked to be waived. The Hawks complied.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was an experiment that didn't work,'' Babcock said after
a 114-90 loss to the Celtics dropped the Hawks to 24-40.
</P>
<P>
   Rider claimed that Mutombo and Ellis went to Babcock a couple of
months ago with allegations of drug use. Babcock, according to
Rider, reported the charges to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone wonders why I was moody at times,'' said Rider, who
was convicted of misdemeanor marijuana possession when he played
with the Portland Trail Blazers. ''I had to deal with players going
to the league with accusations that were unproven or anything.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had not seen anything. They had not smelled anything. It
was just a vicious attack on J.R.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo and Ellis denied Rider's version of events.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know anything about that,'' Ellis said. ''I've always
treated my teammates like brothers. Everything stays within the
family. If I had a problem with him, I would go to him. It's just
sad that he would accuse me of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Mutombo, ''Somebody has got to be blamed. I'm glad it was
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks refused to criticize Rider, with Babcock going to far
as to say ''we failed him as far as providing the kind of
environment he was looking for.'' But there was clearly a sense of
relief that Rider wouldn't be around to cause any more
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a great guy, but he's different,'' Mutombo said. ''That's
the only way to describe him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider had played sparingly since the San Antonio incident,
averaging 2.8 points and 11.3 minutes in four games. In a loss to
Indiana on Wednesday night, he scored one basket in seven minutes
and spent the rest of the night at the end of the bench. At one
point, he clapped along with a small contingent of fans who
chanted, ''We want Rider!''
</P>
<P>
   Rider, who was averaging 19.3 points per game, already had been
suspended twice by the Hawks and fined repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   He has complained about playing for a team in a rebuilding mode
and said last month he didn't mind getting released by the Hawks if
they couldn't work out a trade. The deadline passed without a deal,
but the team was reluctant to cut Rider loose in hopes of working
out a sign-and-trade deal after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Rider is making $5.4 million in the final year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old guard came to the Hawks in August along with Jim
Jackson in a deal that sent Steve Smith, one of the NBA's most
reliable players, to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Rider created trouble right away, missing the opening day of
training camp. He was excused from the team's Nov. 2 opener so he
could attend his grandfather's funeral, but then failed to return
for practice and was fined.
</P>
<P>
   Rider was suspended for one game after he missed practice the
day before a Nov. 18 game against Charlotte, saying his car had
been vandalized. Babcock noted at the time that Rider did not need
a car to get to Philips Arena, which is located a short walk from
his hotel.
</P>
<P>
   He was suspended again Dec. 30 for missing a team flight and
shootaround prior to a loss at Detroit. Rider showed up about an
hour before the game, refused to explain his absence to the media
and was banned from the team's flight home.
</P>
<P>
   His history of NBA offenses dates back to his first pro practice
with the Minnesota Timberwolves in 1993, when he showed up late.
Other problems have included feuds with coaches and a conviction
for assault.

<HEADLINE> Bank One cutting 5,100 Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Bank One Corp. is cutting 5,100 jobs in its
credit card, consumer lending and staff services divisions, the
company said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts represent about 6 percent of the company's work
force, said spokesman Tom Kelly. The company had warned of the job
cuts in January but had not made public the number, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago-based Bank One, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, disclosed
the cuts in its annual report filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said more than half of the jobs have been cut since
January through elimination or attrition, and the rest will be cut
over the next year. Many of the employees will find jobs in other
areas of the company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the cuts were focused in the credit card, consumer
lending and staff units so the company can concentrate on its
primary markets in 14 states.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One earlier this month announced that ''weak''
first-quarter earnings may fall below analysts' expectations. The
bank's problems stem from its First USA unit, the nation's No. 2
issuer of credit cards behind Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock has fallen by more than half since the announcement
last August that First USA's once-soaring growth had fallen off,
the victim of squeezed profit margins and issuing too many
low-interest cards.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 of the eliminated jobs were in the credit card
division.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One shares fell [ to 27| on the New York Stock Exchange on
Friday.

<HEADLINE> No.12 Miss St 94, Saint Peter's 60  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- LaToya Thomas had 26 points and 15 rebounds,
and Angela Harris had 17 points as No. 12 Mississippi State routed
Saint Peter's 94-60 Friday night in the first round of the women's
NCAA tournament West Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Fambrough added 16 points and nine rebounds for the
third- seeded Lady Bulldogs (24-7), making just the second NCAA
tournament appearance in the program's 26-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Wicks scored 18 points to lead Saint Peter's (23-8).
</P>
<P>
   The 14th-seeded Peahens, who won the Metro Atlantic Athletic
Conference tournament, led 14-13 seven minutes into the game and
were tied at 16 before Mississippi State went on a 15-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a 6-foot-2 freshman who was the MVP of the Southeast
Conference tournament, scored seven points during the run, all in
the paint, and Harris had two 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Bulldogs led 41-29 at halftime and quickly pushed the

<HEADLINE> Former Texas Hoops Coach Sued  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Former Texas men's assistant basketball
coach Eddie Oran filed suit Friday against his former boss, coach
Tom Penders, alleging libel and slander.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges Penders made libelous and slanderous remarks
against Oran in the aftermath of the release of a player's grades
in 1998 to a local radio station, according to papers filed late
Friday in Travis County state district court.
</P>
<P>
   Oran seeks unspecified damages for loss of income, loss of his
employment at Texas, personal humiliation and mental anguish and
suffering, according to a report for Saturday's editions of the
Austin American-Statesman. Also cited in the suit was the loss of
an opportunity to regain a position as an assistant or head
basketball coach on the major-college level in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Oran now works for an Austin-area automobile dealership.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the grades of former Texas player Luke Axtell were
released to KVET-AM in violation of the Buckley Amendment, which
protects a student's constitutional right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Axtell, who now attends Kansas, filed suit against Capstar Texas
Limited Partnership, the parent company of KVET-AM. In statements
taken under oath in the Axtell suit, Oran said he took the blame
for the release of the grades to protect Penders.
</P>
<P>
   Oran was disciplined and lost a week's salary. When Penders
resigned after taking a settlement from the university, Oran was
not retained by new coach Rick Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no knowledge of anything,'' Penders, now the coach at
George Washington, said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Although he initially took responsibility for releasing Axtell's
grades to KVET, Oran testified under oath at his deposition that he
was merely carrying out the orders of Penders by instructing the
basketball secretary to fax the report.
</P>
<P>
   Oran's suit claims that, in the days surrounding the release of
the deposition transcripts, Penders made libelous statements to two
newspapers and a radio station and also made slanderous statements
to county residents as well as people in the basketball coaching
fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Axtell filed suit against Texas, Penders,
Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds and Capstar Texas Limited
Partnership. Oran was not named in that suit.

<HEADLINE> Man Breaks Into Plane's Cockpit  </HEADLINE>
By KIM CURTIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A hulking, incoherent man muttering threats
and shedding his clothes broke through the locked cockpit door of
an Alaska Airlines jet, attacked the crew and lunged for the
controls before he was wrestled to the floor by terrified
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Police had no motive for Thursday night's attack on Flight 259,
which was making the same Mexico-to-San Francisco trip as an Alaska
Airlines jet that crashed in the Pacific in January, killing all 88
people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   A co-pilot using a fire ax fended off Peter L. Bradley, a
6-foot-2 carpenter weighing 250 pounds after Bradley screamed:
''I'm going to kill you'' as he grabbed for the controls, according
to an affidavit from FBI agent Margaret Eason.
</P>
<P>
   During the struggle, the pilot pleaded for help over the
intercom, and five to seven passengers sprang into action, tackling
Bradley and sitting on him while crew members put him in plastic
handcuffs and held him in a seat until the plane landed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fortunately all the guys moved quick and he ain't dead and
we're not dead,'' said passenger Robert Benjamin, 56, of West Linn,
Ore., who helped restrain Bradley. ''I was scared to death.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight was carrying 43 passengers and five crew members. The
co-pilot needed eight stitches to close a cut in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley appeared in court Friday with a black eye, cuts and
scratches on his face from the struggle. He had spent the night at
a hospital for observation and was in federal custody on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A judge ordered a psychological evaluation for Bradley and
scheduled a hearing for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 39, of Blue Springs, Mo., faces a charge of interfering
with flight crew members and attendants. He could face up to 20
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not try to hijack the MD-83 jet but threatened to
kill people on board, the airline said. He threw his shoulder
against the locked cockpit door and broke it open 40 miles outside
of Monterey, Calif., authorities said
</P>
<P>
   He ''was going for the throttle and fuel controls,'' said police
Sgt. Joe Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't overemphasize the heroics that went on tonight,'' said
Reilly, referring to the passengers and crew. ''They averted a
tremendous disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Before breaking into the cockpit, Bradley had been roaming the
aisles, speaking nonsense and taking off his socks and his shirt,
Reilly said. He repeatedly switched seats, disobeying orders to
stay put.
</P>
<P>
   Eason's affidavit said Bradley pulled a folding pocket knife on
one passenger and asked: ''Do you want to kill me or something?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley eventually sat in first class, where, Reilly said, he
made this threat: ''I'm going to kill all of you. Keep away from
me,'' while simulating the shape of a gun with his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot had been called out of the cockpit at one point to
help the crew with Bradley, but he became more agitated, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin crew ''really were helpless against this guy,''
Benjamin's wife, Donnie.
</P>
<P>
   ''What really scared me was when he tried to open up an exit,''
said Chris Honochick, 37, a 225-pound former college football
player from Salem, Ore., who helped subdue the man.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley stormed the cockpit, the plane took a sudden dip,
passengers said. Honochick wrenched the man backward and they both
toppled into the aisle, where Benjamin and at least three other men
climbed on top in a gang tackle that put almost half a ton of
muscle to work to subdue him.
</P>
<P>
   With all that weight on top of him, Bradley passed out for a
moment and his feet and hands were lashed with plastic ties while
Honochick kept him in a wrestling hold, the passengers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't about to let go,'' Honochick said. ''Not until we had
this guy so he couldn't move.''
</P>
<P>
   The men put him in a chair and surrounded him as the pilot
finished the descent to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Missouri said they have no record of problems with
Bradley other than two traffic violations in 1979, when he
apparently moved to Blue Springs. The citations were not drug- or
alcohol-related.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's public defender, Ron Tyler, said Bradley has no
history of substance abuse or psychiatric problems. Neighbors said
he has a wife and a teen-age son. Both were en route to the San
Francisco Bay area Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd characterize him as a laid-back kind of guy. I never saw
any behavior that would make me think otherwise,'' said Earl
Anderson, a neighbor in their working-class neighborhood in the
Kansas City suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Magistrate Bernard Zimmerman put off concluding Bradley's
arraignment until he had more information.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a rather puzzling and bizarre incident and without
knowing why it happened I have to be concerned that it may happen
again,'' Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   After a delay to gather evidence, the flight continued to
Portland, Ore., arriving just two hours late.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third incident this year involving the same Alaska
Airlines route. On Feb. 7, sparks flew from one of the engines of a
plane leaving San Francisco after arriving from Puerto Vallarta. No
one was injured.

<HEADLINE> Hearst To Sell Examiner Newspaper  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL WARREN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Hearst Corp. sold the San Francisco
Examiner to the owners of a free city newspaper on Friday, clearing
the way for Hearst's purchase of its century-long rival, the San
Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is expected to meet Justice Department approval,
gives Hearst control of the city's dominant newspaper and ends a
joint operating agreement in which the two papers have split
profits 50-50 for the last 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our deal today is the fulfillment of a dream for my family,
for myself, for my late father,'' said Ted Fang, who will be the
publisher of the new Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Fang said he would switch the Examiner back to mornings when the
two papers become fully independent in August, after a four-month
transition period, and compete head-to-head with the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hearst nor Fang would disclose the sale price, or say
whether some profit-sharing agreement was part of the deal. Hearst,
which is buying the Chronicle for $660 million, said it would make
a ''substantial financial commitment to the continued publication
of the Examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale is expected to close by March 30, but it will be
''business as usual'' for the next four months, Examiner Publisher
and CEO Tim White told a crowd of reporters and editors in the
paper's newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 600 reporters and editors at the Chronicle and
Examiner, as well as employees of the San Francisco Newspaper
Agency, which oversees the joint operating agreement, will continue
working for the Hearst Corp. under the deal. No employees will be
required to work for the new owners.
</P>
<P>
   The sale does not include the Examiner's building or printing
presses. Fang said he will secure new offices in downtown San
Francisco, and will either print the paper on the presses used by
his San Francisco Independent or secure more capacity elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also includes the Examiner's library, computer system,
delivery trucks and newsracks, as well as www.examiner.com, the
Sunday Examiner magazine and sponsorship of ''Bay to Breakers,'' a
footrace that draws tens of thousands of runners each May.
</P>
<P>
   But finding staffers able to compete against Hearst could be a
problem for Fang, whose Independent newspaper has been attacking
the Hearst Corp. for months, even running cartoons lampooning
Examiner Executive Editor Phil Bronstein and his wife, actress
Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein said it was too early to tell how many current
Examiner newsroom employees would work for the Fang-owned Examiner.
''I have no idea,'' Bronstein said. ''Not a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Fang said he would pay well for top talent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We plan to commence an aggressive search locally and
nationwide to put together a new staff for the new Examiner,'' he
said. ''We're looking for people who want to make history in this
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Fang said his father, John T.C. Fang, fled Communist China and
arrived in San Francisco with $200 in his pocket in the 1950s.
Along with his brothers James and Douglas, Ted Fang will now run
the nation's largest minority-owned daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second major newspaper deal announced this week. On
Monday, the Tribune Co., publisher of the Chicago Tribune,
announced it was acquiring the Times Mirror Co. and its flagship
Los Angeles Times in a $6.46 billion deal. The move would end 118
years of control of the Times by the Chandler family.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst had been seeking a buyer for the Examiner since Aug. 6,
when it abruptly announced its purchase of the Chronicle,
pre-empting any potential bidders for its morning rival as well as
the production equipment the papers shared.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, responding to antitrust concerns from local, state and
federal officials, in January sweetened the deal for potential
buyers, abandoning efforts to sell only the newspaper's name and
subscriber list.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deal will preserve both of San Francisco's two daily
newspapers, and allow the city to continue its long tradition of
diversity of editorial voices,'' said the statement from ExIn LLC,
a new company affiliated with the Fang family.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst said the investment banker it hired to sell the Examiner,
Veronis Suhler &AMP; Associates of New York, had been in contact with
more than 90 prospective buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to sell to the Fang family came after intense
negotiations with the Justice Department over anti-trust concerns.
Hearst ultimately decided that selling the Examiner was the only
way to get approval for its purchase of the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle, with a daily circulation of more than 456,000, is
the largest newspaper in Northern California and the second largest
on the West Coast. It was founded in 1865 by Charles and Michael de
Young and has been owned and operated over the succeeding 134 years
by their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   William Randolph Hearst founded what is today The Hearst Corp.
in 1887 when he assumed control of the Examiner. It has a daily
circulation of 107,000, according to recent figures from the Audit
Bureau of Circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ExIn is owned by the Fang family, publishers of the Independent
and Asian Week newspapers. The Independent Newspaper Group of San
Francisco and San Mateo counties is the largest non-daily newspaper
group in California, with a circulation of 379,000.

<HEADLINE> 'Boys Don't Cry' Opens in Neb. Town  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL ROONEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALLS CITY, Neb. (AP) -- Most everyone in this farm town knows
too well the story of Teena Brandon, a woman who posed as a man,
dated a woman and then was killed by two men after they learned her
true identity.
</P>
<P>
   While residents would like to forget, the events of Brandon's
life were retold Friday night at the local premiere of the Academy
Award-nominated film ''Boys Don't Cry.'' The critically-acclaimed
movie chronicles Brandon's days in this southeast Nebraska town,
about 85 miles south of Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our phone rings off the hook,'' said Virginia Ernst, manager
of the River Twin Cinema, which sits across the street from the
courthouse where a jury convicted Brandon's killers.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst expected large crowds for the film's opening at the
220-seat theater that sits along one of the city's narrow, brick
streets, but only 110 tickets were sold for Friday's showing. Ernst
said the crowds are usually larger on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   After previewing the movie Thursday with her staff, Ernst said
she did not know how the community will respond to the movie's
lesbian love scenes and an unflattering portrayal of Falls City
with most characters depicted as drunks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nothing like the town that's in the movie,'' Ernst said.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the film on Friday, resident Jared Kirkendal
agreed. ''That's not Falls City,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's weird they made it more of a love story than a crime,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Boys Don't Cry'' opened nationwide in November, but did not
reach Nebraska screens until last month, when it opened at
multiplex theaters in Omaha, the state's largest city. Area theater
managers shied away from the film until actress Hilary Swank won
the Golden Globe Award for her portrayal of Brandon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought about it, debated it and decided to show it,''
Ernst said.
</P>
<P>
   Swank is nominated for the best actress Academy Award to be
presented March 26. Chloe Sevigny, who played Brandon's girlfriend,
Lana Tisdel, is up for the best supporting actress award.
</P>
<P>
   While residents are curious about the movie, ''Boys Don't Cry''
has not yet dominated coffee shop chatter, auctioneer John Cummings
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I venture there will be a big turnout for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shock of the crime remains fresh in local memory because it
was something that was not supposed to happen here, Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been six years since Brandon was murdered in a farmhouse
near Humboldt, about 20 miles west of Falls City. Her friends, Lisa
Lambert, 24, and Philip DeVine, 22, also were killed because they
witnessed Brandon's death.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon, who used the alias Brandon Teena, was a 21-year-old
woman who ran around the Falls City area with a rough crowd,
including her killers, John Lotter and Marvin Nissen.
</P>
<P>
   Her death came after she told police that the men raped her when
they learned of her true identity and were upset that she had dated
their female friend, Tisdel.
</P>
<P>
   Lotter sits on death row awaiting execution in the state's
electric chair. Nissen is serving a life prison sentence after
agreeing to testify against Lotter.
</P>
<P>
   Tisdel, who still lives in Falls City, has sued the film's
makers. She claims the movie makes references to her as ''lazy,
white trash and a skanky snake,'' and depicts her as a lesbian and
constantly under the influence of drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also falsely portrays Tisdel as falling asleep at the
murder scene and ''doing nothing about it after it has occurred,''
according to Tisdel's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Police reports indicate that Tisdel was not at the murder scene.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Peirce, writer-director of ''Boys Don't Cry,'' has said
she took dramatic liberties with Brandon's case in portraying in on
the big screen.

<HEADLINE> Father Found Guilty of Killing Son  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRESTON, Minn. (AP) -- A man was convicted Friday of killing his
3-year-old son by taping him to a tree in the woods as a way to win
back his estranged girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Kramer Jr., 27, was convicted of second-degree
intentional murder in the boy's death last May. He faces up to 40
years in prison when sentenced April 17.
</P>
<P>
   The jury acquitted Kramer of first-degree murder but also found
him guilty of felony murder and child endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days after Kenny disappeared, police found the boy's body
-- still dressed in his red sleeper -- in a garbage bag. He was bound
with duct tape to the base of a tree near the family's home in
southeastern Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer was accused of leaving his son in the woods in the middle
of the night to die as part of an effort to win back his estranged
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   During the police investigation, Kramer confessed to the
killing, but the defense contended the confession was coerced. At
the trial, he testified that he did not kill his son.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys argued that Kramer was the victim of a drug
deal gone bad and a sloppy investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, defense attorney Candace Rasmussen said she
still believed he did not kill his son. ''He loved his son,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution argued that Kramer provided police with facts
only the killer would know.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Board Fires 3 Cops  </HEADLINE>
By TAMMY WEBBER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Three police officers were fired and one was
suspended Friday for their roles in the shooting death of an
unarmed motorist last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Among those fired by the city's Police Board for violating
police procedures was officer Serena Daniels, who fatally shot
LaTanya Haggerty during a traffic stop following a police chase.
Daniels has said she mistook a shiny object in Haggerty's hand for
a weapon. Haggerty, 26, was a passenger in the car and was holding
a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Also fired were officers Michael Williams and Stafford Wilson.
Officer Carl Carter was suspended until July 12. Carter was not
dismissed because he did not fire his gun during the traffic stop
and ensuing chase, Police Board president Demetrius Carney said.
</P>
<P>
   All four officers have been on unpaid suspension since July.
</P>
<P>
   Carney said there was no evidence that the officers or anyone
else intended to shoot Haggerty on June 4, and he said the driver
of the car was also responsible because he fled police. But he said
police work is a profession and, ''not everyone can do the work of
an officer, as it is difficult and dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Police Superintendent Terry Hillard had recommended that
all four officers be fired after concluding they had ignored a
supervisor's order calling off the chase, fired at the vehicle
without justification and failed to promptly notify a supervisor
that they had used deadly force.
</P>
<P>
   The officers' attorney, Joseph V. Roddy, called the decision
''1,000 percent political'' because he said Hillard and Mayor
Richard M. Daley wanted the officers fired. He said the decision
will be appealed in Cook County Circuit Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''The field has never been level and they proved that tonight --
it's a disgrace,'' Roddy said.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized board members for not attending the Police Board
hearing last month and for announcing their decision -- reached late
Tuesday -- on St. Patrick's Day night.
</P>
<P>
   ''What are they afraid of? ... Why don't they face the public?''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were not surprised by the decisions, Roddy said.
</P>
<P>
   Carney said the decision was announced Friday because the
hearing officer needed time to write the decision after Tuesday's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty's shooting, coming within days of the fatal shooting of
another unarmed motorist by police, prompted demonstrations in the
city and questions about police treatment of blacks. Both victims
were black, as were the officers involved in the shootings.

<HEADLINE> NBA Withdraws Two Coach Mike Fines  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA on Friday withdrew $100,000 fines levied
against the Seattle SuperSonics and Toronto Raptors after their
coaches refused to wear microphones for an NBC telecast.
</P>
<P>
   The league also said it will continue to give coaches the option
for the rest of the season of whether to wear a wireless microphone
or have a boom microphone lowered into their huddles during
selected national broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise was first offered Tuesday following an outcry
among coaches who felt the microphone policy was heavy-handed and
intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have had several discussions with the coaches'
association,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said, ''and we
believe that all of our coaches should be comfortable with this new
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to allow this option for the remainder of
this seaon and the playoffs, and we've agreed to sit down with the
coaches' association at the end of the season to discuss a variety
of issues relating to television production and media access,''
Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA handed out the fines last week. Paul Westphal of Seattle
and Butch Carter of Toronto had said they were willing to pay the
$100,000 fines out of their own pockets, so strongly did they feel
about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches and players have also complained about other new
media rules, including the use of an unmanned camera to give
viewers a glimpse of what an NBA locker room looks like during a
typical halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Also, beginning April 1, teams must open the final 30 minutes of
practice to media.

<HEADLINE> Nuggets 114, Clippers 87  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Antonio McDyess had 23 points and Raef LaFrentz
21, helping the Denver Nuggets snap a seven-game losing streak with
a 114-87 victory Friday night over the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess, benched four minutes into the game by an angry coach
Dan Issel for not playing defense, had all of his points after
returning to the game late in the first quarter. He also had 15
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   LaFrentz had eight rebounds and six blocked shots, and rookie
James Posey added 16 points, eight rebounds and three steals.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Taylor led the Clippers with 21 points, and Derek
Anderson had 11.
</P>
<P>
   Denver, leading 54-50 at intermission, shot 53 percent in the
third quarter compared to Los Angeles' 35 percent to take an 87-73
lead into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Charles R. Jones cut the deficit to 12 points early in the
fourth quarter, but McDyess hit four baskets in the next 2:16 and
Denver expanded its lead to 99-80 with 5:29 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's reverse layup gave the Clippers a 9-5 lead early in the
game. Denver had shot just 1-for-7 from the floor to that point,
and during a timeout with 8:17 left in the quarter, Issel told his
star forward to take a seat.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets responded with a 13-2 run, including back-to-back
slam dunks by LaFrentz and consecutive 3-pointers by Chris Gatling.
LaFrentz had 12 points in the quarter as Denver took a 30-21 lead.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess, who returned to the lineup with 1:37 left in the
opening quarter, hit a 12-foot jumper two minutes into the second
period, giving Denver a 37-24 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor then had eight points during a 19-8 flurry that drew the
Clippers within two, 45-43. Taylor had 13 points in the quarter and
17 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Van Exel's 3-pointer, McDyess' slam and LaFrentz's layup
gave Denver a 61-52 lead early in the third period. Eric Piatkowski
hit a 3-pointer, but Posey then had four of the Nuggets' next six
points, and the Clippers got no closer than nine points after
that.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Before the game, the Clippers activated center Keith Closs
from the injured list. Closs had missed the previous five games
with back spasms. The Clippers also waived forward Mario Bennett,
who was signed to a 10-day contract on March 7. ... Denver's Tariq
Abdul-Wahad, who had missed the previous six games with a sprained
left wrist, played sparingly and appeared to aggravate the injury.
... The Nuggets' seven-game skid was their longest of the season.

<HEADLINE> Suns' Gugliotta Has Knee Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Phoenix Suns forward Tom Gugliotta underwent
reconstructive knee surgery Friday and team doctor Richard Emerson
said the operation was a success.
</P>
<P>
   ''The medical team is very pleased with the outcome of the
surgery of what was a significant knee injury,'' said Emerson, an
orthopedic surgeon who performed the operation. ''Tom will begin
rehabilitation immediately and it is expected he will recover from
the challenging and difficult rehabilitation process.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson said he reconstructed or repaired complete ruptures to
the anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament, a
partial rupture of the posterior cruciate ligament and the
separation of the medial meniscus.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson has estimated that it will take a year for Gugliotta to
recover. That means he is expected to be removed from the U.S. team
that is to compete in the Sydney Olympics in September.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta's injury has led to speculation that Vince Carter
would be his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old forward was injured late in a home game against
Utah on March 10, when teammate Randy Livingston tumbled into his
legs beneath the Suns' basket. Gugliotta was playing his best
basketball of the season at the time of the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta played in 54 games this season. He averaged 13.7
points, 7.9 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.48 steals while shooting
.481 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   The injury brought a miserable end to what had already been a
difficult season. Gugliotta missed seven games after suffering a
life-threatening seizure on the team bus following the Suns'
victory at Portland Dec. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson has said that he believes an herbal supplement that
Gugliotta was taking to help him sleep caused the seizure.

<HEADLINE> Iowa State Wrestlers in NCAA Semis  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Cael Sanderson remained unbeaten for his career
and Iowa State closed in on its first NCAA wrestling championship
since 1987 Friday night, qualifying four finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson, the most valuable wrestler last year as a freshman,
easily advanced at 184 pounds and ran his career record to 78-0.
Cody Sanderson, a senior and Cael's older brother, made it to the
finals at 133 pounds. The Cyclones were most impressive at the
higher weights, also sending top seed Joe Heskett at 165 pounds and
No. 4 seed Zach Thompson at 197.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State tied for fourth last year and its highest finish in
recent years was second in 1996. The finals are Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that I'm here, I don't know what to say,'' coach Bobby
Douglas said. ''I hope people aren't going to give me all the
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are excited,'' said Cody Sanderson, who'll face top-seeded
Eric Juergens of Iowa in the finals. ''But we are still
concentrating on our individual results.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones led by seven points after the quarterfinals, aided
by upsets to two No. 1 seeds for five-time defending champion Iowa.
A third top seed for the Hawkeyes lost in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   T.J. Williams, the champion at 149 pounds last year, had won 67
consecutive matches before falling 3-1 in overtime to No. 5 seed
Larry Quisel of Boise State at 157 pounds in the upset of the
evening. Earlier, Jody Strittmatter lost at 125 pounds and
defending champion Doug Schwab fell at 141 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a real long day,'' coach Jim Zalesky said. ''They
weren't wrestling like they're capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State had a 17.5-point lead over Iowa after the semifinals,
although wrestleback results shaved it to 98-88.5 heading into the
finals. Minnesota was third with 67.5 points, followed by Oklahoma
(63.5), Oklahoma State (55.5) and Illinois (54.5).
</P>
<P>
   Six of the 10 top seeds made it to the finals. Iowa, Illinois
and Oklahoma each qualified two wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   For consolation, Iowa won the only head-to-head matchup with its
in-state rival when heavyweight Wes Hand decisioned previously
undefeated Trent Hynek 8-3. Hand gets the right to face the biggest
brute force of the tournament, Minnesota's Brock Lesnar.
</P>
<P>
   Lesnar, the top seed, twice lifted Bandele Adeniyi-Bada of Penn
off the mat before recording his third straight pin in 6:41.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just getting momentum, staying motivated and keeping my
eyes on the prize,'' Lesnar said. ''I know I am going to win if I'm
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson rang up his fourth big score of the tournament,
beating Brandon Eggum of Minnesota 16-5. He won his previous two
matches 20-5 and 21-6 and led his opening-round match 19-6 before
recording a pin.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Tucker, a 174-pounder from Oklahoma, has also put up some
big numbers. Tucker defeated Ryan Cunningham of Central Michigan
12-1 in the semifinals, on the heels of 16-9, 21-8 and 14-3
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the semifinals at 125 went to double overtime. No. 8
Steve Garland of Virginia escaped with five seconds left in the
second extra period for a 6-5 victory over T.J. Hill, the only
unseeded wrestler in the semifinals. He'll face No. 2 Jeremy Hunter
of Penn State, the runnerup last year who won 2-1 when No. 3 Leroy
Vega of Minnesota was called for locking his hands.
</P>
<P>
   First-day leader Oklahoma State dropped to fourth after the
quarterfinals and to fifth after the semifinals. The Cowboys
dropped five of seven quarterfinal matches, and also lost a team
point when 184-pound Daniel Cormier made an obscene gesture after
losing in consolation matches.

25-7 burst with a steal and layup to give LSU a 59-39 lead with
6:39 to play.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Warriors 95, Bulls 92, 2 OT  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Mookie Blaylock hit back-to-back 3-pointers in
the second overtime Friday night and the Golden State Warriors
outlasted the Chicago Bulls 95-92 to end an eight-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Blaylock finished with 23 points. Donyell Marshall scored five
of his 21 points in the second extra period for the Warriors, who
swept the season series with the Bulls for the first time in 13
years.
</P>
<P>
   Elton Brand, whose short jumper at the buzzer in regulation
forced the first overtime, scored 26 for the Bulls, who have lost
13 of their last 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Brown hit two free throws with 8.8 seconds left in the
first overtime to tie the game at 82. After Marshall was called for
a charge with five seconds left, Brown missed a jumper at the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Blaylock hit 3-pointers with 2:31 and 1:46 remaining in the
second overtime to give the Warriors a 92-87 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carr's 3-pointer with five seconds left brought the Bulls
within three. Golden State then turned it over on the inbounds
pass, but Carr's 3-pointer just before the buzzer was off.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls trailed by 10 early in the fourth quarter, rallying
behind Brand's 13 points, including his jumper just before the
buzzer. Golden State didn't score in the final 2:46 of regulation
and Chicago scored six to force the tie.
</P>
<P>
Notes: John Starks, seeking his release by offering to forfeit his
salary with the Bulls, has missed 11 straight games. He's now on
the injured list with a sore knee. An arbitator will rule on his
status Tuesday. Starks came to the Bulls from the Warriors in a
three-way trade. Even even if he stays in Chicago, Starks is not
expected to play much the rest of the season. ... It was Jason
Caffey's first game in Chicago since he was traded to the Warriors
on Feb. 19, 1998 for David Vaughn and two second-round picks.
Caffey was the Bulls' first-round pick in 1995 and played on title
teams in 1996 and 1997. ... The Bulls had 27 turnovers, the
Warriors 21. ... Five players fouled out.
