Cardinal O'Connor's Farewell Begins
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands of mourners silently watched the start of a
four-day farewell to Cardinal John O'Connor Friday in services held at his
beloved St. Patrick's Cathedral. Organ music swelled and the church bells rang
as eight pallbearers carried the casket inside the grand cathedral where
O'Connor conducted countless memorials for New York heroes both famous and
obscure. The 40-minute service marked O'Connor's return to the Manhattan church
where he presided for 16 years as the nation's highest-profile Roman Catholic.
O'Connor, 80, died Wednesday night in his residence behind the cathedral after
battling cancer for months.

   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A Columbine High basketball star who witnessed last
year's bloodbath -- losing one of his best friends -- hanged himself in his
garage as a CD, set to replay continuously, blared a song with the words: ''I'm
too depressed to go on.'' It was the second suicide among friends or relatives
of the Columbine High victims. Greg Barnes, a 17-year-old who averaged 26.2
points a game as a junior last season and had attracted attention from Harvard,
Notre Dame and other universities, hanged himself Thursday morning, said a

Peru Said Not Ready for Fair Runoff
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- U.S. election observers said Friday that President Alberto
Fujimori's government has failed to take minimum steps to ensure a fair and open
runoff vote for president on May 28. ''The consequence is that the process at
this moment continues to fall well short of the standards that are required,''
Patrick Merloe, head of the joint mission of the National Democratic Institute
and Carter Center, said Friday. Polls show Fujimori and economist Alejandro
Toledo in a dead heat in the runoff race after a first-round campaign and April
9 vote riddled with irregularities and allegations of government abuses and
fraud.

   RIGA, Latvia (AP) -- Latvia's parliament on Friday approved a new
center-right government led by Andris Berzins, a popular former mayor of Riga
who has pledged to maintain the Baltic state's pro-reform, pro-West course. The
100-seat Saeima parliament voted along party lines, 69 to 24, to approve the
government with Berzins at its helm. Seven deputies either weren't present or
didn't vote. Berzins said he was committed to the open-market economic policies
adhered to by all of Latvia's governments since the country regained
independence following the 1991 Soviet collapse.

Colombian Peso Hits Historic Low
</SUBHEAD>

   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Political gridlock and rebel threats to kidnap the
rich drove the Colombian peso to a historic low on Friday and observers said key
economic reforms were in danger. The downturn -- coming amid stubbornly high
unemployment, falling government bond values and shrinking foreign investment --
heaps new economic jitters atop the Andean nation's woes. The peso closed at
2,043 to the U.S. dollar on Friday, it's lowest ever.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 10, Twins 8  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers capitalized on a blunder
by rookie catcher Matthew LeCroy for the second straight game and
rallied to beat the Minnesota Twins 10-8 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers scored five runs in the seventh after LeCroy was
called for catcher's interference shortly after Jacque Jones had
put the Twins ahead 7-4 with a three-run homer off Hideo Nomo.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Higginson, who homered in the fourth two pitches after
LeCroy lost track of his foul ball that hit a speaker, lined out to
first but was awarded the bag because he hit LeCroy's mitt during
his swing.
</P>
<P>
   That loaded the bases with nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Carrasco (3-2) then gave up an RBI groundout to Gregg
Jefferies and threw a wild pitch that plated another run, making it
7-6, and bringing on Travis Miller, who gave up Deivi Cruz's
game-tying RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Wendell Magee's RBI single off Miller gave Detroit
an 8-7 lead, and Brad Ausmus followed with another run-scoring
single.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, LeCroy's interference led to a three-run
sixth inning in Minnesota's 8-6 loss to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, LeCroy hit a home run, but it was not enough to
overcome his mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota pulled to 9-8 in the bottom half of the inning on
Butch Huskey's RBI groundout. But Juan Gonzalez, who had three
hits, hit an RBI double off Johan Santana in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Patterson (1-0) earned his first victory since Aug. 10,
1999, even though he allowed a run on three hits in two-thirds of
an inning. Todd Jones pitched the ninth for his seventh save.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Jones' homer in the sixth sailed just over the glove of
center fielder Juan Encarnacion.
</P>
<P>
   Encarnacion's seventh-inning single extended his hitting streak
to 17 games, best in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Canizaro wasted no time impressing his new Twins teammates.
He replaced second baseman Todd Walker, who was demoted to Salt
Lake this week and asked to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the first, Canizaro scooped a high bouncer on
the short hop and threw to first to nip the runner. After getting
high-fives in the dugout, he doubled off the right-field wall and
scored on Ron Coomer's single.
</P>
<P>
   After LeCroy's solo homer, his second, made it 2-0, Canizaro
beat out a relay throw on a fielder's choice in the third and later
scored on Coomer's single for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Sean Bergman had a hard time finding the plate or holding
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson pulled Detroit to 3-2 with a two-run homer after
LeCroy lost his foul ball behind home plate when it bounced off a
overhanging speaker and landed a few feet from him.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Twins manager Tom Kelly is two victories shy of 1,000 for
his career. Said Tigers manager Phil Garner: ''Good for him. I hope
he gets it next week.'' The teams play two more games this weekend.
... Tigers 3B Dean Palmer and Garner served the eighth and final
games of their suspensions for brawling with the White Sox last
month.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 11, Indians 10  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Paul Shuey's great stuff made no difference for
the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Darrin Fletcher hit a game-winning single off Shuey in the ninth
inning as the Toronto Blue Jays won a wild one, sending the Indians
to their sixth straight loss, 11-10 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Shuey (1-1) fanned five, but he also gave up a game-tying homer
to Alex Gonzalez in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had the edge, but things just didn't fall into place,''
Shuey said.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto rallied three times after trailing 3-1, 8-4 and 10-9,
while Cleveland came back twice after falling behind 4-3 and 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a lot of hits, a lot of lead changes and we went
through a lot of pitchers,'' Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cruz's two-run homer off Tom Martin in the sixth, his 11th
of the season, put Toronto ahead 9-8, but Jim Thome regained the
lead with a two-run homer in the seventh off Lance Painter.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez tied it at 10 with a one-out homer in the eighth off
Shuey. Brad Fullmer then reached with a two-out, broken-bat single
in the ninth and Fletcher lined a ball down the left-field line,
giving the Blue Jays the 1,800th win in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paul throws hard, and he can easily get a guy out with three
different pitches,'' Fletcher said. ''I just put the bat head on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Koch (2-0), the Blue Jays' sixth pitcher, got the final
out in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's Einar Diaz had a career-high five hits, going
5-for-5. The Indians, who are near the bottom of the American
League in nearly every major offensive category, had 20 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, it will carry on into tomorrow,'' Indians interim
manager Grady Little said.
</P>
<P>
   To get the Indians out of their hitting slump, Little changed
the lineup by moving Roberto Alomar to lead leadoff spot and David
Justice to the No. 3 hole for the first time this season. Justice
responded with a three-run double that put Cleveland ahead in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher hit a solo homer in the second and Raul Mondesi gave
the Blue Jays a 4-3 lead in the third with a three-run homer off
the restaurant in center field.
</P>
<P>
   But the Indians scored five runs in the fourth on Manny
Ramirez's two-run homer off Roy Halladay, Einar Diaz's two-run
double and Jolbert Cabrera's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz hit an RBI double in the fourth, and Carlos Delgado had a
two-run homer in the fifth off the top of the center-field
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cleveland manager Charlie Manuel had successful surgery
Friday to have his colon reattached. ... Alomar's second-inning
single snapped an 0-for-22 slide. ... Nine of Delgado's 10 home
runs have come at SkyDome. ... The Blue Jays have won seven of
their last nine home games. ... The Blue Jays played their first
game this season with the SkyDome roof open.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 17, Athletics 16  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MARSHALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Rangers overcame an eight-run
deficit for the first time in team history, rallying past the
Oakland Athletics 17-16 Friday night on pinch-hitter Mike Lamb's
RBI single in the bottom of the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   On a night in which neither team took batting practice because
of morning showers, the A's and Rangers combined for six homers,
six doubles and 37 hits in the majors' highest-scoring game of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which wasted an early 5-0 lead, trailed 15-7 after six
innings and was down 16-10 before tying it with a six-run eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers loaded the bases with one out in the ninth on a
single, walk and an error by pitcher Jeff Tam (0-2). Lamb singled
home Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland (1-1), the only one of 10 pitchers to not allow a
run, worked the ninth for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The clubs tied an AL record when all 18 starters scored,
matching a feat accomplished by the Boston Red Sox and Philadelphia
Athletics on June 29, 1950. The major league record for players
scoring in one game is 22, set by the Philadelphia Phillies and
Chicago Cubs on Aug. 25, 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sheldon drove in four runs for Texas, which had 21 hits.
Ben Grieve drove in four runs for the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland, coming off a 14-5 win over Kansas City on Wednesday,
got home runs by Frank Menechino, Ramon Hernandez, Jeremy Giambi,
Adam Piatt and Terrence Long.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez homered for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland trailed 5-0 in the second, tied it in the fifth, and
then fell behind 7-5 in the bottom half. The A's opened a 15-7 lead
with five runs each in the sixth and seventh innings.
</P>
<P>
   With Texas trailing by six in the eighth, Rafael Palmeiro had a
two-run single off Doug Jones, and Luis Alicea and Sheldon each hit
two-run singles off Mike Magnante.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Oliver, staked to a 5-0 lead in the second, left after
five innings ahead 7-5. Reliever Matt Perisho allowed 10 runs, five
hits and four walks in the next two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Perisho walked the bases loaded in the sixth and Grieve hit a
three-run double to the gap in left-center for an 8-7 lead. Giambi,
recalled from Triple-A Sacramento before the game, followed with a
two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Piatt had a two-run homer and Miguel Tejada added a two-run
double in a five-run seventh that made it 15-7. Three runs were
unearned after left fielder Chad Curtis dropped Olmedo Saenz's fly
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Texas took a 5-0 lead in the second off Mark Mulder. Sheldon,
filling in for an injured David Segui, had a two-run single and
Curtis had a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland closed in a three-run fourth that included Menechino's
homer, and Hernandez tied it at 5 with a two-run homer in the
fifth. Palmeiro and Ruben Mateo hit RBI singles in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez had his fifth consecutive multihit game, finishing
going 3-for-5 with a solo homer in the seventh.
Notes: Segui was scratched from the lineup with a strained right
hip flexor sustained Thursday night against Tampa Bay. ... The
Athletics are 10-4 on the road, 5-10 at home. ... The game included
two pickoffs at first base in which the runner took off early.
Piatt got caught in the second inning and Texas' Tom Evans was
erased in the third.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 5, Padres 3  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Seven starts, seven victories for Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose temper flared when he was hit in the left elbow
by a Sterling Hitchcock pitch in the second inning, pitched a
five-hitter Friday night that led the Arizona Diamondbacks over the
San Diego Padres 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (7-0), the third pitcher in modern baseball history to
win six games in April, kept it going in May and even extended his
hitting streak to five games going 2-for-3 with and RBI single in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Miller and Danny Klassen homered ahead of Johnson in the
second to make it 3-0. On a 1-2 count, a pitch from Hitchcock (0-4)
glanced off Johnson's left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pointed his bat at the Padres' pitcher, shouted angrily
and took a couple of steps toward the mound. Both dugouts and
bullpens emptied, but calm was quickly restored.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Padres' runs were unearned, leaving Johnson's ERA at
0.93. He struck out 11, all but one in the first five innings, and
walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Of the hits he allowed, three were bloopers into the outfield
and another was an infield single. Ed Sprague hit a 428 foot
leadoff homer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona homered four times off Hitchcock, including leadoff
drives in the first three innings by Hanley Frias, Miller and Greg
Colbrunn.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson didn't allow a hit through five innings. His call third
strike against Eric Owens in the first was clocked at 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has complete games in four of his starts and was an out
short of another. He has struck out at least 10 six times.
</P>
<P>
   For the season, Johnson has allowed six earned in 58 1-3
innings. He has struck out 74 and walked 13.
</P>
<P>
   The four homers were the only hits allowed by in five innings by
Hitchcock, who hit two batters.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego got two runs in the sixth. Pinch-hitter Chris Gomez
led off with a bloop single to center. After one out, consecutive
errors by Frias at shortstop loaded the bases. Johnson walked Phil
Nevin, forcing in a run, and Sprague's broken-bat single brought
home another.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone grounded into an inning-ending double play, with
Padres manager Bruce Bochy arguing the call at first.
Notes: Most of the Phoenix Suns attended the game and sat behind
the Arizona dugout. Rodney Rogers, winner of the NBA's Sixth Man
Award, threw out the first ball, with Jason Kidd, Penny Hardaway
and Cliff Robinson serving as catcher, batter and umpire,
respectively. ... Arizona closer Matt Mantei was placed on the
15-day disabled list with weakness in his right shoulder. His
roster spot was taken by RHP Vincente Padilla, recalled from
Triple-A Tucson. ... Frias' homer was the third of his career and
first as a right-handed batter. ... The Padres, who have had 11
players on the DL this season, activated OF Ruben Rivera and RHP
Rodney Myers from the 15-day DL. They placed RHP Woody Williams
(aneurysm in his right armpit) on the DL.

<HEADLINE> New York has a new budget, 35 days late  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Being late 35 days sounds like a lot, but by
New York's standards of overdue state budget adoptions, this year's
tardiness was not so bad.
</P>
<P>
   The state Assembly and Senate adopted a $77.5 billion budget on
Friday for the 2000-01 fiscal year which began on April 1.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 16th straight year the budget wasn't in place on
time. But except for 1998, when the budget was adopted on April 14,
this year's budget is the earliest since 1993. Included in those
years of budget-adoption futility were numbing impasses in 1999 and
1997 which stretched to Aug. 4 each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did a budget that I believe is one of the best budgets that
we've enacted on behalf of the people of this state certainly since
I've been leader and maybe since I've been in the Senate,'' said
state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, a 24-year Senate
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget contains a series of firsts: the highest-ever
increase in state aid for public schools of $1.2 billion; a
first-in-the nation deduction from state income taxes for college
costs; the largest-ever proposed state bond act, $3.8 billion to
aid transportation, to be placed before voters in November; the
first concerted effort to rein in state borrowing practices; and
expansions of benefits to highest-ever levels of the EPIC
prescription drug program for the elderly and the Tuition
Assistance Program for college students.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget increases spending in the state's general fund --
comprised of funds the state raises itself through taxes and fees --
by just under 5 percent and overall by just under 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat who may run for
governor in 2002, said increasing spending above the rate of
inflation at the same time the state was approving another $3
billion in non-voter-approved ''backdoor'' debt showed how out of
touch state leaders are.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes it seems as if New York is in its own little
Twilight Zone,'' McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   McCall also deride the debt reform initiatives as riddled with
loopholes and meaningless provisions -- and immediately drew an
attack from Michael McKeon, spokesman for Gov. George Pataki, who
accused McCall of calling publicly for debt reform but doing
nothing practical to see that it was instituted.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki defended the ''fiscally responsible'' budget. It makes
''prudent'' contributions into rainy day funds so that if the
economy goes sour or some other fiscal disaster besets New York,
the state can weather the storm, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   There was little debate over any of the budget bills since most
of the high points of the spending plan had been known for weeks.
The state Assembly took just over five hours to pass the 13-bill
budget package late Thursday and early Friday, with much of the
time taken up by closed-door conferences or members waiting for
bills to be brought before them for votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate worked a few hours Thursday night and returned into
session Friday morning, where it took just 40 minutes to approve
the final seven budget bills.
</P>
<P>
   While vetoes by Pataki are possible, the governor was involved
in negotiating all significant aspects of the budget and is not
known to have any major objections.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is my understanding that he will not do any wholesale
vetoes,'' Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker in the Assembly,
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno estimated that about 98 percent of the budget consisted of
bills the governor sent back to the Legislature in recent days,
indicating his acceptance of the provisions. The rest originated in
the Legislature. Bruno called the budget ''fairly veto-proof.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Bruno and Silver devised a budget without Pataki's
input and the governor vetoed hundreds of millions of dollars worth
of legislative spending initiatives. Silver vowed to get Pataki
involved in the legislative negotiating process to avoid a repeat
of that veto-happy budget.

<HEADLINE> Pataki: I am backing cost-of-living pension increases  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki says he favors pensioners
of state and local governments getting annual pension increases to
keep up with the cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki announced Friday he has reviewed the report of a task
force he created in June 1999 to study the cost-of-living issue and
agrees with its recommendation to institute automatic and permanent
COLAs.
</P>
<P>
   ''With our healthy economy and the strong performance of the
pension systems, the timing is right to address the COLA situation
and I look forward to working with the Legislature on this,''
Pataki said in a statement released by this office.
</P>
<P>
   Public employee unions and groups of retirees have lobbied hard
in recent years for cost-of-living increases, noting that their
pension fund has never been worth more. The state's Common
Retirement Fund has increased from $63.4 billion in 1995 to about
$120 billion today.
</P>
<P>
   The fund covers about 600,000 current public employees and
290,000 retirees.
</P>
<P>
   To this time, Pataki has been sympathetic to the pensioners'
arguments, but said he wanted to see what his task force
recommended before taking a position.
</P>
<P>
   Pensioners did get pension ''supplementation'' in 1995 and 1998
-- one-time benefit increases -- but they have been pushing for
benefits to go up annually based on some gauge of rising living
expenses such as the Consumer Price Index.

   A pro-COLA rally by current and retired public employees is
scheduled for Tuesday in Albany. Organizers said they expected as
many as 10,000 people at the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is truly wonderful news,'' said Denyce Duncan Lacy,
spokeswoman for the Public Employees Federation union. ''Those are
things that PEF has been saying ought to happen for years. It
sounds like the governor is agreeing with us. It is long overdue.''

   State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, the sole trustee of the state

permanent, automatic, reliable and affordable, and I am heartened
that these ideas were adopted by the task force,'' McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those on the pension task force were Adam Barsky, director
of the New York City Mayor's Office of Management and Budget;
former state Budget Director Patrick Bulgaro; Danny Donohue,
president of the Civil Service Employees Association; Denis Hughes,
president of the state AFL-CIO; and Cynthia Wilson, president of
the Retired Public Employees Association.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was chaired by Linda Angello, director of Pataki's
Office of Employee Relations.

By The Associated PressJudge agrees anthrax vaccine unsafe; halts court martial
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG (AP) -- The Armed Forces have been dragged into the 21st
century, suggests a retired air force sergeant whose refusal to
take an anthrax vaccine was validated Friday by Canada's chief
military judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can defend our Canadian rights, but we should be able to
partake in them also,'' Mike Kipling said moments after he and his
supporters jubilantly cheered the decision of Col. Guy Brais to end
Kipling's court martial before it even started.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great for Mike Kipling and it signals a new era in human
rights for enlisted men and women,'' said Jay Prober, the civilian
lawyer Kipling decided to hire instead of accepting free military
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Brais agreed with the defense that the vaccine Kipling was asked
to take in 1998 in Kuwait during the second Gulf War could have
been unsafe, based on evidence presented in court, and therefore
his common law and Charter rights were jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   Retired colonel Michel Drapeau, a frequent critic of Canada's
military who writes for Esprit de Corps magazine, hailed Kipling as
an honorable soldier who did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Drapeau pointed out that Kipling resigned in an attempt to end
the matter and avoid court martial for disobeying an order, but the
military decided to pursue him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesman Capt. Brian Martin said from Ottawa that no
policy changes will take effect until the military has time to
examine the decision.

Chretien calls U.N. designation of Clayoquot Sound ''Canadian
success story''
</P>
<P>
   TOFINO, British Columbia (AP) -- Clayoquot Sound, the site of one
of the largest demonstrations of civil disobedience in Canadian
history, is a ''great Canadian success story,'' Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien was at Pacific Rim National Park as the sound was
declared a United Nations biosphere reserve, a place for
sustainable economic development, research, education and training.
</P>
<P>
   Logging in Clayoquot Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island
had been vigorously opposed by environmental groups in the 1980s
and early 1990s. The dispute culminated in a massive protest in
1993, the so-called War in the Woods.
</P>
<P>
   More than 800 protesters were arrested along logging roads.
</P>
<P>
   Canada was given an international black eye as the issue was
taken up by celebrities such as Australian rock band Midnight Oil
and Robert Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer and the son of
slain U.S. senator Robert Kennedy. Both appeared at the site during
the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Clearcut logging ended in the sound after the protests.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. designation was treated as a victory Friday by
environmentalists who attended the ceremonies.

Love Bug brings calls for national cyber police agency
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A seemingly continuous stream of global computer
viruses like this week's so-called love bug is triggering calls for
a national cyber-police squad to jump on Internet attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Gaylen Duncan, president of the Information Technology
Association of Canada, said a Canada-wide police force is needed to
track down and prosecute computer hackers and virus creators.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's doable,'' Duncan said Friday from Toronto. ''But it takes
a hit squad that moves at the speed of light.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a six-month investigation, this is not a two-year
prosecution. This kind of stuff has to move within the week,'' said
Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan said the pressure is on the international business
community to demand governments around the world create a global
treaty to help prosecute offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Teeple, in charge of the RCMP's technical security branch,
said a new Canadian information protection center is likely to be
established. This will follow September's tabling of a federal task
force report on the protection of critical infrastructure.

Endangered list continues to grow with no end in sight, experts
say
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Scientists have added 14 Canadian species,
including the southern-mountain tailed frog of British Columbia, to
a list of animals and plants endangered or at risk.
</P>
<P>
   And biologists warned Friday that there's no end in sight to
additions to the endangered-species list because of pollution and
development.
</P>
<P>
   ''This list will grow and it will continue to grow,'' David
Green, chairman of an independent committee on the status on
endangered wildlife, said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be more species that become in peril.''
</P>
<P>
   A panel in Ottawa assessed 140 species this week, including
mammals, plants, amphibians, reptiles, fish, butterflies and
mollusks. The majority remained in the same-risk category they were
in last year.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists and wildlife experts have drafted an annual report on
at-risk animals and plants since 1978.

Nine-year-old girl disappears with troubled 20-year-old; police
treat as abduction
</P>
<P>
   MAPLE RIDGE, British Columbia (AP) -- A man last seen with a
missing nine-year-old girl has a troubled past, but family members
differed Friday over whether he would ever hurt the girl.
</P>
<P>
   David Trott, 20, was seen with Jessica Russell on Thursday when
he was to be taking her to school. Neither has been seen since.
</P>
<P>
   Police originally treated the disappearance as a missing persons
case, but they changed their tack Friday afternoon and began
treating Jessica's case as an abduction.
</P>
<P>
   Trott was released earlier this week on probation on a number of
charges, including possession of stolen property, assault and
uttering threats, said Sheldon Green, a spokesman for British
Columbia Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Green said Trott was also on probation last year for
property-related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Trott's aunt, Sandra Wagner, said she doesn't believe her nephew
would harm the girl. She said he suffers from fetal alcohol
syndrome.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani and Clinton court Liberal Party  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton is courting the
leadership of New York's Liberal Party even though one of Senate
rival Rudolph Giuliani's top political advisers is the party's
boss.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and the New York City mayor were to make separate
appearances this morning before the party's policy committee in New
York City. An endorsement decision from the party's full state
committee could come in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Kim Serafin noted Friday that no
Democrat has been elected governor or senator in New York without
Liberal Party backing since the party's founding in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Clinton's advisers have said they hold out little
hope they can win the Liberal Party nod given that party boss
Raymond Harding is a Giuliani confidant. They have also been trying
to put the best face on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need all these third-party lines,'' a defiant state
Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope said Tuesday on MSNBC's
''Hardball'' program.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview with The Associated Press, Hope said
that while chances of a Clinton endorsement by the Liberal Party
were 'remote ... we assume that none of these institutions are
monolithic and you never know what's around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Liberal Party members said Friday that the Giuliani
forces shouldn't count on walking off with the party's endorsement
and that it may go to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely going to be a dogfight, but I'm really very
confident -- very, very confident,'' said Clinton supporter Joe
Laux, a Liberal Party vice chairman and a member of its policy
committee that was to interview the candidates today.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the intrigue is the expectation that the Liberal Party
will have Vice President Al Gore at the top of its ticket. But that
can only be accomplished with Gore's agreement. The vice
president's New York staff and Clinton's are extremely close.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the issue of whether Giuliani will even stay in
the race. He announced April 27 that he was suffering from prostate
cancer. The mayor said he would decide whether to stay in the race
after discussing treatment options with his doctors. Aides to the
mayor say a decision could come by the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Third party endorsements can be critical in New York in close
races. Polls show the Senate race to be just that with Clinton and
Giuliani in it.
</P>
<P>
   New York, unlike other states, allows major party candidates to
count votes they receive on third-party ballot lines. In fact,
Republican George Pataki beat incumbent Democrat Mario Cuomo in the
1994 governor's race on the strength of the vote from the
Conservative Party line.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Long,
is balking at endorsing Republican Giuliani because of his ties to
the Liberal Party and his support for abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both Clinton and Giuliani appeared at a forum in
Buffalo for Senate candidates April 29 staged by the New York wing
of the national Reform Party. At that event, however, Clinton told
Independence Party leaders that she would not accept their
endorsement if they nominated Pat Buchanan as their presidential
candidate. Giuliani said later that he would probably not run on
the line either if Buchanan were at the top of the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Giuliani camp launched a new television
advertisement. Aides said the 30-second spot would air statewide
for about two weeks at a cost that could top $1 million. The mayor
has had campaign ads running off and on for months.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's campaign launched its first statewide TV ad on
Wednesday, also for a two-week run. It is expected to cost about
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the new TV ads attacks the opposing candidate,
although Giuliani's has thinly veiled barbs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be a senator because I was born in this state,'' he
says in it.
</P>
<P>
   Until January, Clinton had never lived in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Later today, President and Mrs. Clinton were to attend a wedding
in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the first couple will be the stars at a
$250-a-person, fund-raising event in Little Rock to benefit her
campaign. About 300 people are expected to attend.

<HEADLINE> No agreement yet on cleanup of former nuclear site  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST VALLEY, N.Y. (AP) -- With the one-year deadline set by
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson at hand, state and federal
officials have yet to agree on how to proceed with the cleanup of
the West Valley Demonstration Project.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations, however, are progressing well, Richardson said
Friday during a visit to the former nuclear fuel reprocessing
center.
</P>
<P>
   ''My hope had been that we had reached an agreement, for me to
announce it here, but we're not quite there yet,'' he said. ''We're
almost there. There are some differences -- money for one -- but I do
think an agreement is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The private Nuclear Fuel Services reprocessed nuclear fuel rods
at the site 40 miles south of Buffalo from 1966 to 1972. It was the
only such commercial reprocessing center in the country. Left
behind when the operation shut down were more than 600,000 gallons
of highly radioactive liquid waste in an underground tank, as well
as several buildings and stored low-level radioactive material.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 President Jimmy Carter signed the West Valley
Demonstration Project Act making the state and federal governments
partners in the cleanup, a multibillion-dollar prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Valentino, president of the New York State Energy Research
and Development Authority, said the plan being negotiated must
satisfy regulators, the governor and Legislature, as well as
Congress and the community.
</P>
<P>
   ''The consequences of our decisions are going to impact many
generations to come,'' he said, ''and I have absolutely no
compulsion to move too quickly. I think it's more important to get
it right.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've gone over every issue. We pretty much know what each
other's parameters are,'' he said. Neither Valentino nor Richardson
would elaborate on sticking points in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   In the first phase of cleanup, now nearly complete, the liquid
waste was solidified into a more manageable glasslike material that
will eventually be shipped out of state. The question now is what
to do next at the 3,300-acre site.
</P>
<P>
   Plans on the table include leaving the high-level waste tanks in
the ground but cleaning, grouting and covering them, and
demolishing the main plant building while sealing and covering the
basement. All spent fuel and low-level waste would be shipped out.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the federal and state governments have been sharing the
cost of the cleanup, with the federal government paying 90 percent,
or $1.4 billion, and the state contributing 10 percent, or about
$120 million.

<HEADLINE> Stars 5, Sharks 4  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Joe Nieuwendyk had two goals, including
the go-ahead score, and Dallas added a pair of short-handed scores
as the Stars regained their playoff momentum by beating the San
Jose Sharks 5-4 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The defending Stanley Cup champions took a 3-1 lead in their
best-of-seven Western Conference semifinals. The Stars can clinch
the series with a victory against San Jose in Game 5 at Dallas on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Both San Jose goalie Steve Shields and Dallas goalie Ed Belfour,
who had kept a lid on scoring in their previous games, struggled in
this one.
</P>
<P>
   There were three short-handed goals, two by Dallas, and San Jose
converted twice on the power play. A frustrated Belfour drew
successive roughing penalties around a goaltender interference call
on Dave Lowry in the final period, but withstood the resulting San
Jose power play.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose pulled Shields in the final minute for an extra
attacker, but Belfour stuffed Patrick Marleau's shot from up close
with 40 seconds remaining. Dallas prevented the Sharks from getting
another shot.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour had allowed only two goals in three previous games,
twice shutting out the Sharks. Shields, who stopped 28 of 33 shots,
had given up only two goals in the previous two games since a 4-0
loss in the series opener.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk's first goal, off a rebound that Shields just missed
overing up, gave the Stars a 4-3 lead before the game was tied for
a fourth time on Todd Harvey's power-play goal from the slot after
a centering pass by Marleau at 14:07 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk then scored again, putting the Stars up by a goal
heading into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Langenbrunner, who missed Game 3 with a bruised shoulder,
got a pass from Scott Thornton and rushed down the ice. He drew
Shields to cover one side of the net before getting off a feed to
the wide-open Nieuwendyk on the other side for the go-ahead score,
his third of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Nolan forged a 3-3 tie when he answered Dallas' second
short-handed score with one for the Sharks. He took the puck away
from Derian Hatcher at the blue line and broke for the Dallas net,
where he flipped the puck over Belfour's shoulder for his eighth
goal of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Zubov had put Dallas up 3-2 with a short-handed score,
getting a lead pass from Mike Modano and beating Shields with a
shot on the goalie's stick side.
</P>
<P>
   The teams, who combined for four goals in their two previous
games, scored two each in the first period alone.
</P>
<P>
   A Stars turnover led to Mike Ricci's fifth goal of the playoffs,
which tied it 2-2. Zubov was skating behind the net attempting to
clear the puck when Marco Sturm knocked it away. It bounded out to
Niklas Sundstrom and he quickly dished to Ricci, who tapped the
puck in from just outside the crease.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had gone in front on a short-handed breakaway just 1{
minutes after San Jose converted on a two-man advantage on Vincent
Damphousse's first goal of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Keane picked up a loose puck in the Dallas zone and took
off down the left side of the rink. Sharks defenseman Bryan
Marchment had the angle, but appeared to cramp up as he gave chase
and couldn't catch him. Keane got off a cross-ice pass to the
streaking Guy Carbonneau, who finished the breakaway by beating
Shields.
</P>
<P>
   Marchment left the game with a groin strain.
</P>
<P>
   Modano scored 1:08 into the game, stretching his career-high
points streak to eight games. Brenden Morrow won a scrum along the
boards and got the puck out to Brett Hull, who passed it on to
Modano for a shot from the point that slid beneath Shields' legs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Methamphetamine fumes coming from a
piece of luggage aboard a commercial plane sickened 20 passengers
Friday evening, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of United Airlines Flight 1190, traveling from Denver
to Des Moines, reported a strange odor from a garment bag stuffed
into an overhead compartment, said Scott Williams, Des Moines
International Airport operations manager.
</P>
<P>
   The odor grew stronger as the 90-minute flight wore on, United
spokeswoman Wendy Parson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flight crew kind of narrowed the smell down to something
in one of the overhead bins and ... removed a bag from the overhead
bin and put it in the back,'' Parson said.
</P>
<P>
   The crew alerted local authorities after the plane made its
scheduled landing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 passengers complained of nausea, but none needed to go
to a hospital, said Linda Frangenberg, a spokeswoman for the Des
Moines Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   The bag held ''methamphetamine oil,'' containing ether and other
chemicals, Frangenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers were questioned by law enforcement authorities,
Parson said. Investigators weren't immediately sure who owned the
bag.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands of mourners silently watched the start of a
four-day farewell to Cardinal John O'Connor Friday in services held at his
beloved St. Patrick's Cathedral. Organ music swelled and the church bells rang

where he presided for 16 years as the nation's highest-profile Roman Catholic.
O'Connor, 80, died Wednesday night in his residence behind the cathedral after

   SEATTLE (AP) -- Kent Bottenfield pitched 6 1-3 scoreless innings
and Tim Salmon homered and doubled twice as the Anaheim Angels held
off the Seattle Mariners 6-5 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon's two-run shot in the eighth inning gave the Angels a
homer in 11 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Down 5-0, the Mariners rallied for four runs in the eighth off
Mark Petkovsek and Shigetoshi Hasegawa. Stan Javier homered, Tom
Lampkin hit a two-run double and Mike Cameron doubled home a run.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad tripled and Adam Kennedy singled in the Angels
ninth. Troy Percival got three outs for his eighth save, working
around John Olerud's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron, who replaced Ken Griffey Jr. in center field for the
Mariners, made his second outstanding catch at Safeco Field this
season. With two runners on in the fourth, Cameron crashed into the
fence to rob Scott Spiezio of extra bases to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez went 4-for-4 for the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield (3-3), who came to the Angels from St. Louis in a
trade for Jim Edmonds a week before spring training ended, limited
the Mariners to four hits. He struck out seven and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele (2-2) gave up an RBI single to Troy Glaus in the
fourth and a run-scoring double to Spiezio in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon hit his eighth homer and Glaus had an RBI single in the
eighth. Both players finished with three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield was replaced by Petkovsek after walking Cameron to
put two on with one out in the seventh. The Mariners left the bases
loaded for the second time when, after a walk to Carlos Guillen,
Mark McLemore grounded out.
Notes: Cameron robbed Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees of a
home run by leaping over the fence to catch his drive on April 7.
... Angels SS Gary DiSarcina missed his second straight game
because of a sore right shoulder. ... Mariners right fielder Jay
Buhner is expected back on Saturday after missing three games in a
row because of the flu. ... Erstad, the AL's leading hitter, was
1-for-5 to drop his batting average to .411, making him 3-for-17 on
his team's current road trip. ... McLemore was caught stealing for
the sixth time this year. ... The Mariners are now batting 2-for-17
(.118) with the bases loaded and two out this season.

<HEADLINE> FBI: No White House Phone Breach  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI has all but closed an extensive
investigation into allegations that Israeli spies penetrated the
White House and other government telephone systems, finding no
evidence of a breach, a senior federal law enforcement official
said.
</P>
<P>
   This official and another senior law enforcement official said
Friday that more than a year of investigation failed to
substantiate the allegations and that the FBI identified no one to
arrest. Both spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was extensive investigation, and there are just no facts
to support the allegation,'' one of the officials said. This
official said the investigation had ''100 percent complete support
from the Justice Department and every other government agency''
that would be needed to check such an allegation.
</P>
<P>
   The probe is technically not closed, this official said. But it
was described as being in the ''pending inactive state because the
allegation is so serious and in case something develops.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, a senior official said the White House had
no indication that its phone system was compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Regev, a spokesman for the Israeli Embassy said, ''I don't
listen even to the phone conversations of my wife.'' He called the
allegation outrageous and said, ''Israel does not spy on the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   A former civilian intelligence analyst for the U.S. Navy,
Jonathan Pollard, was convicted during the 1980s of extensive
spying for Israel. That country has tried unsuccessfully since then
to have him pardoned by U.S. presidents.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Republican sources said the allegation centered
on a telecommunications contractor.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Probes Deutch Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is conducting a new
criminal investigation of whether former CIA director John Deutch
violated the law in mishandling secrets on his home computer,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry represents the second time the department has looked
into the matter, reflecting what top Justice officials say is their
concern that Deutch be held to the same standards applied to
Chinese nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee, whom the government charged
earlier this year with mishandling atomic weapons secrets on
computers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's attorneys have publicly challenged his indictment, citing
the department's decision in April 1999 not to prosecute Deutch for
storing numerous classified CIA documents on an unsecured computer
in his home, which was used by his children to connect to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Attorney General Janet Reno announced the Deutch
case was under review again. Initially, it appeared that Justice
prosecutors were simply going to examine a CIA inspector general
report on the matter to see if it disclosed any evidence beyond
what they had found.
</P>
<P>
   But in late February and early March, FBI agents were sent out
to conduct a new round of interviews with two or three individuals,
which one department official, requesting anonymity, said amounted
to opening a preliminary inquiry in the case, one step short of a
full investigation. That round of FBI interviews was also said to
have focused on the question of whether CIA officials improperly
delayed reporting the Deutch incident to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   After a review in early March, Justice officials requested that
the FBI conduct more interviews, according to a senior Justice
official, who said in effect the criminal investigation was
reopened at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a special White House intelligence panel headed by
former Sen. Warren B. Rudman has presented President Clinton with a
report critical of current and former CIA officials for failing to
follow through adequately on the evidence against Deutch, The New
York Times Web site and The Washington Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Deutch affair also is being investigated by Republicans in
Congress. And the renewed Justice interest in the case -- after the
department declined to bring criminal charges in spring 1999 --
played a role in the refusal in early March this year by former CIA
general counsel Michael J. O'Neil to testify before the Senate
Intelligence Committee unless given immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In a yearlong probe that ended April 1999, the department's
criminal division concluded Deutch's lapses were sloppy rather than
criminal. It referred the case to the CIA inspector general for
administrative discipline. Last August, the CIA stripped Deutch of
his security clearance.
</P>
<P>
   After O'Neil refused to testify voluntarily, he was subpoenaed.
On March 7, O'Neil invoked his right not to incriminate himself and
refused to answer questions from Senate Intelligence Committee
members about the Deutch case.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, O'Neil's lawyer, Roger Spaeder, said he
had advised his client not to testify while Reno reviews an earlier
decision not to prosecute Deutch or others.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil, who left the agency in October 1997, at first declined
to turn over computer storage cards from Deutch's computers and
delayed notifying the Justice Department of the matter, according
to an unclassified version of the CIA inspector general's report.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that the actions by O'Neil and another CIA
executive ''had the effect of delaying a prompt investigation of
this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Deutch's security lapse was found in December 1996 as
he was leaving the agency, the CIA did not submit a report to the
Justice Department until March 1998 and did not notify
congressional oversight panels until June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996, Deutch processed
thousands of highly classified documents on unprotected home
computers that he and family members also used to connect the
Internet, making the information potentially vulnerable to hackers,
according to the CIA inspector general's report. Deutch has
apologized.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Senate Democrats Meet  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARMINGTON, Pa. (AP) -- President Clinton met with Senate
Democrats at a plush resort in the mountains of western
Pennsylvania, spending about two hours talking about pending
legislation, this year's presidential race and the party's future
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The event was closed to the press, but White House deputy press
secretary Jim Kennedy said about 20 senators attended the two-day
annual issues retreat, which ends today at the 2,600-acre complex
with tennis courts, two golf courses and European-style inn.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president spoke for a little while, talking about his
education tour this week and then he took questions and they
engaged in a discussion of a variety of domestic and international
issues -- everything from Russia to racial relations,'' Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Senate Democratic Leader Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., called
it a strategy session to discuss such issues as health care, gun
control, raising the minimum wage and juvenile justice. Panel
discussion topics included technology in the 21st century, privacy
issues and arms control.
</P>
<P>
   ''They talked a little bit about politics, as you might
imagine,'' Kennedy said. ''They talked about the fact that he had
been here (at retreats) all eight years.'' And, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., joked that he hoped the president would return
next year as a ''Senate spouse'' -- a reference to first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton's bid for the Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans hold similar sessions, Republican National
Committee spokesman Chris Paulitz characterized the retreat as no
more than a huddle to coach Vice President Al Gore on an ''attack
strategy'' against his expected GOP presidential opponent, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left before Gore arrived to address the senators at
dinner Friday night. The president traveled to Lancaster, Va., to
attend the wake for the son of a White House employee who works in
the first family's residence.

<HEADLINE> Giants 5, Rockies 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Joe Nathan combined with two relievers on a
three-hitter and J.T. Snow homered Friday night to give the San
Francisco Giants a 5-0 win over the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, which broke open the game with a four-run eighth
inning, has won five straight and 11 of 13 following a 4-11 start.
The Giants stopped Colorado's three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan (2-0) baffled a hot-hitting Colorado team, which came
into the game with a major league-leading .306 team average. The
Rockies had scored 72 runs in their last six games.
</P>
<P>
   Snow sliced an opposite-field liner to left in the second off
Masato Yoshii (1-3), who allowed two hits in seven innings,
retiring his last 15 batters.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco got its eighth-inning runs on Bobby Estalella's
RBI double off Stan Belinda, Calvin Murray's two-run double off
Gabe White and Bill Mueller's run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, clinging to a one-run lead, had walked the bases loaded
with two out in the seventh and went to a 3-1 count on Neifi Perez,
but Perez flied out to center on the next pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan allowed two hits in seven innings, struck out five and
walked three. John Johnstone pitched a hitless eighth and Alan
Embree finished.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter reached against Johnstone on a two-base fielding
error by Mueller at third base with two outs in the eighth, but
Mike Lansing hit a low liner to left fielder Barry Bonds, who went
down on his knees to make the catch.
Notes: Plate umpire Doug Eddings ejected two players, one from
each team, for extended arguments on called third strikes:
Colorado's Jeff Cirillo in the seventh and San Francisco's Jeff
Kent in the eighth. ... Giants manager Dusty Baker said OF Ellis
Burks is ready to rejoin the starting lineup, but kept him out
Friday night because of windy, 55-degree weather. He is expected to
make his first start in seven games Saturday. Burks has been
bothered by a strained left quadriceps. ... Rockies manager Buddy
Bell said OF Tom Goodwin probably will return to the starting
lineup Sunday. He strained his left abductor muscle Wednesday
against Montreal. ... Rockies RHP Rolando Arrojo will be activated
from the disabled list to start Saturday's game. It will be his
first career appearance against the Giants. ... It was the second
shutout of the year for San Francisco, which hasn't been blanked.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 113, Kings 86  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The real Los Angeles Lakers returned for
their biggest game of the season, and the upset-minded Sacramento
Kings didn't stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Looking every bit like championship material after a two-game
fling with self-doubt and mediocrity, the Lakers got a dominant
game from Shaquille O'Neal and turned it into a laugher early in
the third quarter as they steamrolled the Kings 113-86 on Friday
night in the deciding game of the best-of-five first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   With their fans in a mini-panic and the rest of the contending
teams salivating over the prospect of a road to the finals that
wouldn't go through Los Angeles, the Lakers quickly brought
everybody back to reality.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal outrebounded the entire Sacramento team in the first half
and finished with 32 points and 18 rebounds, while the rest of the
team contributed steady offensive production and superb defense.
Shortly after halftime, it was abundantly clear that the Lakers
would pass their first tough test of character with ease.
</P>
<P>
   So lopsided was it that O'Neal and Kobe Bryant sat out almost
the entire fourth quarter, giving the team's two best players some
unexpected extra rest to carry into their second-round series
against the Phoenix Suns beginning Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant finished with 17 points, Glen Rice had 14 and the other
members of the team -- A.C. Green, Robert Horry, Derek Fisher -- who
had been playing poorly or not at all in Games 3 and 4 provided
plenty of support. Green finished with 10, and Horry and Fisher had
eight apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, meanwhile, who shocked everybody but themselves by
tying the series with a pair of home victories, were borderline
pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Getting little from anyone other than Chris Webber, who seemed
to be trying to carry his team by himself, the Kings were
outrebounded 14-12 by O'Neal in the first half and 54-35 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Webber finished with 20, but the rest of Sacramento's starters
shot a combined 7-for-22. Vlade Divac scored just four, Nick
Anderson had three and Corliss Williamson eight.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings fell behind by 35 less than two minutes into the
fourth quarter after consecutive dunks by Horry and O'Neal, and
never really gave themselves a chance to pull off what would have
been one of the biggest upsets in league history by becoming just
the third eighth-seeded team to knock off a No. 1 seed.
</P>
<P>
   Right from the outset the Lakers played with the kind of
calmness that coach Phil Jackson had counseled, and it took less
than 10 minutes for them to open a double-digit lead.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal made his first five shots, Bryant made two of his first
three and it was 25-14 before Sacramento coach Rick Adelman went to
his bench. But unlike in Games 3 and 4 when the Kings' reserves
dominated their Lakers counterparts, this time it was Los Angeles
that got a boost from its backups.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who didn't even get off the bench in Game 4, went
4-for-4 from the field, and Horry was 3-for-4 before the half. And
although the Kings got the deficit down to 10 on a steal by Webber
leading to a fast-break 3-pointer by Predrag Stojakovic, the Lakers
didn't let Sacramento turn it into a sustained run.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant blocked Divac's 3-point attempt just before the buzzer,
and the Lakers went to the locker room with a 59-44 lead behind 20
points and 14 rebounds from O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers came out hot in the third quarter and Divac quickly
picked up a technical foul -- Sacramento's fourth -- when a call went
against him less than two minutes in. You could almost see the
Kings quit right then and there, and it only got worse for them the
rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was 0-for-4 from the foul line when he went there midway
through the third with the crowd chanting ''M-V-P, M-V-P'' and
calmly sank both for an 80-57 lead with 3:32 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson emptied his bench with 10 minutes left in the fourth,
and the early exiting locals started streaming toward the exits
with more than six minutes left.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Among the celebrities in the crowd were Jack Nicholson and
David Spade, who sat courtside in the first row, and Dustin
Hoffman, Salma Hayek and Penny Marshall. ... Sacramento hasn't won
a playoff series since 1991.

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland Plan Faces Hurdles  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A surprise Anglo-Irish plan for
resurrecting Northern Ireland's Catholic-Protestant administration
has raised hopes at a critical hour in peacemaking, but faces
fundamental hurdles in the days and weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 hours of talks with local parties, the British and
Irish prime ministers Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern announced late
Friday that they wanted to transfer power back to local hands on
May 22 -- two years to the day after all of Ireland strongly backed
the landmark Good Friday peace accord. They challenged politicians
within the suspended four-party coalition to shift their fixed
positions and make lasting compromise possible.
</P>
<P>
   But the province's major British Protestant party, the Ulster
Unionists, emphasized that any emerging deal would hinge on whether
the Irish Republican Army agreed to disarm, otherwise they wouldn't
resume sharing power alongside the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party.
</P>
<P>
   That unresolved argument forced Britain to suspend the
coalition's powers in February after just 11 weeks in office. The
IRA, in response, broke off all contact with the province's
independent disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their new formula, Ahern and Blair said one of the
Good Friday accord's goals -- to achieve the total disarmament of
the IRA and outlawed pro-British groups by May 22 -- should be
extended to June 2001. They suggested that verbal commitments from
the armed groups to disarm would be a sufficient starting point.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governments believe that the paramilitary organizations
must now, for their part, urgently state that they will put their
arms completely and verifiably beyond use,'' the prime ministers
said in their joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd be very disappointed if the response from the
paramilitaries was not extremely positive,'' Ahern added.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the two governments said they expected the IRA to
issue a new policy statement this weekend confirming the outlawed
group's intention to resume talks with the disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
   And in hopes of encouraging newfound IRA flexibility on the
issue, Blair suggested that Britain would pursue a policy of troop
withdrawals and army installation closures if the IRA began
scrapping its hidden weapons stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams lauded the prime ministers'
unexpected initiative as ''a very decisive moment'' in efforts to
promote accommodation between the province's long-competing British
Protestant and Irish Catholic blocs.
</P>
<P>
   But Adams, a reputed former IRA commander, declined to comment
on what the group might do and asserted Sinn Fein's right to hold
two posts within the suspended 12-member Cabinet even if the IRA
didn't promise to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Just as importantly, it remained unclear whether Ulster Unionist
leader David Trimble would be able to rally his already bitterly
divided party behind an initiative that would postpone the deadline
for IRA disarmament once again.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, weakened by an unexpectedly strong leadership challenge
last month, also is vulnerable to criticism from his hard-line
rivals for Protestant votes, the Democratic Unionists. That party
holds two posts within the suspended Cabinet -- even though it
opposes sharing power with Sinn Fein under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these obstacles, President Clinton appealed to both
sides to achieve both power-sharing and disarmament as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''I urge the parties and paramilitary organizations to seize
this opportunity to realize these goals in order to restore lasting
peace to the people of Northern Ireland,'' Clinton said in
Lancaster, Va.

<HEADLINE> Vieques Protesters Vow To Return  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Abraham ''Yungo'' Velez tried -- and
failed -- to run the blockade around the U.S. Navy's Vieques bombing
range with his 27-foot fishing boat.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I'll try again,'' he said cheerfully after relating his
escapade Friday to chuckling fishermen at El Yate Bar. ''They can't
stay out there forever.''
</P>
<P>
   On Vieques, people faced the prospect of renewed Navy
bombardment with determination and pride at having won a promise
from the world's only superpower that, if they choose, the Navy
will be gone in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Many insisted that the federal raid Thursday that dislodged 216
protesters from the Atlantic fleet training ground they had
occupied for a year was a temporary setback.
</P>
<P>
   To prove it, demonstrators were hard at work again -- setting up
a new camp next to the training ground, planning meetings and
Masses and vowing to return to the range to halt more exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters occupied the Navy's 60-year-old range in April 1999
after a civilian guard was killed in an accidental bombing. They
stood in the way of a Jan. 31 accord between President Clinton and
Gov. Pedro Rossello allowing the Navy to resume limited training
with inert bombs until 2003, with a Vieques referendum to decide
whether the Navy can stay longer and use live ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy argues that Vieques is vital to national security
because it is the only place that air, land and sea forces can
train simultaneously with live munitions before deploying abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The raid touched off protests outside a federal courthouse in
historic Old San Juan on Friday and forced police to beef up
security at U.S. Army and Navy bases, federal offices and post
offices on the main island of Puerto Rico. National Guard troops
protected water and electricity plants.
</P>
<P>
   Several militants smashed the window of a car carrying former
Gov. Luis A. Ferre as he arrived at the courthouse for a dedication
ceremony. Ferre was not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Protests by students -- and in some cases their professors -- shut
down classes at colleges in the cities of Ponce and Bayamon and
disrupted many classes at the University of Puerto Rico's main
campus in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   In Vieques, protesters pitched a blue tarpaulin and began
hanging up new anti-Navy placards near a police roadblock half a
mile from where U.S. soldiers were dismantling their old camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they think they've stopped us, they're wrong,'' said Norma
Torres, a 53-year-old high school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the detained protesters were back in Vieques within
hours of the raid, whisked home from Roosevelt Roads Naval Station
by a flotilla of fishing boats flying the Puerto Rican flag.
Hundreds of people on shore cheered wildly as the incoming boats
launched red flares into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters said they would redouble their political efforts to
expel the Navy, using the attention the arrests garnered -- as well
as demonstrations in the United States -- to help influence U.S.
lawmakers and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   They questioned how long the Navy could keep its training ground
sealed, even with Marine patrols, helicopter overflights and Coast
Guard ships enforcing a three-mile-wide security zone around the
range.
</P>
<P>
   The training ground's 20 miles of coastline are pocked with
small, sheltered coves. Protesters have repeatedly cut through the
five-mile chain-link fence on its western boundary, sometimes using
horses to travel through brush that is impassable for military
Humvees.
</P>
<P>
   Activist Carlos Zenon claimed Friday that seven people,
including two of his sons, were hiding in the range. The Navy said
it knew of no holdouts and was planning to rapidly resume training.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mapepe is hidden, protected in the hills!'' protesters at the
roadside camp chanted, referring to an alleged ''secret'' camp in
the range.
</P>
<P>
   Even non-protesters said they doubted the battle had ended.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Navy will go back and reclaim its land and the
protesters will head back as well,'' said Federico Campos, a doctor
in the town of Isabel Segunda. ''It's going to start all over
again.''

<HEADLINE> Columbine Athlete Hangs Himself  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Five Columbine High basketball players
gathered on a home patio court to shoot hoops as they struggled to
grasp why their close friend and teammate committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Greg Barnes, 17, who lost one of his best friends and saw
a teacher die in last year's Columbine bloodbath, hanged himself
Thursday while classmates went to school, said neighbor Leonard
Purer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not know if Columbine caused this, but I do know he was
upset by it. All the students were upset by it,'' said Purer, who
has known the family for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   A CD, set to replay continuously, blasted a song by the group
Blink 182 with the lyrics, ''You'll be sorry when I'm gone,'' and
''I never thought I'd die alone,'' said teammate David Mitchell, an
exchange student from Melbourne, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I talked to him the night before, and it didn't seem like
anything was wrong,'' he said Friday as he took a break from the
game on teammate Brian Deidel's court. ''We talked about the usual
stuff, girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Deidel, also a childhood friend of Barnes, said, ''I just didn't
believe it. It was horrible. It made me mad. Mad at Greg.''
</P>
<P>
   Grief counselors cautioned against automatically linking Barnes'
death to the Columbine shootings, noting teen-agers cope with a
great deal of pressure. Suicide is the third-leading cause of death
for people ages 15 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' death came just two weeks after the anniversary of the
massacre. It was the second suicide among friends or relatives of
the victims since October, and the latest in a series of tragedies
that have sent the Columbine community reeling.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators would not say whether Barnes left a note and gave
no additional details. Six counselors came to Columbine Friday, and
substitute teachers were on call to fill in for staff members who
wanted to stay home, said Jefferson County School District
spokesman Rick Kaufman. Many students skipped school.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a somber mood at Columbine High School,'' said Kaufman,
who declined to give details about the death.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's office and the Jefferson County coroner also
declined to provide details. ''Some things should remain
confidential to the family,'' Coroner Nancy Bodelson said.
</P>
<P>
   On April 20, 1999, two teen-age gunmen killed 12 Columbine
classmates and a teacher and wounded 23 people before committing
suicide in the worst school shooting rampage in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was in a science room when the gunmen opened fire. He
told Sports Illustrated he saw teacher Dave Sanders ''take two
shots, right in front of me'' as he watched the rampage through a
window in the door. Barnes was also a good friend of victim Matt
Kechter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Matt always waited by the mailbox for his little brother to
come home from school,'' Barnes told The Associated Press after the
shooting. ''He was the most innocent person I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the massacre, most in the Columbine community have lived
with grief as a constant companion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not know if Columbine caused this, but I do know he was
upset by it. All the students were upset by it,'' Purer said.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of Anne Marie Hochhalter, a student paralyzed in the
shooting, walked into a pawnshop in October, asked to see a gun,
loaded it and shot herself to death. On Valentine's Day, two
Columbine sweethearts were shot to death in a sandwich shop.
</P>
<P>
   At a bagel shop near the school Friday, C.J. Reeh, 72, and his
wife, Irene, stared in disbelief at newspaper accounts of Barnes'
death.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what to think. We thought it would be the last
when the mother shot herself. We don't know what's going to be
next,'' said C.J. Reeh.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3 Barnes, who averaged 26.2 points a game in the
season that ended in March, had drawn interest from several
universities, including Harvard, Yale and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 31 points in Columbine's loss during the state
quarterfinal playoff game in March. The Denver Post and the Denver
Rocky Mountain News named him to their all-state teams, and Barnes
would have been the top player in the state next year, according to
two coaches whose teams played Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought Greg was the kind of person who would do
something like this. He had everything going for him,'' said Jason
Brehm, 17, a junior who shared a history class with Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wasn't the real typical jock who would throw the little guy
around. He didn't try to be the best at everything, except
basketball.''

<HEADLINE> Day one of services marking cardinal's death  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- During his 16 years in New York, Cardinal John
O'Connor was on the altar at St. Patrick's Cathedral for an
assortment of funerals and memorial services: for city heroes, for
New York Yankee great Joe DiMaggio, for the victims of TWA Flight
800 and Swissair Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   Now his chair sits empty, and it is O'Connor's time to be
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 mourners silently walked past his casket Friday
at the start of a four-day farewell to the cardinal, who died
Wednesday night at the age of 80. His body was returned Friday
afternoon to his beloved cathedral, arriving with a full police
escort.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was without a doubt the quintessential homebody,'' said
Bishop Patrick Sheridan, vicar general of St. Patrick's, during a
special rite observing O'Connor's final homecoming. ''His work is
done, and now he's home.''
</P>
<P>
   The remains of O'Connor, who conducted countless memorials for
New York heroes both famed and obscure in the grand cathedral, were
brought up the church steps by eight pallbearers on a warm spring
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Organ music swelled and the church bells rang as the casket was
carried inside. The congregation sang a hymn, ''Now From the
Heavens Descending,'' as the pallbearers -- joined by a phalanx of
priests, nuns and altar servers -- slowly marched through the
church.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-minute service marked O'Connor's return to the Manhattan
church where he presided for 16 years after swapping Scranton, Pa.,
for a position as the nation's highest-profile Roman Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ''He held fast to the traditions handed to him,'' said a teary
Ralph Giordano, 23, who stood on the sidewalk opposite St.
Patrick's. ''I trusted him for that reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's dark wood coffin was carried through the ornate
brass doors of the Fifth Avenue church, then brought up the aisle
and placed at the front of the main altar.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is home now, in his beloved cathedral, the object of our
esteem,'' Sheridan said. ''May God grant him eternal rest.''
</P>
<P>
   A steady flow of mourners -- estimated at about 10,000 -- was soon
marching past the open casket to bid a final goodbye to the late
spiritual leader of the archdiocese's 2.4 million faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt inspired and touched,'' said Frank Zizzo of Levittown,
N.Y., whose wife Josephine visited the casket with him. ''He looked
incredibly at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's body was brought down Fifth Avenue from an Upper
East Side funeral home with an escort of police motorcycles. To the
left of the cathedral doors, the Sisters of Life -- an order of nuns
founded in 1991 by the cardinal -- stood awaiting his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the service, the lid of the coffin was removed to
show the cardinal lying peacefully inside its red velvet. His hands
-- holding a white rosary -- were folded across his white vestments.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's body will lie in the cathedral all day Saturday
and Sunday. The funeral Mass was scheduled for Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, a special Mass was celebrated by the cardinal's
former secretary, Bishop James McCarthy of the St. Elizabeth Ann
Seton parish in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some have asked what will be his legacy,'' McCarthy said.
''May I suggest one: he saved lives -- the lives of the unborn, the
lives of the poor, the lives of those in war-torn nations.''
</P>
<P>
   By the start of the earlier service, the church was nearly full
and more than 1,000 people stood opposite the church. Police
barricades were erected on the cathedral's north and south sides to
handle the expected lines of mourners.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-deep crowds on the sidewalk included a fair amount of
tourists and passers-by along with the mourners. ''Who is coming
out of the church?'' asked Eszter Stampel, 21, a Hungarian student.
''Who is going in?''
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the usual two sign-in books at the front of the
church, an additional 10 were placed for guests to write their
names. The front of the church was festooned with black and purple
bunting.
</P>
<P>
   Following the four-day farewell, O'Connor's body will remain at
St. Patrick's. The cardinal will be interred in the crypt beneath
the cathedral's altar, where all the previous archbishops of New
York are buried.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Toussaint, a former slave who could become the church's
first black American saint, is also interred there. O'Connor
supported efforts to win his sainthood.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings' Bowman Unsure of Future  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Deflecting questions about his future, Detroit Red
Wings coach Scotty Bowman said Friday night he will weigh several
factors before deciding whether to continue coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman's season came to an end when his team bowed to the
Colorado Avalanche 4-2 on Friday night. Colorado won the
best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal series 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman, 66, has been the subject of retirement speculation since
having knee replacement surgery and an angioplasty that caused him
to miss the early part of the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday night's loss, Bowman insisted he didn't enter the
postseason with any plans of either retiring or continuing if his
team won a Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess the first thing I'll do is get a physical,'' Bowman
said. ''There are five ingredients, and the most important is my
health. Then there's Kenny (general manager Ken Holland) and the
way this team wants to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to talk to my wife and with myself, and to my financial
adviser. I haven't thought it all the way yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Already a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, Bowman has coached
eight teams to Stanley Cup titles, and he is the winningest coach
in NHL regular-season (1,144) and playoff (205) history.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of only two coaches in the four major sports to win a
championship with three teams (Montreal, Pittsburgh, Detroit).

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Testimony on Tripp Limited  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Maryland prosecutors must consider
whether to proceed with their wiretapping case against Linda Tripp
now that a judge has suppressed virtually all of Monica Lewinsky's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The former White House intern is the star witness in the
criminal case -- and the voice on the other end of Tripp's secretly
recorded conversations about Lewinsky's affair with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp was indicted last July for secretly making a Dec. 22,
1997, tape of Lewinsky and disclosing its contents for editors of
Newsweek magazine in January 1998. Maryland law prohibits
intercepting telephone conversations without both parties' consent.
Prosecutors say Tripp's secret recordings of her talks with
Lewinsky constitute interception.
</P>
<P>
   Howard County Circuit Judge Diane Leasure on Friday ruled that
Lewinsky can testify that she never gave Tripp permission to tape
record their conversations in late 1997. But Lewinsky won't be
allowed to tell a jury that she and Tripp had the December
conversation Tripp is accused of illegally taping.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking back through the evidence to make sure that,
given what she's suppressed, we still have enough to go forward,''
said assistant prosecutor Thomas McDonough.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp attorney Joseph Murtha said he was encouraged by the
ruling. ''We will not walk away from this day discouraged in any
sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Tripp repeated her assertion that the
state's case is politically motivated
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the court's ruling today, any action by the prosecution
short of dismissal rises to the level of malicious prosecution,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp received federal immunity for her cooperation with
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. State Prosecutor Stephen
Montanarelli was free to bring state charges against her, but could
not use any evidence Tripp gave Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Leasure ruled that Lewinsky's testimony that she independently
remembered the date of the December conversation was not credible,
and that her recollection was tainted by reading Starr's report to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no question that Ms. Lewinsky, perhaps more so than
any other ... state witnesses, had substantial exposure to Ms.
Tripp's immunized testimony and information that came from Ms.
Tripp as a result of her cooperation'' with Starr's prosecutors,
the judge wrote. ''The defense argues that Ms. Lewinsky is 'bathed
in impermissible taint.' The court agrees.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tripp-Lewinsky tapes triggered Starr's investigation of
President Clinton, which led to impeachment proceedings last year.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys argued the judge should dismiss the case
because it was tainted by evidence from the Starr investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Leasure refused to throw out the case, however, because
prosecutors did not let the grand jury hear testimony protected by
Tripp's immunity deal.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Tripp could face 10 years in prison and a $20,000
fine. She is the only major figure in the Clinton sex scandal to
face criminal charges.

<HEADLINE> Liberal Party Sought in N.Y. Race  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton is courting the
leadership of New York's Liberal Party even though one of Rudolph
Giuliani's top political advisers is the party's boss.
</P>
<P>
   Both U.S. Senate candidates were to make separate appearances
today before the party's policy committee in New York City. An
endorsement decision from the party's full state committee could
come in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Kim Serafin said Friday that no
Democrat has been elected governor or senator in New York without
Liberal Party backing since the party's founding in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Clinton's advisers have said they hold out little
hope they can win the Liberal Party nod given that party boss
Raymond Harding is a Giuliani confidant. They have also been trying
to put the best face on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope said chances of a
Clinton endorsement by the Liberal Party were remote, but ''we
assume that none of these institutions are monolithic and you never
know what's around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Liberal Party members said Friday that the Giuliani
forces shouldn't count on walking off with the party's endorsement
and that it may go to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely going to be a dogfight, but I'm really very
confident -- very, very confident,'' said Clinton supporter Joe
Laux, a Liberal Party vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the issue of whether Giuliani will even stay in
the race. The Republican announced April 27 that he was suffering
from prostate cancer. Aides to the mayor say a decision about
staying in the campaign could come by the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Third party endorsements can be critical in New York in close
races, and polls show the Senate race to be just that.
</P>
<P>
   New York, unlike other states, allows major party candidates to
count votes they receive on third-party ballot lines. In fact,
Republican George Pataki beat incumbent Democrat Mario Cuomo in the
1994 governor's race on the strength of the vote from the
Conservative Party line.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Giuliani camp launched a new television
advertisement. Aides said the 30-second spot would air statewide
for about two weeks at a cost that could top $1 million. The mayor
has had campaign ads running off and on for months.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's campaign launched its first statewide TV ad on
Wednesday, also for a two-week run. It is expected to cost about
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the new TV ads attacks the opposing candidate,
although Giuliani's has thinly veiled barbs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be a senator because I was born in this state,'' he
says in it. Until January, Clinton had never lived in New York.

<HEADLINE> US 8, Mexico 0  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Shannon MacMillan scored two goals and Mia
Hamm added a goal and three assists as the United States continued
its dominance of the U.S. Cup with an 8-0 rout of Mexico on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffeny Milbrett, who along with MacMillan got most of the
cheers from their sparse hometown crowd, added a goal as the
Americans cruised to a 4-0 halftime lead. They were never
threatened by the smaller, more disorganized Mexican team.
</P>
<P>
   Team USA has won this tournament all six years it has been held,
outscoring opponents 87-8 in 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   Exploiting a considerable advantage in quickness, seven players
scored for the Americans, including Kristine Lilly, who extended
her world record by playing in her 199th international game for the
U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly, who played her first game with the national squad in 1987
at the age of 16, will reach 200 caps if she plays in Sunday's
championship against Canada. The closest player to Lilly -- man or
woman -- is Hamm, who has 190 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Young U.S. goalkeepers Siri Mullinix and Hope Solo, an
18-year-old freshman at the University of Washington, combined for
the shutout in place of starter Briana Scurry, who is sitting out
the tournament with a thigh injury.
</P>
<P>
   One of those newcomers likely will make the 18-player roster for
the Olympics in Sydney. Assuming new coach April Heinrichs selects
the 15 returning World Cup players she invited to residency camp,
that leaves two open spots in the field.
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan opened the scoring on a penalty kick in just the third
minute. Hamm was brought down from behind by Fabiola Vargas to draw
the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly dribbled past a defender and fired a shot into the left
corner of the goal for a 2-0 lead in the 22nd minute.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Serlenga, playing in just her fourth game, scored her
second international goal -- a powerful shot high into the net -- in
the 25th minute to push the lead to 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Milbrett rebounded her own shot off Mexican keeper Linnea
Quinonez for a 4-0 lead. Milbrett has scored in each of the United
States' four games played in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Lorrie Fair and Christie Welsh also scored goals for the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the draw of the Mexican team on Cinqo de Mayo, only
6,517 fans braved the chill to watch both games at Civic Stadium. A
crowd of 23,325 turned out for Team USA's ''send-off'' match for
the World Cup last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Canada defeated South Korea 1-0 earlier in the night.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament is sponsored by Nike.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Faces Trouble in Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By DAFNA LINZER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- For the United Nations, there is more at
stake in its handling of the current crisis in Sierra Leone than
the freedom of peacekeepers being detained there by rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The world body may have a difficult time getting countries to
volunteer troops for future missions, including one planned for the
Congo, and is at risk of being branded incapable of its very
mandate -- resolving conflict and protecting the weak.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a crisis as much for Africa as for the U.N. and
African leaders need to resolve it because there is little
likelihood of any meaningful action in the Congo unless the Sierra
Leone operation is seen to be functioning satisfactorily,'' said
David Malone, president of the International Peace Academy, an
independent institution specializing in peace and security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionary United Front rebels have captured an estimated 300
U.N. personnel sent to Sierra Leone to supervise the fragile peace
accord that ended eight years of civil war. So far this week, four
peacekeepers from the U.N. mission are missing and presumed dead
and 12 more have been wounded.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Security Council issued a statement Thursday
demanding the release of its people and accusing rebel leader Foday
Sankoh of violating the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone said the statement was weakly worded and the United
Nations needed to take a tougher line with Sankoh if it expects to
shore up support for future peacekeeping missions elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.N. needs to make clear to him more directly that the arm
of justice is longer than it was 10 years ago, that criminal
tribunals have been set up, that an international criminal court
has been agreed upon and that all these things have been done
precisely to deal with the kind of people that he appears to be,''
Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called on Western powers,
including the United States and Britain -- Sierra Leone's former
colonial master -- to provide rapid-response teams to the war-torn
region, a move policy analysts believe unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. policy has been to support Africans in resolving
conflicts on their own continent,'' said Tim Bork, director of the
African Policy Initiative for the Carnegie Endowment. ''I don't
think there would be support for U.S. troops swooping in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The West shied away from African intervention after 18 Americans
were killed in a botched U.S. raid in Somalia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Bork called the crisis in Sierra Leone ''a temporary setback''
but did not think it would diminish chances for a peacekeeping
mission in oil- and diamond-rich Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congo is a very important country and could not only cost us
in economic terms but in a lot of other ways as well,'' Bork said.
The opportunities for success in Congo provide the Clinton
administration -- which has had a tough run in foreign policy -- with
the chance to prove itself in Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is
in Congo discussing details of a deployment with the parties
involved there, but his efforts were hampered by renewed fighting
between Ugandan and Rwandan troops that claimed the lives of at
least 10 civilians on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   John Stremlau, a former State Department official who teaches
international relations at the University of Witwatersrand in
Johannesburg, South Africa, believes the United Nations often goes
into areas with its hands already tied.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Sierra Leone, he said, the organization was
expected to police a shaky peace accord that installed Sankoh in
the Cabinet and freed him from prosecution for the brutal actions
of his forces during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have been accused of killing thousands of civilians
and maiming many more -- often chopping off limbs with machetes -- in
their war to oust the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, the U.N. is only what its members want it to be.
It's being asked to do things that are pretty impossible because
governments are always trying to offload responsibilities on it,''
Stremlau said.

Lewinsky Testimony on Tripp Limited
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Maryland prosecutors must consider whether to
proceed with their wiretapping case against Linda Tripp now that a judge has
suppressed virtually all of Monica Lewinsky's testimony. The former White House
intern is the star witness in the criminal case -- and the voice on the other
end of Tripp's secretly recorded conversations about Lewinsky's affair with
President Clinton. Tripp was indicted last July for secretly making a Dec. 22,
1997, tape of Lewinsky and disclosing its contents for editors of Newsweek
magazine in January 1998.

Cardinal O'Connor's Farewell Begins
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands of mourners silently watched the start of a
four-day farewell to Cardinal John O'Connor Friday in services held at his
beloved St. Patrick's Cathedral. Organ music swelled and the church bells rang
as eight pallbearers carried the casket inside the grand cathedral where
O'Connor conducted countless memorials for New York heroes both famous and
obscure. The 40-minute service marked O'Connor's return to the Manhattan church
where he presided for 16 years as the nation's highest-profile Roman Catholic.
O'Connor, 80, died Wednesday night in his residence behind the cathedral after
battling cancer for months.

Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and British Prime Minister Tony Blair said all sides
had agreed to consider a ''target date'' for resuming power-sharing.

Big Game Jackpot Swells to $230M
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Americans lined up at convenience stores and joined office
pools for a shot at instant riches as the jackpot in Friday night's Big Game
drawing swelled to $230 million -- the second-largest lottery prize in U.S.
history. ''They say money can't buy happiness, but I'm willing to try,'' said
Kevin Stoerch of Escanaba, Mich. Many players bought dozens and even hundreds of
$1 tickets, apparently pooling their money with co-workers or simply trying to
improve the odds. The odds of getting all six winning numbers were one in more
than 76 million.

garage as a CD, set to replay continuously, blared a song with the words: ''I'm
too depressed to go on.'' It was the second suicide among friends or relatives

Lakers Eliminate Kings
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Looking every bit like championship material after a
two-game fling with self-doubt and mediocrity, the Los Angeles Lakers got a
dominant game from Shaquille O'Neal and turned it into a laugher early in the
third quarter as they steamrolled the Sacramento Kings 113-86 on Friday night in
the deciding game of the best-of-five first-round series. O'Neal outrebounded
the entire Sacramento team in the first half and finished with 32 points and 18
rebounds, while the rest of the team contributed steady offensive production and
superb defense.

<HEADLINE> 300 Held Hostage in Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations was appealing for
international help in shoring up its beleaguered peacekeeping
mission in Sierra Leone, where an estimated 300 U.N. troops were
held captive and at least four were dead after clashes with rebels.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said officials were trying to rally
regional support to press rebel leader Fodoy Sankoh to release the
hostages. Malian and Nigerian delegations have visited Sankoh in
the capital of Freetown. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who has
long had ties to Sankoh, also promised to talk to the rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
   Annan also was trying to mobilize support for reinforcements.
The United States, Britain and France have been approached but have
not offered ground troops. Britain has agreed to provide a
technical support team to help with logistics. Washington was
studying a request for air transport.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations evacuated at least 90 non-essential, non-U.N.
international aid workers and family Friday. But there has been no
serious public discussion yet whether the United Nations would
evacuate any of its 8,700-strong peacekeeping force or its civilian
staff in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, U.N. officials appear resigned to the fact that the
clashes and hostage-taking this week by the Revolutionary United
Front has jeopardized the ''basic premise'' of peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this case, one of the major parties has backed out of the
agreement and has gone and attacked that very peace force. The very
basis of this mission is now in question,'' U.N. spokesman Lt. Col.
Jaswinder Sandhu said Friday in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Four Kenyan U.N. peacekeepers are believed to have been killed
in the clashes and 12 have been injured, Eckhard said. Six rebels
were killed, RUF spokesman Eldred Collins said in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first detained were six U.N. civilians -- a four-man
helicopter crew and two passengers -- who were released Friday from
Kailahun in the east. Liberian President Charles Taylor, a longtime
ally of Sankoh, interceded with Sankoh to call for their release.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 300 U.N. peacekeepers and observers remained
hostage, including a 208-man Zambian contingent seized as it moved
into the central town of Makeni to reinforce U.N. troops who came
under fire earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF denied it held any hostages and suggested instead that
the troops may have gotten ''lost in the bush'' during fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard said Friday that helicopter surveillance showed rebels
manning some of the 13 armored personnel carriers -- emblazoned with
the U.N. logo on the side -- that were taken from the Zambians.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. mission for Sierra Leone was dispatched in December to
oversee the peace agreement that ended a brutal eight-year civil
war that left the country in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   A power-sharing agreement was reached last July between the
government and the RUF, but this week's fighting has threatened
that. The RUF claims the clashes began because peacekeepers were
forcibly disarming RUF fighters -- a charge U.N. officials deny.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard stressed that U.N. troops had a mandate to use deadly
force to protect themselves and civilians in imminent danger -- but
that any decision on that would be made by the force commander.
</P>
<P>
   ''The emphasis is not to go to war with the RUF,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Canada 1, South Korea 0  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Andrea Neil's header off a corner kick in
the 71st minute gave Canada a 1-0 victory over South Korea in the
semifinals of the U.S. Women's Cup on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Canada will play the United States, an 8-0 winner over Mexico,
in Sunday's championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have won the tournament all six years it has been

</P>
<P>
   Neil's goal was set up by Sharolta Nonen's corner kick. Canada
was awarded the kick when Christine Sinclair missed a point-blank
shot in front of the goal, and after the ball bounced off keeper Ho
Jung Jung, a South Korean player booted it out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a minute after the goal, Canada goalkeeper
Nicole Wright made a diving save to prevent the tie. Wright made
another diving stop in the opening seconds of stoppage time.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Made Sure Lakers Would Win  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Score this one for the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson made all the right moves during the fifth and
deciding game as the Los Angeles Lakers rolled past the Sacramento
Kings 113-86 Friday night and into the second round of the NBA
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But it was what he did in the two days beforehand that was
probably even more important.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who coached the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships
in the 1990s, was calm, cool and even a little chippy.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fret over a dicey situation, he embraced it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told them, 'If you can't survive in this kind of adversity
at this point in the playoffs, then we're not going to hang
together as a group. Why even go on?' '' Jackson said a day before
the Lakers avoided one of the biggest upsets in NBA playoff
history.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice, who had 14 points, five rebounds and six assists,
said the Lakers ''weren't too much worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Their coach wouldn't allow that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, we were ready, very focused, came out with a lot of
firepower, very aggressive,'' Rice said. ''We wanted to let them
know we meant business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said veterans A.C. Green and Robert Horry, the power
forwards, had to shoot the ball more than they had in two losses in
Sacramento that tied the best-of-five series 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   And so they did.
</P>
<P>
   While Shaquille O'Neal was making his first five shots en route
to a 32-point, 18-rebound performance, Green took four shots in the
first quarter, making one. Horry fired away upon entering the game,
and made his first three shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''You saw A.C. hesitate a couple times before he shot, wide-open
shots,'' Jackson said in his meeting with reporters 90 minutes
before the opening tipoff. ''He should shoot those shots, he's a
veteran. That's what I'm talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Fisher watched from the bench as the Kings led all the way
in winning a 101-88 decision in Game 4. In this game, he was called
upon late in the first quarter, and made four outside jump shots in
as many attempts to help the Lakers take a 59-44 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was no contest after that.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher admitted he was hurt about not playing in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody on the team wants to help the team,'' he
said. ''It was tough for me to deal with, I hadn't dealt with that
it 3{ years. It was tough, but you always have to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fish is a soldier, he steps up when the coach calls on him,''
said Kobe Bryant, who had 17 points and six assists. ''Tonight, he
was more than ready. Fish's defense ignites his offense. He came
out and got his hands on the ball a couple times, made some big
shots, kept them from sagging in on Shaq. He really stepped up, he
answered the call.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry was 3-of-4 in the opening 24 minutes, giving the Lakers 14
big points from a group of reserves that contributed little in the
two games at Arco Arena.
</P>
<P>
   At one point before the game, Jackson suddenly flashed a big
grin and said, ''This is a game, is that right?''
</P>
<P>
   And he also said, ''I was concerned with a long layoff without a
game and here we are, playing Friday. I think it's better to do it
this way, sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The point? It's better to do whatever it is you're doing. Always
put a positive spin on whatever happens. And that's what Jackson
has generally done in his coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran John Salley, who played for Jackson in Chicago, said
before the game the Lakers were ''right where we're supposed to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   How did he know?
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been here before,'' Salley said. ''The way we practiced,
everybody took it to the utmost seriousness. They weren't tense,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   And did he expect to win?
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, yeah, I always expect to win,'' Salley said. ''I never
expect to lose. If I expected to lose, I'd have stayed home with a
virus, a hangnail.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a player coached by Phil Jackson, whose 114-43
record in playoff games (.726) is the best in NBA history. He may
have had the best players, and probably does now, but certainly
he's fulfilled his role.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers now face the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference
semifinals, starting Sunday at Staples Center, where they've won 20
of their last 21 games.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Candidates Campaign in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE RAY ORTIZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- They are far from home and from the voting
booths where Mexico's next presidential election will be decided,
but the immigrants who toil in the United States are nonetheless
being courted by top candidates.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Vicente Fox, the political cowboy who hopes to
upset Mexico's long-ruling party in the July 2 election, makes a
campaign swing north of the border. On Sunday night, Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, the former Mexico City mayor who is running third in
polls, heads to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was to be feted in a downtown parade in Chicago on Saturday.
Then it was on to California for a rally in Bakersfield, a Cinco de
Mayo celebration in Fresno, and appearances before state lawmakers
in Sacramento. Cardenas planned two days of meetings with Mexican
citizens, support groups and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   But just what is a Mexican presidential contender seeking by
campaigning in a foreign country where his compatriots have no
power to cast ballots? In a word, influence, according to Fox fans
and observers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fox is very intelligent,'' said Ezequiel Banda Sifuentes, a
leader in a pro-Fox group based in Chicago. ''He sees what other
people don't seem to realize -- that we are Mexicans who go to
Mexico, who write letters, who call our mothers, fathers and
sisters almost every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates hope to benefit from the great influence the
immigrants hold. Not only do many head families, the earnings they
send home total some $7 billion a year, making it Mexico's
third-largest source of legal income behind oil and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are a pillar of the Mexican economy. Without us, the system
would fall down,'' said Luis Magana, coordinator of an immigrant
assistance group in Stockton who plans to listen to Fox in Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States there are some 7.2 million Mexican-born
immigrants -- who would represent more than 10 percent of the
Mexican electorate if they were allowed to vote from abroad,
according to a study by Mexico's Federal Electoral Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But an effort to grant that power died last year in the Mexican
Senate where it was blocked by members of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which has governed for 71 years straight.
</P>
<P>
   Both Fox and Cardenas have supported absentee voting. Fox, of
the pro-Roman Catholic and pro-business National Action Party, is
governor of Guanajuato state, which has a high number of U.S.
immigrants, and is well aware of the need to appeal to the
expatriates.
</P>
<P>
   He has spoken of his desire to make schoolchildren computer
literate and English savvy, and supported a call to expand the
North American Free Trade Agreement to include the free flow of
labor over border lines.
</P>
<P>
   And by promoting his reputation as a man of the campo -- the
countryside -- he is not only playing to migrant workers but
fighting for the poor voters who traditionally have been squarely
behind the ruling party, said David Shirk, a recent fellow at the
Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Diaz, a Guanajuato native who works in television
production in Fresno, is already rooting for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've already talked to my family and told them to listen to
his message. It's about time we have a new Mexico,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With recent polls showing Fox nearly tied with ruling-party
candidate Francisco Labastida, support won from immigrants could
help decide July's election. Labastida's advisers say he doesn't
plan to visit the United States before the elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if he went to California, he probably would end up not
being well received by the migrant population,'' said Jesus
Martinez Saldana, an analyst with Instituto Mora, a research center
in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Labastida opposed the voting-abroad movement,
Martinez said, but as a candidate of the ruling party he could face
criticism for the economic situation that has forced Mexicans to
leave their country. And his support for giving Mexicans abroad the
right to vote has been lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   Magana, whose hometown of Jaripo, Michoacan, sees 90 percent of
its people migrate to the United States, says he'll be listening to
Fox's message very closely and discussing it with his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need more seriousness, not just someone who comes to take a
photo with the migrants without making any promises,'' he said.
''We are here, but we live economically supporting and building
Mexico.''

<HEADLINE> DeHaven Hopeful at Marathon Trials  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL, AP Track Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Rod DeHaven turned away from his computer and
turned up the mileage for Sunday's U.S. Olympic marathon trials.
</P>
<P>
   A computer programmer, DeHaven reduced his work schedule to six
hours a day in January in hopes of making the team that will go to
Sydney in September.
</P>
<P>
   It has given him more time to fit in his workouts. Now, he tries
to squeeze in 10-12 miles before work and five miles at lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   ''The workouts are going much better,'' said DeHaven, the
third-fastest qualifier in the field of 106 at 2 hours, 13 minutes,
2 seconds. The time is faster than the Olympic standard of 2:14:00,
but it was posted at the 1998 Chicago Marathon, before the first
Olympic qualifying date.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, in order to make the team, DeHaven will have to
finish in the top three Sunday and break 2:14:00.
</P>
<P>
   He knows it will not be easy, because of the expected
unseasonably warm weather scheduled for race time; the fact that he
has done it only once, over a fast, flat course, and the Pittsburgh
terrain is tough and hilly; and he has been bothered by a back
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   His confidence comes from two good races this year. He won a
half-marathon in January at 1:03:12, beating the field by more than
a minute, and he won a 10,000-meter race in March at 28:17.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was his best time, but they were good enough to show
DeHaven that he still is very competitive.
</P>
<P>
   He had his concerns last year after two disappointing marathons.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the Boston Marathon, he was brimming with confidence,
hoping to run 2:11. Instead, he struggled to finish at 2:19:23.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a good season on the roads last summer, he competed
in the marathon at the World Championships at Seville, Spain. On a
brutally hot day, he wound up 24th at 2:19:06.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was not happy about my place, but I was happy to have
executed my plan, and I had some consolation of being the first
American finisher,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He knows he doesn't necessarily have to be the first finisher
Sunday, possibly only for financial reasons -- the winner gets
$40,000, the runner-up $25,000 and third-place $20,000, plus
Olympic team bonuses of $35,000, $15,000 and $10,000, respectively.
There is the possibility that if he wins and doesn't break 2:14, he
would be the only U.S. marathoner at the games.
</P>
<P>
   ''After Boston last year, things didn't go well,'' DeHaven said.
''(At Seville), I underestimated the heat. I had calf problems. I
suffered quite a bit in the middle of the race. I just jogged in
the last 10 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, I have gotten smarter and I'm prepared to run better in
the heat. After Boston and Seville, I changed my training. Now,
I've concentrated on long tempo runs. I've gotten away from the
track for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the marathon is a crapshoot for me. I enjoy racing, but
training can be a drag.''
</P>
<P>
   The marathon is a crapshoot for most runners, since they don't
get many opportunities to run the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I probably will have to run 2:12 to make the team,'' he said.
''If I don't make the team, I probably will go for the 10,000 (at
the track trials in Sacramento, Calif., in July).
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be the last serious (Olympic) marathon chance of my
career. At age 33, I don't see myself getting down to 2:06.''

<HEADLINE> Davies, Turner Share Philips Lead  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- With the iron shots Laura Davies is
hitting, she has little need for her driver.
</P>
<P>
   Using a 3-iron on nearly every driving hole, Davies shot a
3-under-par 67 in the second round Friday to move into a
first-place tie with Sherri Turner at the Philips Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't really need it on this course,'' Davies said of her
driver, which hasn't come out of its fuzzy puppy head cover in a
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm playing my irons so well. When you hit as long as I do,
one bad shot and you're in a lot of trouble. It's a much easier
game when you don't have to worry about hitting a driver off
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Averaging about 230 yards off the tee with her 3-iron, Davies
was nearly perfect down the fairways and into the greens on a day
when scores were generally low in a constant, sometimes swirling
wind.
</P>
<P>
   Davies held a 1-stroke lead over Turner at 6 under before
3-putting her last hole to drop back into a tie.
</P>
<P>
   One of the longest hitters on the tour, Davies ranks 32nd in
driving distance largely because she rarely uses her driver.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Englishwoman used a driver was in the first
round of the Chick-fil-A Charity Championship last week in Atlanta,
where she tied for seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit it straight left and out of bounds,'' and put it back in
the bag, she said. ''It's nice to hit fairways and just play
steady.''
</P>
<P>
   Steady sums up the first two rounds for Turner, a 16-year pro
who hasn't won since 1989 or lived up to the promise of her LPGA
Championship victory in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   After a 65 on Thursday, Turner started Friday with a birdie. But
she got just two more the rest of the day and gave away each of
them with three bogeys as she finished with an even-par round of 70
on the 6,101-yar Onion Creek course.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said the hard part of leading on the weekend will be
keeping her eyes off the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just have to relax and have a good time,'' she said, showing
little, if any, tension as the co-leader. ''I don't feel like I
have any pressure this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Akiko Fukushima of Japan was part of a
six-way tie, 1 shot back at 136. Canada's Dawn Coe-Jones and Peru's
Alicia Dibos made a late charge when both aced the 156-yard eighth
hole.
</P>
<P>
   Also at 4 under were Jill McGill, Scotland's Janice Moodie and
Susie Redman, all of whom have yet to win an LPGA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Coe-Jones was 2 under with two holes to play when she landed an
8-iron on the front of the green at No. 8 and ran it 45 feet into
the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could sit here and say that's what I was aiming at, but with
a hole-in-one you need some luck,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 minutes later, Dibos did the same thing with a 7-iron.
</P>
<P>
   ''She opened it up for me,'' Dibos said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Steinhauer, who started the day tied for first at 5
under, fell well back into the pack at 1 over with a round of 76 on
the course she played regularly as an All-American at the
University of Texas.

<HEADLINE> Franco, McCallister Share Compaq Lead  </HEADLINE>
By MARY FOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- With a spectacular 7-under-par run in a span
of six holes, McCallister latched onto a share of the lead after
the second round of the Compaq Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I made the eagle I said, 'Wow!' Shoot three birdies and
an eagle on four holes and that kind of gets your mind going,''
McCallister said. ''Then I follow it right up with great putt on
the next hole. But I was able to stay in the present and not get
hung up on what I was shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   McCallister birdied Nos. 7-10, eagled the par-5 11th and closed
the scoring spree with a birdie on No. 12. The 7-under run is the
best six-hole streak on the PGA Tour this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, defending champion Carlos Franco caught McCallister
with a 5-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   McCallister finished with a 7-under 65 to match Franco at
10-under 134 on the windswept English Turn course. It's the first
time since 1993 that McCallister has held or been tied for the lead
after 36 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've shot some pretty good rounds in my career. I just haven't
put enough of them together in awhile,'' said McCallister, who has
won five times on the tour, but not since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, from Paraguay, had seven birdies for his second straight
67.
</P>
<P>
   ''I checked the score all the time,'' Franco said. ''I watched
the leader and knew where he was. Now I am in a very good position.
Now I have a good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco has mastered the course the past two years. He is a
combined 29-under-par in six rounds at English Turn and has yet to
post a round in the 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Edwards and Australia's Stuart Appleby were a stroke back
at 135, and Glen Day, Paul Stankowski, Jay Williamson and Trinidad
and Tobago's Stephen Ames followed at 136.
</P>
<P>
   The wind picked up throughout the day, with McCallister and the
other early starters facing gusts up to 15 mph and Franco playing
in gusts to 25 mph in the afternoon. Thirty-five players broke par
in the morning, compared to 17 in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day, the golf course is different, but my game is very
confident,'' said Franco, the 1999 PGA Tour rookie of the year who
has four top-10 finishes this year. ''I have a good game for the
wind, but I need a little luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby drew attention in the first round when he waded into the
water on the par-3 12th hole and blasted his ball from the pond
onto the green to save a bogey, leaving a muddy mess on his pants.
On Friday, he stayed dry and added a 66 to his first-round 69.
</P>
<P>
   ''The course at times is playing borderline, really, really
nearly impossible on a couple of holes, just from the way the wind
is blowing and the greens are drying out,'' Appleby said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who shot a 66, is coming off his best finish of the
year, a tie for third last week in the Houston Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''A couple of weeks ago, I was really struggling with my swing,
and I got a little bit of help from my brother-in-law,'' Edwards
said. ''I started playing a lot better and with a little bit more
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack and Gary Nicklaus missed the cut. Jack Nicklaus shot a 77
for a 147 total, and his son had a 73 for a 149 total.

<HEADLINE> Illegal D Calls Set Tone for Kings  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Following the Lakers' second defeat by
Sacramento, Los Angeles coach Phil Jackson claimed the Kings were
playing zone defense against Shaquille O'Neal without being called
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute into Friday night's fifth and deciding game
of their playoff series, the Lakers received an illegal defense
warning. Some two minutes later, the Kings were called twice in a
six-second span for being in an illegal defense, with the second
call a technical.
</P>
<P>
   That was the end of Sacramento defenders trying to sag back and
block the passing lane into the Lakers' big center, who scored 32
points and had seven of his rebounds on the offensive end of the
court.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers hit from outside, too, in their runaway 113-86
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (the referees) let us know they were here very quickly,''
Sacramento coach Rick Adelman said. ''I was very surprised the way
it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, they read the papers. If that's how it's going to
be, anybody who's going to play them (the Lakers) is in big
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Adelman quickly added, however, that the Lakers simply outplayed
his team.
</P>
<P>
   ''They controlled the tone of the game from the very start,'' he
said. ''They had us on our heels from the very start.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tried to get something going, but they wouldn't let us.
When they came out in the third quarter and ran it (the lead) to
25, that was pretty much it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings shot a miserable 34 percent, and Chris Webber, with 20
points, was their only player in double figures. Even he went
7-of-21 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just didn't play well,'' said Vlade Divac, who scored only
four points on 2-of-6 shooting against his former team. ''They are
a very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento's starting lineup had only 41 points -- to 45 by their
'Bench Mob' that was a key to the team's wins in the third and
fourth games.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight year, the underdog Kings rallied after
losing their first two games of the postseason. But unlike a year
earlier, when they extended Utah into overtime before losing Game
5, they were never really in the showdown against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed we lost, but we'll get better,'' Divac
said. ''Next season, we need to play hard so we can have the
homecourt advantage for the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings haven't won a playoff series since 1981, when they
were still in Kansas City.

<HEADLINE> Report: LAPD Faces Rights Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Justice Department officials will bring a
civil rights lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department
unless city officials agree to a number of reforms, the Los Angeles
Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-year probe that in recent months has focused more
on the department's Rampart station scandal, in which officers are
said to have framed, beat, robbed and shot innocent people, federal
investigators now believe they have enough evidence to sue the
LAPD, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office
served search warrants related to its Rampart probe at the homes of
17 Los Angeles police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rampart investigation has led to the dismissal of more than
80 convictions and the resignations, firings or suspensions of some
30 officers. Criminal charges have been filed against three
officers, and Police Chief Bernard Parks has said he expects more
people to be charged.
</P>
<P>
   Sources told the Times that Bill Lann Lee, the head of the
Justice Department's civil rights division, was to meet Monday
afternoon with a number of local officials, including the city
attorney, police chief and at least two City Council members.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has been monitoring the department since
1996 to determine whether it is guilty of a pattern of abusive
behavior. In recent months the probe has concentrated on the
Rampart scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Although it wasn't known what reforms officials might demand in
exchange for not suing, in previous cases they have insisted on the
appointment of an outside auditor.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's searches were condemned by Ted Hunt, president of the
Los Angeles Police Protective League. He said prosecutors served
the warrants about 7 a.m. in front of officers' children and
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said the police union plans to go to court to challenge the
confiscation of notes from one officer's meetings with his attorney
and his defense representative.
</P>
<P>
   DA spokeswoman Victoria Pipkin said all 17 warrants were signed
by Superior Court Judge Larry Fidler. She refused to discuss
specific information about the warrants, which are sealed.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Party Hangs Over EU Talks  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WIELAARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FURNAS, Azores (AP) -- The presence of the far-right Freedom
Party in Austria's government is casting a shadow over a meeting of
European Union foreign ministers gathered to debate European
security and EU enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, a mainstream
conservative, increased pressure on his partners Friday to end
bilateral sanctions on cultural and sports exchanges imposed after
he formed a government with the Freedom Party on Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Party has been embroiled in controversy since its
former leader, Joerg Haider, praised the ''orderly'' employment
policies of Nazi Germany and called Waffen SS veterans ''men of
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel's government issued an 18-point action plan to get the
sanctions dropped. If not, Austria will hold a referendum in the
fall in which voters could demand their fellow Europeans return to
business as usual. Such a referendum, although it will have largely
symbolic value, would be unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Neves, a spokesman for Portugal, which holds the EU
presidency, insisted that the sanctions are bilateral matters, not
an EU issue.
</P>
<P>
   That reasoning infuriates Austria, which argues that banning
cultural and sports exchanges may be mild measures but they pollute
the atmosphere at EU meetings when French, Belgian and other
delegates shun the usual group photo sessions. The sanctions also
fuel calls from Freedom Party officials for Austria to veto EU
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian Vice Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer, head of the
Freedom Party, said Friday that it ''was time to act'' to get
European nations to drop their bilateral measures.
</P>
<P>
   Before a referendum, Austria plans to conduct opinion polls with
EU citizens, send prominent Austrians in fields such as politics,
economics and culture to visit EU counties and have Schuessel visit
the EU executive commission in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers were to meet in a historic residence amid
gardens and natural springs on Sao Miguel, one of Portugal's Azores
islands.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda includes a debate about the Balkans and efforts to
revamp the EU's aid programs, which EU foreign and security policy
chief Javier Solana says are hobbled by red tape. Since 1991, the
EU and its member states have provided about $17 billion in aid to
Balkan nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkan debate will include a review of efforts to bring
lasting peace and reconciliation to Kosovo, where the NATO allies
have deployed 40,000 peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the ministers also will debate how to breathe new
life into discussions on overhauling the European Union's
convoluted decision-making rules. While all agree this is necessary
before the next round of enlargement in 2004 or thereabouts, the EU
governments are deadlocked in reform talks that began in February.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has said it also wants to discuss Zimbabwe, where mobs
and ruling party militants have occupied scores of farms in recent
days. By Friday, armed black squatters were camped on nearly 760
white-owned farms and had staked claims to a total of 1,190.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal O'Connor's Farewell Begins  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- During his 16 years in New York, Cardinal John
O'Connor was at the altar in St. Patrick's Cathedral for an
assortment of funerals and memorial services: for city heroes, for
New York Yankee great Joe DiMaggio, for the victims of TWA Flight
800 and Swissair Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   Now his chair sits empty, and it is O'Connor's time to be
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 mourners silently walked past his casket Friday
at the start of a four-day farewell to the cardinal, who died
Wednesday night at the age of 80. His body was returned Friday
afternoon to his beloved cathedral, arriving with a full police
escort.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was without a doubt the quintessential homebody,'' said
Bishop Patrick Sheridan, vicar general of St. Patrick's, during a
special rite observing O'Connor's final homecoming. ''His work is
done, and now he's home.''
</P>
<P>
   Organ music swelled and the church bells rang as the eight
pallbearers carried O'Connor's casket inside the cathedral. The
congregation sang a hymn, ''Now From the Heavens Descending,'' as
the pallbearers -- joined by a phalanx of priests, nuns and altar
servers -- slowly marched through the church.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-minute service marked O'Connor's return to the Manhattan
church he led for 16 years as the nation's highest-profile Roman
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   His dark wood coffin was carried through the ornate brass doors
of the Fifth Avenue church, then brought up the aisle and placed at
the front of the main altar.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is home now, in his beloved cathedral, the object of our
esteem,'' Sheridan said. ''May God grant him eternal rest.''
</P>
<P>
   A steady flow of mourners was soon marching past the open casket
to bid a final goodbye to the late spiritual leader of the
archdiocese's 2.4 million faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt inspired and touched,'' said Frank Zizzo of Levittown,
N.Y., whose wife Josephine visited the casket with him. ''He looked
incredibly at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's body will lie in the cathedral all day Saturday
and Sunday. The funeral Mass was scheduled for Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, a special Mass was celebrated by the cardinal's
former secretary, Bishop James McCarthy of the St. Elizabeth Ann
Seton parish in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some have asked what will be his legacy,'' McCarthy said.
''May I suggest one: he saved lives -- the lives of the unborn, the
lives of the poor, the lives of those in war-torn nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the four-day farewell, O'Connor's body will remain at
St. Patrick's. The cardinal will be interred in the crypt beneath
the cathedral's altar, where all the previous archbishops of New
York are buried.

<HEADLINE> Better if Stroke Victims Go Home  </HEADLINE>
By TROY GOODMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Rehabilitation from a stroke appears to be more
effective when patients are sent home earlier from the hospital,
according to a study published in the latest issue of Stroke, a
journal of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers concluded that stroke patients undergoing at-home
therapy mastered simple tasks such as walking up stairs, doing
housework or working in the garden more quickly than those who had
longer hospital stays.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about being at home and being reintegrated back into
society, which we've shown actually improves the physical
well-being of these survivors,'' said Nancy Mayo, an epidemiologist
at McGill University in Montreal who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   Mayo and her team studied 58 patients who were chosen at random
to go home early and 56 others who were not, then tested both
groups three months later to see how their rehabilitation was
going.
</P>
<P>
   The average hospital stay for the patients who were discharged
early was 10 days -- six days shorter than patients who underwent
conventional rehabilitation in the hospital or at an outpatient
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The patients who underwent therapy at home all had a caregiver
in the house and were visited by physical therapists and other
aides.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who received the traditional post-stroke care at
hospitals or outpatient clinics were about five points behind the
home-rehabilitation group when ranked on a physical well-being
scale of one to 50.
</P>
<P>
   At the three-month mark, the stroke patients who went home early
were already back to doing chores around the house and even walking
several blocks for therapy. They also did better at resuming their
roles as parents or spouses and kept in closer touch with friends
and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Mayo said the findings support other research that seems to
point toward early hospital discharge once the patient is medically
stable as the best way to get people back to a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rehabilitation should get people back to playing golf, back to
work and driving the car,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The study clearly points the way toward changing post-stroke
care toward more home rehabilitation, said University of Kansas
Medical Center epidemiologist Pamela Duncan, director of research
at the hospital's center on aging.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just means that if you can get the support at home, it
really improves the quality of life for these patients,'' Duncan
said.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Hostage-Taker Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Kidnapping and assault charges have been
filed against a man who kept police SWAT teams at bay for three
hours while holding his estranged wife hostage at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage drama that emptied a 10-story medical building ended
peacefully Friday when Donald T. Ross surrendered to police
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, 29, of Concord, turned himself over to police shortly
before noon, said police Maj. Tim Stewart, who headed the police
SWAT team at the scene. Police said Ross' wife, Sandy, also 29, was
unharmed, and no shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had separated about a week ago, police said, and Ross
expressed to negotiators that he was upset over their marital
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ross released a second woman who suffered an asthma attack after
being held captive more than an hour, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in fatigues, black cap and a black T-shirt with the
professional wrestling slogan ''Layeth the Smacketh Down,'' Ross
was hustled out of the Metroview Professional Building by officers.
</P>
<P>
   Ross was charged with second-degree kidnapping and assault by
pointing a gun. He could receive up to more than eight years in
prison if convicted on both charges.
</P>
<P>
   The episode began when Ross, armed with a BB gun with a silencer
made from a Coca-Cola bottle and carrying a briefcase containing
several knives, duct tape and twine, entered the building's ninth
floor about 8:30 a.m., just before the office opened.
</P>
<P>
   Ross pointed a pistol at several clinic employees, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of police cars converged on the scene and about 250 to
300 workers were evacuated from other floors.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said they were able to make contact by phone with
Ross very quickly after arriving on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a little tense with us, but he was willing to listen
and he expressed himself very well,'' said police Sgt. Glen
Gigante.
</P>
<P>
   A turning point was when Ross agreed to release the asthmatic
hostage, Gigante said.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen or so employees on the ninth floor who were unable
to slip away hid under desks during the entire incident, Stewart
said. ''I don't think that he knew the people were in there,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Development Bank Protested  </HEADLINE>
By BUSABA SIVASOMBOON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) -- About 2,000 demonstrators pushed
over crowd-control barriers and confronted riot police today in a
protest against the Asian Development Bank, which opened its annual
meeting inside a heavily guarded university conference center.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, chanting slogans against the ADB, sat at both
ends of the road outside the Chiang Mai University hall and vowed
to block the delegates from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of riot police bearing clubs and shields kept a tense
eye on the protesters from behind other barriers.
</P>
<P>
   A group of demonstrators pushed the lines of riot police, who
pushed back. About 100 students managed to scale a wall around the
conference center, but were quickly surrounded and staged a sit-in.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the protesters were from non-governmental organizations
or had lost their land or livelihood due to ADB-funded projects.
They have taken their lead from protests at the World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle last year and the recent World Bank
and International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   They view the Manila-based ADB as another multilateral
institution that promises to help developing countries but instead
reinforces the global financial order at the expense of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters' leaders said they wanted to present ADB
President Tadao Chino with a list of demands: that the bank stop
making loans that increase the indebtedness of poor nations, end
funding for a controversial wastewater treatment project near
Bangkok and quit making loans to governments that disrupt the lives
of small farmers and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Myoung-ho Shin, an ADB vice president, went outside and received
the demands, and said they would require study.
</P>
<P>
   Somchai Sirichai, 38, a representative of 38 non-governmental
organizations outside the conference center, said they wanted Chino
to answer the demands in detail by Sunday. Chino has refused to see
them.
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting, officials from the ADB, regional finance
ministries and central banks gave predictions for their economies,
which are expected to collectively post the world's fastest growth
rates this year.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the board of governors, Chino said clean governance
was needed to reduce corruption and avoid a repeat of the economic
crisis that devastated Asia in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Asia must not revert to business as usual, taking the crisis
as simply a short-term aberration,'' he said. ''The weaknesses in
the corporate and financial sectors and in governance structures
that were revealed during the crisis need to be speedily
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the sidelines, Thailand and some other members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations lobbied to move toward an
Asian monetary fund that would act as a lender of last resort to
regional governments in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand wants Japan, China and South Korea to join the 10 ASEAN
members in a plan under which each country would hold reserves in
the others' currencies and come to the rescue in case of
speculative attack.
</P>
<P>
   Japan proposed creating an Asian monetary fund at the outbreak
of the crisis, but the idea was shot down by the United States,
which preferred to let the Washington-based IMF deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Some Asian leaders felt the IMF was serving Washington's
economic interests, not theirs, and the organization itself has
admitted mistakes in diagnosing the reasons for the meltdown and in
some of the remedies prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Thai officials have been careful to say that any regional fund
would complement, not compete, with the IMF and World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Lottery: No Big Winner in Big Game  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Americans lined up at convenience stores and
joined office pools for a shot at instant riches as the jackpot in
Friday night's Big Game drawing swelled to $230 million -- but no
one won the second-largest lottery prize in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The jackpot now grows to $300 million, lottery officials said.
The next drawing is May 9.
</P>
<P>
   Many players bought dozens and even hundreds of $1 tickets,
apparently pooling their money with co-workers or simply trying to
improve the odds. The odds of getting all six winning numbers were
one in more than 76 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say money can't buy happiness, but I'm willing to try,''
said Kevin Stoerch of Escanaba, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's winning numbers were: 6-8-16-30-32 and Big Money Ball
26. None of the tickets sold matched all of the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three second-prize winners did win $150,000. Three hundred
fifty-five players matched four of the five lotto numbers, plus the
Big Money Ball number. Those tickets are each worth $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-state Big Game is played in Georgia, Illinois,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia. The
jackpot swelled from $5 million to $230 million after going eight
weeks without a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd be happy with $5 million,'' said Robert Trasak, a
36-year-old delivery driver and occasional lottery player who
bought 20 tickets at a Detroit gas station as the jackpot climbed
higher and higher. ''But something about $220 million makes you
say, 'I really got to win that one.'''
</P>
<P>
   People from North Carolina streamed into Charley's Stop and Shop
in Danville, Va., to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been terrible today,'' said clerk Kaye Dicks, who saw the
line grow to more than 50. ''They've had their hands full of
cash.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pilot Travel Center near the Alabama state line, a line
of 40 ticket buyers stretched out the door and around the building.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just playing because it's so high,'' said Lisa Gray of
Alpine, Ala., who drove 40 miles to stand in line with her
4-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   The winner can take the money in 26 annual installments of $8.8
million before taxes, or receive a lump sum of roughly $114
million. Federal and state taxes would reduce that to roughly $80
million.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest jackpot in U.S. history is $295.7 million, won by a
group of 13 machinists from Westerville, Ohio, in 1998.

<HEADLINE> No One Wins $230 Million Lottery  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICIA M. LaHAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The millions of lottery players who lined up at
convenience stores, drove across state lines and joined office
pools for a shot at instant riches in the $230 million Big Game
jackpot will have yet another chance to do it all again.
</P>
<P>
	   No ticket matched all five numbers plus the Big Money Ball in
Friday's drawing, so the sum grew to a record $300 million for the
next drawing on May 9.
</P>
<P>
	   ''It's the largest jackpot in U.S. history,'' said Parquita
Nassau, spokeswoman for the Georgia Lottery.
</P>
<P>
	   The numbers drawn Friday were: 6-8-16-30-32 and Big Money Ball
26. The odds of getting all six winning numbers were one in more
than 76 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-three second-prize winners did win $150,000. Three hundred
fifty-five players matched four of the five lotto numbers, plus the
Big Money Ball number. Those tickets are each worth $5,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven-state Big Game is played in Georgia, Illinois,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia. The
jackpot swelled from $5 million to $230 million Friday after going
eight weeks without a winner.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously, the largest jackpot in U.S. history was $295.7
million. It was won in 1998 by a group of 13 machinists from
Westerville, Ohio, in the Powerball drawing, another multistate
game.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest Big Game jackpot ever won -- $197 million -- was
awarded in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   ''It's very rare to have a jackpot this big, but when you do you
sell an extraordinary number of tickets -- many to first-time buyers
and people who cross state lines to buy tickets,'' said Rebecca
Paul, director of the Georgia Lottery Corp., which administers the
game.
</P>
<P>
	   About $32 million in Big Game tickets were purchased in Georgia
alone between Tuesday's and Friday's drawing. That compares to
about $1.5 million in sales for the Georgia Lottery's $3 million
prize drawing on Saturday, Paul said.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul said she isn't allowed to play any Georgia lottery games,
including the Big Game. Formerly employed by the Florida lottery,
Paul said she still has plenty of friends in that state and when
the jackpot grows irresistible she sends them a few dollars and
asks them to buy her tickets.
</P>
<P>
	   ''I'm just like everybody else,'' Paul said. ''When it's big, I
play. When it isn't, I don't.''
</P>
<P>
	   The winner can take the money in 26 annual installments of $8.8
million before taxes, or receive a lump sum of roughly $114
million. Federal and state taxes would reduce that to roughly $80
million.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Fight Over Statistics  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential campaign is turning into
Stats Wars as Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush reach
for the statistics that will let the political force be with them.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are coming fast and furious:
</P>
<P>
   --Almost half of Texas prisoners go back behind bars in three
years, Gore claimed in a slam on Bush's ''revolving door'' justice
system. Drug use by teen-agers has almost doubled in the
Clinton-Gore administration, Bush shot back.
</P>
<P>
   --Test scores show Texas students are lagging, Gore says. Charges
Bush: Federal prisons have cut drug-treatment beds by one-third.
</P>
<P>
   Some figures that underpin the accusations are outdated or
unsupported, such as Gore's claim of rising Texas recidivism under
Bush. Others, like Bush's point about higher teen-age drug use, are
essentially correct but fall short of telling the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   It almost does not seem to matter, observes David Murray, an
anthropologist who studies the use and misuse of numbers.
Statistics are a way to ''condemn and indict in a hurry,'' he said.
Best of all for a candidate, he said, in quoting them ''you both
get authoritativeness and no accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray is research director for the Statistical Assessment
Service, a think tank that works for better understanding of
scientific and social research and debunks spurious statistical
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the service has taken issue with assertions that the
declining infant mortality rate has something to do with the
closing of nuclear power plants. It has faulted for improbable
precision a federal study that said a 20-cent increase for a
six-pack of beer could reduce gonorrhea by 9 percent. And it has
dissected and disputed claims that the number of missing or
abducted children runs into the tens of thousands a year.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics are powerful, Murray said. They come down from a dark
sky of confusion, bringing a bright flash of clarity to everything.
''It's stolen lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   Passed on by ''the priests in white coats,'' as he put it,
statistics are grasped by politicians seeking advantage, government
officials wanting fatter budgets, advocates wanting this and that,
and then are hurled at a debate with all the certitude of Zeus.
</P>
<P>
   ''The voice of power and authority is with me,'' Murray intoned,
slipping into the spirit of a Stats Warrior. ''If you argue with me
you're actually arguing against things as they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Unchecked in the absence of debates since the end of the
primaries, Gore has been firing away with tax, environmental and
crime numbers to show his opponent would chew up the Social
Security surplus and has made a mess of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has dueled with opponents throughout the primaries and now
with Gore on whether Texas numbers show higher achievement in
schools and lower taxes for citizens -- and whether he's had
anything to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Charges are made and denied, and campaigns release their
supporting evidence, which is sometimes thin and occasionally
wrong. But by then, the candidates have moved on to another
statistical frontier, leaving behind an aura of science from their
number-dropping.
</P>
<P>
   Recidivism in Texas prisons is not up under Bush, as far as
anyone knows. Because of the long lag time in analyzing how many
convicts go back after three years -- the standard measure -- no such
figures have been released yet on inmates let out since Bush became
governor in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, blaming Bush for a ''revolving door'' prison system in
a major crime speech last week, claimed rates under Bush have gone
up almost to 50 percent -- a figure actually operative when Democrat
Ann Richards was governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign got the figure from newspaper and magazine
stories that published it without attribution to any source or
without saying when the finding of nearly 50 percent was made.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest figures from Texas, three-year
recidivism dropped to 40.8 percent for prisoners released in 1994,
Richards' last year in office.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, denying charges that drug-treatment programs
have been reduced for prisoners in Texas, accused the Clinton-Gore
administration of cutting drug-treatment beds for federal
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department figures backed up Bush's claims. While the
percentage of prisoners in mainline drug treatment dropped by about
a third, however, the percentage in alternative forms of drug
counseling doubled from 1991 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   With instant information now so widely accessible, Murray says a
bum number is even more likely to live on than before. ''Once
something gets passed into the media bloodstream, it's almost
impossible to get it out again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was intrigued by the theory that statistics have special
power in campaigns because they lend credibility to an enterprise
that so many people don't trust.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not sure about that. He doesn't have the numbers to
back it up.

<HEADLINE> Year goes fast with hot primary contests for U.S. Senate  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- In no time, this year has become
politically hot in New Jersey, providing voters with contested,
closely fought primary races for U.S. Senate on both sides of the
political aisle.
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks leading to June 6 were precipitated when U.S. Sen.
Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., decided early last year not to seek
re-election when his term expired at the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The contest became more complicated when his colleague, U.S.
Sen. Robert Torricelli, a chief national strategist for the
Democrats, recruited millionaire Jon Corzine, recently deposed as
chairman of Goldman Sachs, to run for Lautenberg's seat to keep it
in Democratic hands.
</P>
<P>
   And it turned topsy-turvy when the presumed front-runner for the
job, Republican Gov. Christie Whitman, decided last September to
bow out of the contest after talking about it and fueling GOP hopes
all summer.
</P>
<P>
   The fight for the Republican and Democratic nominations is wide
open, and the only political novice on the scene, Corzine, has
already shattered campaign spending records, so far deploying more
than $10 million just in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Following are thumbnail profiles of the six candidates.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   Jon Corzine
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, 53, of Summit, wants to win the campaign with
handshakes and personal charm. For good measure he is pouring
millions of dollars into TV commercials at a rate that may shatter
national records for spending in his effort to overcome a hostile,
well-known opponent and his own lack of name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   A former Wall Street financier with a fortune estimated at $300
million, Corzine is backed by the state Democratic Party and its
major leaders and county organizations, but he has fumbled some
under campaign pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Florio
</P>
<P>
   For Florio, 62, of Metuchen, this is a last chance to revive a
political career spanning four decades. Outspent and lagging in
party support, he is on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Florio tries to build mistrust of his wealthy opponent for a
cash-driven ''hostile takeover'' of the party while defending his
own decision as governor to raise taxes in 1990, from which his
party has yet to recover. Having run close in three statewide races
he has won or lost, Florio commands a loyal base of rank-and-file
Democrats, according to polls and pundits.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   Bob Franks
</P>
<P>
   Franks, 48, of Berkeley Heights, has spent seven years in the
U.S. House of Representatives emphasizing causes important to New
Jersey over those with partisan appeal or national import.
</P>
<P>
   A former state party chairman, Franks has won major county GOP
endorsements and hews to the traditional formula for Gov. Christie
Whitman and state Republicans, opposing taxes and government
spending, but moving center on abortion, gun control and campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gormley
</P>
<P>
   Long a prominent figure in the state Senate, Gormley, 54, of
Margate, has failed in previous campaigns for the GOP nomination
for governor and for Congress in the 2nd Congressional District. He
has since worked to broaden his record and his appeal, converting
hostility from pro-gun lobbies into a political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Many recognize a new, improved Gormley, including Donald Trump,
a one-time rival who is now raising money for him. Gormley is
expected to have a money edge, but strong efforts to win at least
one county endorsement north of Trenton failed.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Treffinger
</P>
<P>
   A son of Democrats, Treffinger, 49, of Verona, ventured into
bedrock Democratic territory to win two terms as Essex County
executive, making his career a case study in bureaucratic reform,
fiscal overhauls and political power-building. He calls on
Republicans to shed their image as the party of Wall Street and
become the ''party of the people,'' though he has had limited
success appealing to Republicans outside his Essex-Passaic base,
where he cuts into Franks' support.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Sabrin
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin, 53, of Leonia, was the Libertarian Party candidate for
New Jersey governor in 1997, but now shifts to the GOP, where his
anti-abortion views make a better fit. Seen as trailing the field,
the Ramapo College professor has shunned traditional party
organizations. He offers a neat picture of staunch conservatism,
opposing government regulation such as auto emissions tests,
opposing gun control and affirmative action. His Libertarian roots
explain his support for legalization of drugs and prostitution.

<HEADLINE> Euro Becomes Early Embarrassment  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Heralded at its champagne-soaked launch in Jan. 1,
1999 as a rival to the almighty dollar, the euro was supposed to
help unify Europe's nations into a global economic force -- a
super-currency that would draw investors from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the euro has plunged on currency markets, shedding
almost a quarter of its value since debuting. The embarrassing
sell-off accelerated this past week, sparking government calls for
calm among consumers nervous over the prospect of scrapping their
marks, francs and lira for a single currency.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the concern is premature: The euro is still just a
bookkeeping tool for governments and businesses: it doesn't go into
circulation until 2002. And the grand monetary experiment has
already helped the economies of the 11 countries involved.
</P>
<P>
   But the early setback clearly is humbling.
</P>
<P>
   Warnings are heard about a ''crisis of confidence'' among those
who will have to replace the money in their pockets. Die-hard euro
opponents are renewing demands for the monetary union to be called
off, while its key architects, like former German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, remain conspicuously silent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of dynamism for Europe, the euro has brought
dynamite,'' said Wilhelm Hankel, one of four economics professors
who went all the way to Germany's constitutional court in a futile
attempt to stop the euro in 1998, saying a single currency violated
German sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Intended to reflect Europe's burgeoning strength and unity, the
euro's weakness has highlighted disagreements in ''Euroland'' about
who to blame and what should be done, if anything, to reverse the
slide.
</P>
<P>
   After the euro dipped below 90 cents to the dollar for the first
time last week, the German government said it viewed the situation
with ''great calmness'' and believed no action was required. But a
day later, French Premier Lionel Jospin suggested ''a collective
response'' by the European Union, the United States and Japan
''should be considered'' to restore confidence in the euro.
</P>
<P>
   EU finance ministers plan to tackle the euro's problems at their
regular monthly meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven out of 15 EU countries have adopted the euro: Austria,
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Britain, Denmark and Sweden opted
out.
</P>
<P>
   Greece, which initially didn't have its fiscal house in order,
got the OK from EU officials this past week to join the pack.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation has to be confirmed by European leaders at their
summit in June. But some analysts said the prospect of Greece,
notorious for undisciplined finances in the past, coupled with the
recent government turmoil in Rome, may have helped push the euro
down in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Others, perplexed by the euro's dive, say economic fundamentals
in the zone overall are rosy.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation is still comfortably low at roughly 2 percent. Growth
is catching up to the United States, with unemployment sinking for
the first time in years. Corporate mergers are picking up pace and
taxes are coming down.
</P>
<P>
   ''The long-term trends are very, very good,'' said Josef Joffe,
co-publisher of Germany's respected Die Zeit newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he added that much of the credit actually goes to the
euro, which has created a huge domestic market for European
producers similar to that U.S. companies enjoy. The underlying
currencies have been fixed to the euro since its launch, insulating
the businesses keeping their books in euros from currency swings
and creating a broad new market for euro-denominated stocks and
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet currency traders are instead looking to the United States,
where dollar investors currently enjoy higher interest rates and a
rocketing stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The negative impact of the currency's dive is already hitting
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans could end up feeling shortchanged when traveling
abroad, since they'll have to pay more for dollars when exchanging
currencies. And prices of imports may rise in Europe, since it
takes more euros to buy products from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   European Central Bank president Wim Duisenberg took the unusual
step Friday of issuing a special statement not to currency traders,
but to consumers worried that the weak euro would drive up prices
in the stores and eat away at their savings and pensions.
</P>
<P>
   But the lanky Dutch banker doesn't yet command the same respect
as those who shepherded the rock-hard Deutsche mark over the past
50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which accounts for a third of Europe's economic might,
under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder also hasn't been showing the
kind of leadership that Kohl did in promoting the euro and
explaining its benefits to a skeptical population, said Angelika
Volle, executive editor of Internationale Politik, the quarterly
journal of the German Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This euro thing has never ever been an economic project, it's
always been a political project,'' she said. ''We need political
action.''

<HEADLINE> Subpoenaed Notes Put on Web  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- The Wichita Eagle, found in contempt of
court for refusing to turn over a reporter's notes from his
interviews with a murder suspect, published them on its Internet
site before giving them to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle editor Rick Thames said, ''We reluctantly decided to
comply with the judge's order after ... determining that an appeal
would be difficult at best in this particular case.''
</P>
<P>
   Sedgwick County District Judge Clark Owens found the newspaper
in contempt Tuesday after refusing its motion to quash a subpoena
for the notes and fining the paper $500 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Owens had said the notes should be turned over because they
contained material which was not available to prosecutors from any
other source.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves the March 27 killing of teacher Janice
Vredenburg, 52, at her Wichita home. Tanner Green, 23, is charged
with first-degree murder in her death.
</P>
<P>
   Green, a parolee who has refused to talk to police since being
accused of the crime, proclaimed his innocence in jailhouse
telephone interviews with reporter Tim Potter, giving a detailed
account of where he said he was on the day of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Potter's story on Green's comments was published April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, his notes, drafts and other unpublished material
relating to the Green interview were subpoenaed.

to say would be less inclined to talk to The Eagle if they believed
the mere issuance of a subpoena could turn the newspaper into an

justice.''

<HEADLINE> Festival Planned for Rock Museum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Metallica, Patti Smith, James Brown, Beck, Bo
Diddley and Alanis Morissette are booked for a three-day music
festival kicking off the opening of Paul Allen's new rock museum.
</P>
<P>
   About half the events are free at the festival, which begins
June 23. None of the performances will be in the interactive
Experience Music Project museum being built by the Microsoft
co-founder at the base of the Space Needle.
</P>
<P>
   The building, with dramatic metal loops and swirls, was designed
by architect Frank Gehry.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to be able to do things in this facility that
you're not able to do in any other museum,'' said Kathy Scanlan,
the museum's deputy director, referring to interactive features
that will enable visitors to listen, watch and even play along with
their favorite musicians.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is expected to open on the first day of the music
festival. The lineup was announced Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Tribe's Native Speaker Was Outsider  </HEADLINE>
By JIM DAVENPORT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The man cited as the last native speaker
of the Catawba Indian language and praised as a preservationist of
the tribe's culture was not Catawba at all, a Smithsonian
Institution linguist says.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Red Thunder Cloud, who died in 1996, had Rhode Island and
Maryland forebears and not the South Carolina tribal roots he
claimed, said Ives Goddard, who runs the Smithsonian ethnology
department.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, Red Thunder Cloud contributed to understanding
and protecting native cultures, particularly the Catawba language,
which tribal leaders have been struggling to preserve.
</P>
<P>
   ''Red Thunder Cloud's accomplishment in becoming a speaker of
Catawba puts him outside the class of ordinary impostors,'' Goddard
wrote in an article released Friday by the Society for the Study of
the Indigenous Languages of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ''He made a contribution, there is no question about it. He did
field work on this native language. ... He had papers on it that we
hope someday to have access to,'' Goddard said. ''I wouldn't pass
judgment on the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wes Taukchiray, an expert on Catawba history and genealogy, said
Goddard's research did not change the image of the man he
corresponded with for years -- the man who corrected his Catawba
pronunciations.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'm interested in is that he learned how to speak the
Catawba language conversationally,'' Taukchiray said. ''I'm not
really concerned about his ethnic origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Goddard tracked down family trees and public records available
on the Internet and found Red Thunder Cloud's was born Cromwell
Ashbie Hawkins West, not Carlos Ashibie Hawk Westez, the name he
gave friends.
</P>
<P>
   He had claimed he learned Catawba from his mother's father,
Strong Eagle, a Yale Law School graduate who died in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   But Goddard said Red Thunder Cloud's true maternal grandfather
was William Ashbie Hawkins, one of Baltimore's first black lawyers.
He said the man's father was a druggist named Cromwell West from
Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Goddard said he first became acquainted with Red Thunder Cloud
in the 1960s through an article that included his supposed Catawba
family tree.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody ever tracked down who all these people were,'' Goddard
said.
</P>
<P>
   But when a friend began working on a book that included Red
Thunder Cloud and sought Goddard's input, the linguist began
checking out his family history.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Red Thunder Cloud's death in Massachusetts, Foxx
Ayers, a friend of Red Thunder Cloud's and a member of the tribe's
executive committee, said Red Thunder Cloud was not an official
member of the tribe although he had visited its reservation several
times.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is good now that something has been written officially
showing his background,'' said Claudia Priester, the applied
linguist at the Catawba Cultural Preservation Project in Rock Hill.
The nearby Catawba reservation in north-central South Carolina is
home to about half of the Catawba's 2,600 members.

<HEADLINE> Chief D.C. Judge Hires GOP Lawyer  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chief federal judge in the District of
Columbia has hired prominent Republican attorney Michael Madigan to
represent her in a judicial misconduct investigation of why she
assigned campaign fund-raising cases and a Whitewater prosecution
to Clinton appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Legal sources at the courthouse said that in recent weeks before
Chief U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson hired Madigan, she
summoned at least three clerk's office employees to her chambers
and questioned them about their recollections of the handling of
the cases.
</P>
<P>
   One employee was brought back for at least one additional round
of questioning by Johnson and all three employees were questioned
in the presence of a court reporter, said the sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A former assistant U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia
from 1969-73, Madigan was chief counsel for Sen. Fred Thompson's
campaign finance investigation of fund-raising abuses in the 1996
election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've known the chief judge for a very long time and she is not
only one of the finest judges in the country, but one of the most
honorable people I have ever met,'' Madigan said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The clerical employees who were questioned by Johnson process
incoming case filings. Ordinarily, cases are assigned at random by
a computer system which the clerk's office administers.
</P>
<P>
   In the rare instances where a case is specially assigned by the
chief judge, the chief judge's office must have some contact with
employees in the clerk's office in order to direct a prosecution to
a particular judge.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson questioned the employees after a decision in early
February by the Judicial Council of appeals and district judges at
the courthouse to revive a complaint against Johnson that had been
filed last year by a conservative group, Judicial Watch. The
complaint was based on Johnson's assignment of two high-profile
prosecutions of presidential friends -- a tax evasion case against
Webster Hubbell and a campaign fund-raising case against former
Little Rock, Ark., restaurateur Charlie Trie.
</P>
<P>
   The Judicial Council reinstated the complaint after a Republican
congressman, Rep. Howard Coble of North Carolina, disclosed that
four additional cases involving alleged Democratic fund-raising
illegalities had been directed by Johnson to recent appointees of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Also working with Madigan in representing Johnson is former
House of Representatives legal counsel Steve Ross, a Democrat also
with the same firm as Madigan -- Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has rejected an invitation from Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind.,
to testify to the House Government Reform Committee on May 17 about
the special assignments in the high-profile cases.
</P>
<P>
   Burton spokesman Mark Corallo declined to comment, but according
to courthouse sources who have seen the letter signed by both
Madigan and Ross, the lawyers cite separation of powers between the
branches of government for her decision not to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, according to the legal sources, responded with a request
for information about any other cases that Johnson might have
assigned outside the computerized random selection process.
</P>
<P>
   Madigan, who was assistant minority counsel to the Senate
Watergate Committee, specializes in white-collar criminal defense
work, complex civil litigation and has represented officers and
directors of Fortune 500 companies in various congressional
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   He has served on the judicial nominating commission for judges
in the District of Columbia and the board of governors of the
District of Columbia Bar.

<HEADLINE> House May Not Hold Elian Hearings  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Politics, public opinion and wariness about
past investigations are prompting House Republicans to skip
hearings into the Elian Gonzalez case, a turnabout for a party
whose other productions showcased Ruby Ridge, campaign finance and
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   There are dissenters, among them Reps. Bob Barr of Georgia and
John Doolittle of California. Both spoke up at a recent private
meeting to urge hearings into last month's predawn raid by armed
government agents who took the boy from the home of Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've had a very egregious violation of fundamental
constitutional rights, and if we don't have hearings on this we're
going to give our stamp of approval,'' Doolittle said in a
subsequent interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Speaker Dennis Hastert, who initially wanted hearings ''into
the Clinton-Gore Justice Department's tactics and response'' in the
case, told fellow Republicans he no longer feels that way. Instead,
he is asking Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, to conduct an inquiry as the basis for a written report.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not planning hearings now,'' Hyde, R-Ill., said late last
week. ''I'm saying there could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps not.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is similar in the Senate, where GOP leaders backed
away from plans for full-fledged hearings after airing the issue
privately. Several sources, who declined to identified by name,
said word had been relayed to George W. Bush's presidential
campaign that there will be no high-profile effort that might turn
attention away from the party's principal goal, which is winning
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Hyde, Hastert, Barr and others are united in
expressing disgust at the Immigration and Naturalization Service
operation that reunited the boy with his father. Father and son
remain at a secluded retreat on Maryland's Eastern Shore.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said at the closed meeting of the rank and file,
according to several participants, that he was horrified to see
pictures of armed INS agents take the boy. He considered the
episode un-American, the participants said.
</P>
<P>
   But other factors are at work.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a fierce election-year battle to hold the House,
many Republicans profess optimism about recent polling. Some argue
hearings would be a distraction from a core GOP message that
includes cutting taxes while protecting the Social Security
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we should be talking about is, 'We balanced the budget,
and we reformed welfare.' That's what we should be holding hearings
on,'' said Rep. James Walsh, a New Yorker who also spoke up at last
week's GOP caucus, or conference.
</P>
<P>
   Others note that polls indicate the public generally feels the
issue is essentially a custody fight, and 6-year-old Elian should
be with his father. Some Republicans said they fear hearings could
appear to place the GOP on the other side, particularly given the
strong feeling of many conservatives that nothing justifies sending
the boy back to Fidel Castro's communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''I talked to a lot of people at home during the break, who told
me he should be with his father, and we ought to stay out of the
issue,'' said Rep. Howard McKeon, R-Calif., who spoke on the issue
at the weekly GOP whips meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, ''We have not seemed to do very well at
hearings. ... I think that could be a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, top GOP aides made the same point more emphatically.
Republicans dealt awkwardly with extremist groups in the Ruby Ridge
hearings, in the view of some Republicans. That case dealt with the
death of white separatist Randy Weaver's wife at the hands of an
FBI sharpshooter in the 1992 siege in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign finance hearings into allegations of wrongdoing by
President Clinton turned into a political brawl as Democats sought
to tarnish the effort. Dissatisfied with conduct of the probe,
then-Speaker Newt Gingrich insisted on dismissal of a top aide to
Rep. Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican who led the investigating
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment hearings 18 months ago became highly partisan as
Democrats labored to depict Republicans as political extremists
determined to overturn a national election.
</P>
<P>
   ''The administration has proven themselves to be very adept at
obfuscating and stonewalling and turning hearings into circuses,''
said Ed Gillespie, a former aide to Majority leader Dick Armey and
communications director at the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''And even though it's the administration that's the clowns,
it's the (Republican-controlled) Congress that gets the fallout.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats reject Gillespie's characterization of them but share
the broader point. Several aides interviewed last week saw hearings
as a potential political plus for the Democrats and expressed hope
the Republicans would plunge ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans who feel that way are in the minority among
their peers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Too many people are paying too much attention to polls and are
more interested in responding to polls than they are to actually
leading the nation,'' Barr said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The case ''has nothing to do with the issues of custody per se.
It has to do with whether the Department of Justice abides by the
same rule of law'' as the rest of the country.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Governor Endorses China Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If U.S. business doesn't get a crack at
selling American cars, food and manufactured goods to China's 1.2
billion consumers, companies in other countries surely will,
Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist argued Saturday in the Republicans'
weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should agree to permanent normal trade relations with
China to ensure that Americans gain business opportunities in ''the
world's biggest and most important emerging market,'' Sundquist
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last fall, China agreed to unilaterally open its markets to
other nations, including the United States, and to play by
international rules of trade. The only question now is whether the
Chinese buy from the U.S. or from another country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a popular view among state governors, 43 of whom signed a
letter to House and Senate leaders last week in support of
permanent normal trade with China. President Clinton is leading the
drive to normalize trade.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would give China the same permanent low-tariff
access to American markets now routinely extended to almost every
U.S. trading partner. China's status currently must be renewed
every year.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also would ease China's entry into the World
Trade Organization, the Geneva-based organization that sets the
rules for world trade. China will have the conditions negotiated
with the United States even if the legislation is rejected, but
benefits for U.S. traders would be denied.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing congressional objections, the Clinton administration
has said it will work to ensure that China lives up to its promises
to further open its markets if Congress votes for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   A House vote is expected in two weeks. If it passes, the Senate
likely would take it up next month.
</P>
<P>
   Sundquist admitted that China must improve its human rights
record, but he said Republican governors believe trade and
communication with China will put China ''on the path to a more
democratic society.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Developing China's private sector through commerce and trade
is the best way to free the Chinese people from government control
and ensure their continued exposure to freedom,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New budget, same old way of deciding the toughest issues  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- As much as legislative leaders kept
stressing the words ''open'' and ''in public'' when discussing how
the 2000-01 state budget was negotiated, the most important issues
were again settled in closed-door bargaining sessions among the
leaders and Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Year Three of the use of budget conference committees by the
Legislature saw lawmakers continuing to give more credit to the
committee process than it deserved, based on key provisions of the
final budget the committees had nothing to do with.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and Pataki committed to spend about $77.5 billion for
the year beginning April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the nine conference committees of Assembly and Senate
members which met between April 5-17 decided how to spend ''only''
about $1 billion. And the parameters of their spending was in most
cases set in advance by the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the legislative leaders and Pataki made deals
among themselves on $1.5 billion worth of tax cuts; on presenting a
$3.8 billion transportation bond act to voters this November; on a
$34.2 billion, five-year capital plan for transportation and mass
transit; on a record $1.2 billion aid increase for public schools;
on a debt-reform initiative, to mention only a few examples.
</P>
<P>
   This came after private negotiations among the legislative
leaders and Pataki in December produced a new deal on New York's $9
billion health care financing system, including a new health
insurance program for up to 1 million working poor New Yorkers and
a near doubling of the state's cigarette tax to a
highest-in-the-nation $1.11 a pack.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric to the contrary, Albany remained a place during the
2000 budget negotiations where an extraordinary amount of power is
concentrated in the hands of the governor, the speaker of the state
Assembly and the majority leader of the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the risk of stating the obvious, the budget process is
still in great need of reform,'' said Martin Connor, who is leader
of the Senate's Democratic minority.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year the budget negotiation process in some small way
took on the look of being open to the public. But as soon as the
ship hit the shoals, it was up to the three leaders -- and not
rank-and-file members of the Legislature -- to patch the leaks.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's budget was approved on May 5; last year, the impasse
went on until Aug. 4. From the standpoint of timing, the
legislative leaders and governor weren't nearly as bad in 2000 as
they have been in some past years.
</P>
<P>
   But they never came close to reversing what is now a
16-year-long skein of failing to pass a timely budget.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno insisted repeatedly in March
and April that he would not be involved in old-style
''three-men-in-a-room'' budget negotiating sessions with Pataki and
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver over the 2000-01 budget. Yet
participate he did, and after the budget was passed he sounded
resigned about the necessity of such closed-door bargaining, at
least late in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ''We keep trying to keep the process public and we went with the
conference committees and it's about as public, I guess, as it can
be when you're preparing to wind things up and close,'' he said.
''It's apparent that some discussion must take place (in private)
as they take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver said making deals on the most significant budget issues
is what there are leaders for.
</P>
<P>
   ''Debt reform is an issue that took place between leaders,'' he
said. ''Cleaning up transportation, cleaning up various things that
the subcommittees did is the job of leadership. I think it was a
good mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Silver and Bruno said rank-and-file legislators were
satisfied they were involved in the budget process in a significant
way. Silver said if the reports of the nine subcommittees were
''lined up'' with spending in the final budget, the subcommittee
recommendations were closely followed.
</P>
<P>
   Closely, but not religiously if it did not fit into the leaders'
designs.
</P>
<P>
   The health conference committee recommended an Oct. 1 start date
for an expansion of the EPIC prescription drug program for senior
citizens, for example. When the final version of the budget
emerged, ''leadership'' had been pushed back to Jan. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   And Pataki's shadow hung over the conference committee process,
or, rather, the prospect of him making wholesale vetoes to the
budget the Legislature sent him. Legislative leaders needed to know
if some spending in this year's budget would similarly face vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The process required that some of the process be done with the
governor and therefore not be done at the public conference
committees,'' Silver said.

<HEADLINE> Rochester author wins prestigious mystery writers award  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- ''Never Trust a Dead Man,'' by Rochester
author Vivian Vande Velde, has been named best novel for young
adults in 1999 by the Mystery Writers of America.
</P>
<P>
   It tells the humorous tale of a 17-year-old boy who is wrongly
accused of killing a romantic rival and gets imprisoned inside a
cave with the corpse. With a witch's help, the dead man comes back
to life as a bat and teams up with the boy to hunt for the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a medieval fantasy world, Vande Velde's 17th book
produced her first major literary prize at the Mystery Writers'
annual Edgar Allan Poe Awards dinner in New York on Thursday night.
''I am still about two inches from the ceiling,'' Vande Velde said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Her first mystery story -- ''the rest have been more fantasy or
adventure'' -- is spiced with the wry humor that runs through all
her works. ''I'm afraid I don't take too much seriously,'' she
said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   After working a variety of secretarial jobs in the 1970s, Vande
Velde began writing around the time her daughter was born 21 years
ago. The key to success? ''I think a good writer has to love
stories -- you can't fake it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Vande Velde, 48, now averages two books a year, and the
trickiest part is deciding what to write about. ''Once I get the
idea, then it comes very quickly. ... All of those possibilities in
the world, it's hard for me to focus,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her next suspense mystery, ''Magic Can Be Murder,'' will be
published by Harcourt Brace in the fall and her first non-fantasy,
tentatively titled ''Alison, Who Went Away,'' is due out next year.
Vande Velde also has written books for younger children and for
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The Edgar awards are named for the father of the modern mystery
story. Previous winners include Alfred Hitchcock and Mickey
Spillane.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Burke of Los Alamitos, Calif., won the Edgar for best
mystery fiction book in 1999 for ''Bones,'' Eliot Pattison got top
honors for best first American novel for ''The Skull Mantra,'' and
James B. Stewart's ''Blind Eye'' won as best fact crime book.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1946, Mystery Writers of America is an organization
dedicated to promoting the genre. It represents more than 3,000
writers, editors, agents, booksellers, librarians and others with
an interest in mystery writing.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are no cash prizes, honored books often go into
additional printings. ''An Edgar can make a career,'' said the
organization's spokeswoman, Sherry Zannoth.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor was remembered Saturday
by his Hispanic parishioners as a friend who cared very much for
them, especially the immigrants, as they struggled to make a new
life in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the politicians, to the police, to all the nationalities
represented here today -- we are all brothers today, in respect for
the cardinal,'' said Bishop Francisco Garmendia at a Mass said in
Spanish at St. Patrick's Cathedral. ''We want to thank you,
cardinal, for all you did for us in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   People from Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Puerto Rico
and other nations filled the cathedral pews. Many fingered rosary
beads and mouthed silent prayers in tribute to their beloved
cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   All were appreciative that the Philadelphia native had embarked
on an intensive Spanish language course upon his appointment in
1984 to head the archdiocese. His fluency improved to the point
where he could give homilies in Spanish and preside at weddings and
funerals for Hispanics, Garmendia said.
</P>
<P>
   He was especially beloved by immigrants for making them feel so
welcome, said Esperanza Morales, coordinator of the Tepeyac
Association of New York, which represents Mexican immigrants. The
group held a large banner and sang quietly outside the cathedral
after Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ''He always talked to us in Spanish, and always wanted to help
us,'' Morales said. ''We loved him, we want to tell him 'Thank you'
for all he did for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics are an important part of the archdiocese, making up
approximately 36 percent of its 2.4 million members. Roughly 100 of
the archdiocese's 413 parishes are predominantly Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands came to pay tribute to the cardinal, some carrying
banners and flags.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a good man, he always made us feel special,'' said
Maria Huslin, 38, of the Bronx. ''The Hispanic community was never
made to feel second to any other nationality. He treated all his
parishioners the same. He treated us with respect.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I named my son after him,'' said Manuel Escobar, 31, of
Brooklyn, carrying his 2-year-old son Juan. ''I met him once, and I
called him 'Father.' He was like a parish priest to us. We could
talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's love for his parishioners was mentioned frequently
throughout the Mass. During his homily, the Rev. Josu Iriondo
called O'Connor someone who cherished life and who fought to make
the lives of his flock better.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a lover of life, a defender of life, of the sick, of
the poor,'' said Iriondo, pastor of Church of St. Anthony of Padua,
in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Some worshippers wiped away tears at the end of the Mass, when
Garmendia mentioned how the Hispanic community was indebted to
O'Connor. Many stayed behind after the Mass to view the cardinal's
body.
</P>
<P>
   There were also several non-Hispanics in the crowd, including a
small group of women who had just run a 3.1-mile race from Times
Square to Central Park to raise money for cancer research for
women.
</P>
<P>
   ''On such a glorious day, it seemed only fitting to come and pay
tribute to such a wonderful man,'' said Becky Moranis, 28, of
Manhattan, as she walked out of the cathedral into the warm, sunny
day.

<HEADLINE> Metropolis Looking for Its Superman  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL PEARSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   METROPOLIS, Ill. (AP) -- Wanted: tall, handsome, muscular man
willing to wear tights in public. Ability to leap tall buildings a
plus, but not required.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Metropolis -- Illinois, that is -- is seeking a
Superman for its upcoming festival honoring the Man of Steel, but
the big block of ''kryptonite'' parked downtown must be scaring the
true Clark Kents away. In the list of applicants so far, big
bellies and bald heads rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think these guys must have forgotten what Superman looks
like,'' said Jim Hambrick, co-chairman of the Superman search and
owner of the Super Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the applicants don't even come from Metropolis, which
shares its name with the fictional city where the superhero
regularly saved reporter Lois Lane for all sorts of catastrophes
and evil-doers.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate is from northern Illinois. Another intends to fly
in -- presumably not under his own power -- from Atlanta. Most are
from Paducah, Ky., just across the Ohio River.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time in the 22-year history of Metropolis'
Superman Celebration that a superhero hasn't just fallen in
organizers' laps, said chamber director Becky Lambert, whose staff
is fielding the applications.
</P>
<P>
   In previous years, a local with all the right attributes always
surfaced to play the part. But this year, it appears there aren't
many residents of this tiny but tidy Ohio River town willing to
squeeze into red-and-blue tights, strap on a cape and strut around
for everyone to see.
</P>
<P>
   For one brief weekend, the successful applicant will be hero to
as many as 70,000 adoring Superman fans expected for the June 8-11
festival, and even get paid a few bucks for the honor.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say the job requirements are fairly simple. Superman
needs to be at least 6-1 and weigh somewhere near the 225 pounds
listed in his official DC Comics biography. He can't have a paunch,
he needs to have dark hair, and he really shouldn't have a drawl.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-feet tall, 200 pounds, dark-haired and somewhat muscled,
Michael Bauer of Paducah figures he looks the part.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always been a running joke that since I live near
Metropolis, I must know Superman,'' he said. ''I thought it would
be fun to actually be Superman.''
</P>
<P>
   No word on Bauer's prospects, but the choice is particularly
important this year. Two former Lois Lanes, Noel Neill of TV fame
and Margot Kidder from the Christopher Reeve films, are scheduled
to appear.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens if Superman doesn't show?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe organizers could hire a villain to proclaim Superman is
being held hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would probably be a lot easier,'' Hambrick said. ''We'd
get a lot of baldies in here wanting to play Lex Luthor.''

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Opposition Held, Let Go  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNA LOOF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- The leader of Zimbabwe's main opposition
party was jailed for four hours in what a party spokesman on
Saturday called an act of harassment by security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Police stopped Movement for Democratic Change leader Morgan
Tsvangirai at a roadblock Friday after he held a campaign rally at
Chiredzi, 300 miles south of Harare. Tsvangirai was released after
midnight, party spokesman David Coltart said.
</P>
<P>
   Two lower-ranking party officials who were traveling with
Tsvangirai were also arrested, as were two bodyguards. They were
held overnight and released early Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arrests late at night are deliberate harassment of senior
members of an opposition political party,'' Coltart said. He said
the group was not informed of charges against them.
</P>
<P>
   Police were not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests were the latest development in political turmoil
that has rocked Zimbabwe in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Movement for Democratic Change led the defeat of
President Robert Mugabe's ruling party in a referendum on a revised
constitution in February, violent mobs and ruling party militants
have staked claims to land on more than 1,000 farms, many of them
owned by white opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has called the land occupations justified in this former
British colony where one-third of the fertile land is still owned
by about 4,000 whites. But opponents accuse Mugabe of provoking the
land crisis to intimidate white farmers and other opposition
supporters in advance of parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   The worst economic crisis since independence, soaring inflation
and unemployment and gas shortages have fueled support for the main
labor-backed opposition group ahead of the elections, expected to
be called within months. Tsvangirai's party is seen as the biggest
threat to Mugabe's hold on power since the president led the nation
to independence from Britain in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Political violence has claimed at least 17 lives in recent
weeks. Farmers' leaders on Friday reported worsening intimidation
against workers on white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the once-thriving Zimbabwe International Trade
Fair was dotted with vacant stalls -- another sign of the country's
tottering economy and political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Once a major regional trade show, this year's fair had only 617
exhibitors, down from 820 last year. Foreign exhibitors were
largely absent.

<HEADLINE> Commencement Season Underway  </HEADLINE>
By ARLENE LEVINSON, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The words were the same as those echoing through the auditoriums
of hundreds of universities, but the venue was anything but
conventional as Jones International University President Pamela
Pease, clad in a cap and gown and framed by a virtual stone arch,
held up a diploma before a camera in Denver and conferred eight
degrees online.
</P>
<P>
   At Michigan State University the same day, a handful of
graduates turned their backs on the stage and walked out in protest
as a chorus of boos greeted commencement speaker James Wolfensohn,
president of the beleaguered World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, college dropout Drew Carey was drafting the 15
minutes of insight he'd deliver Sunday at his hometown's Cleveland
State University.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to be serious,'' Carey promised by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   This is the season of mortarboards, memories and many, many
speeches -- most inoffensive and inspirational, some sparking
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Being an election year, the speaker circuit is thick with
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has already addressed graduates of Eastern
Michigan University. He'll be at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in
New London, Conn., on May 17 and Carleton College in Northfield,
Minn., June 10. Vice President Al Gore speaks at Columbia
University Law School May 16 and at West Point May 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush family could use its own speaker's bureau. Former first
lady Barbara Bush appeared Saturday at Centenary College of
Louisiana. Her husband, former president George Bush, has three
bookings: Rice University in Houston on May 13, Monmouth College in
Illinois on May 14, and St. Anselm College in New Hampshire on May
20.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the Texas governor and presumptive Republican
presidential nominee, addresses graduates at Prairie View A&AMP;M
University in Texas on May 13.
</P>
<P>
   The field is also dotted with celebrities, some unaccustomed to
the propriety of caps and gowns, others strangers to the
controversy they can arouse among students.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Rogers of ''Mister Rogers Neighborhood'' is a perennial
favorite. Last year, graduates at Marist College in Poughkeepsie,
N.Y., joined him in singing his theme, ''It's a Beautiful Day in
the Neighborhood.'' But when Old Dominion University in Norfolk,
Va., wooed him for commencement this Saturday, some students
balked, saying they were too grown up for the patriarch of PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Don Marshall, a 46-year-old Navy veteran receiving a bachelor's
degree in business computers, said he planned to boycott Rogers'
speech, adding, ''He's not the appropriate speaker for our age
group.''
</P>
<P>
   John Broderick, vice president of institutional advancement at
Old Dominion, shrugged off the complaints. ''A college campus is
really a marketplace of ideas,'' he said. ''That's what choosing a
commencement speaker is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Rogers got a standing ovation from the 2,100
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know you don't have to do anything sensational in order to
love or be loved,'' Rogers told the students, many of whom grew up
watching his show. ''What ultimately nourishes us is knowing we can
be trusted, that the foundation of our being is good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Students at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, drew
hundreds of protesters to campus when they picked a condemned
killer.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking via videotape from death row April 29, Mumia Abu-Jamal
insisted he was innocent of the murder for which he was jailed,
that of a Philadelphia police officer. The officer's wife and
off-duty police joined others outside in protest.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle of Higher Education Almanac estimates that 2.2
million degrees, associate level to doctorate, will be conferred by
more than 4,000 institutions this spring.
</P>
<P>
   While only a few of those degrees will be presented online the
way Jones International University's were, more graduation
ceremonies are appearing on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Lesley College in Cambridge, Mass., is building a special Web
site to share its May 22 ceremonies with farflung masters graduates
of the school's technology in education program. The University of
Connecticut plans to put its May 21 graduation online so families
of 700 foreign graduate students can stay home.

<HEADLINE> Political Progress in N. Ireland  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   As part of this week's successful diplomacy that
achieved an IRA
promise to disarm, the British and Irish governments on Saturday
spelled out important new goals and commitments in a letter to
Northern Ireland parties. The proposed measures generally appeal to
the province's Catholics, some of whom support the IRA.
<TEXT>
<P>
   2000
</P>
<P>
   -- May 22: Considerable governing powers to be transferred from
Britain back to a local four-party coalition in Northern Ireland.
The coalition was suspended in February. Whether it can be
restarted will depend on backing from the province's major
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists. Soon after the transfer of
powers, the IRA would begin providing the locations of its hidden
arms dumps to international inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   -- July 28: The last imprisoned members of the IRA and outlawed
pro-British groups to be paroled, completing a process that began
in September 1998. Whether this will happen depends on the groups'
cease-fires holding.
</P>
<P>
   -- September: Britain to enact a charter promoting minority
languages, specifically Irish Gaelic in Northern Ireland.
Irish-language television and radio services to be promoted.
</P>
<P>
   -- October: British government to publish its plans to reform
Northern Ireland's criminal justice system. Also, British and Irish
governments to pass legislation incorporating the European
Convention on Human Rights into their national law.
</P>
<P>
   -- November: Britain to pass legislation reforming Northern
Ireland's predominantly Protestant police force. The Royal Ulster
Constabulary to be renamed the more neutral-sounding Police Service
for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   2001
</P>
<P>
   January: A new 20-member civilian Policing Board to be appointed
to oversee police reform. Two members to be from the IRA-linked
Sinn Fein party.
</P>
<P>
   April: Recruitment of police officers to begin on a 50-50
Catholic-Protestant basis. Goal is 30 percent Catholic
representation by 2011.
</P>
<P>
   June: The IRA and major outlawed pro-British groups, the Ulster
Defense Association and Ulster Volunteer Force, to identify,
destroy or hand over all their weapons stockpiles in cooperation
with international inspectors.

<HEADLINE> U.S., L.A. Officials Meet Over LAPD  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Justice Department officials are to meet
Monday with Los Angeles authorities to work on a settlement of the
department's long-running investigation into whether city police
have engaged in racial discrimination, a government official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Assistant Attorney General Bill Lann Lee, head of the
department's civil rights division, and several other officials
will travel to Los Angeles for the meeting, Justice spokesman Myron
Marlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin said the meeting will be to discuss the investigation. He
refused to go into details, ''because it's a pending matter.''
</P>
<P>
   A government official, who requested anonymity, said the goal is
to negotiate a settlement. It would include revisions in police
training and procedures to end the pattern and practice of racial
discrimination that Justice investigators have found in the Los
Angeles Police Department, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Justice investigation, the official said, Lee has
been authorized to file a civil lawsuit against the city to obtain
the revisions, should the negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
   The developments come amid the police department's Rampart
station scandal, in which officers are said to have framed, beaten,
robbed and shot innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office
served search warrants related to its Rampart probe at the homes of
17 Los Angeles police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rampart investigation has led courts to overturn more than
80 convictions and to the resignations, firings or suspensions of
some 30 officers. Criminal charges have been filed against three
officers, and Police Chief Bernard Parks has said he expects more
people to be charged.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has been monitoring the LAPD since 1996
to determine whether it shows a pattern of abusive behavior. In
recent months the investigation has concentrated on the Rampart
scandal, according to the Los Angeles Times, which published
Saturday the first report of Monday's planned meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hunt, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League,
condemned Friday's searches. He said prosecutors served the
warrants about 7 a.m. in front of officers' children and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said the police union plans to go to court to challenge
confiscation of notes from one officer's meetings with his attorney
and his defense representative.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Pipkin, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles district
attorney, said all 17 warrants were signed by Superior Court Judge
Larry Fidler. She refused to discuss specific information about the
warrants, which are sealed.

<HEADLINE> Russia Moving Slowly in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian military's slow pace against Chechen
rebels in recent weeks was gauged to prevent casualties, Russia's
defense minister said Saturday, promising the insurgents would
eventually be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said the lives of federal
soldiers are more important than a quick victory. ''The main thing
is, don't hurry us, so we don't lose our own people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev's comments may have been aimed at shoring up popular
support for the Chechen conflict. Initially a large majority of
Russians backed the military campaign, but public support has
appeared less certain in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops quickly seized two-thirds of Chechnya after
invading the breakaway republic last September. But they have had
far less success fighting the rebels in the republic's southern
mountains, and leaders of the militants say they have no intention
of surrendering.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have inflicted heavy casualties on troop convoys in
ambushes recently, defying claims that they are on the run or
incapable of posing a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups of rebels kept up their hit-and-run attacks late
Friday and Saturday, shooting at federal forces across Chechnya,
according to the federal press center in the Caucasus. There were
no reports of Russian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military was bolstering defenses throughout Chechnya
on Saturday in preparation for the May 9 celebrations of the defeat
of Nazi Germany in World Ward II. Commanders have said they expect
the rebels to try to mar the anniversary with attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see that their preparation is increasing, how they're
preparing various plans, including seizing towns,'' Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a Russian official said up to 5,500 Chechen males
could be drafted into the army. All Russian men aged 18-27 are
eligible for the draft, but conscription has not been enforced in
Chechnya because the region was under the control of a rebel
government.
</P>
<P>
   Drafting Chechen men could restore public faith in Russian
forces after years of rebel rule and months of devastating military
conflict, said Alexander Petrov, Russia's military commissioner in
Chechnya. He said any conscripted Chechens would probably be posted
inside the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Conscription would likely be deeply unpopular in the republic.
Many residents deeply distrust the Russian military.

<HEADLINE> China Said To Tighten Media Control  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Chinese authorities have stopped issuing
tourist visas to foreign journalists in a bid to tighten controls
on media, a newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign journalists can now make personal trips to mainland
China only as part of government-supervised tour groups, a foreign
ministry spokeswoman in Hong Kong was quoted as telling the South
China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong Journalists Association called the controls
''unreasonable,'' saying they ''infringe on freedom of movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The move reverses a decade-old policy of usually allowing Hong
Kong and foreign journalists to travel freely in the mainland when
not working, the English-language daily reported. Journalist visas
are required to do reporting work, although the Chinese authorities
haven't always enforced the rule.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said the visa restrictions coincide with
government campaigns to purge liberal Chinese academics and
restrain foreign correspondents in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the mainland authorities recently
quietly changed the visa rules, and several Hong Kong-based foreign
journalists have already been denied access tourist visas in the
past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The controls do not apply to Hong Kong Chinese journalists who
travel to China using home visit permits.

<HEADLINE> London Mayor Gets Call From Blair  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Ken Livingstone began his first full day as
London's newly elected mayor Saturday talking by phone to Prime
Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, who had warned before Livingstone's election victory that
the maverick lawmaker ''would be a disaster,'' phoned Livingstone
at Romney House, which is serving as temporary headquarters for the
new London government. It was the first time the two men had spoken
since Livingstone was declared the winner Friday of the first
citywide mayoral race.
</P>
<P>
   They talked for 20 minutes, and their conversation was described
by Blair's Labor Party as ''very positive and constructive.''
Livingstone said later that it was ''friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone was kicked out of the Labor Party after deciding to
run as an independent candidate against the prime minister's
preferred choice.
</P>
<P>
   During the often bitter campaign, Blair had warned Londoners not
to vote for Livingstone. He said Friday after the votes were
tallied that his views had not changed, but that he was determined
to cooperate with the new mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone, dressed casually in jeans for his first day in the
office, also promised to work with Blair.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not worried about what people think about me, but I am
worried about what they can do for London,'' said Livingstone, who
invited some Labor Party members on Saturday to hold key posts in
his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't ask people to love me. I'm not asking them to spend a
week on holiday with me. But can we get a bit more money to solve
London's problems?''
</P>
<P>
   Blair, who also celebrated his 47th birthday on Saturday,
created the mayoral job as part of his program of building up
regional government.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor, Livingstone will serve as an ambassador for the
capital's 7.25 million residents, oversee a $5.3 billion budget and
assume responsibility for the police, transportation, fire and
emergency services. He must also work with the newly elected
25-member London Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Thai Immigration Officers Probed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thai immigration police will
investigate whether their fellow officers aided traffickers who
used a two-year-old Thai boy to try to smuggle a Chinese woman into
the United States, an investigator said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Police Capt. Suphamitr Katasila said police will look into how
the woman obtained a Thai immigration stamp found in her fake
Singaporean passport.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will call some immigration officers at the Bangkok Airport
for questioning,'' he said. ''We cannot help having a suspicion
that some officers might have a part in this illegal business.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 11, the toddler, the Chinese woman and a man flew into
Los Angeles. The toddler was given a fake name, and the man and
woman claimed to be his parents. They were deported after an
inspector discovered their fraudulent passports, but the boy was
kept in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities believe the boy was used as a prop to bolster
the impression the group was a family on vacation. Suspicion that
his natural mother was in on the scheme has caused his return to
Thailand to be delayed while the issue of custody is debated.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese woman, identified as Sue Mei Long, 22, is free on
bail from a Thai court and is expected to report to court officials
on May 15. She will be tried in Thailand before being sent home,
Suphamitr said.
</P>
<P>
   Police have already deported the man in the scheme, identified
as Suseno Karjorpanoto of Indonesia. He was given a suspended
six-month-jail term for making and using a fake passport.
</P>
<P>
   Suphamitr said police cannot investigate whether the boy's
mother was involved in the smuggling scheme unless someone files a
complaint against her.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has so far denied the allegation that she had a part in
it,'' he said. ''She did not know where her Indonesian friend had
taken the boy to.''

<HEADLINE> Pataki administration reports index crime down 7 percent  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Thanks mainly to a fall-off in rapes,
burglaries and motor vehicle thefts, serious crime was down by
nearly 7 percent in New York state in 1999, the Pataki
administration reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The state Division for Criminal Justice Services' statistics
were based on reports of crimes to local law enforcement agencies
in the state. State officials said the numbers could change
''slightly'' when final crime statistics for 1999 are released by
the agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the 603,841 serious crimes reported last year in New
York were down 6.9 percent from 1998 numbers. Pataki, who got
elected in 1994 against Democrat Mario Cuomo in part by running as
a law-and-order candidate, said serious crimes have dropped by 34.3
percent since he was elected. There were 919,210 serious crimes
reported to police in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also ran in 1994 on a tax-cutting platform, and he said
the success of lowering taxes is reflected in the crime statistics,
as are anti-crime measures during his administration such as ending
parole for violent felons and DNA technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''These initiatives, combined with an improved economy spurred
in part by our unprecedented tax cuts, are making our streets and
neighborhoods safer than they've been in a generation,'' he said in
a statement released by his office Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest statistics involve ''index'' crimes, which are among
the most serious offenses. They showed reported rapes down 13.3
percent, from 3,836 to 3,326, in 1998; burglaries were down 12.2
percent, from 103,923 to 91,244; motor vehicle thefts fell 9
percent, from 67,665 to 61,575; robberies fell just under 9
percent, from 49,218 to 44,838; aggravated assaults fell 7 percent,
from 61,842 to 57,513; larcenies fell 4.4 percent, from 361,210 to
345,317; property crimes dropped 6.6 percent, from 532,798 to
497,633 and murders were down less than 1 percent, from 922 to 917.
</P>
<P>
   The New York statistics mirror the latest round of FBI
statistics for crime nationally. That data, released in November
1999, showed reports of index crimes to police agencies in the
first six months of last year declined 10 percent. The national
numbers showed reports of murders (down 13 percent), burglaries
(down 14 percent) and auto thefts (12 percent) were the crime
categories with the biggest drops.
</P>
<P>
   For 1998, FBI statistics showed a 7.3 percent drop in index
crimes and declines each year going back to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki used release of the latest New York statistics to push
for various anti-crime bills he favors in the state Legislature,
including expansion of the state's DNA database for all offenders,
ending parole for people convicted of non-violent felonies, and
toughening laws against domestic violence and reforming sex assault
laws.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Applauds Ireland Move  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The decision by the Irish Republican Army to
begin disarming is ''a truly historic step,'' President Clinton
said. Saturday, he said, was ''a very good day for the people of
Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time the IRA is clearly committed to
decommissioning and a process to get there. I applaud that,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The outlawed IRA gave its commitment a day after the British and
Irish governments announced ambitious plans to transfer power back
to the province's suspended Catholic-Protestant administration on
May 22 and to extend the deadline for total IRA disarmament from
that day to June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very good day for the people of Northern Ireland. It
is a truly historic step,'' Clinton said before leaving the White
House for Andrews Air Force Base and a flight to his home state
Arkansas. ''I hope it will be fully accepted by all parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he believes the agreement will stick this time.
''We never got this far on the details of implementation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Republican Army struggled for close to three decades
to end British sovereignty over the six counties of Northern
Ireland and unite them with Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in December, a coalition Cabinet was formed to give the
province a measure of local control. The Cabinet was first proposed
as part of the U.S.-mediated Good Friday peace accord of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA did not announce by February it was laying down its
arms, however, and Britain reimposed direct rule. The Cabinet was
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke on the White House lawn near a waiting helicopter.
He was to spend the weekend in Arkansas, where he is to speak
Sunday at a Little Rock fund-raiser for first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton's Senate campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier written statement, the president said he welcomed
the IRA's commitment to put arms ''beyond use'' and the its
agreement to allow international inspectors into its arms dumps.
</P>
<P>
   ''These developments offer renewed hope to the people of
Northern Ireland that politics will once and for all be pursued
through exclusively political means,'' Clinton said. ''The United
States remains ready to assist this process in any way we can.''

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Accuses Eritrea on Talks  </HEADLINE>
By ABEBE ANDUALEM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Ethiopia's foreign minister accused
Eritrea on Saturday of derailing talks aimed at resolving their
23-month border dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Seyoum Mesfin said the indirect discussions -- or ''proximity
talks'' -- in Algeria's capital, Algiers, broke down after Eritrea
set preconditions. He spoke ominously of evaporating hopes for
peace in a sporadic two-year border conflict that has already left
tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have now reached a critical period when prospects for a
peaceful resolution of the conflict have been blocked by Eritrea,''
Seyoum told reporters in the Ethiopian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Both Eritrea and Ethiopia have accepted a framework peace
agreement and a broad implementation strategy drafted by the
Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia, however, has questioned the technical arrangements for
implementing the accord, particularly the possibility that
peacekeepers would be stationed in contested areas along the
disputed 620-mile border.
</P>
<P>
   At the talks, which ended in deadlock Thursday after four days,
Seyoum said Eritrea demanded the two sides sign the framework
agreement, the implementation strategy and a cease-fire accord as a
prerequisite for any substantive discussions. Ethiopia rejected the
demands.
</P>
<P>
   European Union special envoy Reno Serri, U.S. special envoy
Anthony Lake and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Susan
Rice traveled to Algiers to encourage a settlement but failed,
Seyoum said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Eritrean delegation did not go to Algiers to make peace
but to scuttle the peace prospects,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two Horn of Africa countries went to war in May 1998 over
their frontier, which has not been demarcated since Eritrea gained
independence from Ethiopia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   This week's talks were held under the supervision of Algerian
Justice Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, the personal representative of
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.

<HEADLINE> Nev. 'Quickie Divorce' Home Marked  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT SONNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- There are churches, courthouses, breweries and
even casinos on the National Register of Historic Places. And now
there's also a house recognized for its role in the making of the
''quickie divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nystrom Guest House was one of the most famous homes away
from home for people trying to establish the minimum six-week
residency to obtain a divorce in Nevada in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other states and territories were lengthening the period of
residence, trying to make it harder to get a divorce, the
presumption being there would be fewer breakups of families,''
state archivist Guy Rocha said. ''People were coming to Reno
because it was the last venue in the country with a six-month
divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers saw an opportunity in the making.
</P>
<P>
   In 1927, they cut Nevada's residency requirement to three
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then, after the Great Depression they decided that they were
attracting so many people, that if they made it even easier to get
divorced, maybe even more people would come to Reno,'' said Mella
Harmon, a historic preservation specialist for the state.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1931, the residency period went to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had its desired effect. It was a great economic strategy
during the Depression,'' Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 32,000 divorces were granted in Washoe County from
1929 to 1939, a time when Reno's population totaled about 18,000.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1930s, the county was averaging 5,000 divorces a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Many divorcees spent their time waiting at the Nystrom House, a
few blocks west of downtown near the Sands Regency Hotel Casino.
</P>
<P>
   The original Gothic, wood-siding house, now covered in stucco,
was built in 1875 as the home of Washoe County Clerk J.S.
Shoemaker. It changed hands several times and was purchased during
World War II by Victor and Estelle Nystrom, who moved from San
Francisco to take part in the divorce trade. Mrs. Nystrom ran the
boarding house from the early 1940s until she died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While Reno's divorce trade has become mostly a thing of the past
since other states began liberalizing their divorce laws in the
1960s, the folklore lives on, especially tales of newly divorced
women throwing their wedding rings into the Truckee River, which
runs through downtown Reno a block from the Washoe County
Courthouse. Some versions of the tale describe fishermen catching
trout in the river with rings in their bellies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some say it is a myth. Some say it is true,'' said Harmon, who
works for the State Historic Preservation Office under the Nevada
Department of Museums, Library and Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those things probably happened but less frequently than
portrayed. It may have been enhanced by the telling. It was the
Depression. Who was going to throw away a wedding ring?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rocha, the state archivist, believes there's some truth to the
ring tales.
</P>
<P>
   Salvage divers over the years, he said, have recovered ''all
sorts of things from the river, including rings.''

<HEADLINE> Big Game jackpot rolls over to record $300 million  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- How much bigger can the Big Game get?
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows after players failed to choose all six
numbers drawn Friday in the Big Game, swelling the jackpot to more
than $300 million -- the largest in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The jackpot tops the previous largest lottery prize of $295.7
million two years ago in the Powerball game, won by 13 machinists
from Westerville, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we're in uncharted water,'' Virginia Lottery executive
director Penelope Kyle said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 122 million tickets were sold from 11 p.m. Tuesday to
11 p.m. Friday in the seven Big Game states, exceeding estimates of
118 million on which Friday's jackpot of $230 million was based.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Lottery Corp. President Rebecca Paul said she was among
many surprised by the Big Game's sheer bigness.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had anticipated the jackpot would approach $200 million,
but we never thought it would go over $200 (million), much less
$300 million,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Frantic ticket sales drove Friday night's jackpot higher than
the estimated $230 million.
</P>
<P>
   And lottery officials said Saturday it would be difficult to
gauge the jackpot for Tuesday's drawing, which might be raised
after officials confer Monday morning. Directors of the seven Big
Game states -- Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
New Jersey and Virginia -- have a daily telephone conference about
the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Game hit $197 million last year, its previous highest
pot.
</P>
<P>
   However, New Jersey had not yet joined, so it is difficult to
factor the impact nearby New York gamblers will have, Kyle said.
</P>
<P>
   For Friday's game, New Jersey sold the most tickets -- 33.95
million, attributed to the huge populations in adjacent New York
City and Philadelphia. Georgia and Illinois sold just over 21
million tickets each. Maryland sold the least, 7.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three players were one number shy, collecting $150,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   Even lottery directors were amazed no one won after they saw the
numbers -- 6-8-16-30-32 and a Big Money Ball of 26.
</P>
<P>
   Sales records showed that 70 to 75 percent of the possible
combinations had been covered, officials said, and low numbers
often indicate that someone will hit the jackpot because many
players use anniversary dates or birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   ''We watched the drawing and they were all low numbers and we
thought we'd have about 10 winners,'' Kyle said. ''These were
winnable numbers, not bizarre numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another frenzy is expected as people contemplate $300 million up
for grabs Tuesday night. Lottery officials said they're prepared.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, lottery employees will help retailers manage the
crunch at the state's 10 to 15 largest sellers, Kyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery traffic in many locations picked up early Saturday as
players checked their tickets and realized they didn't win.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Miller, 48, of Chicago, said he will buy a ticket even
though he usually doesn't. And he noted there is no such thing as a
jackpot that is too big.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is America, land of capitalism,'' Miller said. ''There's
no such thing as too much money.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Serv-U-Well Party Shoppe in Detroit, manager Nash Kassab
said players get creative when picking numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got some people who take them out of the garbage and play
other people's numbers,'' Kassab said. But it has been good for
business.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's people coming in that I've never seen before, that
have never played the lottery,'' Kassab said. ''Everybody hopes to
win the 300 million, nobody comes in to win a dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday will bring a winner, Kyle predicts. And she expects more
than one.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have so many people playing across the country,'' she said.
''People can fantasize about the $300 million, but I believe there
will be several matching tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ''This thing's not going on any longer.''

<HEADLINE> Big Game Jackpot Might Break Record  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- How much bigger can the Big Game get?
</P>
<P>
   It depends on how much money people spend on tickets -- and on
whether anyone wins Tuesday's drawing.
</P>
<P>
   The multistate lottery's jackpot has ballooned to a record of
more than $300 million since Friday when no one picked all six
numbers drawn. The largest U.S. lottery prize was $295.7 million,
set two years ago in a multistate Powerball game that was won by 13
machinists from Westerville, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we're in uncharted water,'' Virginia Lottery executive
director Penelope Kyle said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of ticket-buying for the next drawing picked up early
Saturday at many locations in the seven Big Game states -- Georgia,
Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, lottery employees will be sent to help retailers
cope with the ticket-buying crowds at the state's 10 to 15 largest
sellers, Kyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials said Saturday it was difficult to estimate the
eventual jackpot for Tuesday's Big Game drawing, which might be
raised after lottery officials from the seven Big Game states
confer Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The top prize for Friday's drawing had been estimated at $230
million after eight weeks without a winner. More than 122 million
tickets were sold from 11 p.m. Tuesday to 11 p.m. Friday, exceeding
estimates of 118 million.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Lottery Corp. President Rebecca Paul said she was
surprised by the Big Game's bigness.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had anticipated the jackpot would approach $200 million,
but we never thought it would go over $200 (million), much less

<P>
   Lottery directors were surprised no one had Friday's winning
combination of 6-8-16-30-32 plus a Big Money Ball of 26. Sales

<P>
   ''We watched the drawing and they were all low numbers and we
thought we'd have about 10 winners,'' Kyle said. ''These were
winnable numbers, not bizarre numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three second-prize winners did win $150,000, and 355
players matched four of the five lotto numbers plus the Big Money
Ball number for $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey sold the most tickets -- 33.95 million, primarily due
to the huge populations in adjacent New York City and Philadelphia,
Kyle said. Georgia and Illinois sold just over 21 million tickets
each.

<P>
   ''We have so many people playing across the country,'' she said.
''People can fantasize about the $300 million, but I believe there
will be several matching tickets.

<HEADLINE> Prost! New Jersey homebrewers unite for Big Brew 2000  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF LINKOUS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TURNERSVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- It was a day more suited for relaxing
and swigging a glass of beer, but on Saturday beer enthusiasts from
southern New Jersey and Princeton had a better idea.
</P>
<P>
   They decided to make beer as well.
</P>
<P>
   From a parking lot in a strip mall off busy Route 42, about 40
brewers -- including many members of the Gloucester County
Homebrewers club -- spread out with beer kegs turned into kettles
and toiled in 80-degree heat over propane cookers to craft a
variety of ales.
</P>
<P>
   At a Princeton homebrew supply shop, about 20 beer enthusiasts
did likewise.
</P>
<P>
   At each location, the beer buffs were celebrating the twelfth
National Homebrew Day, an annual event sponsored by the American
Homebrewers Association based in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Actually an international celebration, the tribute to brewing
and beer styles is in its third year. A recipe for Big Brew 2000's
featured style, American pale ale, was published in the
association's May/June edition of ''Zymurgy,'' a magazine titled
after the process of making fermented beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers expected this year's event to include 3,000 people at
250 registered sites from nine countries -- including the United
States, Poland, Japan, England, Germany, Austria and South Africa.
The target volume for Big Brew 2000: 300 barrels of beer. (A barrel
is 31 gallons.)
</P>
<P>
   Each participating site is asked to notify the AHA of its
attendance and how many gallons of beer brewed.
</P>
<P>
   Big Brew '99 united 2,180 people from 47 states and eight
countries to brew a recipe of a milk stout -- a sweeter tasting,
full-bodied cousin of the classic stout style most commonly
associated with Guinness. The American pale ale recipe for this
year is an imitation of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, a microbrewery beer
from California.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have the flexibility to do what they want with their
brew kettles, but most will be brewing the pale ale,'' said Paul
Gatza, director of the AHA based in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   In Turnersville, behind Beer Crafters supply shop, Blaise
Fougere of Cinnaminson brewed a Belgian style ale called abbey
double.
</P>
<P>
   Fougere unloaded his brewing gear from the back of his van and
displayed a 1957 black-and-white photo of his father, Simon,
siphoning beer from a wooden barrel into jars.
</P>
<P>
   ''Homebrew and heritage,'' Fougere said, adding that when he
started brewing he didn't know of his father's experience. ''When I
let him know, he told me he had the picture of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the lot, Julian Mason lent an international flavor to the
day. Mason, a native of Worcester, England, who now lives in
Winslow Township, was brewing American ale. A diver who works on
dam projects, Mason has lived in the United Stated for almost 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I first came here, I couldn't stand the beer,'' he said.
''It was refreshing perhaps because it was cold when the weather
was hot. I think now with all the microbreweries, there's a lot of
good really good beer here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Princeton, shop owner Joe Bair hosted about 20 brewers from
the club, Princeton And Local Environs Ale and Lager Enjoyment
Society. ''That's an awfully long thing to say. It sounds like
something the Reagan administration would make up. It's easier to
just say PALE ALES,'' Bair said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're doing about 45 gallons. It's less than last year; we had
about 30 people last year and did 65 gallons.''
</P>
<P>
   From his store's back yard, where he has garden of hop vines
snaking 12 feet up and along a trellis, Bair and his crowd brewed
what he dubbed a ''California red'' beer, using a specially malted
barley from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ''It came out red, too,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Delves Into Balkans Problem  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FURNAS, Azores Islands (AP) -- European Union foreign ministers
took a critical look Saturday at EU efforts in the Balkans, while
Austria pressed for the lifting of sanctions imposed over the
presence of far-right elements in its government.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Solana, the EU's chief of foreign and security policy,
urged the 15 foreign ministers to help Serbia's independent media
and send aid through local governments held by opponents of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Aid to Serbia is needed because Milosevic is ''clearly moving to
silence independent voices in the run-up to the elections,'' Solana
said, referring to the local voting in Serbia that must be held by
November.
</P>
<P>
   EU finance ministers are expected next week to authorize about
$20 million for programs in support of June 11 municipal elections
in Montenegro, the pro-Western republic that along with Serbia
makes up the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers are gathered for two days in an informal session
in this town on Portugal's mid-Atlantic Azores islands.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, they are expected to decide whether to send a
European mission to the Philippines, where rebels are holding more
than two dozen hostages, including citizens of Germany, France and
Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Austria continued to plead here for a lifting of the bilateral
sanctions imposed by the other 14 EU member countries after
Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel formed a government with the far
right Freedom Party in February.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian government said Friday it might hold a nonbinding
referendum giving Austrians a chance to express their views on the
sanctions, which have affected diplomatic, sporting and cultural
ties. The symbolic vote would be aimed at embarrassing Austria's EU
partners.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Party has drawn criticism over its perceived
anti-immigrant stance and comments by its former leader, Joerg
Haider, in praise of some aspects of the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope it will not come to a referendum,'' Austrian Foreign
Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner said. Such a vote would show ''that
the majority of the Austrian people stands behind the government
and wants the lifting of the sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   They EU ministers also discussed how to breathe new life into
talks on overhauling the European Union's convoluted
decision-making rules.
</P>
<P>
   EU governments are deadlocked in reform talks that began in
February.

<HEADLINE> O'Connor Heir Faces Challenges  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The new archbishop of New York will have to walk
a spiritual tightrope, balancing traditional teachings with
contemporary challenges as he takes over America's most prominent
Roman Catholic pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   He will be Pope John Paul II's point man in the world's most
powerful nation. But his flock -- including those who support birth
control and women seeking a greater role in the church -- may not
follow easily.
</P>
<P>
   ''We, the baptized, are the church. We really don't look to the
hierarchy,'' said Sister Mary Boys, professor of practical theology
at New York's Union Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Some problems facing the successor to Cardinal John O'Connor,
who died Wednesday at age 80 after 15 years as cardinal, are
peculiar to New York, with its spectacular mix of cultures and
languages. But others reflect the challenge of the Catholic Church
across the country in an age when strict rules are ever more open
to question.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,700-square-mile New York archdiocese, with 2.4 million
faithful, faces tight finances, a diminishing supply of priests and
nuns and a radical change in the population to which it ministers.
</P>
<P>
   It is the nation's third largest Catholic diocese after Los
Angeles and Chicago. In the 19th century, it was populated by Irish
immigrants. In the early 20th century, it was Italians.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the reason why O'Connor -- the latest in a long line of
Irish-American archbishops -- learned Spanish: More than a third of
New York's Catholics are now Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   About two miles from the bronze portals of St. Patrick's
Cathedral on Fifth Avenue is St. Elizabeth's Church in the
Washington Heights neighborhood, where working-class Puerto Ricans
and Dominicans struggle to feed their children.
</P>
<P>
   ''The church is under pressure -- financial pressure, the
pressure of the drug scene and the sex scene in the neighborhood,
the pressure of families that aren't able to stay intact,'' said
the Rev. Gerry Walsh, St. Elizabeth's Irish-American pastor.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the biggest problems faced by the American
Catholic Church is that the number of immigrants is rising while
the number of priests and nuns is dropping -- by about 50 percent in
the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to keep the ship afloat. People are hungry for
religious faith,'' said Walsh, 58, who presides over Masses in
Spanish and English.
</P>
<P>
   Juliassa Figueroa, who worships at St. Elizabeth's, doesn't mind
that the church's pastor is not Hispanic. But she said she misses
the close-knit friendships from her native Puerto Rico, the sense
of community that carried over in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ''People over there were more together, we knew each other,''
said Figueroa, 32. ''Here, you come to church, you see the people
in church, and then you don't see them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The new archbishop will replace a cardinal who was a powerhouse,
both spiritual and temporal. In the world's media capital, he would
appear with politicians and celebrities, and his comments on social
issues in Sunday homilies made news.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connor was no bean counter. There are shortfalls in the
archdiocese's $527 million annual budget. The money supports 413
parishes, 17 hospitals, 238 Catholic elementary schools and 55 high
schools, among other church institutions tended by the
archdiocese's almost 900 priests, 3,700 nuns and 1,000 lay workers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the financial troubles, the new archbishop will encounter
parishioners who are increasingly setting their own agenda for what
Catholicism means. Some attend Mass while holding opinions on
abortion, birth control and homosexuality that run counter to
official Vatican teachings.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor held to the Vatican line on such social issues, as well
as in failing to encourage the promotion of women to higher
positions of authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many, many women theologically trained and educated
for pastoral positions, but I'm not mindful of anything Cardinal
O'Connor has done to make it possible for such women to preach,''
said Sister Boys, a member of the Sisters of the Holy Name.
</P>
<P>
   One New York columnist even suggested that a woman should
replace O'Connor -- technically possible, since a cardinal need not
be a priest.
</P>
<P>
   ''One more nice old guy -- or even a nasty old guy -- is not going
to be able to patch the leaks in the plumbing,'' wrote Jim Dwyer in
the New York Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The comment suggests a trait that the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor
in chief of the Catholic magazine America, said the archbishop of
New York must have: ''He's got to have thick skin.''
</P>
<P>
   A top U.S. bishop, Joseph A. Fiorenza of Houston, said in Rome
on Saturday that he expected the Vatican to announce O'Connor's
successor soon. In New York, thousands of people passed through St.
Patrick's Cathedral, where the cardinal's body was to lie until
Monday's funeral Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorenza, who had lunch with the pope at the Vatican on Friday,
said O'Connor's death dominated their conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a big personal loss for the holy father,'' Fiorenza
said. ''The pope relied on him.''

<HEADLINE> Grave Robberies Baffle Madagascar  </HEADLINE>
By KATYA ROBINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) -- A spate of grave robberies in
eastern Madagascar has baffled officials and sparked an uproar over
the theft of bones in a culture where people worship their
ancestors and revere tombs.
</P>
<P>
   Police have arrested about 50 people in recent weeks for
breaking into tombs and stealing and selling bones.
</P>
<P>
   Local media have speculated the robberies are linked to
international trafficking in human bones for unknown medical
applications, while others wonder if unknown cults or tribal
rivalries are involved.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who was caught allegedly buying bones from the grave
robbers for up to $40 a pound was arrested in March, but officials
said they do not yet know her motive.
</P>
<P>
   Grave robbing has been a chronic problem in eastern Madagascar
since 1996, with 1,000 tombs desecrated, investigators say. Police
have seized two tons of human bones, mostly in routine traffic
stops, since they began investigating the crimes three years ago.
In the past several weeks, the number of crimes has escalated
though authorities are at a loss to explain the increase.
</P>
<P>
   Grave robbers who broke into five tombs last week took the
skeletons but not the skulls of female corpses, which usually are
separated from men in collective family tombs. As in other cases,
they left the male corpses undisturbed, though they threw the
bodies of the recently buried outside the tombs.
</P>
<P>
   In Madagascar, the dead are traditionally buried in communal
family tombs that are often far more elaborate structures than the
homes of the living. Families spend years of savings on the stone
or cement tombs the size of small houses.
</P>
<P>
   Every few years, families exhume the bodies in elaborate
ceremonies, rewrap the bones and dance with the shrouded remains
lifted shoulder-high before replacing them on shelves in the tombs.
Malagasy people believe their dead relatives have a godlike status
and have the power to bring fortune or tragedy to the living.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's simply shocking to do this here. It exhibits the most
profound disrespect for families,'' said Mamy Rakotobe, national
director of cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The dead are key to the Malagasy's sense of self, and the loss
of their remains is akin to wiping out the identities of the
living, he said. However, money could drive the desperate to
desecrate a tomb in the world's 13th poorest nation, says Rakotobe.

   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges on Saturday
urged state lawmakers not to adjourn until the Confederate flag
dispute is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to solve that problem, my friends, and we will not
leave Columbia until we do,'' Hodges said at the Democratic Party's
state convention.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative session ends June 1, but Hodges has the
authority to call a special session.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP has been urging people and companies to boycott South
Carolina until the Confederate flag comes down from the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday will start debating a Senate-passed bill to
remove the flag from the Statehouse dome and fly a similar banner
at a monument in front of the Capitol honoring Confederate
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic state Rep. John Scott said he will not support the
Senate bill because the NAACP opposes the flag's visibility in the
plan. NAACP officials say they will continue the boycott if the
Legislature approves the bill.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Soccer Referee Shot Dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Gunmen shot and killed a
semiprofessional soccer referee after forcing his car off a road in
western Colombia, authorities said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Fajardo was shot five times in the Friday night attack on
a highway outside Cali, the capital of Valle State, police said.
The motive was not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''They ended the life of an extraordinary person who cared a lot
for his fellow referees,'' Edgar Velez, a member of the state
referees association where Fajardo was president, said on local
radio.
</P>
<P>
   The killing was only the latest in a rash of violent incidents
this year involving Colombian sports figures.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, a national sharpshooting champion used his target
rifle to kill two assailants in an attempted kidnapping or robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Days earlier, rebels had kidnapped a former national soccer team
member, releasing him 48 hours later after a national cry of
outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Two world-class Colombian cyclists have also been kidnapped and
released this year.
</P>
<P>
   The spate of incidents against sports figures has not been seen
as a campaign against athletes. Violent crime is out of control in
this South American country, which has the world's highest
kidnapping rate and a decades-old civil conflict.

<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Florida officials are reviewing whether a state
senator broke state election laws by allegedly failing to report
thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and accepting cash
donations in excess of state election guidelines, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators who examined the bank records of state Sen. Alex
Diaz de la Portilla found evidence of 320 possible violations of
state law, according to a report obtained Friday by The Miami
Herald.
</P>
<P>
   The report, presented to the Florida Elections Commission this
week, says Diaz de la Portilla failed to report $158,195 in
contributions and three transfers totaling $67,000 from his
personal account, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also found that he may have violated state law by
accepting a cash contribution of $10,000, it said. State law
prohibits cash contributions in excess of $100.
</P>
<P>
   If the allegations are upheld, the commission could fine him a
record $843,999, the Herald reported. The allegations are also the
subject of a criminal investigation, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Diaz de la Portilla's Miami office were not immediately
returned Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Mandela: Overthrow Corrupt Leaders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Former president and Nobel
laureate Nelson Mandela urged citizens Saturday to take up arms and
overthrow corrupt leaders who have accumulated vast personal
fortunes while children went hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela declined to name the culprits, saying: ''Everybody here
knows who I am talking (about). The situation exists in many parts
of the world, especially Africa. If you don't know who I am talking
about, there is no point in me telling you.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged the public to pick up ''rifles to defeat the tyrants.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela said often these leaders had liberated their countries,
but then after rubbing shoulders with the rich and powerful wanted
to become like that themselves.
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking at the launch of a new UNICEF initiative aimed
at bringing about a better life for the world's millions of
deprived children. He and his wife, Graca Machel, pledged to
personally lobby other leaders for specific commitments to the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Machel, who investigated the impact of armed conflict on
children for the United Nations, said 300,000 children worldwide
were involved in some form of armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each year between 8,000 and 10,000 children are maimed or
killed by anti-personnel mines,'' she said. ''In fact, the true
extent of the deaths and physical, psychological and emotional
damage to children in armed conflict can never be quantified.''

<HEADLINE> Romanian Couple Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- A Romanian couple who fled Romania's
communist regime by stealing a light aircraft were arrested when
they applied for new Romanian passports, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking a communist-era prison sentence passed in 1986, police
arrested the couple Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Agneta and Iosif Hasz, aged 39 and 44 respectively, fled Romania
in August 1983 after stealing a crop-duster plane, according to a
statement issued by police in Satu Mare, northern Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Hasz and the plane's pilot, Dumitru Morar, were working at Satu
Mare airport, 280 miles northwest of Bucharest. They said at the
time they intended to use the plane for a recreation flight.
</P>
<P>
   The three fled to Austria, where they requested political
asylum, and then left for Germany, where they obtained German in
addition to their Romanian citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Romanian authorities convicted the three in absentia in 1986 of
''stealing and embezzlement,'' and sentenced them to between 15 and
20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, the couple returned to Romania twice to renew their
passport without any problem. But this time the Satu Mare police
arrested them on the basis of the communist-era prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Agneta Hasz was immediately released under the statute of
limitation. Her husband is to stay in jail until July, but the
couple planned to hire a lawyer to have the sentence annulled.

<HEADLINE> More CIA Employees Face Discipline  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inquiries into lax computer practices by
former CIA Director John Deutch could result in reprimands or
stronger action against a widening number of present and former
senior CIA officials, intelligence officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a new Justice Department criminal investigation
into the 1996 security breach, the officials said, a presidential
advisory panel criticized Deutch's successor, George Tenet, and
other agency officials last week for inordinate delays before they
acted against Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   Once focused primarily on Deutch, inquiries by the Justice
Department, Congress and the CIA itself now are seeking to
determine why the matter was not pursued more aggressively within
the CIA, said administration and congressional officials who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential advisory panel, headed by former Sen. Warren
Rudman, R-N.H., gave President Clinton and congressional
intelligence overseers a classified report containing sharp
criticism of the spy agency.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the report said its wording is remarkably
harsh, which is significant because Rudman was among the first to
speak out in support of the CIA's handling of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Among targets of criticism are Tenet, former CIA General Counsel
Michael O'Neil, former CIA Executive Director Nora Slatkin and what
one intelligence official characterized as ''a handful'' of
officials still at the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his own involvement in the matter, Tenet has removed
himself from the case and turned over the internal investigation to
Air Force Gen. John A. Gordon, the agency's deputy director.

<P>
   ''General Gordon is reviewing the Rudman report to determine if
additional steps are warranted,'' CIA spokesman William Harlow said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Any reprimand of Tenet would have to come from Clinton,
administration officials said Saturday. Officials said White House
officials were reviewing the case closely to see whether a public
reprimand of Tenet was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard Air Force One, carrying Clinton to a weekend in Arkansas,
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said he knew the report
had been completed, but he has not seen it and would not discuss
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Deutch case gained renewed attention with subsequent
disclosures that at least three laptop computers, one with highly
classified material in its memory, disappeared from the State
Department. Last week's ''Love Bug'' e-mail virus, which infected
scores of government computers, further showed vulnerabilities of
government computers.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA said the ''ILOVEYOU'' virus showed up on fewer than a
dozen computers at the agency, none of which held classified
information. The CIA has two separate computer systems -- one
secure, one not.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch, who concedes he unintentionally violated security rules,
kept classified CIA documents on home computers that also contained
an America Online account that he and other members of his family
routinely used to connect to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Justice Department initially reviewed the matter
and decided not to prosecute Deutch, Attorney General Janet Reno
asked for a new review and named former Justice Department official
Paul Coffey to oversee it.
</P>
<P>
   A message left Saturday at Deutch's office at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, where he is a professor, was not
immediately returned. A woman who answered the telephone at
Deutch's home in Belmont, Mass., referred calls to that office.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice inquiry reflects what top department officials say
is their concern that Deutch be held to the same standards applied
to nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee, whom the government charged
earlier this year with mishandling atomic weapons secrets on
computers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   After a review in early March, Justice officials requested that
the FBI conduct more interviews, according to a senior Justice
official, who said in effect the criminal investigation was
reopened at that time.
</P>
<P>
   The Rudman panel report covers little new ground, basically
repeating findings by CIA Inspector General L. Britt Snider last
year, said officials familiar with the new report.
</P>
<P>
   The report does focus more criticism on other CIA officials and
is somewhat less critical of Tenet, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They said the report asserts that O'Neil, the former CIA general
counsel, refused to turn over to CIA investigators four computer
storage cards that were retrieved from Deutch's Bethesda, Md.,
home, and suggested that he was planning to destroy the cards.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil declined to testify before the Senate Intelligence
Committee, citing Fifth Amendment protection against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil, a Washington lawyer, left the CIA in 1997. His lawyer in
the matter, Roger Spaeder, has denied ''an unlawful cover-up.''

<HEADLINE> Pakistanis Asked To Pray for Rain  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR ZIA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's military ruler urged the
public Saturday to pray for rain and donate money to help an
estimated 3.2 million people affected by severe water shortages in
the south.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Pervez Musharraf made the call for prayers in a statement
released Saturday after officials held emergency meetings on the
drought. The prayers are to be offered by Muslims in mosques and
open grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf also announced a $37 million emergency aid package for
drought-hit areas, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The drought has affected roughly 2.1 million in southwestern
Baluchistan province. Fifteen people have died in the province as a
result of the drought, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Sindh province, at least 1.1 million people, mostly
in the desert region of Tharparkar, have been affected. The drought
is causing masses of people to migrate to cities and areas where
water can be found.
</P>
<P>
   Entire herds of goats, sheep, camels and cows have died in the
drought-ravaged regions of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Western neighbor Afghanistan and India to the east are also
suffering under the extended dry spell. The United Nations has
issued an emergency appeal for Afghanistan, where millions of
people have been relocated and entire herds wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   In India's eastern states of Rajasthan and Gujarat, more than 50
million people were suffering.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, soldiers were spearheading relief work for drought
victims, supplying food and medicines, using helicopters to reach
remote areas and evacuating people in trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Relief centers have been established to provide shelter. And
Pakistan Railways has been running special trains to supply water
in the remote areas of Baluchistan province, railway officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Wants Israelis Tried  </HEADLINE>
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- The Arab League on Saturday called for
convening an international criminal court to try Israelis
responsible for a massacre of Lebanese civilians in 1996, equating
it with Israeli demands for justice for Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time that the League has formally made such a
demand on the Qana bombing. Resurrecting past grudges echoes the
frustration and outrage among Arabs over Israel's two-day
bombardment this week against Lebanon -- despite its plans to pull
out of the country within the next two months after years of
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-member body demanded in a resolution that Israel be held
accountable and forced to pay compensation for the ''human losses
and financial and economic harm resulting from its attacks on
Lebanese lands.''
</P>
<P>
   It said the Arab League expresses ''support for Lebanon's call
to form an ... international criminal court to try Israeli war
criminals who carried out the 1996 Qana massacre ... and other
Israeli massacres for which Lebanon served as a stage.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 18, 1996, at the height of an Israeli bombing campaign
against Hezbollah, about 800 villagers took refuge at the base of
the Fijian contingent of the U.N. peacekeeping force, believing
they would be safe there. Instead, the flimsy huts in which they
were sheltering came under fire, and about 100 civilians died.
</P>
<P>
   Israel said it hit the U.N. compound by mistake. The attack led
to an agreement between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas that
neither would use or target civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest attacks are a violation of that agreement, the
Arab League said. This is not the first time Israel has been
accused of breaking that deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day Arab countries take a step toward peace and Israel
unfortunately moves back from it 1,000 miles,'' Arab League
Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to justify the League's demand, saying Israel also asks
for compensation for the Jewish victims of Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In two days of attacks and counterattacks, Israel early Friday
knocked out power stations near Beirut and in northern Lebanon. The
strikes were retaliation for a Hezbollah rocket attack on northern
Israel that killed a soldier and injured 26 people. Hezbollah said
its barrage was to avenge two civilian deaths on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Applauds IRA Move  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The decision by the Irish Republican Army to
begin disarming is ''a truly historic step,'' President Clinton
said. Saturday, he said, was ''a very good day for the people of
Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time the IRA is clearly committed to
decommissioning and a process to get there. I applaud that,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The outlawed IRA gave its commitment a day after the British and
Irish governments announced ambitious plans to transfer power back
to the province's suspended Catholic-Protestant administration by
May 22 and to extend the deadline for total IRA disarmament from
that day to June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very good day for the people of Northern Ireland. It
is a truly historic step,'' Clinton said before leaving the White
House for Andrews Air Force Base and a flight to his home state
Arkansas. ''I hope it will be fully accepted by all parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he believes the agreement will stick this time.
''We never got this far on the details of implementation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard Air Force One, Clinton telephoned the prime ministers of
Britain and Ireland, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, ''to congratulate
them for moving the process forward,'' White House press secretary
Joe Lockhart said. He expressed hope for future progress.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Republican Army struggled for close to three decades
to end British sovereignty over the six counties of Northern
Ireland and unite them with Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in December, a coalition Cabinet was formed to give the
province a measure of local control. The Cabinet was first proposed
as part of the U.S.-mediated Good Friday peace accord of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA did not announce by February it was scrapping its
weapons stockpiles, however, and Britain reimposed direct rule. The
Cabinet was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke on the White House lawn near a waiting helicopter.
He was to spend the weekend in Arkansas, where he is to speak
Sunday at a Little Rock fund-raiser for first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton's Senate campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier written statement, the president said he welcomed
the IRA's commitment to put arms ''beyond use'' and the its
agreement to allow international inspectors into its arms dumps.
</P>
<P>
   ''These developments offer renewed hope to the people of
Northern Ireland that politics will once and for all be pursued
through exclusively political means,'' Clinton said. ''The United
States remains ready to assist this process in any way we can.''

<HEADLINE> Remains of Headless Conquerer Found  </HEADLINE>
By FILADELFO ALEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP)-- Archaeologists have found the headless
remains of a Spanish conquistador in the ruins of an old Nicaraguan
city, local media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of Hernandez de Cordoba -- who was decapitated 474
years ago by Nicaragua's governor -- were found last Sunday in a
destroyed church in Leon Viejo, 50 miles west of the capital,
academic Clemente Guido was quoted by local media as saying.
</P>
<P>
   De Cordoba joined in the conquest of Mexico and founded the
first Nicaraguan cities under Spanish rule, Leon and Granada, in
1524. Two years later, Nicaragua's ruler at the time, Pedrarias
Davila, had him decapitated for treason.
</P>
<P>
   His head reportedly was put on public display and his body left
for the vultures.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Leon was destroyed during the eruption of the
Momotombo volcano and relocated west, where it is currently
located.
</P>
<P>
   The remains were discovered in the destroyed city by two
archaeologists searching for the tomb of Pedrarias, who was also
responsible for the execution of Vasco Nunez de Balboa, the first
European to view the Pacific ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said the lack of a head on the remains and their
presence in an area of the church reserved for people of high
social and religious rank confirmed that they were de Cordoba's.
They also cited, without elaborating, historical documents that
confirm the identity of the remains.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists continue looking for Pedrarias' remains, which
allegedly were buried in a metal box adorned with jewelry.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Questions Zimbabwe Leader  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- In a meeting with President Robert
Mugabe Saturday, visiting U.N. Security Council delegates
criticized the Zimbabwe military's alleged involvement in dealing
diamonds and other mineral wealth in central Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Council members did not say how Mugabe responded to the
allegations that his military was dealing in riches in the central
Congolese city of Mbuji Mayi.
</P>
<P>
   ''We said that plundering a country was a bad thing, and that it
had to stop,'' Dutch Ambassador Peter Van Walsum said.
</P>
<P>
   The mission, led by U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, planned
the meeting to keep Congo's flagging peace process on track. The
war pits Congo's government against numerous rebel and militia
groups in shifting fronts scattered across a vast nation of jungles
and savanna.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe deployed more than 10,000 soldiers to back Congo's
government, while Zimbabwe faces a growing economic and political
crisis at home. Mugabe refused Saturday to speak with journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The council members discussed setting up a panel of experts to
look into foreign forces extracting minerals in Congo, according to
French Ambassador Jean David Levitte. Although Congo is nearly
devoid of economic infrastructure, warring sides in the Central
African country have been attracted by some of the richest natural
resources on the planet, including uranium, gold, diamonds and
other precious minerals.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda, which back rival Congolese rebel factions,
have been accused of profiting from Congo's bountiful natural
resources in the east, including timber and gems.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council delegation was on the third day of its
visit to five African countries somehow involved in the war. The
rebels have allies in Uganda and Rwanda, while Congolese President
Laurent Kabila is backed by Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia. Other
African countries, including South Africa and Zambia, have tried to
help mediate peace.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the council's tour has been to boost Congo's peace
prospects, and to prepare the climate for a 5,500-member U.N.
observer mission. On Thursday, the Congolese government signed an
agreement giving access and safety assurances to U.N. observers
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said Saturday that Friday's fighting between nominal
allies Uganda and Rwanda in eastern Congo had merely been an
''aberration,'' and he insisted that a cease-fire was holding.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in the city of Kisangani ''doesn't surprise us,''
he said, explaining that it was normal for peace initiatives to
face setbacks. ''But it is not acceptable. The fighting must come
to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Kisangani was calm Saturday, following the daylong dual that
left at least 10 civilians dead and another 100 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council delegation is to visit Rwanda and Uganda on
Sunday. It has already traveled to Congo and Zambia

<HEADLINE> New prince of the church faces a complex archdiocese  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The new archbishop of New York will walk a
spiritual tightrope, balancing traditional teachings with today's
modern twists as he takes on America's most prominent Roman
Catholic post.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, he'll be Pope John Paul II's point man to the
world's most powerful nation. But his flock -- including those who
question birth control and women seeking a greater role in the
church -- may not follow easily.
</P>
<P>
   ''We, the baptized, are the church. We really don't look to the
hierarchy,'' says Sister Mary Boys, professor of practical theology
at New York's Union Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Some problems of the successor to the late Cardinal John
O'Connor are peculiar to New York, with its spectacular mix of
cultures and languages. But others reflect the challenge of the
Roman Catholic Church across the country in an age when strict
rules are ever more open to question.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,700-square-mile New York archdiocese stretches from
Manhattan to the Bronx, Staten Island and seven counties north of
the city, ministering to 2.4 million faithful. The archdiocese
faces tight finances, a diminishing supply of priests and nuns, and
a radical change in the population to which it ministers.
</P>
<P>
   New York, the nation's third largest Catholic diocese after Los
Angeles and Chicago, has revolved around Irish immigrants since the
19th century, followed by a large influx of Italians in the early
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the reason why O'Connor -- the latest in a long line of
Irish-American archbishops -- learned Spanish: more than a third of
New York's Catholics are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the possible successors to O'Connor have Irish
names, the new archbishop must serve the Latino parishioners, too,
along with a fast growing population of ethnic Asian Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   About two miles from the bronze portals of St. Patrick's on
Fifth Avenue is St. Elizabeth's Church in the Washington Heights
neighborhood, where working-class Puerto Ricans and Dominicans
struggle to feed their children.
</P>
<P>
   ''The church is under pressure -- financial pressure, the
pressure of the drug scene and the sex scene in the neighborhood,
the pressure of families that aren't able to stay intact,'' says
the Rev. Gerry Walsh, St. Elizabeth's Irish-American pastor.
</P>
<P>
   He says one of the biggest problems faced by the American
Catholic Church is that the number of immigrants is rising while
the number of priests and nuns is dropping -- by about 50 percent in
the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many parishes are now staffed by lay people and
priests from the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to keep the ship afloat. People are hungry for
religious faith,'' says Walsh, 58, who presides over Masses in
Spanish and English to meet the needs of new and longtime
parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   Juliassa Figueroa, who worships at St. Elizabeth's, doesn't mind
that the church's pastor is not Hispanic. Walsh, she says, ''is a
great pastor. I always see him around talking to people on the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   But she says she misses the close-knit friendships from her
native Puerto Rico, the sense of community that was carried over in
the church.
</P>
<P>
   ''People over there were more together, we knew each other,''
says Figueroa, 32, who stays home with her baby while her husband
works as a building superintendent. ''Here, you come to church, you
see the people in church, and then you don't see them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The new archbishop will replace a cardinal who was a powerhouse,
both spiritual and temporal. In the world's media capital, he would
appear with politicians and celebrities, and his comments on
explosive social issues in Sunday homilies were news.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connor was no beancounter. There are shortfalls in the
archdiocese's $527 million annual budget. The money supports 413
parishes, 17 hospitals, 238 Catholic elementary schools and 55 high
schools, among other church institutions tended by the
archdiocese's almost 900 priests and about 3,700 nuns, as well as
1,000 lay workers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the financial troubles, the new archbishop will encounter
parishioners -- like those across the country -- who are increasingly
setting their own agenda for what Catholicism means. Some attend
Mass while holding opinions on abortion, birth control and openly
gay or lesbian lifestyles that run counter to official Vatican
teachings.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor held to the Vatican line on such social issues, as well
as in failing to encourage the promotion of women, who are taking a
greater role in church affairs, to higher positions of authority.
</P>
<P>
   When death came for the archbishop Wednesday, loud accolades
mixed with whispers of his strained relationship with some women in
the church and female theologians seeking church leadership roles
or even ordination as priests.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many, many women theologically trained and educated
for pastoral positions, but I'm not mindful of anything Cardinal
O'Connor has done to make it possible for such women to preach,''
says Sister Boys, a member of the Sisters of the Holy Names of
Jesus and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   One New York newspaper even suggested that a woman should
replace O'Connor -- technically possible, since a cardinal need not
be a priest.
</P>
<P>
   ''One more nice old guy -- or even a nasty old guy -- is not going
to be able to patch the leaks in the plumbing,'' wrote columnist
Jim Dwyer in the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The comment suggests one paramount quality that the Rev. Thomas
Reese, editor in chief of the Catholic magazine America, says the
archbishop of New York must have: ''He's got to have thick skin.''

<P>
   BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) -- A local military chief testified
Saturday in a landmark human rights trial that his soldiers were
acting in self-defense when they killed 57 civilians in an
anti-rebel operation last year.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Syafnil Armen, chief of Lilawangsa Military Command, said
the July 23 attack by 300 soldiers on Beutong Ateuh, a remote
village in West Aceh, was aimed at capturing separatist leader
Tengku Bantaqiah.
</P>
<P>
   Bantaqiah, a former political prisoner and preacher at the
hamlet's Islamic boarding school, was killed along with 56 of his
students. He was a prominent supporter of the Free Aceh Movement,
which has been waging a bloody independence struggle since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of 25 soldiers and one civilian for the murders is
regarded as a test of the new government's resolve to rein in the
military, which committed numerous human rights abuses in Aceh
during the dictatorship of ex-president Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, presided over by a panel of military and civilian
judges, opened last month in the provincial capital of Banda Aceh.
It is expected to last several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Armen testified that, on its way to the village, the army unit
was ambushed twice by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the operation, I received reports that 31 people
including Bantaqiah were shot dead,'' Armen said. ''The shootings
... were inevitable because the rebels first attacked the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those charged in the killings were enlisted men, and the
highest ranking officer was a captain. The commander of the
operation, Lt. Col. Sudjono, has been missing since he was named a
suspect in November.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels belonging to the Free Aceh Movement have been fighting to
secede from Indonesia. More than 5,000 people have been killed in
the past decade, including about 300 since the beginning of this
year.

By The Associated Press	   Thunderstorms drenched Oklahoma, causing flooding
Saturday that
was blamed for one death.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The thunderstorms had stayed nearly stationary over easterain
Oklahoma during the night, part of a system that produced stormy
weather over the southerain Plains and westerain Gulf Coast states for
much of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Several easterain Oklahoma towns were flooded, highways were
blocked and cars were stalled in deep water. Hail up to 2{ inches
in diameter was reported.
</P>
<P>
   A creek surged out of its banks in Keifer, Okla., swamping a
mobile home park, after more than 8 inches of rain fell from Friday
into Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might have been even more, but the rain gauges we had only
went up to 8 inches,'' said B.J. Pope, Creek County emergency
management director.
</P>
<P>
   One woman died after her car was stalled in deep water in Tulsa,
police said. Her body was found in a creek bed about six blocks
from her car. Emergency workers in Coweta, Okla., had to use boats
to pull people from flooded cars and homes, said Assistant Police
Chief Derrick Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   The storms dwindled as they moved northeastward through Arkansas
and Missouri and into the Ohio Valley. By afterainoon, radar showed
showers and a few thunderstorms scattered from Missouri into
southerain Illinois and Indiana, and in westerain sections of Kentucky
and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   An upper-level low pressure area over the Northwest produced
scattered, light showers across parts of northerain Califorainia,
Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and northerain Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms were possible during the night across the northerain
and central Plains as a cold front moved across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a few light showers were scattered from northerain New
York state across the northerain New England states.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's temperatures around the Lower 48 states ranged from a
moraining low of 24 at Redmond, Ore., to a midday reading of 94 at
Midland, Texas. The lowest wind chill was 12 at Cut Bank, Mont.

<HEADLINE> Israel To Help Border Civilians  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli government has prepared a $450
million plan to help civilians on the Lebanese border cope with
economic and security problems they could face after Israeli forces
withdraw in the next two months, an official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak will submit the proposal to the
cabinet for approval on May 14, his spokesman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 years now the Israeli army has occupied a strip of land
in south Lebanon to protect the border against guerrilla attacks.
But Barak has promised to withdraw the troops by early July, after
which residents fear they will be much more exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the aid package is a $76 million program to build
roads further away from the border than the ones that exist now.
But most of the other items in the plan were aimed at reducing
unemployment and boosting investment in industry, agriculture and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Mayors in the border towns have repeatedly complained that,
aside from Lebanese guerrillas launching periodic Katyusha rocket
attacks, the government ignores their economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday and Friday scores of rockets landed in the area,
killing a soldier and injuring a number of civilians. About 200,000
civilians spent more than 24 hours in bomb shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was made in response to the killing of two Lebanese
women by an Israeli-backed Lebanese militia.
</P>
<P>
   Israel reacted to Thursday's attack by bombing two Lebanese
power stations, a guerrilla ammunition dump and the highway
connecting Beirut to Damascus.

<HEADLINE> Thornton, Jolie Wed in Las Vegas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar winners Billy Bob Thornton and Angelina
Jolie were married here in a no-frills, quickie ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The actors married about 3:30 p.m. Friday at the Little Church
of the West on the Las Vegas Strip, chapel owner Greg Smith said
Saturday. The bride and groom both wore jeans for the 20-minute
ceremony, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clark County Marriage License Bureau confirmed Saturday that
Thornton, 44, and Jolie, 24, received a marriage license Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth marriage for Thornton and the second for
Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton won a 1996 Academy Award for the screenplay of ''Sling
Blade'' and was also nominated for best supporting actor last year
for ''A Simple Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie, the daughter of actor Jon Voight, won an Oscar this year
for her role as a hospitalized sociopath in ''Girl, Interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair appeared together in ''Pushing Tin,'' a comedy about
frenzied air traffic controllers. They played husband and wife.

<HEADLINE> Woman Pleads in 'Crush' Videos  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKEECHOBEE, Fla. (AP) -- A woman pleaded no contest to animal
cruelty for her part in ''crush'' videos, which show women crushing
small animals to death with their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Loudermilk, 29, was sentenced Friday to two years of
probation, 300 hours of community service and psychiatric
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The videos were made by Loudermilk's husband, Bryan, who died in
June after being crushed under the rear wheel of his own truck. She
turned the videotapes over to a detective investigating his death.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes are sold to people who get sexual pleasure from
watching the sight of a woman crushing rats, mice and other small
animals.
</P>
<P>
   In the tapes she handed over, Loudermilk was seen stepping on
rabbits and mice until they were dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was abhorrent and cruel,'' said Assistant State Attorney
Bernard Romero. ''My first instinct was to seek the maximum
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   But the case was more complex than it seemed, Romero said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the defense's contention that she was not a willing
participant (in the videos) and that she was beaten many times by
Bryan Loudermilk,'' Romero said.
</P>
<P>
   She was charged in July with two counts of felony animal
cruelty, which were lessened to misdemeanors in a plea deal.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Orders U.S. To Pay Billions  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- In a symbolic lawsuit, Cuba has ordered the United
States to pay $121 billion in damages for causing the communist
island economic harm during a four-decade-long trade embargo, state
media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the decision, the Communist Party daily Granma
said that the U.S. government had been informed of the ruling on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have never commented on the lawsuit, which
was filed last year in an attempt to draw attention to the
suffering that Cuba says its people have endured under the embargo
imposed after President Fidel Castro took power in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has also never commented on a similar
previously filed lawsuit. In the first suit, a Cuban court in
November found the U.S. government liable for deaths and damage
caused by ''aggressive policies'' toward the island and ordered the
United States to pay $181.1 billion in reparations.
</P>
<P>
   Both lawsuits appeared to be a response to the ruling by a U.S.
federal judge in Miami last year ordering Cuba to pay $187 million
to the families of three Americans killed in 1996 when Cuban
military jets shot down two small private planes off the island's
coast. The ruling has been appealed.
</P>
<P>
   While the Cuban government used the suits to make a political
point, it appeared unlikely that either would result in any damages
being paid. There are no American funds in Cuba that could be
seized.
</P>
<P>
   Even local news coverage of the trial has been overshadowed by
the government's ongoing focus on the case of Elian Gonzalez, the
6-year-old castaway whose rescue off the coast of Florida last
November set off an international custody battle that continues
today.
</P>
<P>
   The court's final ruling mentioned Elian, saying that the
custody battle would never have occurred if not for the Cuban
Adjustment Act, a 1966 U.S. law that allows Cubans who reach
American soil to apply for U.S. residency. Elian fell under that
law because he reached U.S. soil after he was rescued and taken to
a hospital for medical care.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, the government estimated that 70,000 people
showed up for a rally in eastern Cuba to press for the child's
return to his communist homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The government-organized rally in Puerto Padre, about 400 miles
east of Havana, was the latest in a series of large events being
held in different provincial cities each weekend. Located on Cuba's
northern coast, Puerto Padre is a popular departure point for Cuban
rafters trying to emigrate illegally to the United States.

<HEADLINE> New 'Big Dig Chief' Fires Lobbyists  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The new chief of the financially troubled Big Dig
construction project has fired six consulting firms, declaring it
excessive to spend $439,000 per year on political lobbying and
public relations.
</P>
<P>
   The firings, announced Friday, came under a sweeping employee
purge and spending review by Andrew Natsios, who took charge of the
Big Dig last month. His predecessor, James Kerasiotes, was fired
after a federal audit charged him with concealing a $2 billion cost
overrun.
</P>
<P>
   Known officially as the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel
Project, the Big Dig will bury three miles of Interstate 93 beneath
downtown Boston. It was originally expected to cost $2.6 billion,
but the federal government now puts the price tag at $13.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The project was widely viewed as a drain on state finances and a
hassle for hundreds of thousands of commuters -- even before
allegations of mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Boston's best-known and most politically connected
consultants were dismissed from the Big Dig, such as media
strategist George Regan, a longtime confidante of Kerasiotes, and
the lobbying firm GPC O'Neill, headed by former Lieut. Gov. Thomas
P. O'Neill III.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reviewed these consulting contracts and have
determined that they are not necessary and certainly not
essential,'' Natsios spokesman Joe Landolfi said. ''We want to
start with a clean slate.''

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Province Under Quarantine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) -- Mongolia's southeastern province of
Dornogobi is under quarantine after an outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease, a civil defense spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The government posted troops at entry and exit points to seal
off the province after 140 animals were reported dead, said
spokesman Col. Yondoniin Tserendavaa of the Mongolian Civil Defense
Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Quarantine officials were testing another 17,000 animals for the
disease as they awaited a shipment of vaccine from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the situation under control,'' Tserendavaa said.
</P>
<P>
   Outbreaks of the disease -- which is deadly to cloven-hoofed
animals but not people -- have also been reported in Japan and South
Korea, causing neighboring countries including Mongolia to ban
exports of meat and livestock from both countries.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak was a blow to Mongolian herders, who were already
devastated by drought and unusually cold and snowy weather that has
killed more than 2.2 million head of livestock so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The combined disasters have caused meat prices in the capital,
Ulan Bator, to triple since March.
</P>
<P>
   The quarantine in Dornogobi caused local train service to be
suspended, leaving some 500 passengers stranded and complaining of
food shortages, officials said. The international service from
Beijing was also not making stops in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Mongolian experts said they believed the disease originated in
China. Chinese authorities, however, have said their herds are free
of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease reported
in Mongolia since 1974.

<HEADLINE> Two Philippine Headless Bodies Found  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALIPAO, Philippines (AP) -- Troops on patrol near the former
stronghold of a group of hostage-taking Muslim rebels made a grisly
discovery Saturday: two headless bodies buried in a shallow grave.
</P>
<P>
   The corpses were the first evidence that the Abu Sayyaf rebels
actually beheaded two of their Filipino captives, as they had
claimed last month.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers near the former rebel camp in southern Basilan province
spotted the grave and dug up the two headless male bodies. The dead
men's hands were tied, said Col. Fernando Bajed of the army's 103rd
brigade.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels seized about 50 hostages, including many children,
from two schools in March. They released about 20 of them, but
then, two weeks ago, they announced they had beheaded two teachers
because the government had ignored their demands.
</P>
<P>
   Though the rebels presented no proof that they had killed the
teachers, the military responded to the claim by attacking the
group's stronghold on April 22.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers fled with their remaining 27 hostages last
weekend, just before their camp was overrun by the military.
Pursuing soldiers later rescued 15 of the hostages, but four others
were killed by the rebels. The guerrillas are believed to be still
holding about eight people.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller but more radical of two groups
fighting for an independent Islamic state in the impoverished
Mindanao region, home of the country's Muslim minority. In exchange
for the hostages, they had demanded the release of three terrorists
from U.S. jails, including Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993
bombing of New York's World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   On nearby Jolo island, other Abu Sayyaf rebels holding a
separate group of 21 hostages, including 10 foreign tourists, have
also threatened to behead two captives if the military does not
pull back from the area.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials confirmed Saturday that at least some of the
Jolo island rebels had slipped through a military cordon and were
believed to be escaping with the hostages into the hills of Patikul
town. Two soldiers were killed and six wounded in four separate
clashes with the rebels in Talipao on Friday, the military's
Southern Command said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Envoys made contact with the rebels Saturday. The rebels were to
submit written demands, government negotiator Nur Misuari said, but
the clashes could mean a delay.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us to commence any formal talks, we need what they call a
climate of confidence that there would be no betrayal,'' Misuari
said.
</P>
<P>
   Contacts between the kidnappers and the negotiators had been cut
last week after hundreds of troops encircled the area where the
hostages had been held in a small bamboo hut. A series of clashes
erupted on Tuesday and Wednesday as the rebels attempted to escape.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 hostages include three Germans, two French nationals, two
South Africans, two Finns and one Lebanese in addition to 10
Malaysians and one Filipino. Several of the hostages' governments
have urged restraint by the military and called for a peaceful
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the latest violence in the southern Philippines,
two bus bombs killed six people and injured 35 more Saturday, DXJM
Radio in Butuan and hospital staff said. A larger bomb was found in
a third bus and defused.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another bomb was found on a bus Saturday evening in the
southern city of Davao. The chief of the city's anti-terrorist unit
was seriously injured trying to detonate it, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal gangs here sometimes bomb buses to extort money from
companies. But the military blamed the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front, the larger Muslim rebel group, for other explosions in
recent days.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Claim Capture in Chad  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN LINNEE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Rebels fighting to oust Chadian President
Idriss Deby said Saturday they had captured an army garrison in the
country's north.
</P>
<P>
   Kailan said the garrison at Zouar, a small town with an airfield
560 miles north of the capital, N'Djamena, fell without a fight on
Friday. The day before, rebels took Zoumri, a smaller army post
east of Bardai, without firing a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government troops just fled south when they saw our guys
coming,'' said Kailan Ahmed Touer, Paris-based spokesman for the
Movement for Democracy and Justice in Chad, or MDJT.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't have the will to fight,'' Kailan said of the
government troops.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel statement claimed that government soldiers attacked
civilians as they fled, killing livestock and poisoning wells in
the semi-desert region.
</P>
<P>
   Kailan also said it was ''common knowledge'' that Libya is
ferrying Chadian government troops by air from the military base at
Faya-Largeau to the Libyan air base at Aozou-Tanoua astride the
Chad-Libyan border.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately possible to obtain comment on the rebel
claims from the government in N'Djamena.
</P>
<P>
   Kailan said the rebel's next objective was the oasis of Bardai,
the capital of Chad's mountainous Tebesti region. Zouar is 75 miles
south of Bardai, Zoumri is to the east. A year ago the rebels
claimed to have Bardai surrounded.
</P>
<P>
   Southerners ruled Chad, a landlocked poor country, from
independence from France in 1960 to 1980 and were then succeeded by
a series of rebel leaders from the north.
</P>
<P>
   With the assistance of France, Deby ousted Hissene Habre in
December 1990. Habre, also with French help, ousted his former
comrade-in-arms Goukouni Oueddei, who now lives in exile between
Algeria and Libya, in May 1982. Libya helped put Goukouni in power
in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Sharif Accused of Corruption  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Deposed premier Nawaz Sharif's
government tapped the telephones of judges, journalists, opposition
politicians and leading businessmen and indulged in massive
corruption, the attorney general said, according to Saturday
newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Aziz A. Munshi told Pakistan's Supreme Court
Friday that the Sharif government had bugged scores of telephones,
including those of Chief Justice Irshad Hasan Khan, former Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto and politician Imran Khan, the
English-language daily The News said.
</P>
<P>
   Munshi was appearing before the Supreme Court to defend the Oct.
12 military takeover that ousted Sharif from power. Army Chief Gen.
Pervez Musharraf overthrew the elected government in a bloodless
coup, charging that Sharif's regime was rife with corruption and
economic mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Munshi said the telephones of several newspaper organizations
and international news agencies -- including The Associated Press
and Reuters -- were being tapped by spy agencies on the order of the
deposed government.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear if the bugs had been removed.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's party gave no immediate response after Munshi's
allegations in court.
</P>
<P>
   The military regime found Sharif guilty of hijacking, and
sentenced him to two concurrent life sentences. He is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Munshi also accused Sharif of misusing power to buy state-owned
land at below market value. He said the ex-prime minister was
guilty of tax evasion and of defaulting on his bank loans, the
English-language daily Dawn reported.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, whose family's industrial empire is valued at $3
billion, paid just $16 in tax in one year, Munshi said.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is a major issue in Pakistan, where Sharif and Bhutto
were both dismissed from power on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   The military-led government has promised to root out corruption
and collect the stolen wealth. It is pursing several corruption
cases against Sharif, Bhutto and their former aides. Both former
premiers deny the charges.

<HEADLINE> Leader: Ethnic Cleansing in Cyprus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
alleged Saturday that the Turkish community of Cyprus had suffered
''ethnic cleansing'' long before the Balkans did.
</P>
<P>
   In his last official visit to the breakaway Turkish Cypriot
state, Demirel was referring to the strife between Turkish and
Greek Cypriots in the years before Turkey's 1974 invasion, which
left an estimated 2,500 people dead on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ethnic cleansing was tried here first, before
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo,'' Demirel told a crowd of about one
thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his long political career, Demirel has taken a close

<HEADLINE> Actors Seek Harvard Wage Hike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Native sons Ben Affleck and Matt Damon
added celebrity power to a rally Saturday urging Harvard University
to raise the minimum wage for its employees to $10.25
</P>
<P>
   The City Council's ''Harvard Living Wage'' campaign is the
latest showdown between the wealthy, elite university and a city so
liberal its nickname is ''The People's Republic of Cambridge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ivy League vs. The Little Guy was the theme of Affleck and
Damon's film ''Good Will Hunting,'' which drew on their childhood.
Affleck's parents worked at Harvard, while Damon attended Harvard --
but dropped out -- and both went to the un-elite public Cambridge
Rindge and Latin High School.
</P>
<P>
   ''Make this school a place where you don't have to avert your
eyes in shame when you encounter a janitor in the hallway,'' said
Affleck, whose father was, in fact, a janitor and whose stepmother
was a cleaning woman.

<HEADLINE> O'Connor Successor Faces Challenges  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The new archbishop of New York will have to walk
a spiritual tightrope, balancing traditional teachings with
contemporary challenges as he takes over America's most prominent
Roman Catholic pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   He will be Pope John Paul II's point man in the world's most
powerful nation. But his flock -- including those who support birth
control and women seeking a greater role in the church -- may not
follow easily.
</P>
<P>
   ''We, the baptized, are the church. We really don't look to the
hierarchy,'' said Sister Mary Boys, professor of practical theology
at New York's Union Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Some problems facing the successor to Cardinal John O'Connor,
who died Wednesday at age 80 after 16 years as cardinal, are
peculiar to New York, with its spectacular mix of cultures and
languages. But others reflect the challenge of the Catholic Church
across the country in an age when strict rules are ever more open
to question.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,700-square-mile New York archdiocese, with 2.4 million
faithful, faces tight finances, a diminishing supply of priests and
nuns and a radical change in the population to which it ministers.
</P>
<P>
   It is the nation's third largest Catholic diocese after Los
Angeles and Chicago. In the 19th century, it was populated by Irish
immigrants. In the early 20th century, it was Italians.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the reason why O'Connor -- the latest in a long line of
Irish-American archbishops -- learned Spanish: More than a third of
New York's Catholics are now Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   About two miles from the bronze portals of St. Patrick's
Cathedral on Fifth Avenue is St. Elizabeth's Church in the
Washington Heights neighborhood, where working-class Puerto Ricans
and Dominicans struggle to feed their children.
</P>
<P>
   ''The church is under pressure -- financial pressure, the
pressure of the drug scene and the sex scene in the neighborhood,
the pressure of families that aren't able to stay intact,'' said
the Rev. Gerry Walsh, St. Elizabeth's Irish-American pastor.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the biggest problems faced by the American
Catholic Church is that the number of immigrants is rising while
the number of priests and nuns is dropping -- by about 50 percent in
the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to keep the ship afloat. People are hungry for
religious faith,'' said Walsh, 58, who presides over Masses in
Spanish and English.
</P>
<P>
   Juliassa Figueroa, who worships at St. Elizabeth's, doesn't mind
that the church's pastor is not Hispanic. But she said she misses
the close-knit friendships from her native Puerto Rico, the sense
of community that carried over in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ''People over there were more together, we knew each other,''
said Figueroa, 32. ''Here, you come to church, you see the people
in church, and then you don't see them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The new archbishop will replace a cardinal who was a powerhouse,
both spiritual and temporal. In the world's media capital, he would
appear with politicians and celebrities, and his comments on social
issues in Sunday homilies made news.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connor was no bean counter. There are shortfalls in the
archdiocese's $527 million annual budget. The money supports 413
parishes, 17 hospitals, 238 Catholic elementary schools and 55 high
schools, among other church institutions tended by the
archdiocese's almost 900 priests, 3,700 nuns and 1,000 lay workers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the financial troubles, the new archbishop will encounter
parishioners who are increasingly setting their own agenda for what
Catholicism means. Some attend Mass while holding opinions on
abortion, birth control and homosexuality that run counter to
official Vatican teachings.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor held to the Vatican line on such social issues, as well
as in failing to encourage the promotion of women to higher
positions of authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many, many women theologically trained and educated
for pastoral positions, but I'm not mindful of anything Cardinal
O'Connor has done to make it possible for such women to preach,''
said Sister Boys, a member of the Sisters of the Holy Names of
Jesus and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   One New York columnist even suggested that a woman should
replace O'Connor -- technically possible, since a cardinal need not
be a priest.
</P>
<P>
   ''One more nice old guy -- or even a nasty old guy -- is not going
to be able to patch the leaks in the plumbing,'' wrote Jim Dwyer in
the New York Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The comment suggests a trait that the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor
in chief of the Catholic magazine America, said the archbishop of
New York must have: ''He's got to have thick skin.''
</P>
<P>
   A top U.S. bishop, Joseph A. Fiorenza of Houston, said in Rome
on Saturday that he expected the Vatican to announce O'Connor's
successor soon. In New York, thousands of people passed through St.
Patrick's Cathedral, where the cardinal's body was to lie until
Monday's funeral Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorenza, who had lunch with the pope at the Vatican on Friday,
said O'Connor's death dominated their conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a big personal loss for the holy father,'' Fiorenza
said. ''The pope relied on him.''

people in its 27-year fight to abolish Northern Ireland as a Protestant-majority
state linked to Britain, pledged to reveal its secretly stored tons of
stockpiled weapons to international arms inspectors. The process, the IRA said,

Moreno of El Paso, Texas, a Harvard-educated lawyer in private practice since
1981, lacked the necessary experience to sit on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of

Committee, which reviews judicial nominations, cited the unqualified rating that

Palestinian representatives walked out of talks at the Israeli Red Sea resort of
Eilat, after the Israelis submitted a map showing a proposal for a Palestinian
state on territory which the Palestinians viewed as totally inadequate. Under
the Israeli proposal, the Palestinian state would consist of one enclave in the

dean of New York University's Stern School of Business, at an NYU legal
conference on the case held late last week. ''I think the likelihood is that it
will be settled,'' Gray said -- but after the November election. The Justice
Department would be ''more the same with Gore, but there would be a change. Any

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Socialists Shift on NATO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) -- In an effort by the opposition Socialist
Party to boost its image at home and abroad, the party's leader on
Saturday proposed a radical shift in policy toward seeking NATO
membership.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after the mass riots that ultimately knocked the
ex-communist Socialist Party from power, Georgi Parvanov said the
party should support Bulgaria's future integration into NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bulgaria will defend better its national interests while being
in NATO rather than staying away from it,'' Parvanov told delegates
of his party's regular congress.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the new position on NATO was ''a natural step
in the party's evolution on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in an attempt to appease hard-liners intent against
Bulgaria's opening up to the West, the moderate party leader said
the issue should be decided in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria hopes to join NATO in its next round of enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   Once the most staunch of Soviet allies, the Balkan country won
respect from Western countries during the Kosovo crisis when it
allowed NATO to use the country's airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Parvanov, 43, also called for a new model of government based on
a broad social-liberal coalition, adding the Socialists should
adopt a transparent, non-ideological and pragmatic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Parvanov said that his party would want to participate in a
future Bulgarian government.

<HEADLINE> Educators Discuss Evolution  </HEADLINE>
By JULIE GOODMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Stephen Jay Gould, a Harvard University
evolution proponent, told a gathering of New England educators
Saturday that the creationism debate is an American ''bizarrity,''
and urged them not to fear its spread.
</P>
<P>
   Gould, who teaches zoology and geology, spoke at a day-long
Brown University symposium on teaching evolution. He encouraged his
audience of teachers, principals and college professors not to fret
over creationist challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ''As insidious as it may seem, at least it's not a worldwide
movement,'' he said. ''I hope everyone realizes the extent to which
this is a local, indigenous, American bizarrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould also urged the audience to keep in perspective the
decision last year by the Kansas Board of Education to approve
science standards that de-emphasize evolution in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''Isn't it absurd though, if what you really want is to get rid
of evolution ... that instead you pass an absurd law -- which the
country's going to laugh at -- making evolution optional,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is ''literally like saying we're going to continue to teach
English, but grammar's optional,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Creationism is the belief that a divine power created the
universe in six days. The theory of evolution holds that humans
evolved from more primitive species.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Fogarty, chairman of the science department at
Providence's Lincoln School, said what happened in Kansas could
happen elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to be ready for it, ready in the sense of being
educated on both sides,'' she said. ''We can't dismiss
(creationism) as being fanaticism, because it isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Lance Arnold, a life sciences teacher in Connecticut, said he
excludes discussion of religion from his evolution lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Before he teaches the subject to his students, he tells them:
''I'm going to teach you what is known to be true from a scientific
point of view. You can apply your religion to that.''
</P>
<P>
   If they have questions about how their religion fits in, he says
he isn't afraid to say he doesn't know the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a theologian, I'm a scientist,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Officials Visit Ex-Rebel Leader  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- As residents of Sierra Leone's
capital grew increasingly fearful of attack, the atmosphere
Saturday at the home of the notorious former rebel leader who lives
in their midst was almost carnival-like.
</P>
<P>
   Women in brightly colored African print dresses sang and waved.
Comedians dressed in oversized clothes, their faces painted white,
cracked jokes for dozens of former rebel fighters and armed U.N.
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a dapper gray suit and shiny shoes, Foday Sankoh
played host Saturday to a steady stream of visitors -- U.N.
officials, a high level delegation from Libya and supporters -- all
of them asking about the fate of more than 300 U.N. peacekeepers
reportedly held by his forces somewhere in the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   To each one he repeated that his Revolutionary United Front was
committed to this West African country's shaky peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people they are foreigners here. They do not know the
terrain,'' Sankoh said in an interview with The Associated Press.
''As time goes on, I think all of them will come out,'' he said,
adding that he had instructed rebel fighters to look for the
missing soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that if anyone was being held by his soldiers,
they would be freed.
</P>
<P>
   Such contradictions are common with Sankoh, an unpredictable man
worshipped by many of his followers, who often refer to him simply
as ''pa'' or ''the leader.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who killed tens of thousands of civilians and
deliberately maimed many more during eight years of civil war,
insisted that the United Nations and the Sierra Leone government
are the ones jeopardizing the implementation of a peace accord
signed in July.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he spoke, U.N. officials reported that they had lost
contact with 200 more peacekeepers in the country's interior. If
the troops, all of them Zambians, have been captured by the rebels,
that would bring the number of U.N. personnel being held by the RUF
to nearly 500.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF, who officially are part of a power-sharing government,
say the missing U.N. soldiers accuse the peacekeepers of provoking
clashes in the interior by trying to forcibly disarm rebel
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Sankoh's supporters were milling Saturday outside his
Freetown house, a plain, two-story building with green trim and
white paint fading to gray -- and heavily guarded by U.N. troops.
While none of his followers were brandishing guns, concealed
weapons could occasionally be spotted on some of the RUF guards.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of their comrades living in the jungle, who often
struggle to find food to eat, many of Sankoh's hangers-on wore
flashy jewelry, brand new bluejeans, t-shirts and hooded tops.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, gathered under a canopy made of wooden poles
and plastic sheeting, were the political organizers of the rebel
political party -- the Revolutionary United Front Party -- who
listened attentively as an RUF official lectured them on the basics
of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, who has a government position equivalent to
vice-president, had a long list of complaints against the Sierra
Leone government. He said the appointment of RUF ministers was a
sham and his party was being ''marginalized'' by the country's
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Saturday, the RUF claimed disarmament was
one-sided, with members of a pro-government militia known as the
Kamajors refusing to turn in their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   RUF spokesman Eldred Collins also complained that ex-fighters
who turned in their guns were not getting any help starting new
lives.
</P>
<P>
   But Sankoh insisted such grievances had nothing to do with the
incidents that began Monday, as the West African intervention force
that has fought the rebels for years on behalf of the government
made its final withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Some former members of that force, were at Sankoh's house
Saturday. Now wearing the United Nation's trademark blue caps, they
sat side by side with their former foes, each keeping watch over
the residence -- and each other.
</P>
<P>
   ''The road to peace is rough,'' Sankoh said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Listeria Measures  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government will require companies that
churn out hot dogs and cold cuts to test their plants for the
deadly listeria bacterium, President Clinton announced Saturday.
The goal is to reduce listeria-caused illnesses by one-half over
five years.
</P>
<P>
   While poisoning fewer people than pathogens such as salmonella,
Listeria monocytogenes is estimated to kill 500 Americans a year
and sicken 2,000 more. A third of the cases involve pregnant women
and their babies, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is one of a series of food safety initiatives the
administration has promoted recently, from eggs to genetically
altered foods, as Clinton seeks to burnish his legacy as consumer
protector. The proposals may not take effect until after Clinton
leaves office in January and still could be blocked by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Chiding lawmakers for not going along so far with the egg safety
plan, Clinton said, ''We should be doing more, not less, to ensure
the safety of our food.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the listeria rules the Agriculture Department expects to
propose in four months, processors will have to test for Listeria
monocytogenes and related bacteria on equipment, floors and other
areas around their plants. The tests are designed to warn of
sanitation problems that could lead to meat contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies already test on their own. They do not have to
share the results with the government and have no government
guidelines for what must be done when listeria bacteria are found.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials say they do not plan to require systematic
testing of meat products themselves, a measure consumer advocates
contend would provide an extra check on plant processes. Department
inspectors now test small numbers of samples for listeria.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 2.5 percent of 3,547 samples checked nationwide tested
positive for the bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   ''While our administration has already taken a number of
important steps to reduce the threat of listeria, it's clear we
must do more to protect Americans,'' Clinton said in Saturday's
weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the testing requirement, the administration will
consider requiring new labeling for packaged meats to warn
consumers about listeria.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's plan is a ''great leap forward'' for
consumers, said Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in
the Public Interest. ''It is the first time the processed meat
industry has been required to check for bacteria.''
</P>
<P>
   An outbreak of listeria poisoning in 1998 killed 15 people and
sickened at least 100 and was traced to meat processed at a Sara
Lee Corp. plant in Michigan. The company recalled 15 million pounds
of hot dogs and lunch meats, and the Agriculture Department ordered
plants nationwide to revamp their processing methods to prevent
listeria contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's goal is realistic, but ''there is a lot to be done
between now and there in figuring out how we get there,'' said Dane
Bernard, vice president of the National Food Processors
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''Government data show that (listeria) has declined in
ready-to-eat meat and poultry products, proving that industry and
government are taking the right steps to address this problem,''
Bernard said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven food industry organizations said in a joint statement that
a recent survey found that more than 90 percent of processed meat
and poultry plants already use microbiological tests to help
control listeria, complementing tests already performed by federal
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The industry also is researching new technologies to prevent
formation of listeria, including pasteurization and ingredients and
packaging that retard pathogen growth, said Jim Hodges, president
of the American Meat Institute Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Testing for pathogens can be helpful,'' Hodges said. ''But
testing doesn't kill pathogens -- technology does.''
</P>
<P>
   Listeria can be found in hot dogs, delicatessen meats, soft
cheeses like Brie or feta, unpasteurized milk products and
undercooked meat, poultry or seafood.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria causes flu-like symptoms in most healthy people, but it
can be serious in the young, old or weak. In pregnant women, the
bacterium can cause miscarriage or stillbirth even if the mother
feels no symptoms. Pregnant women are advised to reheat
ready-to-eat foods, including cold cuts, and avoid soft cheeses.

<HEADLINE> 10 New EU Members Said Possible  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Ten eastern and southern European countries could
join the European Union by 2005, a German magazine reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The EU commissioner for expansion, Guenter Verheugen, has
outlined a proposed timetable in talks with EU leaders, Der Spiegel
reported. The plan would be slower than some aspirants, notably
Poland, want.
</P>
<P>
   Verheugen sees front-runners Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus becoming members on Jan. 1,
2005 -- along with Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia and Malta, the news

<P>
   At a December summit of the existing 15 EU members, Verheugen
will propose that the economic bloc set the end of 2002 as formal
target date for completing membership talks, with another two years
for national parliaments to ratify the accession accords, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Concern has been growing among the first-wave candidates that
the European Union is slowing down its enlargement process after
holding out the promise of quicker progress in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But EU leaders have stressed that it's up to the Eastern
European countries -- particularly Poland -- to reform their
economies and inefficient agriculture and meet other EU standards,
such as environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   Poland has set a 2003 target, and its leaders were stung by a
recent report by a German business group saying it might not be
ready to join before 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The EU began membership talks with the six front-runners two
years ago. Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Malta
began entry negotiations on Feb. 15.

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Airbus in Race for Orders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Forget the gold ring. When it comes to Boeing and
rival Airbus Industrie, the company with the most entries in the
airliner order book is the winner.
</P>
<P>
   And right now they are virtually neck-and-neck for the year.
</P>
<P>
   After lagging behind Boeing for much of the year, Airbus pulled
into a near dead heat Friday with what is said to be a 50-plane
order from the industry's biggest aircraft leasing company.
</P>
<P>
   The order from International Lease Finance Corp. in Los Angeles
is worth more than $3 billion at list prices, the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer reported Saturday. An announcement that a firm
deal has been struck could come next week, the newspaper quoted an
unidentified source as saying.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of April, Airbus had won 120 new orders this year,
according to the company's Web site. The addition of 50 planes for
International Lease would bring the European consortium's total to
170.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has 150 new orders, according to its Web site. But that
does not include a 30-plane order announced Thursday by American
Trans Air. The ATA order will not be added to Boeing's total until
a final purchase agreement is signed.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus edged Boeing for the first time ever last year, when it
landed about 60 percent of all new orders for planes with more than
100 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Top Boeing executives say the Seattle company is well positioned
to win the majority of new airplane orders in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''As clearly as I can say this, I think we are in a great
position vis a vis Airbus,'' Boeing Chairman Phil Condit said at
the company's annual meeting Monday in Huntsville, Ala.

<HEADLINE> Rallies Held in Miami Over Elian  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Thousands of people rallied Saturday to call for
unity amid mounting tensions following the removal of Elian
Gonzalez from the home of his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 demonstrators in Cutler Ridge in south
Miami-Dade County lined the streets and waved U.S. flags in support
of the federal action.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the last five months all we've seen are the
Cuban-Americans protesting,'' said Tom Strybala, 37. ''Why is it
going to make things more divided for us to protest? It doesn't
seem right to sit by and not say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   At a major intersection in surburban Miami, about 350 people
waved American flags and criticized recent actions taken by Miami
Mayor Joe Carollo and held signs that read, ''Joe Must Go'' and
''Disagree, but do not disrespect.''
</P>
<P>
   No arrests were made at either rally, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The city has been divided since April 22, when armed agents with
the Immigration and Naturalization Service seized the 6-year-old
Cuban boy and reunited him with his father. Elian had lived with
the Miami relatives since November, when his mother and 10 others
drowned in a boat crossing from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The very public tug-of-war between city officials since the raid
has sparked criticism that the city government is out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo criticized the police chief for not alerting him in
advance about the federal raid, and fired the city manager. Police
Chief William O'Brien resigned, saying he was tired of the mayor's
destructive politics. City Manager Donald Warshaw remains in
office, following a court injunction that delayed his removal until
after an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like what has happened with the mayor and with City
Hall,'' said Gildo Rivas, 71, a Cuban-American who has lived in
Miami for 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pearson-Martinez, 28, said he is tired of feeling
misrepresented in his community. ''Lawlessness has been endorsed at
the highest levels of city government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rally organizers from Citizens for a Better Community said the
gathering was intended to help patch community divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Quinn, vice chair and treasurer of the executive
committee of the Reform Party, encouraged voters to express their
displeasure in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I brought 1,100 voter registrations forms today, and I hope to
have them all filled,'' Quinn said. ''But I'm also out here to
protest the current political system of Miami.''

IRA Agrees To Disarm, Peace Possible
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The Irish Republican Army proclaimed today
that it will soon start to disarm -- a breakthrough that makes lasting peace
possible in Northern Ireland after 30 years of bloodshed. The outlawed IRA,
which killed about 1,800 people in its 27-year fight to abolish Northern Ireland
as a Protestant-majority state linked to Britain, pledged to reveal its secretly
stored tons of stockpiled weapons to international arms inspectors. The process,
the IRA said, would render its arsenal ''completely and verifiably beyond use.''

Two Headless Bodies Found in Philippines

   TALIPAO, Philippines (AP) -- Troops patrolling near the former stronghold of
a group of hostage-taking Muslim rebels found on Saturday two headless bodies
buried in a shallow grave. The corpses were the first evidence that the Abu
Sayyaf rebels actually beheaded two of their Filipino captives, as they had
claimed last month. The rebels seized about 50 hostages, including many
children, from two schools in March. In exchange for the hostages, the Abu
Sayyaf have demanded the release of three terrorists from U.S. jails, including
Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 bombing of New York's World Trade

Clues Emerge in E-mail Virus Hunt

   NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. authorities said today they are helping police in the
Philippines search for the creator of the most damaging computer virus ever, the
''Love Bug'' that swept around the world this week. The identity of the
programmer was still unclear. Security experts in the United States said clues
in the virus code pointed to a student at a computer college in the Philippines,
while a Swedish researcher said traces on the Internet pointed to a bored German
exchange student. The virus caused a flood of e-mails with the alluring subject
line ''ILOVEYOU'' to course through computer systems in more than 20 countries

Experts: Microsoft Settlement After Election

   SEATTLE (AP) -- Some antitrust experts predict the Justice Department won't

office. The predictions were made by Microsoft legal consultant C. Boyden Gray,
who served as an aide to Presidents Reagan and Bush, and Nicholas Economides,
dean of New York University's Stern School of Business, at an NYU legal
conference on the case held late last week. ''I think the likelihood is that it
will be settled,'' Gray said -- but after the November election. The Justice
Department would be ''more the same with Gore, but there would be a change. Any
administration is going to put new people in.''

<HEADLINE> Air Force Drug Lab Official Removed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A top manager has been removed from his post
at an Air Force drug lab that processes random drug screens for
hundreds of thousands of airmen each year.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Hatzis is accused of failing to follow proper procedures at
the lab at Brooks Air Force Base, Capt. Dawn M.K. Zoldi, an Air
Force legal adviser, said in Saturday's San Antonio Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the claim, Air Force officials said no one has been
falsely accused of failing a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   In its ''notice of removal'' filed against Hatzis, the Air Force
accused him of ''deliberate destruction and falsification of
forensic laboratory records.''
</P>
<P>
   While denying claims that he destroyed documentation, Hatzis
declined to discuss his actions. He has not been charged with any
crimes, but faces dismissal from the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Legal fallout might have already occurred as a result of
problems at the lab. Two weeks ago, a court-martial against Tech.
Sgt. Chalmers Addison was dropped by the commander of Barksdale Air
Force Base in Bossier City, La.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Addison had used marijuana, and the allegation
was based on a urine test done by a section of the lab overseen by
Hatzis until his removal in December.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale officials said Friday the dismissal was based on
insufficient evidence in Addison's case, and not because of any
lack of confidence in the drug testing program.
</P>
<P>
   Tests done by Hatzis' group are used in all Air Force
disciplinary actions. The tests confirm previous drug screens done
by the lab and can trigger a court-martial and even expulsion from
the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be an issue,'' Zoldi conceded when asked if test
results might be challenged as a result of the allegations against
Hatzis. ''But, again, every case stands on its own merit and the
Air Force stands behind their test results 110 percent.''

<HEADLINE> Finger Sidelines Brewers' Jenkins  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- In a season full of bad breaks for the
Milwaukee Brewers, this one was the worst yet.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Jenkins, the Brewers' leader in nearly every hitting
category, will be out for one month after breaking a bone in the
middle finger of his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee put Jenkins on the 15-day disabled list Saturday after
a 3-2 loss to Montreal. He was held out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins hurt the finger on Friday night while swinging at a
pitch in the second inning of Milwaukee's 10-2 loss to Montreal. He
lost control of his bat on the swing, and it flew into the crowd
and hit the arm of a female spectator who left the game wearing a
soft cast.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins came out in the fifth inning and said he thought he had
merely sprained the finger, which didn't appear swollen or crooked.
But X-rays of the injury taken Saturday morning revealed the break.
A team spokesman said he's expected to miss a month.
</P>
<P>
   His loss is a blow for the Brewers, whose team batting average
is already a majors-worst .227. Jenkins, the team's cleanup hitter
and everyday left fielder, has been the only reliable offensive
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee (10-20) has lost 15 of its last 19 games and is 2-7 on
its current homestand, which ends Sunday. The Brewers, already nine
games behind NL Central-leading St. Louis, have lost seven straight
series and will start a seven-game road trip Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins has hit 11 homers, tying him with four players for the
NL lead entering Saturday. He leads Milwaukee's regular players in
batting average (.298), RBIs (23), runs (19), hits (31), total
bases (69) and slugging percentage (.663).
</P>
<P>
   He had homered in three of the previous six games before his
injury, and he had hit a homer in each of the Brewers' last seven
series. He is also tied with Arizona's Steve Finley for the NL lead
in outfield assists (four).
</P>
<P>
   The team said the injury was a fracture to the middle joint of
the finger. Jenkins dressed for the game against Montreal and
caught the game's ceremonial first pitch, but was held out of the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Once a deep offensive team that played high-scoring games, the
Brewers have very little hitting depth this season. In an attempt
to improve Milwaukee's woeful pitching, first-year GM Dean Taylor
traded several vital components of the Brewers' fairly potent 1999
lineup during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Former Brewers infield starters Jeff Cirillo, Fernando Vina and
Jose Valentin are all thriving in their new homes, but except for
3-2 starter Jimmy Haynes, Taylor's pitching acquisitions haven't
made a dent in Milwaukee's losing ways.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins' break is the second major hand injury suffered by a
critical member of the Brewers' lineup in two seasons. All-Star
outfielder Jeromy Burnitz, who is currently mired in a 3-for-34
slump, missed a month of last season after breaking a bone in his
hand.

<HEADLINE> Giants 6, Rockies 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Shawn Estes scattered nine hits and Jeff
Kent went 3-for-3 with a triple and two runs scored Saturday as the
San Francisco Giants shut out the Colorado Rockies for the second
straight day, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have won six straight and are 12-2 following a 4-11
start.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which led the majors with a .300 batting average
coming in, has been blanked in consecutive games for the first time
since starting play in 1993. The Rockies had scored 72 runs in
their previous six games before the series.
</P>
<P>
   Estes (2-1) retired the side in order just twice, but worked out
of jams to win his second straight start. He struck out five and
walked three in his fifth career shutout and sixth complete game.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco went ahead with an unearned run in the fourth
against Rolando Arrojo (1-3). Kent scored from second with two outs
when second baseman Mike Lansing overthrew first base on Armando
Rios' slow infield chopper up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mueller's sacrifice fly made it 2-0 in the fifth, and San
Francisco added three runs in the sixth. Kent tripled and scored on
an RBI double by Rios. Doug Mirabelli added a two-run single for a
5-0 lead, and Mueller doubled a run in the eighth off Mike DeJean.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo, pitching for the first time since April 20 following a
stint on the disabled list caused by a strained left hamstring,
allowed all five runs -- four earned -- seven hits and four walks in
five-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado advanced runners to scoring position four times against
Estes. The Rockies loaded the bases with one out in the third, but
Todd Helton grounded into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Rockies are 0-for-12 with runners in scoring position
in the series. ... To make room for Arrojo on the roster, the
Rockies optioned RHP Giovanni Carrara to Colorado Springs. ...
Giants OF Barry Bonds was given the day off. ... Kent is 13-for-32
on the homestand with three home runs and eight RBIs. ... Estes is
3-0 in four starts against the Rockies since 1998.

<HEADLINE> Patient Drysdale Wins The Derby  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The waiting game is over for Neil
Drysdale.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale won the Kentucky Derby on Saturday with Fusaichi
Pegasus, eight years after enduring the frustration of scratching
A.P. Indy on race morning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, A.P. Indy turned up with a bruised foot on Derby Day
and never left the barn. The injury also kept him out of the
Preakness. But the colt came back to win the Belmont and was voted
horse of the year, giving Drysdale some consolation.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly didn't need any this week.
</P>
<P>
   The 1{-length victory Saturday by the Japanese-owned horse,
whose tongue-twister of a name often leads Drysdale to call him
''the colt,'' completed a dream week for the trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale, 52, was elected to racing's Hall of Fame on Tuesday.
D. Wayne Lukas followed the same path last year, getting into the
hall days before Charismatic won the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very humbling week and very rewarding,'' Drysdale said.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale is as cool as Fusaichi Pegasus can be contentious. He's
unfailingly polite, but it's obvious Drysdale doesn't thrive on the
spotlight like some of his fellow trainers.
</P>
<P>
   He's loathe to reveal much, if any, emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know I don't answer touchy-feely questions,'' he told
reporters asking what it meant to win the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale learned the two P's -- patience and planning -- during
four years as an assistant to the late Hall of Fame trainer Charlie
Whittingham in the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale, a former English teacher, opened his own stable in
1983. He trains on the same Southern California circuit as Lukas
and Bob Baffert, and is successful in a low-profile kind of way.
</P>
<P>
   His horses earned more than $4 million last year, and 124 of his
266 starters finished in the money. Drysdale was even better in
1998. He won a career-high 73 races and finished fourth among the
nation's trainers with earnings of $6.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Ky. Derby Trainers Examine Race  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE BAILEY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Jenine Sahadi is ready for life to return
to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks of lofty expectations quickly evaporated as Sahadi,
trainer of Santa Anita Derby winner The Deputy, watched in
frustration Saturday as her prize colt finished 14th in the
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Had The Deputy crossed the line first, Sahadi would have been
the first female trainer ever to claim the first jewel in horse
racing's Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   As tired as she got of answering the endless questions about
female trainers and their quest to win the Derby, she never turned
down an interview. Now, the fuss can die down and she can go back
to being just another trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very disappointed, but not so much for myself,'' a forlorn
Sahadi said. ''I feel bad for the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy, who went off as the second betting choice at 9-2,
trained well after arriving at Churchill Downs and seemed to become
comfortable with the track during workouts. He broke from the gate
strong, running with the leaders early, but tired and fell out of
contention.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was exhausted and just couldn't run,'' she said. ''I guess
you'd call that the beauty of the Kentucky Derby. We'll just pick
up, go home and regroup again.''
</P>
<P>
   Fan favorite Harold Rose, the 88-year-old trainer of Hal's Hope,
spent much of the last two weeks mugging for photos and telling
anyone within earshot of his love for the horse, which he credits
with helping him recover from major heart surgery last August.
</P>
<P>
   The colt led the race entering the final turn, but Rose could
only watch in disappointment as the Florida Derby winner faded and
struggled home to a 16th-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, he was in much the same situation as trainer D.
Wayne Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas is no stranger to the Derby winner's circle. He's been
there four times, including last year as trainer of 31-1 shot
Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   He saddled three in Saturday's race, but none would crack the
top half of the 19-horse field. Exchange Rate finished 12th, High
Yield finished 15th and Commendable wound up 17th.

   FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) -- UCLA took early leads in the first two
games, then battled back from a 13-8 deficit in the third Saturday
to sweep Ohio State and win the NCAA men's volleyball title for the
18th time.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State built a 5-point lead before UCLA had 5-0 run and

</P>
<P>
   The Bruins never trailed in any of the matches and were led by
Evan Thatcher with 15 kills. Chris Fash paced the Buckeyes with 15
kills.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who have won the title more than any team in NCAA
history, gave coach Al Scates his 20th overall win.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA finished the season 29-5. Ohio State went 25-4.

<HEADLINE> Polynice Thrives In Utah Lineup  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olden Polynice feels vindicated, and with
good reason. Labeled a disruptive force and even a ''cancer'' in
recent years, things could only get better at some point.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Polynice is now.
</P>
<P>
   While his former teams have been eliminated from the playoffs,
Polynice will start at center for Utah when the best-of-seven
Western Conference semifinals open Sunday in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   When Polynice signed as a free agent in August, it raised
eyebrows around the league. How could an outspoken, free-spirited
journeyman fit into the structured regime of Jazz coach Jerry
Sloan?
</P>
<P>
   No problem, it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we first met, Jerry had me sit down,'' Polynice said.
''He laid out all the rules, from the drawstring on down. He does
that with everyone on the team ... and we all abide by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''But once again,'' Polynice added with a cynical frown,
''you'll hear people saying I don't abide by any rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1999-2000 season offered a chance for Polynice to reshape
his image. He came to Utah after a year in Seattle and four
strenuous years in Sacramento, where it was said he eroded team
unity.
</P>
<P>
   ''That reputation went out the window when he got here,'' Sloan
said. ''He had to go on what our team is trying to do. We've got
great players that show great leadership. I think everything worked
out well.''
</P>
<P>
   After public spats with Sacramento teammates and management,
Polynice was described as a ''cancer'' in the locker room. He said
it was an incorrect and unfair assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ''A guy wouldn't play if his knee was sore or maybe he had a
hangnail, and it made me mad,'' Polynice recalled. ''I would say
something about it and then suddenly I'm a cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been a problem in Utah because of Sloan's clearly
defined expectations and a tendency among the Jazz players to
rarely acknowledge injuries while playing through them.
</P>
<P>
   Signed to push Greg Ostertag at center, the 35-year-old Polynice
became a starter and averaged 5.3 points and 5.5 rebounds during
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   After he scored 13 points in Utah's 96-93 victory over Seattle
on Friday night, Sonics coach Paul Westphal described Polynice as
the ''fifth player'' who made the difference for the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone, Utah's perennial All-Star forward, must have sensed
the same thing in August. He put aside years of feuding with
Polynice to welcome him to the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ''Olden has done everything he was supposed to do,'' Malone
said. ''When he came here, I told people to just give him a chance.
I believe it's the environment you're around, and he's done a great
job for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Polynice has found a comfort zone with the Jazz, but it's one he
said always existed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't come here looking to prove people wrong,'' he said.
''I'm the same person I was last year and the same person I was the
year before last. I didn't change anything about myself.''

<HEADLINE> Report: 34 Insurgents Dead in Algeria  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- At least 34 Islamic insurgents were
killed in two separate offensives last week against rebels in the
country's east and northwest, an Algerian newspaper reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the French-language daily Liberte, an army search
for a group of some 40 insurgents belonging to the radical Armed
Islamic Group ended Thursday with the death of 14 militants in the
Djebel Asfour region, near the western city of Tlemcen near the
Moroccan border.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known how many soldiers were killed in the operation,
launched days earlier after an incursion by the group into border
hamlets. Security forces have rarely reported their losses since
the start of the insurgency in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 insurgents were killed a week after the start of a
similar offensive by security forces, backed by air cover, in the
Bouira region, 75 miles east of the capital, Algiers, according to
the French-language daily La Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Daily violence continues in the north African country despite
peace efforts by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika that featured
partial amnesty for insurgents who turned themselves in by Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Armed Islamic Group and a smaller group centered in the
Bouira region refused the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 people have died since violence erupted after
the army canceled legislative elections that the Islamic Salvation
Front was poised to win. The Muslim fundamentalist party was
subsequently banned.

<HEADLINE> Ky. Derby Trainers Examine Loss  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE BAILEY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Jenine Sahadi is ready for life to return
to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks of lofty expectations quickly evaporated as Sahadi,
trainer of Santa Anita Derby winner The Deputy, watched in
frustration Saturday as her prize colt finished 14th in the
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Had The Deputy crossed the line first, Sahadi would have been
the first female trainer ever to claim the first jewel in horse
racing's Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   As tired as she got of answering the endless questions about
female trainers and their quest to win the Derby, she never turned
down an interview. Now, the fuss can die down and she can go back
to being just another trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very disappointed, but not so much for myself,'' Sahadi
said. ''I feel bad for the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy, who went off as the second betting choice at 9-2,
trained well upon arriving at Churchill Downs and seemed to become
comfortable with the track during workouts. He broke from the gate
strong, running with the leaders early, but tired and fell out of
contention.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was exhausted and just couldn't run,'' she said. ''I guess
you'd call that the beauty of the Kentucky Derby. We'll just pick
up, go home and regroup again.''
</P>
<P>
   Fan favorite Harold Rose, the 88-year-old trainer of Hal's Hope,
spent much of the last two weeks mugging for photos and telling
anyone within earshot of his love for the horse, which he credits
with helping him recover from major heart surgery last August.
</P>
<P>
   The colt charged to the front of the pack and led the race
entering the final turn. But Rose could only watch in
disappointment as the Florida Derby winner faded in the stretch and
struggled home to a 16th-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I saw the fractions, I got nervous,'' Rose said of the
quick start. ''You just can't go that fast. I did think he would
run a little better, but he just went too fast too early.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess we go back home with him. I don't know what's next
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, he is in much the same situation as trainer D.
Wayne Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas is no stranger to the Derby winner's circle. He's been
there four times, including last year as trainer of 31-1 shot
Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   He saddled three in Saturday's race, but none would crack the
top half of the 19-horse field. Exchange Rate finished 12th, High
Yield finished 15th and Commendable wound up 17th.
</P>
<P>
   ''They ran flat today for whatever reason,'' Lukas said. ''I was
disappointed in all three of them because they all trained so well
for the race. But, you know, it's a horse race and sometimes it's
unexplainable.''

<HEADLINE> Twenty-year-old sailor drowns in pre-dawn boating accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MALTA RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- Six people were rescued after a boat
capsized on Saratoga Lake at about 3 a.m. Saturday, awakening
neighbors with the din. A 19-year-old Naval sailor from Indiana is
presumed drowned and alcohol is believed to have played a role in
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   State police say that six U.S. Navy sailors and a female friend
attempted to cross Saratoga Lake in a 14-foot rowboat, apparently
after drinking beer at a nearby residence.
</P>
<P>
   About halfway across the lake, police say, one of the boaters
entered the water. When he attempted to climb back into the boat,
it capsized, spilling the remaining passengers into 51-degree
water. Attempts to get to shore by clinging to the boat and kicking
failed.
</P>
<P>
   One boater, Aaron Wayne Binkerd of Indiana, was apparently
overcome by the frigid water and drifted away from the others, who
were rescued by nearby residents and the Malta Ridge Fire
Department.
</P>
<P>
   State police and environmental conservation officers as well as
teams from the Malta Ridge fire department and both Warren and
Saratoga counties were unable to locate Binkerd's body Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The search was to resume Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   All others in the accident were treated for hypothermia and
released from Saratoga Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The six sailors were from the Knolls Atomic Power
Laboratory\Kesserling site about seven miles away in West Milton.
The lab conducts research and development for the design and
operation of naval nuclear propulsion plants.

<HEADLINE> Secession on Quebec's Agenda, Again  </HEADLINE>
By Jack Branswell, 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Quebec's secessionists were hoping Saturday to
relaunch their bid to split from Canada and become an independent
country.
</P>
<P>
   The Parti Quebecois, the governing party in the province of
Quebec, was holding a weekend policy convention in an effort to
jump start the secessionist movement, which lost two sovereignty
referendum in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of unpopular budget cuts to eliminate
Quebec's deficit, the party said it is ready once again to address
its ultimate goal -- secession.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard, who also leads the PQ, set the
tone for renewing the debate in his opening speech at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''From this moment on we are going to put the political future
of Quebec front and center in public debate,'' he said. ''We are
going to dare to tell our fellow citizens that the Quebec people
have a job to finish,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard's speech was well received by party members, but some
rank-and-file members remained skeptical about when a third
secession referendum would be held. The PQ lost votes in 1980 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we are going to have one in the near future,''
said Claude Lafreniere, a convention delegate.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard says the PQ will hold a referendum as soon as possible,
but has refused to be pinned down on a timetable.
</P>
<P>
   With support for secession hovering around 40 percent, opinion
polls show the majority of Quebecers are fed up with talk of
splitting with Canada and want the provincial government to focus
on bread-and-butter issues like health care and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard's government is also embarking on a controversial plan
to drastically reduce the number of cities and towns in Quebec
through municipal mergers. Many PQ backers oppose the plan and most
analysts think it unlikely that a referendum would be called until
that controversy settles down.
</P>
<P>
   If Bouchard decides to delay a referendum until after the next
election in 2003, the weight of history will be against him: no
Quebec government has won three consecutive mandates since the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard did get over one hurdle on Saturday when PQ delegates,
voting in a leadership review, handed the premier a 91 percent
approval rating.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Bouchard still faces a giant task in rekindling the
debate on secession.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec's Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Joseph Facal said
the government is now well-poised to reintroduce the separation
debate because the province has balanced its books and is beginning
to cut taxes. He is unfazed by the stagnant support for secession.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 1995 when we launched the (secession) referendum, support
was at 43 percent and people said 'You guys are nuts.''' ''We ended
at 49.4 percent, whiskers from winning it.''

<HEADLINE> Floodwaters Kill One in Oklahoma  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Floodwaters poured into several eastern
Oklahoma towns Saturday, killing a woman, filling homes and
businesses and affecting hundreds of families in a four-county
area.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the worst flood we've had in over 30 years and I've
been here a lot longer than that,'' said B.J. Pope, Creek County
emergency management director.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa reported six inches of rain fell Friday and Saturday,
closing several roads there, and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol
reported at least three state highways were closed by floodwaters,
mudslides or washed-out bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers evacuated people from flooded homes in Kiefer,
Sapulpa and several other towns. A mobile home park was swamped
Saturday morning in Kiefer, where a creek topped its banks after
the town received more than 8 inches of rain from Friday into
Saturday. Pope said some roads still had 8 to 9 feet of water over
them Saturday afternoon, and a nearby creek was still rising.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Cory, 53, was killed after the car she was driving to
work early Saturday was caught up in floodwater, Tulsa police said.
Cory was found by rescue workers a few hours after her car got
stuck.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 families in Sapulpa might not be able to return to
their houses Saturday night, said Tom Halowell, who was running a
Red Cross station at a church.
</P>
<P>
   Shelters also were set up in Coweta and Sand Springs, where
about 126 people were affected by the floods, said Red Cross
spokeswoman Jennifer Taylor. Other shelters would be set up as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   In Coweta, emergency workers used boats and jet skis to pull
people from cars and homes, said assistant police chief Derrick
Palmer.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Baseball Player Leaves Group  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE KARNOWSKI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A member of a Cuban baseball team visiting
the Twin Cities got into a car and sped off Saturday in a possible
defection as his team was leaving the terminal at Minneapolis-St.
Paul International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The player was a member of a team stocked mostly of students
from the University of Havana and some students from a technical
institute in the Cuban capital, said Doug Hennes, a spokesman for
the University of St. Thomas, which sponsored the visit.
</P>
<P>
   After a welcoming ceremony, the student walked out of the Hubert
Humphrey Terminal along with other players, coaches, staff and
faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody was heading out of the terminal toward the team bus,
and this guy literally jumped into a car and took off,'' Hennes
said. He said only one member of the team saw him leave, and was
unable to get the car's license plate number.
</P>
<P>
   Hennes said school officials know the name of the missing
student but were adhering to a request by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service not to release his name.
</P>
<P>
   The student had not contacted his group or government
authorities as of late afternoon, and his whereabouts remained
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The team is in Minnesota to return a visit to Cuba by the St.
Thomas baseball team last winter.
</P>
<P>
   An INS official met with university officials earlier in the
week to review procedures in case a member of the Cuban delegation
left the group, Hennes said.
</P>
<P>
   All scheduled activities for the team will go on as scheduled
through May 11, said the Rev. Dennis Dease, the St. Thomas
president. A dinner and welcoming events were scheduled on campus
Saturday evening, and the Havana and St. Thomas teams are scheduled
to play Tuesday in the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   In games in Cuba in January, St. Thomas won 7-0 and 10-1.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a Cuban team of college players came to the United
States was in 1987, when a national team played several games at
the Metrodome.

<HEADLINE> Leafs' Clark Misses Game Vs. Devils  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto Maple Leafs left wing Wendel Clark missed
Saturday's Game 5 against the New Jersey Devils due to an
undisclosed injury.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was seen wearing a bandage across his midsection Wednesday
night, following Toronto's 3-2 victory that tied the best-of-seven
Eastern Conference second-round series 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   After being a healthy scratch for Toronto's first four playoff
games, Clark had played in the last six, recording a goal and an
assist. His assist was a critical one, setting up Darcy Tucker's
game-winning goal in Game 1 against the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Fans at the Air Canada Centre booed when it was announced that
Clark -- one of Toronto's more beloved athletes -- would not play.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs inserted Adam Mair into the lineup in Clark's
place. Mair has appeared in four playoff games this season,
including Games 2 and 3 against the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto defenseman Gerald Diduck missed his second straight game
with a suspected leg injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils got a boost as second-line forward Sergei Brylin
returned to the lineup after hurting his knee in Game 2 of New
Jersey's opening-round series against Florida.

<HEADLINE> Lukas Has Bad Derby Outing  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY KING, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A year after winning the Kentucky Derby
for the third time in five years, trainer D. Wayne Lukas was a flop
Saturday as his starters finished 12th, 15th and 17th in the
19-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   ''They ran flat for whatever reason,'' said Lukas, who has won
four Derbys and has started a record 38 horses since 1981. ''There
is always an explanation of some kind. We've been there before and
had that situation, so we'll see.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was disappointed in all three of them because they all
trained so well for the race. But it's a horse race, and sometimes
it's unexplainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas had particularly high hopes for Blue Grass winner High
Yield, who finished 15th, two dozen lengths behind winner Fusaichi
Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the Derby, he pointed to High Yield's 12 races, almost
$1.2 million in earnings, three Grade I victories and the presence
of jockey Pat Day -- the king of the Churchill Downs track.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a good trip, I just didn't have any horse,'' Day said.
''He warmed up nice and I thought he would be all right, but he
never showed any enthusiasm. He was just going through the motions.
I was in position at the half-mile pole, but I didn't have any
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lukas-trained Exchange Rate, the longest shot in the field
at almost 60-1, showed some speed, but faded to 12th. Lukas'
Commendable, who had won only a maiden race in six starts, was
never in contention and beat two in the 19-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas said he has no immediate plans for any of the three.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas won the Derby with Winning Colors in 1988, Thunder Gulch
in 1995, Grindstone in 1996 and Charismatic last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Jones holds the record of training six Derby winners, but he
only started 11 horses.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, 65, said earlier this week that his goal is to saddle 10
Derby winners.
</P>
<P>
   ''The record is there,'' he said. ''We'll shoot at it. But as
long as we're going to be in the business, we might as well win
10.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, he is criticized for running horses that don't seem to
belong in the race. He has admitted that the Derby is important to
him, but even more important to his clients.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to play in this arena, and I try to put them
there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> George W. Bush Attends Derby  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush says he's not a
betting man -- not even at Saturday's Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like to lose money,'' Bush explained.
</P>
<P>
   But even politicians aren't allowed to waffle on Derby Day,
where everybody has a favorite even if they don't put down any
money.
</P>
<P>
   So Bush -- the presumptive Republican presidential nominee -- said
he was pulling for The Deputy, a horse trying to become the first
Derby winner trained by a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the story that came true was that the favorite actually
won the race for the first time since 1979. Fusaichi Pegasus took
the lead in mid-stretch and raced home ahead of Aptitude and
Impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush had put $2 on the winner, it would have brought him all
of $6.60.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush might want to check with his father if he does
decide to take up wagering. The former president made his first bet
Friday on Secret Status, who won the Kentucky Oaks and paid $295
for the $50 ticket purchased by the elder Bush.
</P>
<P>
   However, the governor disclosed that the tip to his father came
from William S. Farish, a family friend who owns Secret Status and
also happens to be chairman of the board of Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   One of Vice President Al Gore's daughters, Karenna Gore Schiff,
also attended Saturday's Derby -- and also liked The Deputy.
</P>
<P>
   She said that was a tip from her mother, Tipper, who she said
goes by the name in picking her favorite horses. It was not clear
whether Schiff placed a bet -- either for herself or for her mother.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 10, Padres 5  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Erubiel Durazo extended his hitting streak to
nine games Saturday with a home run and a double as the Arizona
Diamondbacks beat the San Diego Padres 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell had two hits, including a two-run single as the
Diamondbacks scored six runs off Rodrigo Lopez (0-1) in the second
inning. Pinch-hitter Greg Colbrunn had a two-run double in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Sprague was 4-for-4, including two home runs for the Padres.
Sprague has three home runs in two days, raising his season total
to six. Bret Boone hit a three-run homer off Brian Anderson in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson (2-0) allowed four runs and seven hits in seven
innings, and was helped by some strong defense, including three
line-drive catches at shortstop by Tony Womack, one at his shoe
tops, one diving to his left and one soaring high in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Byung-Hyun Kim struck out the side for Arizona in the eighth,
extending his streak of consecutive strikeouts to seven.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, in his second outing since being called up from Triple-A
Las Vegas, allowed six runs and six hits in 1 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo, hitting .433 with four homers and 12 RBIs during his
streak, led off the second with his sixth home run. Steve Finley
doubled and Travis Lee walked, then Kelly Stinnett singled to drive
in Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Fox singled when left fielder Al Martin lost the ball in
the lights, loading the bases for Anderson, who hit a sacrifice
fly.
</P>
<P>
   Womack grounded to second and Boone's throw to the second-base
bag was not in time and off the mark. Bell's single up the middle
drove in two runs, and Arizona made it 6-1 when Luis Gonzalez hit
into a run-scoring fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Boone's three-run homer cut the lead to 6-4 in the fourth.
Arizona added two more in the fourth when reliever Kevin Walker
walked Durazo with the bases loaded and Womack scored on Finley's
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: San Diego's Eric Owens was 0-for-4 and failed to reach base
for the first time in the 28 games he's played this season. ... In
his first outing, against Atlanta, Lopez allowed one run and five
hits in seven innings. ... Arizona closer Matt Mantei is
rehabilitating his weak shoulder with the same exercise regimen
that Todd Stottlemyre used to come back without surgery from a
partially torn rotator cuff. ... Gonzalez was 0-for-3 and has two
hits in his last 24 at-bats.

Rebels Move Toward Freetown
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Using civilians as human shields, rebels
advanced Saturday night toward Freetown, and have battled U.N. forces in the
interior of the country, a U.N. official said. The rebels moved Saturday
afternoon from the town of Lunsar, 45 miles northeast of Freetown, the capital,
and were heading toward the town of Masiaka, said U.N. spokesman Philip Winslow.
He said the rebel force was estimated to be between 500 and 1,000 men carrying
''infantry-type'' weapons. They were advancing down the road toward Freetown
using vehicles they had captured from U.N. peacekeepers, he said. Since Monday,
hundreds of U.N. personnel have been taken hostage by the rebels, and at least
four are presumed dead following clashes.

IRA Pledges To Disarm
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- In a surprise gesture, the Irish Republican
Army announced Saturday that it had agreed to disarm, making peace possible in
Northern Ireland after 30 years of bloodshed. The outlawed IRA, which has killed
about 1,800 people in its fight to abolish Northern Ireland as a
Protestant-majority state linked to Britain, pledged to reveal its secretly
stored tons of stockpiled weapons to international arms inspectors. The process,
the IRA said, would render its arsenal ''completely and verifiably beyond use.''
The IRA's move came less than a day after Britain and Ireland said they would
extend the deadline for total disarmament from this May 22 to June 2001.

Philippine Troops Discover Headless Bodies
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TALIPAO, Philippines (AP) -- Troops patrolling Saturday near the former
stronghold of a group of hostage-taking Muslim rebels found two headless bodies
buried in a shallow grave. The corpses were the first evidence that the Abu
Sayyaf rebels actually beheaded two of their Filipino captives, as they had
claimed last month. The rebels seized about 50 hostages, including many
children, from two schools in March. In exchange for the hostages, the Abu
Sayyaf have demanded the release of three terrorists from U.S. jails, including
Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 bombing of New York's World Trade
Center.

Justice Investigates Former CIA Director
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is conducting a new criminal
investigation of whether former CIA director John Deutch violated the law in
mishandling secrets on his home computer. Meanwhile, a special White House
intelligence panel headed by former Sen. Warren B. Rudman has presented
President Clinton a report about the Deutch affair. Details remain classified,
but officials familiar with the report's contents said today it is very critical
of CIA director George Tenet for not following through adequately on the
evidence against Deutch.

   BERLIN (AP) -- Ten eastern and southern European countries could join the
European Union by 2005, a German magazine reported Saturday. The EU commissioner
for expansion, Guenter Verheugen, has outlined a proposed timetable in talks
with EU leaders, Der Spiegel reported. The plan would be slower than some
aspirants, notably Poland, want. Verheugen sees front-runners Poland, Hungary,
the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus becoming members on Jan. 1,
2005 -- along with Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia and Malta, the news report said.

Secession on Quebec's Agenda, Again

the governing party in the province of Quebec, was holding a weekend policy
convention in an effort to jump start the secessionist movement. After several
years of unpopular budget cuts to eliminate Quebec's deficit, the party said it
is ready once again to address its ultimate goal -- secession.

<HEADLINE> Quotes From Saturday's Ky. Derby  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Quotes from owners, trainers and jockeys
of the 19 3-year-olds who ran in Saturday's 126th Kentucky Derby
(in order of finish):
</P>
<P>
   Fusaishi Pegasus: ''The racing gods smiled on us, the rail
opened and he moved up. He is talented and I'm very proud of him.''
-- trainer Neil Drysdale.
</P>
<P>
   Aptitude: ''I had a great trip, just a perfect trip. I couldn't
have asked for any more that way.'' -- jockey Alex Solis.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment: ''This horse has no speed, so I knew we'd be last
early, going to the first turn, so I just sat there and waited. I'm
proud of him and the way he closed because not too many horses
closed ground today.'' -- jockey Craig Perret.
</P>
<P>
   More Than Ready: ''I had a good trip, and right near the eighth
pole I made the lead. I thought I was going to win it. Then the
winner went by me and I knew I couldn't catch him.'' -- jockey John
Velasquez.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelaway: ''I thought we could win it at the eighth pole. The
winner was just so good today.'' -- trainer John Kimmel.
</P>
<P>
   China Visit: ''At the three-eighths pole, I thought we were
going to win. He was really in the bridle, but ran out of steam at
the three-sixteenths pole.'' -- jockey Frankie Dettori.
</P>
<P>
   Curule: ''He ran better than expected, and the Godolphin people
seemed pleased. That makes me happy.'' -- jockey Marlon St. Julien.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve: ''Turning for home, I thought I was home free. I
thought I had him in a good spot, right where I wanted to be.'' --
jockey Robbie Albarado.
</P>
<P>
   War Chant: ''We don't have any excuses. Down the backside, he
came out of the bridle and I couldn't get him to pick it up again
until the eighth pole.'' -- jockey Jerry Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Warlock: ''He got hung extremely wide on the second turn.
He wouldn't have won it anyway, but we'll just regroup and find
another spot.'' -- trainer Ken McPeek.
</P>
<P>
   Trippi: ''No excuses. He just got tired.'' -- jockey Jorge
Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange Rate: ''He ran well for a ways.'' -- trainer D. Wayne
Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   Anees: ''I was behind the winner the whole way. But when it came
time to go, it wasn't there. I just ran out of juice.'' -- jockey
Corey Nakatani.
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy: ''I could see him clearly and I didn't see anything.
He just didn't fire.'' -- trainer Jenine Sahadi.

<P>
   High Yield: ''I had a good trip. I just didn't have any horse.''
-- jockey Pat Day.
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope: ''When I saw the fractions, I got nervous. You just
can't go that fast. I did think he would run a little better, but
he went too fast too early.'' -- trainer Harold Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Commendable: ''My jockey said he was strong to the three-eighths
pole, and then he flattened out.'' -- trainer D. Wayne Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   Ronton: ''He never took hold of the track. He just never grabbed
the bridle or seemed comfortable in his stride.'' -- jockey Brice
Blanc.
</P>
<P>
   Graeme Hall: ''We were eased. He was not hurt, just fatigued.''
-- jockey Shane Sellers.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 1, Angels 0  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Mark McLemore singled home pinch-runner Charles
Gipson from second base with one out in the ninth inning Saturday
to give the Seattle Mariners a 1-0 victory over the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore, hitting .210, singled to center off Mike Holtz (0-1)
after David Bell opened the inning with a single, Gipson came in to
run and Dan Wilson sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle won its first 1-0 game this season, while the Angels
lost their second 1-0 game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners loaded the bases in the eighth, but Jay Buhner
ended the inning by hitting into a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the eighth, Kazuhiro Sasaki (1-0) walked the first
two batters, then got Garret Anderson to hit into a double play and
struck out Troy Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore, the Mariners' second baseman, made a running catch in
right field on Glaus' shallow fly ball with runners at the corners
to end the fourth. With the speedy Anderson on first, the catch
saved possibly two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad, the AL's leading hitter, went 0-for-4 as his
average dropped to from .411 to .398. He's 3-for-21 on the Angels'
road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle starter Gil Meche allowed two hits and four walks in
seven innings, striking out five.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Kent Mercker gave up three hits and one walk in
five innings, also fanning five.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Seattle's Stan Javier and Alex Rodriguez each spoke to
plate umpire Mark Wegner after being called out on strikes in the
sixth. ... Angels 2B Adam Kennedy almost collided with RF Tim
Salmon when he made a back-to-the-plate catch of Bell's pop for the
first out in the third. ... In six starts by Meche this season, the
Mariners have scored four runs while Meche has been in the games.
He is 0-3.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal attracts few bids for online auction items  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Items related to Cardinal John O'Connor that
went up for sale hours before his death so far have generated
little enthusiasm among customers of the online auction site eBay,
attracting only a few bids.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, auctions still number in the hundreds for items
related to the late John F. Kennedy Jr. And there is a lively
auction board as well for Larry Linville, who recently died after
gaining fame as the character Maj. Frank Burns on the television
classic, MASH. Nearly 400 auctions were listed for Kennedy, who
died in a plane crash last July. Almost 30 items were listed for
Linville.
</P>
<P>
   William Donohue, president of the Catholic League for Religious
and Civil Rights, said he thinks it's just fine that O'Connor items
aren't hot right now.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't surprise me a whole lot,'' he said. ''This is
neither the time nor the place. At least wait until he's in the
grave to start your bids.''
</P>
<P>
   The web domain name of ''Cardinaloconnor.com,'' offered at a
starting price of $500, had attracted no bids as of Saturday. It
was posted shortly before the death of the cardinal was announced
Wednesday. Its anonymous seller said it would be ''perfect for a
Web site dedicated to Cardinal John O'Connor.''
</P>
<P>
   Four other items listed for less than $10 each had received no
bids, including a photograph of O'Connor with former first lady
Rosalynn Carter and another of O'Connor with Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   Three bids had been placed for a book written by O'Connor and
former Mayor Edward Koch.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Pursglove, an eBay spokesman, said the scarcity of items
for sale and of bids may stem from a tendency by people not to want
to appear to be trying to capitalize on someone's death.
</P>
<P>
   But he said it was natural for items to be offered for sale
after a death because some people find participating in auctions is
''a way of paying tribute or sharing a memory with their fellow
eBay users.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, he said, might be ''trying to get a little piece of
history.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers Purchase Green's Contract  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Rangers purchased the contract
of outfielder Scarborough Green from Oklahoma of the Pacific Coast
League prior to Saturday's game against the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Green, Texas optioned shortstop Kelly
Dransfeldt to Oklahoma. To make room on the 40-man roster, Texas
designated RedHawks catcher Cesar King for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Green was hitting .313 with one homer, 10 RBIs and 14 stolen
bases in 27 games for Oklahoma. He has played 38 major league games
with St. Louis and Texas during the last three seasons with a .159
average. Green hit .308 in 18 games in four stints with the Rangers
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dransfeldt was recalled from Oklahoma on Thursday. He made one
appearance, Thursday against Tampa Bay, going 0-for-1 after coming
in as a pinch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   King hit .143 with seven RBIs in 13 games at Oklahoma.

<HEADLINE> Suns Say Pressure Is On Lakers  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns don't feel any pressure
playing the Los Angeles Lakers. Of course, that's what the
Sacramento Kings said, and they're on the golf course now.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing to be uptight about,'' Suns forward Rodney
Rogers said before they left home for Sunday's opener of the
Western Conference semifinal. ''They haven't been talking about us
winning a championship all year long.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers inspired such talk by winning an NBA-high 67 games
during the regular season, second-most in franchise history, but
they were extended to the maximum five games before demolishing the
upset-minded Kings 113-86 Friday night to reach the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns, meanwhile, eliminated defending NBA champion San
Antonio in four games, giving them four full days to rest and
prepare for the best-of-seven second round.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a couple more days of rest than they have,'' Rogers
said. ''Sometimes that's good, sometimes that's not so good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers believe it's no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like the regular season, you know what I mean? It's the
same scenario, only with a lot more at stake,'' Kobe Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also believe their 4-0 record against Phoenix this
season and the fact that they've won 16 of the last 19 games
between the teams is meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   And they wouldn't say they were glad to see the Suns instead of
the Spurs, who swept the Lakers in the Western Conference
semifinals last May and have won eight of the last nine games
between the two teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you remember last year, we had our way with San Antonio
during the regular season,'' Bryant said. ''The playoffs were a
different story. Phoenix is here, they deserve it, they beat the
world champs.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the champs played without Tim Duncan, who along with
David Robinson has given the Lakers matchup problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns seem much weaker in the middle, which could be a big
problem considering the Lakers have Shaquille O'Neal, the NBA's
leading scorer and second-leading rebounder.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has been more successful recently with forwards Shawn
Marion, Cliff Robinson and Rogers on the court, and centers Luc
Longley and Oliver Miller on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, how do they guard O'Neal?
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know, you'll have to ask them,'' Lakers forward Robert
Horry said. ''Rodney is real strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but Rogers, voted the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year, is
listed as a 6-foot-7, 255-pounder. O'Neal is listed as 7-1 and 315
pounds, which might be conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Longley, 7-2 and 260, played an average of less than 15 minutes
a game against San Antonio, and Miller, 6-9 and 315, played a total
of 17 minutes. Robinson is a 6-10, 225-pounder and Marion is 6-7
and 215.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Suns were extremely successful defensively
against the Spurs, holding them to 81.8 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if it's possible to stop O'Neal, Longley replied,
''He hasn't won a championship yet, so it must be possible.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Longley also said, ''He's 100 percent better, I think,
which is scary because he was really good before. His repertoire
has tripled.''
</P>
<P>
   Suns coach Scott Skiles implied his team will defend O'Neal in
several different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are just all kinds of factors,'' Skiles said. ''Are
other guys making shots? Is he in foul trouble? Are we in foul
trouble? Are we scoring enough that we can still put a center on
him or do we need to put forwards out there so we can score more?''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal called the Suns an explosive and dangerous team, and gave
them credit for beating the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess the better team won,'' he said. ''When we played them,
we pretty much had our way. This is a different team, they're at
full strength now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. Tom Gugliotta underwent knee surgery March 17 and is
out for the season. However, Jason Kidd, one of the NBA's best
point guards, returned last Tuesday in the final game of the San
Antonio series and played 31 minutes. He had been sidelined since
breaking his left ankle March 22.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looked real good in practice,'' Skiles said. ''He's moving
well, he's got no problems at all, he says, so we feel good about
him.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal called Phoenix guards Kidd and Anfernee Hardaway ''an
unbelievable backcourt, a historical backcourt.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Ron Harper, who teams with Bryant in the Lakers'
backcourt, said, ''We've got the best big guards, so we ain't
worrying about their big guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 is Wednesday night before the series shifts to Phoenix
for Games 3 and 4.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Probes Deutch Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is conducting a new
criminal investigation of whether former CIA director John Deutch
violated the law in mishandling secrets on his home computer,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry represents the second time the department has looked
into the matter, reflecting what top Justice officials say is their
concern that Deutch be held to the same standards applied to
Taiwan-born American nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee, whom the
government charged earlier this year with mishandling atomic
weapons secrets on computers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's attorneys have publicly challenged his indictment, citing
the department's decision in April 1999 not to prosecute Deutch for
storing numerous classified CIA documents on an unsecured computer
in his home, which was used by his children to connect to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Attorney General Janet Reno announced the Deutch
case was under review again. Initially, it appeared that Justice
prosecutors were simply going to examine a CIA inspector general
report on the matter to see if it disclosed any evidence beyond
what they had found.
</P>
<P>
   But in late February and early March, FBI agents were sent out
to conduct a new round of interviews with two or three individuals,
which one department official, requesting anonymity, said amounted
to opening a preliminary inquiry in the case, one step short of a
full investigation. That round of FBI interviews was also said to
have focused on the question of whether CIA officials improperly
delayed reporting the Deutch incident to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   After a review in early March, Justice officials requested that
the FBI conduct more interviews, according to a senior Justice
official, who said in effect the criminal investigation was
reopened at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Justice officials said that a veteran organized crime
prosecutor, Paul Coffey, was hired back from retirement to conduct
the Deutch investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a special White House intelligence panel headed by
former Sen. Warren B. Rudman has presented President Clinton a
report about the Deutch affair. Details remain classified, but
officials familiar with the report's contents said Saturday it is
very critical of CIA director George Tenet and others including the
agency's former general counsel, Michael O'Neil, and its
ex-executive director, Nora Slatkin, for not following through
adequately on the evidence against Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   A senior intelligence official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the CIA's deputy director, Air Force Gen. John
Gordon, who requested the Rudman report, is reviewing its findings
to determine whether additional disciplinary steps are warranted.
Although the report is highly critical, the official said, its
basic assertions are similar to those included in a CIA inspector
general's report early this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Deutch affair also is being investigated by Republicans in
Congress. And the renewed Justice interest in the case -- after the
department declined to bring criminal charges in spring 1999 --
played a role in O'Neil's refusal in March to testify before the
Senate Intelligence Committee unless given immunity from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In a yearlong probe that ended April 1999, the department's
criminal division concluded Deutch's lapses were sloppy rather than
criminal. It referred the case to the CIA inspector general for
administrative discipline. Last August, the CIA stripped Deutch of
his security clearance.
</P>
<P>
   After O'Neil refused to testify voluntarily, he was subpoenaed.
On March 7, O'Neil invoked his right not to incriminate himself and
refused to answer questions from Senate Intelligence Committee
members about the Deutch case.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, O'Neil's lawyer, Roger Spaeder, said he
had advised his client not to testify while Reno reviews an earlier
decision not to prosecute Deutch or others.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil, who left the agency in October 1997, at first declined
to turn over computer storage cards from Deutch's computers and
delayed notifying the Justice Department of the matter, according
to an unclassified version of the CIA inspector general's report.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that the actions by O'Neil and another CIA
executive ''had the effect of delaying a prompt investigation of
this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Deutch's security lapse was found in December 1996 as
he was leaving the agency, the CIA did not submit a report to the
Justice Department until March 1998 and did not notify
congressional oversight panels until June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996, Deutch processed
thousands of highly classified documents on unprotected home
computers that he and family members also used to connect the
Internet, making the information potentially vulnerable to hackers,
according to the CIA inspector general's report. Deutch has
apologized.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Suspended Over Vieques Claim  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A pilot for a Puerto Rican commuter
airline has been temporarily suspended for allegedly flying over a
restricted U.S. Navy area on the island of Vieques during
operations to arrest protesters, the airline said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Osvaldo Gonzalez, owner of Vieques Air Link, said that Capt. Jim
Stark, commander of the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, called him
Friday to complain that one of the airline's planes had flown over
Camp Garcia about an hour after U.S. marshals and FBI agents had
begun clearing protesters from the bombing range on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said that pilot Rolando de Jesus was flying to St.
Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy official complained that De Jesus flew about 100 feet
above the area despite a temporary order to fly no lower than
26,000 feet during the operation, Gonzalez said. The pilot claimed
he was not in the restricted area and flew no lower than 500 feet,
Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Navy spokesman Robert Nelson said that someone in the Navy did
contact the Federal Aviation Administration to report ''a possible
violation of airspace,'' but he did not know if it was Stark. He
said he did not have more specific information about the incident
or the airspace restriction.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy would follow up with a written report to the FAA,
Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In addition to this, Captain Stark ... did personally contact
the owner of Vieques Air Link to express his concern about these
unsafe acts,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez complained that his small twin-engine planes cannot fly
high enough to avoid the altitude restriction set by the Navy,
which remained in place Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to go 10 miles out of our way and that makes it more
expensive, it's more gasoline and more time,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said the FAA ordered him to suspend De Jesus while it
investigates. FAA officials could not immediately be reached for
comment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Stark said he would recommend that the pilot lose his license,
Gonzalez said. Nelson said he was not aware of any statement and
said that Stark could only ''recommend what he believes is the
infraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters camped on Vieques for a little over a year to urge
the Navy to end its training there. Resentments over the six
decades of war games turned to outrage when a civilian guard was
killed by errant bombs on the range in April 1999.

<HEADLINE> Chiapas Bishop To Help Zapatistas  </HEADLINE>
By ALEJANDRO RUIZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   POLHO, Mexico (AP) -- The new Catholic bishop for the troubled
state of Chiapas promised Zapatista rebels Saturday that he would
intercede on their behalf to resolve a 6-year-old conflict with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to pray and fast in order to rid the demons that exist
here,'' Felipe Arizmendi Esquivel told members of the insurgent
Zapatista National Liberation Army in Polho, one of the main
Zapatista strongholds in this poor southern state.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting marked Arizmendi's first interaction with members of
the diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas, coming just five days
after he officially began in the post.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas waged a brief armed uprising in January 1994
seeking greater rights for Indians. Sporadic peace talks are at a
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why the bishop put the Zapatistas first on his
agenda, or if the decision in any way indicated that Arizmendi
would become as deeply involved in the conflict as his predecessor,
Bishop Samuel Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   Arizmendi refused to speak with reporters after the meeting. But
he promised the Zapatistas that he would intercede on their behalf
with the government to seek a peaceful end to the conflict and an
end to the persecution of the rebels by paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will offer to speak with the authorities in your name in
order that there is a solution to your just demands,'' he said.
''My obligation is to bring your suffering to the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   In a previous meeting with another group of Zapatista rebels in
the indigenous village of Chenalho, Arizmendi asked the rebels to
live as God wants them to, without resorting to weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Arizmendi, formerly the bishop of Tapachula on the Chiapas
coast, is known as a moderate with some conservative positions. He
has sharply criticized the Zapatistas for choosing to wage an armed
rebellion. Nonetheless, he also has supported Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz became known among supporters as the ''Bishop of the Poor''
for his extensive work with poverty-stricken Indian peasants. But
he was harshly criticized by the government, which linked him with
the Zapatista rebels and dubbed him the ''red bishop'' for what
they considered to be his socialist views.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Arizmendi issued a call for reconciliation -- asking
the army to respect human rights, and the rebels and the government
to make an effort to advance peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until now there has been no solution to the conflict,'' he
told the rebels Saturday. ''It seems that we are in ... a very dark
place. But I believe God will help us to encounter an adequate
solution.''

<HEADLINE> Sekiguchi Finally Sees The Derby  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The American servicemen occupying Japan
at the end of World War II used to regale the 10-year-old boy with
tales of the Kentucky Derby. On Saturday, Fusao Sekiguchi finally
got to see it for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The view from the winner's circle was breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first time I laid eyes on this horse,'' Sekiguchi, smiling
broadly, said through an interpreter, ''I knew he was destined to
be the Derby winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus was all that and more, a big, brown muscular
colt whose resounding win in Saturday's race might have been the
clarion call the sport is desperately waiting to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughbred racing needs stars in the worst way, and the
Japanese software magnate who owns him is more than willing to
comply. The final word on whether his horse is fit enough will come
from trainer Neil Drysdale, but no one should question his own
desire to run Fusaichi Pegasus in the final two legs of the Triple
Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love challenges,'' he said. ''We had been told many times
that 21 years have passed since the last time a favorite won this
race.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we love breaking records,'' Sekiguchi added. ''And we love
setting new ones.''
</P>
<P>
   They were not records, but Sekiguchi's way of doing business is
certainly something new in a hidebound industry hemmed in by so
much tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Try to remember the last time an interpreter was needed in the
winner's circle. Pity poor Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton; his stab at
pronouncing Sekiguchi's first name (foo-sa-O) wasn't close. And his
name is hardly the most exotic thing about him.
</P>
<P>
   Sekiguchi believes in vibes, in looking directly into the eyes
of each and every yearling he is thinking about buying. Once he
makes up his mind, the money is an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kentucky horseman John Ward was representing his
interests at the 1998 yearling sales in Keeneland, Sekiguchi turned
up to see a horse identified in the catalogue as ''Hip 228'' for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went to look at him in the barn. I felt an enormous power,''
he recalled, ''and that's when I made up my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, Sekiguchi convened his staff in his hotel room. The
ponytailed entrepreneur was wearing pajamas, but everybody in the
room understood he was deadly serious.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want this horse,'' he said. ''I don't care how much he
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who has won four Derbies and bought and
trained two horses for Sekiguchi in the past, quickly figured out
who was bidding against his owners at that sale. His blood ran
cold. Their nerve ran out at $3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew how his mindset was,'' Lukas said recently. ''When I
zeroed in on the two horses, I asked him, 'How much is your limit?'
and he said, 'Just buy them.'''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the bidding for Hip 228 stopped at $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have paid $5 million,'' he said. ''Happily.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of talk will send a shiver down the spines of
established horsemen on this side of the Pacific, but it shouldn't.
Sekiguchi loves America, he loves the horse racket, and has ever
since since his childhood in Osaka, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers and sailors who befriended the little kid with few
belongings and no plans were impressed enough several decades later
to provide Sekiguchi with references decades later when he came to
the United States to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Horses, apparently, aren't the only commodities at which
Sekiguchi tossed money. He was thrown out of one company because
his plans were too grand for the boss' taste. But if Sekiguchi's
spending habits are open to questioning, his acumen is not.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to get into racing was more emotional than reasoned
-- ''I always loved horses, but I knew little about racing'' -- but
Sekiguchi put together a top-flight stable in a rush. He began with
five horses 18 years ago. Seven years later, he won the Japan
Derby, with Fusaichi Concord. Now, he has created a ripple in the
biggest racing circle of all.
</P>
<P>
   When he first started out in the thoroughbred business in
America, nearly everyone was ''skeptical,'' Sekiguchi recalled.
Some no doubt were put off by his sense of style. In that sense,
though, it wasn't much different from back home.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Japan, when people hear that I paid $4 million, they
thought I was crazy,'' Sekiguchi said. ''But I've always been a
challenger. I like to be on the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the winner's circle.

<HEADLINE> Explanation Of Derby Winner's Name  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus'
name is a combination of Japanese slang and Greek mythology.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Fusao Sekiguchi came up with the first name by combining
his own first name with ''ichi,'' which in Japanese means No. 1.
Pegasus was the name of the winged horse of mythology.
</P>
<P>
   The first name is pronounced Foo-sah-EE-chee.
</P>
<P>
   Purchased for $4 million, Fusaichi Pegasus is the most expensive
winner in Derby history. The previous high price for a winner was
Winning Colors in 1998. The filly went for $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The highest price horse to run in a Derby previously was
Houston, who cost $2.9 million. The colt finished eighth in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Nineteen-year-old sailor drowns in pre-dawn boating accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MALTA RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- Six people were rescued after a boat
capsized on Saratoga Lake at about 3 a.m. Saturday, awakening
neighbors with the din. A 19-year-old Naval sailor from Indiana is
presumed drowned and alcohol is believed to have played a role in
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   State police say that six U.S. Navy sailors and a female friend
attempted to cross Saratoga Lake in a 14-foot rowboat, apparently
after drinking beer at a nearby residence.
</P>
<P>
   About halfway across the lake, police say, one of the boaters
entered the water. When he attempted to climb back into the boat,
it capsized, spilling the remaining passengers into 51-degree
water. Attempts to get to shore by clinging to the boat and kicking
failed.
</P>
<P>
   One boater, Aaron Wayne Binkerd of Indiana, was apparently
overcome by the frigid water and drifted away from the others, who
were rescued by nearby residents and the Malta Ridge Fire
Department.
</P>
<P>
   State police and environmental conservation officers as well as
teams from the Malta Ridge fire department and both Warren and
Saratoga counties were unable to locate Binkerd's body Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The search was to resume Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   All others in the accident were treated for hypothermia and
released from Saratoga Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The six sailors were from the Knolls Atomic Power
Laboratory\Kesserling site about seven miles away in West Milton.

<HEADLINE> Church Rebuilding Role in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- It is a sight not seen in perhaps 140 years:
an open-air Mass by the Roman Catholic Church attended by tens of
thousands in the heart of Mexico, the sprawling plaza known as the
Zocalo.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration Saturday is yet another sign that the long and
sometimes bloody hostility between the government and church in
Mexico has broken down, and that the church is playing a more
public role.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new church cannot be the church of silence,'' Cardinal
Norberto Rivera said as he opened Saturday's Mass, referring to
more than a century of state restrictions on religion.
</P>
<P>
   The Church's role has also affected Mexico's tightly contested
presidential race. The Clergy has become increasingly vocal in
calling for democratic reform, and politicians from all sides have
openly courted church supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 25 pastoral letter, Mexico's bishops called for ''a
reformulation of the whole political system,'' including
constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The change has not been comfortable for all, particularly as the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, fights to
continue its 71-year hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Church and state have sparred in the press over just how far
priests can go to influence politics under a 1992 reform that ended
many of the draconian laws imposed on clergy since 1855.
</P>
<P>
   Those restrictions, meant to separate church from state,
included an 1873 ban on outdoor religious ceremonies. The Zocalo
has not seen an open-air Mass since before that ban was imposed.
</P>
<P>
   The leading opposition candidate for president, Vicente Fox, has
pushed the limits of the church's new role -- once by displaying a
banner of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's patron saint, at a
campaign rally.
</P>
<P>
   He recently distributed pamphlets quoting the Pastoral Letter's
comment that ''a fuller democratic culture supposes the real
possibility'' of alternating parties in power.
</P>
<P>
   Even the PRI candidate, Francisco Labastida, has appeared with
prominent bishops. Leftist candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, whose
father as president took part in repressing the church in the
1930s, gave Pope John Paul II keys to the city last year, when he
was mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's Mass is the highlight of the National
Eucharistic Congress, gathering all the nation's bishops and a
Vatican representative.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller-than-expected crowd scattered across the Zocalo
Saturday night, some unfurling umbrellas against a drizzling sky. A
free rock concert a few weeks earlier drew a larger crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But the event was deeply meaningful for Erasmo Chavez, a
70-year-old church layworker with an image of the Virgin of
Guadalupe pinned to his sweater.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was a child, we had to come secretly to celebrate
services,'' he said, peering toward the temporary altar set up
before the capital's cathedral, begun in the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   Fox supporters set up a stand at the center of the Zocalo and
another candidate's banner rippled from a building overlooking the
plaza. They did not impress Silvia Reyes, a 70-year-old housewife
who had come to the Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ''Politics and the church are separate because a politician
cannot be Catholic,'' she said. ''If he were Catholic, he would not
rob and oppress the people. So a politician has to be secular.''
</P>
<P>
   With 100 million people, Mexico is one of the most populous
predominantly Catholic nations in the world. The Pope was greeted
with raucous fervor on visits to Mexico in 1979, 1990, 1993 and
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The church played a major part in political and economic life
for about 350 years. In the 18th century, however, reformers
attacked the church's privileges and land holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution of 1857 separated church and state, and other
laws removed marriage and divorce from church jurisdiction. Other
laws forbade church schools and religious orders.
</P>
<P>
   Even tougher limits were imposed on the church in 1917 after the
Mexican Revolution, leading to the Cristero War of the 1920s in
which tens of thousands died fighting over restrictions on
religion. Fox's center-right National Action Party has some roots
in the Cristero movement.
</P>
<P>
   Those restrictions gradually faded in practice and the 1992 law
formally ended most.
</P>
<P>
   But the government still bans religious involvement in politics.
Government officials last week were angered at a pamphlet issued on
Wednesday urging Catholics to vote for candidates who oppose
abortion, favor moral education and promote social programs.
</P>
<P>
   The church insists it is nonpartisan, but has a right to promote
political changes in line with its values.

<HEADLINE> Fusaichi Pegasus Wins Ky. Derby  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER Jr., AP Racing Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Fusaichi Pegasus kicked up his heels
before the Kentucky Derby in what looked like a victory dance.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he knew what was coming.
</P>
<P>
   The playful colt, who sometimes gets too exuberant, acted like a
perfect gentleman Saturday in doing what good horses like Easy
Goer, Arazi and Holy Bull couldn't do-- win the Derby as the betting
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The last horse to do that was Spectacular Bid in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus came on strong in the stretch, taking the lead
approaching the eighth pole and finishing 1 1-2 lengths ahead of
Aptitude.
</P>
<P>
   And he did it while on his best behavior.
</P>
<P>
   This is the colt who caused a brief delay at the starting gate
at the Wood Memorial, who reared and threw his exercise rider and
who has been known to stop and just look around.
</P>
<P>
   But he was all business on this 82-degree day and before 153,204
cheering fans - the second largest Derby crowd in history.
</P>
<P>
   So gentlemanly was the colt, purchased for $4 million as a
yearling, that jockey Kent Desormeaux said he broke like a pony.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had some challenging moments,'' Desormeaux said. ''But when
I needed him to move forward, I had a ton of horse. When I
encouraged him to improve his stride, he took off like a rocket and
this race was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus was the highest priced winner by far in the
Derby and his victory came a year after the race was won by
Charismatic, who once ran with a $62,500 claiming tag. The previous
high price for a winner was Winning Colors in 1998. The filly went
for $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never know where a Derby winner is coming from,'' trainer
Neil Drysdale said before the race. ''Some cost $15,000, some cost
$15 million.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Seattle Slew, the 1977 Triple Crown winner was
bought for $17,500 while Real Quiet, who carried Desormeaux to
victory in 1998, was a $17,000 yearling.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus, on the rail until he hit the stretch, was back
in the pack down the backstretch. He started moving on the turn and
made his winning move around five horses in the stretch. He then
took the lead from Wheelaway shortly after that colt moved in and
bumped Captain Steve.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little worried,'' Drysdale said, referring to the wall
of horses in front of his colt at the top of the lane. ''But then
the racing gods smiled on us and things opened up.''
</P>
<P>
   He was pleased with how his horse won the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I noticed watching the race three times that Kent was riding
him with one hand,'' the trainer said. ''He was very relaxed. He
does seem to be improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale was asked if Fusaichi Pegasus would go to the
Preakness, the second race in the Triple Crown, in search of a
sixth straight victory. The cautious trainer said: ''You know how I
am. We'll have to see how he comes out of this race.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the colt races, it likely will be in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fusaichi Pegasus is a treasure of the United States and I hope
to keep him in the United States,'' owner Fasao Sekiguchi of Japan
said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am just in awe,'' he said of the victory, adding that he
would have bid $5 million for the colt.
</P>
<P>
   Sekiguchi came up with the horse's first name by combining his
own first name with ''ichi,'' which in Japanese means No. 1.
Pegasus was the name of the winged horse of mythology. The first
name is pronounced Foo-sah-EE-chee.
</P>
<P>
   The time of 2:01 was tied for the sixth fastest in the 126
Derbies.
</P>
<P>
   The winner earned $888,400 and paid $6.60, $5.60 and $4 after
finishing a length-and-a-half in front of Aptitude, who paid $9.80
and $5.80. Impeachment, who was four lengths behind Aptitude and a
half-length in front of More Than Ready, paid $4 as part of a
four-horse entry due to common ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't have asked for a better trip,'' said Alex Solis,
who rode Aptitude for the first time. ''Unfortunately, the horse
that won was just fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy, the second favorite, trained by Jenine Sahadi,
finished 14th.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very disappointed, not for myself,'' said Sahadi, trying
to become the first female trainer to win the Derby. ''I feel bad
for the horse. We'll pack up, go home and regroup again.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as jubilant as the winning connections was Marlon St.
Julien, who finished seventh on Curule, owned by the Godolphin
Racing Stable of Sheik Mohammed Mahkthom and Hamdan al-Makhtoum of
Dubai.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I had something to prove,'' said the 28-year-old St.
Julien, the first black jockey to ride in the Derby since 1921. The
last black rider to win was Jimmy Winkfield in 1902.
</P>
<P>
   ''I beat several of the favorites,'' St. Julien said. ''What
else could you want? When they played 'My Old Kentucky Home' my
hair stood up on my chest. I can't explain the feeling. I'm on some
kind of high.''
</P>
<P>
   Completing the order of finish was Wheelaway, China Visit,
Curule, Captain Steve, War Chant, Deputy Warlock, Trippi, Exchange
Rate, Anees, The Deputy, High Yield, Hal's Hope, Commendable,
Ronton and Graeme Hall.
</P>
<P>
   It was a disappointing day also for trainer D. Wayne Lukas,
seeking his second straight Derby victory and fourth in the last
six year. Lukas saddled three horses then watched Exchange Rate
finish fourth, High Yield 15th and Commendable 17th.
</P>
<P>
   Another Derby jinx was extended when Anees, the 2-year-old
champion and Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner finished 13th.
Spectacular Bid was the last 2-year-old champion, and no winner of
the BC Juvenile, which was first run in 1984, has ever won the
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   After being bumped, Captain Steve finished eighth. He is trained
by Bob Baffert, who won the Derby in 1997 with Silver Charm and a
year later with Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus became the first Derby winner to have raced
only once as a 2-year-old. The others were Leonatus (1883), Tim Tam
(1958) and Lucky Debonair (1965). Those three horses ran long
before there were bonuses in thoroughbred racing.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of bonuses, Fusaichi Pegasus earned an extra $250,000
paid to any colt who wins the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct and the
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first Wood Memorial-Derby winner since Pleasant
Colony in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd moved into second place ahead of the 151,051 who
watched Charismatic win last year. The record Derby crowd of
163,264 attended the centennial running in 1974.

<HEADLINE> IRA Says It Will Disarm Soon  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Uttering historic words it had
long decried as surrender, the Irish Republican Army proclaimed
Saturday that it will soon start to disarm -- a breakthrough that
makes lasting peace possible in Northern Ireland after decades of
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   The outlawed IRA, which killed about 1,800 people in its 27-year
fight to abolish Northern Ireland as a Protestant-majority state
linked to Britain, pledged to reveal its secretly stored tons of
stockpiled weapons to international arms inspectors. The process,
the IRA said, would render its arsenal ''completely and verifiably
beyond use.''
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish governments warmly welcomed the IRA's
long-sought pledge, saying it met their requirements and should
clear the way for restoring power to Northern Ireland's
Catholic-Protestant administration on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   The province had gotten a measure of self-rule when the
power-sharing administration was formed in December. But Britain
reimposed direct rule some two months later because of the IRA's
refusal to give any disarmament commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a life-and-death, blood-and-sinew, emotional, painful
step for the IRA to make -- because it wants this to work,'' said
Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, President Clinton called the IRA pledge
''a significant step toward realizing the full promise of the Good
Friday Accord.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These developments offer renewed hope to the people of
Northern Ireland that politics will once and for all be pursued
through exclusively political means,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's surprise gesture came less than a day after Britain
and Ireland, as part of a concerted diplomatic push, announced they
would extend the deadline for total disarmament from this May 22 --
the target set in 1998's Good Friday peace accord -- to June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the IRA's declaration Saturday, Britain and
Ireland announced the appointment of two international statesmen --
Cyril Ramaphosa, the former African National Congress chairman from
South Africa, and Martti Ahtisaari, Finland's recently retired
president -- to lead the arms-dump inspections. That confidential
exercise is expected to begin soon after May 22.
</P>
<P>
   ''The dumps will be reinspected regularly to ensure that the
weapons have remained silent,'' the IRA said in its statement.
Revealing these hidden stockpiles, the IRA said, should reassure
the province's British Protestant community that the IRA cease-fire
of 1997 is designed to last forever.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the IRA had rejected the whole concept of
disarmament as equivalent to surrender. The kind of disarmament now
being offered wouldn't require the IRA to hand over weapons
publicly, only to identify the locations of its secret stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Many details of the fate of the arms dumps have yet to be worked
out, but they are not expected to be guarded at all times. Having
made the commitment to disarm, the IRA likely will want other
parties to accept its word of honor and to be satisfied with
periodic inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's minister for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, said
he supported plans to identify but not destroy IRA arms dumps,
since this would allow the rebels to renounce violence ''without
feeling that others are standing over them and demanding that they
surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Northern Ireland's four-party coalition resumes power
now depends on the major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists,
who are bitterly split over the merits of working alongside Sinn
Fein. The party had demanded a clear IRA pledge to disarm before it
would resume any power-sharing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, the Nobel laureate who is
supposed to lead the suspended coalition, said the IRA move did
''break new ground'' and was ''very positive.''	   But speaking after a
behind-closed-doors meeting of his party's
lawmakers, Trimble said he would need to spend days ''teasing out''
many details of the proposed disarmament scheme, ''particularly
about ensuring that weapons remain secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the IRA's weapons, including tons of the plastic
explosive Semtex, were smuggled from Libya in the mid-1980s and are
buried throughout rural parts of the neighboring Republic of
Ireland. The terms of the IRA offer appear to require state
security forces to steer clear of weapons sites and to leave
monitoring of their contents to the international inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Adams insisted the IRA offer went beyond the terms of the Good
Friday pact.
</P>
<P>
   ''The IRA doesn't have to do this. It is only doing it to try
and give some assurance to those who are nervous or genuinely
concerned,'' he said. He chided Trimble's many hard-line Protestant
critics for wanting ''the IRA totally and absolutely defeated. That
isn't going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how potentially divisive the new move could prove
to Sinn Fein-IRA ranks, Adams appealed for those among his
supporters ''who are nervous about this to stay calm, to be
thoughtful.''
</P>
<P>
   After the IRA called an open-ended truce in 1997, a few senior
IRA members formed a dissident faction that strove to break the
cease-fire. The dissidents, dubbed the Real IRA by Irish media,
have been observing a fragile truce since killing 29 people in a
1998 car-bomb attack. But police and politicians fear they might
attempt a deal-wrecking new atrocity in the coming crucial weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Another splinter group, the Continuity IRA, has already mounted
several nonlethal bombings this year.

<HEADLINE> Twins 6, Tigers 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The return of manager Phil Garner and third
baseman Dean Palmer didn't help the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Redman pitched seven strong innings as the Minnesota Twins
beat the Detroit 6-1 Saturday night in the first game following the
end of a pair of eight-game suspensions imposed on the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Garner and Palmer were penalized by the commissioner's office
for their roles in a bench-clearing brawl against the Chicago White
Sox on April 22.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer went 1-for-4 and committed a two-out error on Cristian
Guzman's routine grounder in the fourth, leading to the Twins'
third run.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Juan Encarnacion extended his major league-leading
hitting streak to 18 games with an infield single in the sixth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Huskey was 3-for-4 with three singles for the Twins, and
Matt Lawton had a two-run double in a three-run seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Redman (2-0), making his first start this season and the third
of his career, allowed one run and eight hits, striking out six and
walking none.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit starter C.J. Nitkowski (1-6), winless in four starts
since April 14, allowed six runs -- five earned -- seven hits and
four walks in 6 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   He balked home Minnesota's first run in the second with Huskey
on third. Jason Maxwell's RBI single and Palmer's error made it 3-0
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Deivi Cruz hit an RBI grounder in the fifth following Wendell
Magee's double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Magee left in the seventh with an injury that was not
immediately known. ... After not facing a left-handed starter in
the first 12 games of the season, Detroit faced its eighth in 15
games. ... The Tigers were 4-4 under interim manager Bob Melvin
during Garner's absence. ... Twins manager Tom Kelly needs one win
to reach 1,000. ... Twins C Matt LeCroy caught a foul ball off the
speaker behind home plate in the third inning; on Friday night he
was unable to do the same and Bobby Higginson homered two pitches
later. ... Hunter lost a ball to center in the ceiling in the
second, resulting in a double for Higginson.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Death Row Convict Out on Bail  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN RILEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A man who spent 20 years on death row for the
murder of a judge's son was released on bail Saturday, three months
after the Nevada Supreme Court reversed his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am overwhelmed. I gotta go,'' Jack Mazzan, his voice
cracking, whispered as reporters met him at the Washoe County Jail,
where he has been held since the high court's Jan. 27 decision.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzan, 53, was accompanied by his lawyer, JoNell Thomas, who
met his bail requirement by giving jailers a $100,000 cashier's
check provided by his family. Mazzan was wearing jail denims and
carrying only a couple of books, a large manila envelope and a bag
of personal effects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overwhelming is probably an understatement. I can't keep my
emotions from my voice,'' Mazzan said later as he drove around Reno
with Thomas -- on streets he hadn't seen since his arrest in
December 1978 for the drug-related knifing death of Richard Minor
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll see friends right away. I'll talk to my mother and
actually I'm going to be very low-key and very low-profile,''
Mazzan said. ''And I'm going to try to enjoy every minute as it
comes along and just be thankful that these minutes are here.''
</P>
<P>
   He faces a possible retrial starting July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzan was convicted of first-degree murder in 1979 and was put
on death row in January 1980. He had appealed unsuccessfully
several times over the years.
</P>
<P>
   In reversing Mazzan's conviction, the high court criticized
prosecutors for failing to give the defense information about other
suspects -- alleged drug-dealers who hadn't been paid for thousands
of dollars worth of drugs supplied to Minor.
</P>
<P>
   Minor's body was found in his apartment by his father, then Reno
Justice of the Peace Richard C. Minor.
</P>
<P>
   Minor, now retired, has said he always doubted the state's
theory that one person, acting alone, was responsible for the
killing. But he believes Mazzan had some role in the murder.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rips Senators on Judge  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton criticized Texas' two
Republican senators on Saturday for seeking to block his nomination
of a Hispanic lawyer to a federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison said Enrique Moreno of
El Paso, Texas, a Harvard-educated lawyer in private practice since
1981, lacked the necessary experience to sit on the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in a statement that claim was ''unconscionable.''
He noted that Moreno won the top rating from the American Bar
Association, which evaluates and reports on the professional
qualifications of people being considered by the president for
nomination to federal judgeships.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton left the White House en route to Arkansas on
Saturday, he was asked by reporters if he thought the senators
opposed Moreno because he is Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are only two conceivable alternatives. That or they just
don't want to confirm any judges unless they are right-wing
ideologues,'' Clinton said. ''It may be that they just want to use
this opportunity to seize control of the judiciary again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm and Hutchison, in a letter Friday to the chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, which reviews judicial nominations,
cited the unqualified rating that a Texas judicial advisory group
had given Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   The group, a collection of Texas attorneys appointed by Gramm
and Hutchison to advise them on nominations, voted 10-5 against the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be fair to summarize the views of those recommending
against confirmation that Mr. Moreno simply had not achieved the
level of experience necessary to be fully engaged and effective on
a court one notch below the United States Supreme Court,'' they
wrote Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gramm and Hutchison, asked to respond to
Clinton's comments, said their letter ''speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gramm nor Hutchison is on the committee, so they were
urging Hatch to reject the nomination. If the nomination were to
reach the full Senate, the two senators could use a parliamentary
procedure to delay a vote indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The senators said they told Moreno of their opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although we do so without prejudice to Mr. Moreno's potential
to be nominated for a federal judgeship in the future, we have
conveyed our personal regret that it will not be possible for this
nomination to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to go forward,''
they wrote Hatch.

   Moreno, in a statement, said he was grateful to be nominated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been blessed with the support and encouragement of many
people,'' he said. ''I am especially grateful and proud of my
community's support of my nomination.''

   Clinton has accused Senate Republicans of stonewalling his
judicial nominees and has implied that that inaction is linked to
the minority backgrounds of several appointees.
</P>
<P>
   As of March, when two of Clinton's more controversial appointees
won Senate confirmation, there were 73 federal judicial vacancies,
or about 10 percent of the national total.

<P>
   The Senate in March confirmed Richard A. Paez and Marsha Berzon,
both Hispanics. Paez had waited more than four years for a vote on
his nomination, and Berzon waited two years.
</P>
<P>
   The political vitriol became intense last fall when the Senate,
along party lines, rejected a black nominee, Missouri State Supreme
Court Judge Ronnie White, for a federal judgeship.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Resume Talks  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- An American envoy was expected to intervene in
Middle East peace talks after Palestinian negotiators on Saturday
rejected Israeli proposals for a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli negotiator Oded Eran met his Palestinian counterparts
Yasser Abed Rabbo and Saeb Erekat for continued talks Saturday
night, with American envoy Dennis Ross present, U.S. embassy
spokesman Larry Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting the Palestinians categorically rejected a map
submitted by Israel with a proposal for the boundaries of a
Palestinian state, said a Palestinian official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. The Palestinians say the land being offered
to them by Israel in the West Bank is totally inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides will not meet Sunday but Ross will have meetings
with each of them in an attempt to solve the dispute, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a strong possibility of a summit meeting Sunday
between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian official said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's spokesman Gadi Baltiansky said he could not rule out the
possibility that the two leaders would meet soon.
</P>
<P>
   At their last meeting Barak offered to hand over three
Palestinian neighborhoods just outside Jerusalem to full
Palestinian control, the official said, but the handover has been
delayed due to opposition inside Barak's coalition, and Arafat
wishes to raise the issue with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Israeli and Palestinian security officials met Saturday
night at Arafat's office, a Palestinian official said. At the
meeting, the outgoing chief of Israel's Shin Bet security service
introduced his successor to his Palestinian counterparts, said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the angry political disputes between the two sides,
Israeli officials concede that the Palestinians are making
considerable efforts to prevent attacks on Israelis by Palestinian
militants.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian police chief Ghazi Jebali announced Saturday that
two opposition figures had been arrested for incitement against the
Palestinian Authority and the peace process with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In custody were Abdullah Shami, spokesman for the militant
Islamic Jihad group and Omar Assaf, a leader of the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical group based in
Damascus, Syria.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven years since Israel and the Palestinians signed
their first agreement, their talks have gone from one crisis to
another and are now far behind the original schedule.
</P>
<P>
   When they signed their last agreement in September, the two
sides set a target date of May 4 to agree on a framework for their
permanent settlement. Ross said they would need six to eight more
weeks to negotiate such a framework although the Palestinians say
no progress has been made so far.

<HEADLINE> Syracuse lion has only months to leave  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- A beloved lion who lost his mate in
November is now dying himself, and officials at the Rosamond
Gifford Zoo say it's not just from a broken heart.
</P>
<P>
   Bud is infected with feline immunodeficiency virus, or FIV, a
disease that has robbed his body of its ability to ward off
infections and disease. FIV is progressive, incurable and
ultimately fatal.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old lion's late companion of the same age, Iseult,
also had FIV, and may have infected Bud. Although FIV positive, the
lioness died of cancer, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo director Anne Baker said it is possible the grief Bud
suffered in losing his mate may have further weakened his body and
accelerated the advance of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said it's difficult to know how advanced the disease is,
but she estimated Bud's life span at between six and 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   He's still on exhibit at the zoo, although sometimes he looks
agitated and at other times dazed and inattentive. Sometimes he
still acts like he did in healthier times. He's being kept indoors
more now when the weather is poor.
</P>
<P>
   Lions are social animals, but the illness has stalled the search
for a new mate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The roaring and pacing and agitation that Bud displayed after
Iseult died has ceased,'' Baker said. ''Now there's a possibility
that a new lioness would stress him more than being alone.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the fear Bud would pass the disease on to a new
mate.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Bud stops eating and wanting to go outside, he will be
letting us know it's time to consider euthanasia,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Lions live to an average age of 13 in captivity, she said.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 6, Braves 0  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Curt Schilling scattered 11 hits for his 100th
career victory and the Philadelphia Phillies stopped Atlanta's home
winning streak, blanking the Braves 6-0 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves set a franchise record by winning 12 in a row at
Turner Field, including a thrilling 6-5 victory over the Phillies
the previous night when Andruw Jones hit a two-run homer in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   There was no comeback against Schilling (1-1), making his second
start since coming off the disabled list following shoulder
surgery. He didn't allow a hit through the first three innings,
then stranded 10 runners the rest of the way for his 14th career
shutout.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had two hits in the fourth, sixth and seventh
innings, then loaded the bases in the ninth with three singles.
Each time, Schilling made the big pitch to escape trouble, striking
out Andres Galarraga on three pitches to end the game. The last of
his 125 pitches was a 96 mph fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, who improved his career record to 100-84, struck out
nine, walked only one and benefited from two double plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies scored three runs in the second against Kevin
Millwood (3-1), who had won nine straight decisions dating back to
last Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Desi Relaford had an RBI double before Doug Glanville came
through with a two-out, two-run double that one-hopped the wall in
right.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia made it 4-0 in the third on Mike Lieberthal's
run-scoring single and added another run in the sixth when Ron Gant
blooped an RBI single that bounced off the glove of Atlanta
shortstop Rafael Furcal. Scott Rolen homered in the ninth against
John Burkett for the final run.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, who closed last season with six straight wins, allowed
five runs, nine hits and three walks in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, meanwhile, won against an Atlanta team that was
missing two-thirds of its starting outfield. Reggie Sanders went on
the disabled list earlier in the day with a sprained ankle, while
Brian Jordan was scratched because of a sore rib muscle.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Steve Sisco, called up from Triple-A Richmond to replace
Sanders on the Braves roster, made his major league debut as a
pinch-hitter in the sixth inning. He lined out to shortstop. ...
The crowd of 48,610 was the first sellout of the year at Turner
Field. ... The Braves' previous home loss was April 7 against San
Francisco. They are 14-3 at The Ted. ... Phillies 2B Mickey
Morandini went 2-for-5 and it hitting .431 for his career at Turner
Field. ... Philadelphia had five players with two hits each and
finished with 13 overall.

<HEADLINE> Revolution 2, Earthquake 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Mauricio Ramos and Wolde Harris each had a
goal and an assist as New England beat San Jose 2-1 to extend its
unbeaten streak to four.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution (2-2-4) took over first place in the MLS's
Eastern Division.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos and Harris, who assisted on each other's goals, scored
within three minutes of each other early in the second half to give
New England a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos notched his first goal off a pass from Harris at 54:11,
chipping in a shot following a giveaway by San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos fed Harris off a perfect give-and-go play at 57:10.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose (2-4-2) cut the deficit to 2-1 in the 72nd minute when
Abdul Thompson Conteh chipped an 18-yard shot over Revolution
goalkeeper Jeff Causey. The goal snapped a four-match, 352-minute
scoreless streak on the road for the Earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose -- outshot 10-1 in the first half -- played without
leading scorer Ron Cerritos, who was on call for the El Salvador
national team.
</P>
<P>
   New England's Johnny Torres nearly put the Revolution ahead late
in the first half with a header off Ramos' corner kick in the 44th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose barely missed a goal six minutes into the second half
when Khodadad Azizi blasted a left-footed shot off the crossbar.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Ante Razov scored three second-half
goals for the first hat-trick in Fire history as Chicago beat the
Miami Fusion 3-0 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (1-3-4) is winless in six matches and has scored only one
goal in its last 595 minutes of play. Chicago improved to 4-4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Razov gave the Fire a 1-0 lead four minutes after halftime.
Midfielder Evan Whitfield sent a crossing pass from the right wing
to a charging Razov, whose diving header beat Fusion goalkeeper
Garth Lagerway from the 6-yard box.
</P>
<P>
   Razov beat Lagerway from 18 yards to make it 2-0 in the 56th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   An unmarked Razov broke through the middle of the Fusion defense
and, when Lagerway couldn't clear Jesse Marsch's crossing pass,
drilled in the ball to close the scoring with 18 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   The first three-goal game in the MLS this season raised Razov's
total to seven goals.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's best scoring opportunity was Roy Lassiter's close-range
shot, which was deflected by Fire goalkeeper Zach Thornton at the
86th minute.

Disarmament Coming Soon, IRA Says
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A breakthrough that makes lasting peace
possible in Northern Ireland after 30 years of bloodshed came Saturday when the
Irish Repubican Army said that it will soon start to disarm. The British and
Irish governments warmly welcomed the IRA's long-sought pledge, saying it met
their requirements and should clear the way for restoring power to Northern
Ireland's Catholic-Protestant administration on May 22. The province had gotten
a measure of self-rule when the power-sharing administration was formed in
December. But Britain reimposed direct rule some two months later because of the
IRA's refusal to give any disarmament commitment.

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Using civilians as human shields, rebels
advanced Saturday night toward Freetown, and have battled U.N. forces in the
interior of the country, a U.N. official said. The rebels, which have taken
hundreds of U.N. personnel hostage since Monday, moved Saturday afternoon from
the town of Lunsar, 45 miles northeast of Freetown, the capital, and were
heading toward the town of Masiaka, said U.N. spokesman Philip Winslow. He said
the rebel force was estimated to be between 500 and 1,000 men carrying
''infantry-type'' weapons.

53, his voice cracking, whispered as reporters met him at the Washoe County
Jail, where he has been held since the high court's Jan. 27 decision. In

Mexico, the sprawling plaza known as the Zocalo. The celebration today is yet
another sign that the long and sometimes bloody hostility between the government
and church in Mexico has broken down, and that the church is playing a more
public role. The Church's role has also affected Mexico's tightly contested
presidential race. The Clergy has become increasingly vocal in calling for
democratic reform, and politicians from all sides have openly courted church

<HEADLINE> Marlins 9, Mets 1  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- It's hard to say which hurt the New York Mets more
on Saturday night: Alex Fernandez's arm or his bat.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander allowed one run and five hits in six innings
and also hit a go-ahead, two-run double in a five-run fourth inning
as the Florida Marlins beat the Mets 9-1.
</P>
<P>
   Former-Met Preston Wilson added his second career grand slam in
the eighth inning off Armando Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez (4-3) struck out four and walked three, allowing Derek
Bell's go-ahead homer in the fourth. Braden Looper, Dan Miceli and
Antonio Alfonseca combined for three-hit relief.
</P>
<P>
   Derrek Lee and Alex Gonzalez singled off Bill Pulsipher (0-2) in
the fourth and Fernandez's double put the Marlins ahead 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Castillo singled, and RBI singles by Mark Kotsay's and
Cliff Floyd chased Pulsipher, who allowed all five runs and nine
hits in 3 1-3 innings. Mike Lowell followed with a sacrifice fly
off Rich Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez cruised through the first three innings, allowing just
a pair of walks. He got in trouble in the fourth, when Bell homered
and Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Piazza followed with singles. But
Robin Ventura struck out on a hit-and-run play, and Alfonzo was
thrown out at third by catcher Mike Redmond for a double play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Marlins 2B Luis Castillo stole three bases, giving him five
in two games since he returned from the 15-day disabled list. ...
Mets reliever Turk Wendell returned from a sprained right ankle and
pitched 1 1-3 scoreless innings. ... Marlins 3B Mike Lowell went
0-for-3, extending his hitless streak to 24 at-bats. ... NL
strikeout leader Preston Wilson of Florida struck out once, giving
him 48 this season. ... The announced crowd of 33,401 was the
largest at Florida since opening day.

the Tigers lineup. ... After not facing a left-handed starter in
the first 12 games of the season, Detroit faced its eighth in 15
games Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins leads the AL in doubles with 68 and have
hit two-baggers in 28 of 30 games this season. ... Jacque Jones,
who did not start Saturday night, is hitting .452 in his last 10
games with homers in the last two.
Angels-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Darin Erstad of the Angels is 1-for-9 in the first two
games of the Mariners' series and is 3-for-21 on Anaheim's road
trip. That's dropped his AL-leading batting average from .449 to
.398. ... Angels 2B Adam Kennedy almost collided with RF Tim Salmon
when he made a back-to-the-plate catch of Bell's pop for the first
out in the third. ... Salmon is 4-for-5 with a homer, three RBIs
and three walks in the Mariners series.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: Seattle's Stan Javier and Alex Rodriguez each spoke to
plate umpire Mark Wegner after being called out on strikes in the
sixth. ... In Gil Meche's six starts this season, the Mariners have
scored four runs while Meche has been in the games. ... The
Mariners played their second 1-0 game at Safeco. They lost 1-0 to
the New York Yankees last Aug. 7 when Andy Pettitte beat Freddy
Garcia. ... The Mariners played their fourth consecutive one-run
game. ... Seattle's Kazuhiro Sasaki, Japan's career saves leader,
got his first major league win. ... The last 1-0 victory for the
Mariners had been Aug. 20, 1997, against Cleveland in the Kingdome.
... Seattle got its first victory when scoring fewer than four
runs.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Pirates-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Wil Cordero continued his hitting streak, driving in
the game-tying run with his triple to the right-center wall and
going 3-for-5. He's batting .444 (8-for-18) with four RBIs in his
last four games after enduring a 2-for-25 slump. ''Not to give one
guy credit for the win, but all of the sudden, Wil's getting big
hits and generating some runs,'' manager Gene Lamont said. ''It's
surprising the difference one makes.'' ... The Pirates have a thing
about opposing closers. They've already beaten Trevor Hoffman and
Ugueth Urbina, and they knocked Rick Aguilera for four runs on two
hits in Saturday's six-run, ninth-inning rally. ... Saturday's
victory guaranteed the Pirates their first winning road trip of the
season. They're 4-1 on the six-game trip, with one game left to
play.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: There was a new guy leading the pregame stretch
Saturday morning for the Cubs' bench players -- Mark Grace. Grace
had started all but one of the first 31 games, with his lone bench
appearance coming after he took a hard fall in Cincinnati. But with
Grace mired in a 6-for-26 slump -- he was 0-for-7 the last two games
-- manager Don Baylor put him on the bench. ''In the past, when I've
watched him hit, he's always been pretty selective at the plate,''
Baylor said. ''Right now he's swinging at first pitches that are
not his pitches, he's 6-for-26, plus he needs a day off. I just
think he needs a mental break.'' Grace said his plate problems
don't have anything to do with the broken finger he suffered during
spring training. ''I just stink,'' he said. ''I know what I'm doing
wrong. We found the problem, now we just have to correct it.''
Grace came into Saturday's game in the sixth inning and went
1-for-2. ... So much for that dreaded Wrigley Field wind. In nine
games with the wind blowing in, the Cubs and their opponents have
averaged 10.1 runs and 3.1 home runs. In six games with the wind
blowing out, they've averaged 9.7 runs and 2.8 homers. ... Saturday
was the two-year anniversary of Kerry Wood's 20-strikeout game
against the Houston Astros.
Mets-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Third-base coach Cookie Rojas missed Saturday's game
because his son, Victor, was getting married. John Stearns filled
in for him. ... With LHP John Franco picking up his first save of
the season Friday night, manager Bobby Valentine said he might use
both Franco and RHP Armando Benitez in the closer role this season.
''Benitez is the closer. He will close, and so will John. If
they're both healthy, then I'll make the decision.'' ... Valentine
applauded Tommy Lasorda being hired as manager of the U.S. Olympic
baseball team: ''It's a great thing for Olympic baseball. He's
still the most recognizable baseball figure in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: The Marlins are 0-3 against former teammates in the
last week. They lost to RHP Kevin Brown and the Dodgers 7-1 last
Sunday, RHP Brian Meadows and the Padres 3-1 on Wednesday and LHP
Al Leiter and the Mets 4-1 on Friday. ... RHP A.J. Burnett had the
cast removed from his surgically repaired thumb this week and has
begun rehabilitation work. He expects to throw in 7-10 weeks. ...
Don't expect manager John Boles to make any drastic lineup changes
any time soon, even with the Marlins' recent slump. ''The last
thing in the world we want to do is give up on people,'' Boles
said. ''I just don't think that's the right thing to do.''
Cardinals-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Mark McGwire received permission to miss Saturday's
game so he could handle a personal matter. He's expected back
Sunday. ... Jim Edmonds was 0-for-2 with a pair of walks, ending
his hitting streak at seven games. He made his third start of the
season in place of McGwire at first base. ... St. Louis is 9-1 in
day games, 10-10 at night.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: The Reds put right-hander Pete Harnisch on the
disabled list, two days after he lasted only one-third of an inning
in a 14-1 loss in Philadelphia. A test detected weakness in the
back of his shoulder, and he's expected to be out for three or four
weeks. ... The Reds don't need another starter until next Saturday.
Osvaldo Fernandez is the leading candidate for a call-up from
Triple-A. ... The Reds gave out roughly 10,000 Pokey Bears, named
for their Gold Glove second baseman.
Phillies-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Mickey Morandini, who didn't play Friday against
LHP Tom Glavine, returned to the lineup with RHP Kevin Millwood on
the mound for the Braves. Morandini entered the game with the
highest average (.433) in the four-year history of Turner Field for
those with a minimum of 50 at-bats. ... The Phillies have scored on
18 runs in Randy Wolf's six starts, tied for second lowest in the
NL for five starts. ... The Phillies will stop in Reading, Pa., on
Monday for an exhibition game against their Double-A farm team.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: RF Brian Jordan was scratched from the lineup because
of lingering pain in his left side. He strained a muscle in his rib
cage while taking indoor batting practice in Los Angeles on
Tuesday. Jordan already has spent 15 days on the disabled list for
a strained muscle in his right rib cage. ... With Jordan out,
Andruw Jones was the only regular member of the outfield who
started Saturday. LF Reggie Sanders was placed on the 15-day
disabled list, retroactive to April 30, because of a sprained left
ankle. Trenidad Hubbard started in right and Bobby Bonilla was in
left. ... The Braves purchased the contract of INF Steve Sisco, who
was playing at Triple-A Richmond after hitting five homers in
spring training. ... Jonathan Schuerholz, son of Braves GM John
Schuerholz, is making a name for himself at Auburn. The younger
Schuerholz, a freshman shortstop, hit a grand slam in the eighth
inning Saturday to give the Tigers a 6-3 victory over rival
Alabama.
Expos-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: Vladimir Guerrero struck out in the first inning, just
his fifth strikeout in 101 at-bats. Guerrero raised his average
from .400 to .420 by going 4-for-5 on Friday night. ... The Expos'
pitching staff combined for a season-high 14 strikeouts on Friday
night, including four in the ninth inning. Milwaukee's Luis Lopez
was struck out by Ugueth Urbina with the bases loaded in the ninth,
but he reached first and Tyler Houston scored on a wild pitch. ...
RHP Mike Thurman will make his season debut against the Cubs next
Saturday. Thurman, who went 7-11 with a 4.05 ERA for Montreal last
season, will make a rehab start for Triple-A Ottawa on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Saturday's game was the last Saturday afternoon game
scheduled at County Stadium, which is to be torn down and replaced
by Miller Park after this season. ... Wearing a Brewers batting
practice cap, Milwaukee Bucks star Ray Allen threw out the first
pitch Saturday. ... RHP Jamey Wright was scheduled to make his
first rehab start with Double-A Huntsville on Saturday. Wright,
acquired in an offseason trade and expected to be in the Brewers'
starting lineup, suffered a small rotator cuff tear during spring
training.
Padres-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Ed Sprague went 4-for-4 with two home runs against
the Diamondbacks, the fifth four-hit game of his career. Five of
Sprague's six homers this season have come against Arizona. Sprague
is hitting .579 against the Diamondbacks. ... Eric Owens was
0-for-4 and failed to reach base for the first time in the 28 games
he's played this season. ... The Padres have lost 11 of their last
13 games at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Byung-Hyun Kim, Arizona's 21-year-old sidearm reliever
from South Korea, has struck out seven consecutive batters over
three games, the longest streak in the franchise's three-year
history. He is averaging 14.2 strikeouts per nine innings. ...
Closer Matt Mantei is using the same exercise regimen to strengthen
his right shoulder as Todd Stottlemyre used to come back from a
partially torn rotator cuff without surgery.
Rockies-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Jeff Cirillo has a 13-game hitting streak for
Colorado. ... He is 22 for his last 49 (.449) with four doubles, a
triple and 11 RBIs. ... Outfielder Thomas Goodwin is expected to
rejoin the starting lineup Sunday for Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Five of Shawn Estes' six career complete games
have been shutouts. ... Estes is 8-2 in 15 career day game starts.
... Giants pitchers are working on a 21-inning scoreless streak.
They have allowed only two runs over the last 31 innings. ... The
Giants have won eight straight home games against the Rockies.
Astros-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Jeff Bagwell's home run and single on Friday night
against Kevin Brown gave him 100 career hits against the Dodgers.
Bagwell, who has at least 100 hits against 10 different teams,
needs seven more against Montreal to make it 11.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: One day after being hired as manager of the U.S.
Olympic baseball team, Dodgers senior vice president Tom Lasorda
was presented with his official U.S. jersey and cap by selection
committee co-chairmen Bob Watson and Bill Bavasi. ''Tommy cost me a
couple of World Series rings in 1981 (with the Yankees) and 1988
(with Oakland), but I'm going to forget it if he can get me the
gold,'' Watson said. ... Darren Dreifort, a month into his third
season as a major league starter, has failed to go longer than six
innings in 34 of his 60 career starts prior to Saturday night's
outing against Houston. His career was stalled by the
reconstructive surgery on his right elbow that forced him to sit
out the entire 1995 season.

<HEADLINE> GOP Utah Gov. Forced Into a Primary  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT GEHRKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah (AP) -- Gov. Mike Leavitt was booed,
heckled and then forced into a primary as state Republicans held
their political convention Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative voters, accusing Leavitt and Sen. Orrin Hatch of
abandoning their principles, greeted the governor with shouts of
''Democrat'' and ''hypocrite'' as Leavitt blew kisses to the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt received 54 percent of the delegate vote -- short of the
60 percent he needed to avoid a primary. He will have to compete
against Glen Davis, a little known Republican who spent just $3,000
on the convention race.
</P>
<P>
   Davis won 46 percent of the delegates' support.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not surprised,'' he said. ''We have a governor who claims
to be a Republican but has violated many of the principles he
claims to cling to.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt said he looked forward to spreading his message to
voters during his primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The delegates) have spoken. What they've said is, 'Mike
Leavitt. Go out and earn the nomination in a primary,''' Leavitt
said. ''Would I rather not have a primary? Yes. Do I have any sense
of reluctance about going into a primary? Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch secured the party's nomination with 61 percent, but his
challenger Greg Hawkins received a surprising 36 percent. Hawkins
was then nominated as Davis' running mate for lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Merrill Cook, R-Utah, who holds one of the nation's most
vulnerable congressional seats, was forced into a June 27 primary
against businessman Derek Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The winner between Smith and Cook will face Democrat Jim
Matheson, who accepted his party's uncontested nomination at the
Democratic convention Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   National Republican leaders, including House Speaker Dennis
Hastert and House Majority Leader Dick Armey, have rallied to
Cook's aide to retain their slim 11-seat majority in the 435-member
U.S. House of Representatives.

<HEADLINE> Hispanics remember O'Connor as a true friend  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor was remembered Saturday
by his Hispanic parishioners as a friend who cared very much for
them, especially the immigrants, as they struggled to make a new
life in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the politicians, to the police, to all the nationalities
represented here today -- we are all brothers today, in respect for
the cardinal,'' said Bishop Francisco Garmendia at a Mass said in
Spanish at St. Patrick's Cathedral. ''We want to thank you,
cardinal, for all you did for us in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   People from Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Puerto Rico
and other nations filled the cathedral pews. Many fingered rosary
beads and mouthed silent prayers in tribute to their beloved
cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   All were appreciative that the Philadelphia native had embarked
on an intensive Spanish language course upon his appointment in
1984 to head the archdiocese. His fluency improved to the point
where he could give homilies in Spanish and preside at weddings and
funerals for Hispanics, Garmendia said.
</P>
<P>
   He was especially beloved by immigrants for making them feel so
welcome, said Esperanza Morales, coordinator of the Tepeyac
Association of New York, which represents Mexican immigrants. The
group held a large banner and sang quietly outside the cathedral
after Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ''He always talked to us in Spanish, and always wanted to help
us,'' Morales said. ''We loved him, we want to tell him 'Thank you'
for all he did for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics are an important part of the archdiocese, making up
approximately 36 percent of its 2.4 million members. Roughly 100 of
the archdiocese's 413 parishes are predominantly Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands came to pay tribute to the cardinal, some carrying
banners and flags.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a good man, he always made us feel special,'' said
Maria Huslin, 38, of the Bronx. ''The Hispanic community was never
made to feel second to any other nationality. He treated all his
parishioners the same. He treated us with respect.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I named my son after him,'' said Manuel Escobar, 31, of
Brooklyn, carrying his 2-year-old son Juan. ''I met him once, and I
called him 'Father.' He was like a parish priest to us. We could
talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's love for his parishioners was mentioned frequently
throughout the Mass. During his homily, the Rev. Josu Iriondo
called O'Connor someone who cherished life and who fought to make
the lives of his flock better.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a lover of life, a defender of life, of the sick, of
the poor,'' said Iriondo, pastor of Church of St. Anthony of Padua,
in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Some worshippers wiped away tears at the end of the Mass, when
Garmendia mentioned how the Hispanic community was indebted to
O'Connor. Many stayed behind after the Mass to view the cardinal's
body.
</P>
<P>
   There were also several non-Hispanics in the crowd, including a
small group of women who had just run a 3.1-mile race from Times
Square to Central Park to raise money for cancer research for
women.
</P>
<P>
   ''On such a glorious day, it seemed only fitting to come and pay
tribute to such a wonderful man,'' said Becky Moranis, 28, of
Manhattan, as she walked out of the cathedral into the warm, sunny
day.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, a line of nearly 1,000 people wanting to view
the cardinal's body stood outside the cathedral, steadily moving
toward the building's entrance. The tall buildings of midtown
shaded the relaxed crowd, which included a mix of devoted followers
of the church and other passers-by who wanted to witness a moment
in history.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 p.m. -- half an hour before St. Patrick's closed its doors
for the night -- a steady stream of people was still flowing from
the cathedral after paying their respects.

<HEADLINE> Reformists Win Majority in Iran  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's reformers won 52 of the 66 seats
contested in run-off legislative elections, the nation's largest
pro-democracy party said Saturday -- another setback for Islamic
hard-liners fighting change.
</P>
<P>
   The run-off was held three months after allies of Iran's
reformist president won 70 percent of the seats decided in the
first round of voting for the Majlis, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
   If the run-off results stand, the reformers will have enough
seats to easily control the 290-member parliament for the first
time since the 1979 Islamic revolution. The reformers would also be
in a position to grant greater social freedoms and weaken
hard-liners' grip on key institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard-liners have shown they won't give up willingly:
Since their first-round defeat on Feb. 18, they have unleashed a
crackdown, shutting down 16 reform newspapers and arresting top
liberal activists.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-line Guardians Council, which oversees elections,
annulled a dozen reformist victories from the first round. The
Council also is yet to endorse the results in Tehran, where
reformers won 29 of the 30 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's results are certain to put more pressure on the
hard-liners. Mohammad-Reza Khatami, head of the Islamic Iran
Participation Front and the president's brother, called the results
''a clear message'' to those who have been resorting ''to illegal
means and seemingly legal pretexts to defeat this promising
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   State-run Tehran radio announced the names of the winners
without giving their affiliations. Elections in Iran are not
contested on party lines, and the leanings of the candidates are
known only unofficially.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the 52 seats won by reformers, hard-liners took 10 seats
and four seats went to independents, said Mhos Pirzadeh, an
official at the headquarters of the Islamic Iran Participation
Front. He said 43 winners were from his party.
</P>
<P>
   Other reformist parties reported similar figures with small
discrepancies. The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency also
confirmed that 10 hard-liners had won, but it reported 40 reformist
wins and said it did not know the affiliations of 16 others.
</P>
<P>
   Run-offs were held for races where no candidate received the
minimum 25 percent of votes in the first round. Only the two
front-runners from the last round were eligible to contest each
seat.
</P>
<P>
   President Mohammad Khatami's 1997 election ignited a huge
movement for change, fueled largely by Iran's predominantly young
population. Islamic hard-liners, out of step with the nation's
mood, are unpopular but have shown that they won't fold, using
their grip on the military, the state media and the judiciary to
stall democratic and social reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians are now watching to see whether the electoral victory
will boost the reformers' power or open the way to more
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more the hard-liners try to dictate to the people, the
more defeats they will suffer,'' said Karim Arqandehpour, editor of
the reformist Mosharekat daily, among the newspapers that were shut
down. ''The hard-liners have no option but to respect the vote of
the people, but unfortunately experience has shown that they are
unwilling to reconsider their own policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Reformers fear that the hard-line crackdown could be an attempt
to provoke riots that would bring troops into the streets and
create a state of national emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Such a situation would give hard-liners more time to maneuver.
It could even give them an excuse to delay the May 27 opening of
the Majlis, which constitutionally must be inaugurated on time
except in a national emergency.

<HEADLINE> Devils 4, Maple Leafs 3  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Scott Gomez, on the verge being benched for poor
play early in the series, had two critical assists as the New
Jersey Devils moved within one victory of the Eastern Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, a favorite for NHL rookie of the year, assisted on the
second and third goals as the Devils rallied from two one-goal
deficits to beat Toronto 4-3 Saturday night, giving them a 3-2 lead
in the best-of-seven series. Game 6 is in New Jersey on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the game was marred by several fights, while
frustrated Maple Leaf fans littered the ice with garbage. Toronto's
Darcy Tucker ignited the commotion when he took a couple of swings
at New Jersey goalie Martin Brodeur at the final horn.
</P>
<P>
   After setting up Sergei Nemchinov's goal that tied the game 2-2
with 4:01 left in the second period, Gomez made a brilliant
behind-the-back pass, setting up Vladimir Malakhov's go-ahead goal
7:47 into the third.
</P>
<P>
   John Madden extended the margin to 4-2 with 5:53 left. The Maple
Leafs closed within one when Sergei Berezin scored with 2:56
remaining, but they couldn't get the equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   It was by Gomez's hand that the Devils took the lead for good.
Just inside the Toronto blue line, Gomez faked a shot, freezing a
Leafs defender and passing to Malakhov. With Toronto's Kevyn Adams
trying to stop him from behind, Malakhov snapped a 20-footer that
beat Curtis Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   After coach Larry Robinson threatened to sit Gomez for his poor
play before Game 2, he has two goals and five points in his last
three games.
</P>
<P>
   Patrik Elias scored the first goal for the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs continued to get solid goaltending from Joseph,
but have yet to hear from their big offensive threats. Toronto's
No. 1 line of Mats Sundin, Steve Thomas and Jonas Hoglund has just
one goal in the series, coming in Game 4's 3-2 win at New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs, with just six goals in the first four games of
the series, finally got some offense from some unlikely sources --
Garry Valk and Jeff Farkas.
</P>
<P>
   Valk's a fourth-liner and defensive specialist, while Farkas was
playing for Boston College in the NCAA championship game just last
month.
</P>
<P>
   After Valk and Elias traded first-period goals, the Leafs went
ahead on Farkas' goal 2:19 into the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils tied it when Gomez beat defenseman Greg Andrusak to
the puck and set up Nemchinov for a breakaway goal.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph was sharp once again as the Leafs were outshot 32-25. His
most remarkable stop came four minutes into the second period
during a scramble in front of his net.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, caught out of position, reached behind him and stopped
the puck after three-quarters of it had crossed the goal line. The
entire puck has to cross the goal line for it to count as a goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs' power play continued to struggle, finishing
0-for-2 for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs have yet to score a power-play goal against the
Devils, and have gone eight straight games -- going back to
Toronto's first-round series against Ottawa -- without scoring with
the man advantage. Overall, Toronto's power-play has gone 2-for-41
in the playoffs, second-worst only to the Los Angeles Kings, who
went 0-for-23 in being swept by Detroit in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Leafs left wing Wendel Clark, missed Saturday's game for
undisclosed reasons. After being a healthy scratch for Toronto's
first four playoff games, Clark played in the next six, recording a
goal and assisting on Tucker's game-winning goal in Game 1 against
the Devils.

<HEADLINE> Feds To Probe Lab Bias Claims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- State and federal agencies are
investigating claims by Asian workers of job discrimination at
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, their attorney says.
</P>
<P>
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission initiated a federal
probe into the claims, said San Francisco attorney Brad Yamauchi.
He represents nine Asian workers who have filed complaints of bias
with the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing.
</P>
<P>
   The workers claim they earned as much as $4,000 a month less
than white counterparts because whites are allegedly preferred for
management positions.

<P>
   Representatives of the federal and state agencies would not
comment on ongoing investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Yamauchi said his clients were encouraged by the interest of
both agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means there will be thorough investigations,'' he said.
''If statistics show a discriminatory pattern, the burden of proof
would shift to the lab to demonstrate that the nine complainants
were not victims of bias.''
</P>
<P>
   Lab spokeswoman Susan Houghton would not comment on the matter.
The lab has denied claims of intentional discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations come in the wake of the arrest of Wen Ho Lee, a
Taiwan-born U.S. citizen who worked at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico. Lee was indicted on 59 counts of
transferring nuclear secrets to his desktop computer and portable
data tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Lee maintains his innocence and sued the Justice and Energy
departments and the FBI, saying officials violated his privacy by
leaking information to reporters designed to make him appear to be
a spy.
</P>
<P>
   After Lee was fired, Asian scientists at the national labs
reported an increase in racist incidents, ranging from
inappropriate jokes to denied promotions.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Move Toward Freetown  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Rebel forces using civilians as
human shields battled U.N. forces in the interior of this West
African country on Saturday and were advancing on the capital, a
U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who had agreed to a U.N.-mediated peace agreement in
July, launched the offensive from the town of Lunsar, 45 miles
northeast of Freetown, the capital, U.N. spokesman Philip Winslow
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tried to stop the rebels using all the resources at our
disposal,'' Winslow said, but declined to characterize the battle
any further, except to say that the rebels were not stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Winslow said the rebel force numbered between 500 and 1,000 and
were carrying ''infantry-type'' weapons. They were using vehicles
they had captured from U.N. peacekeepers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The exact position of the Revolutionary United Front fighters
was not immediately clear, though the fighting violates the peace
deal that brought the rebels into the government and ended an
eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   RUF leader Foday Sankoh, who could not be independently reached
for comment, was continuing to insist that no attack was under way,
Winslow said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said late Saturday, at about 9:30
p.m. EDT, that two to three clusters of rebels, about 300 per
cluster, had been spotted by helicopters about three hours earlier
at Masiaka moving towards Freetown. But about 30 minutes later,
Eckhard announced that he could not confirm the information he had
received from Freetown and relayed to reporters in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has a Jordanian peacekeeping unit just west
of Freetown, but the RUF could go around them, up into the hills,
and then descend into Freetown, he said. At present, there are
about 2,000 U.N. troops in the capital -- about 500 Jordanians and
1,600 Nigerians, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leonean Information Minister Julius Spencer confirmed
that there had been a battle between the rebels and U.N. forces,
but had no further information on the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer said the peace agreement includes a statement that
hostilities would stop.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't understand how they could be doing this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Western aid workers and missionaries, meanwhile, were
gathering with packed suitcases in the parking lots of the city's
two major hotels, seeking protection and potential evacuation. Some
90 non-U.N. aid workers and family members were evacuated from the
city Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, hundreds of U.N. personnel have been taken hostage
by the rebels, and at least four are presumed dead following
clashes.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the U.N. said they had lost contact with a 200-man
peacekeeper unit near the town of Makeni.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.N. peacekeepers, all of them Zambian, have been
captured by the rebels, that would bring the number of U.N. staff
being held by the RUF to nearly 500.
</P>
<P>
   In talks Saturday involving Sankoh, the United Nations and a
Libyan delegation, the rebel leader agreed to a joint delegation to
leave Freetown on Sunday ''to areas where there have been security
problems,'' Winslow said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the fighting Saturday night, though, it seemed highly
doubtful that any such mission would go forward.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials emphasized earlier that the world body had no
plans to withdraw from Sierra Leone. The mission had been
dispatched in December to oversee the peace deal ending the civil
war, which left tens of thousands of people dead and thousands more
maimed in this diamond-rich nation.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, though, have insisted all along that they were
neither holding hostages nor launching an offensive. The missing
U.N. soldiers are simply lost in the jungle, they have said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people, they are foreigners here, they do not know the
terrain,'' Sankoh told The Associated Press in an interview
Saturday afternoon in front of his heavily guarded home. ''As time
goes on, I think all of them will come out. My men are helping to
look for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If they are being held by the RUF combatants, I'm sure they
will be released,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian, Malian and Libyan delegations have met with Sankoh.
Many other diplomats -- African, European and American -- have also
reached out to the rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Sankoh is a mercurial man long accustomed to confrontations
with the United Nations and the Sierra Leonean government, and has
often ignored their pleadings in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The peace agreement brought the RUF into a power-sharing
government. But relations have remained deeply strained between the
rebels and the government, despite their erstwhile alliance, and
thousands of rebels have refused to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   In Freetown, residents have been fearing an attack for the past
couple days. Earlier Saturday, radio stations broadcast notices
that religious services and other meetings were canceled ''because
of the security situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But government and U.N. officials both said the city was
well-defended, and the United Nations continued to appeal for
international help. Earlier Saturday, Eckhard said the United
Nations would continue trying to speed up deployment of the
remaining three battalions -- Indian, Bangladeshi and Jordanian --
due to arrive in mid-July to complete the 11,100-strong force.
</P>
<P>
   Four Kenyan U.N. peacekeepers are believed to have been killed
in the clashes that began Monday. The fighting began as the
Nigerian-led West African intervention, which has fought the rebels
for years as the de facto Sierra Leonean army, made its final
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations says 12 people were wounded in the fighting
and the RUF says six rebels were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels claim the clashes began because peacekeepers were
forcibly disarming RUF fighters -- a charge U.N. officials deny.

British, Irish Alike Welcome IRA Pledge
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The British and Irish governments warmly
welcomed the Irish Republican Army's long-sought pledge to disarm Saturday,
saying it met their requirements and should clear the way for restoring power to
Northern Ireland's Catholic-Protestant administration on May 22. The province
had gotten a measure of self-rule when the power-sharing administration was
formed in December. But Britain reimposed direct rule some two months later
because of the IRA's refusal to give any disarmament commitment.

Clinton Rips Senators on Judge

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton criticized Texas' two Republican
senators today for seeking to block his nomination of a Hispanic lawyer to a
federal appeals court. Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison said Enrique
Moreno of El Paso, Texas, a Harvard-educated lawyer in private practice since
1981, lacked the necessary experience to sit on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals. Clinton said in a statement that claim was ''unconscionable.'' He noted
that Moreno won the top rating from the American Bar Association, which
evaluates and reports on the professional qualifications of people being
considered by the president for nomination to federal judgeships.

night, with American envoy Dennis Ross present, U.S. embassy spokesman Larry
Schwartz said. At the meeting the Palestinians categorically rejected a map

20 Years on Death Row, Now Out on Bail

   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A man who spent 20 years on death row for the murder of a
judge's son was released on bail today, three months after the Nevada Supreme
Court reversed his conviction. ''I am overwhelmed. I gotta go,'' Jack Mazzan,
53, his voice cracking, whispered as reporters met him at the Washoe County
Jail, where he has been held since the high court's Jan. 27 decision. In
reversing Mazzan's conviction, the high court criticized prosecutors for failing
to give the defense information about other suspects -- alleged drug-dealers who
hadn't been paid for thousands of dollars worth of drugs supplied to the victim,
Richard Minor Jr.

Big Game Lottery Jackpot Swells
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The multistate Big Game lottery jackpot has ballooned to a
record of more than $300 million since yesterday when no one picked all six
numbers drawn. The largest U.S. lottery prize was $295.7 million, set two years
ago in a multistate Powerball game that was won by 13 machinists from
Westerville, Ohio. ''Now we're in uncharted water,'' Virginia Lottery executive
director Penelope Kyle said today. The pace of ticket-buying for the next
drawing picked up early today at many locations in the seven Big Game states --
Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia.

name is a combination of Japanese slang and Greek mythology. Owner Fusao
Sekiguchi came up with the first name by combining his own first name with
''ichi,'' which in Japanese means No. 1. Pegasus was the name of the winged
horse of mythology. The first name is pronounced Foo-sah-EE-chee. The bay colt

<HEADLINE> Royals 11, White Sox 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Johnny Damon hit a pair of two-run
homers and went 4-for-5 Saturday night to lead the Kansas City
Royals over the Chicago White Sox 11-5.
</P>
<P>
   Every Kansas City starter had at least one hit, and reliever
Jerry Spradlin (1-1) allowed two hits in four shutout innings,
helping send the AL Central-leading White Sox to their fifth loss
in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (15-15) reached .500 for the first time since it was
8-8 on April 19. The Royals, 13-4 at home this season, finished
with a season-high 18 hits, including Mark Quinn's eighth-inning
homer off Kelly Wunsch.
</P>
<P>
   Damon, who matched his career high for hits, tied the score at 2
in the third with a homer off Mike Sirotka (2-3). Mike Sweeney
singled with two outs and scored the go-ahead run on Jermaine Dye's
triple, and Quinn followed with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   David McCarty homered leading off the fourth and Damon homered
for a 7-2 lead, chasing Sirotka, who allowed seven runs and nine
hits in 3 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   It was Damon's second multihomer game. The first was at
Cincinnati on June 23, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Eyre relieved and gave up five consecutive hits, including
run-scoring singles by Dye and Quinn, and Randa's RBI triple.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Durbin, staked to a 10-2 lead after four innings, couldn't
get out of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up Jeff Abbott's RBI double in the second, escaping a
bases-loaded jam when Carlos Lee and Greg Norton flied out, then
allowed Frank Thomas' run-scoring single in the third.
</P>
<P>
   After RBI single by Paul Konerko and Chris Singleton in the
fifth, Spadlin relieved, allowing a run-scoring, double-play
grounder to Lee.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Damon led off his ninth straight game with a base hit. He
was forced at second on a fielder's choice, failing to score in the
first inning for just the second time in the nine games. The streak
is the longest in the major leagues in at least 25 years, as Elias
Sports Bureau did not keep this stat before 1975. .... The Royals
have 57 hits in their last four games and have been in double
figures in 10 of their last 11.... The White Sox had homered in
five consecutive games coming in. ... It was just the third game
this season tthe Royals did not give up a home run.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Plans To Review Records  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- An NCAA enforcement officer who cleared
Tennessee of academic wrongdoing in March plans to review records
an English professor said reveal questionable practices to keep
athletes eligible, The Tennessean reported.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Bensel-Meyers said the NCAA has asked to review her
records. She said those records show that athletes often were
steered toward easier majors and even had their grades changed.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Barker, a member of the NCAA's enforcement staff, notified
university general counsel Ron Leadbetter that he will return to
campus May 23 and meet with Bensel-Meyers, the newspaper reported
in Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Leadbetter conducted the university's internal investigation,
which concluded there were no NCAA violations. Barker did the
NCAA's follow-up audit, which found there was no reason to conduct
further inquiry ''at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers said she does not want to see NCAA sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to see the academic side oversee all academics on
campus. It needs to be on an academic site. Fair play, that's all I
want,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leadbetter said Saturday that Bensel-Meyers misinterprets the
difference between academic concerns and NCAA violations and has
failed to provide any specific information that might constitute an
NCAA violation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think all the NCAA is doing is giving her one more shot,''
Leadbetter said. ''If she's got something, then spit it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadbetter said his only interest is in whether any NCAA
infractions occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers contends Tennessee consciously withheld evidence
of potential NCAA wrongdoing when Barker was on campus last
November.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think one thing's very obvious, and that's the coverup,''
said Bensel-Meyers, the university's director of English
composition. ''They didn't give all the information to the NCAA the
first time.''
</P>
<P>
   If proven, such a claim could constitute a lack of institutional
control, which the NCAA considers among the worst of violations.
</P>
<P>
   The university's Faculty Senate has instructed its athletics
committee to conduct an investigation into Bensel-Meyers'
allegations of academic misconduct involving the athletic
department.
</P>
<P>
   The athletics committee last month completed a six-month probe
of the athletic department's tutoring operation conducted after
allegations that at least four tutors did schoolwork for football
players, including members of the 1998 national championship team.
</P>
<P>
   The committee found no system of abuses involving the way
athletes were tutored, nor any suspicious pattern of
grade-changing.

<HEADLINE> Reno Receives Ellis Island Medal  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLIS ISLAND, N.Y. (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno was among
130 people honored Saturday night at an annual celebration of the
nation's rich ethnic diversity held on Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the historic site where thousands of immigrants
once arrived to enter the United States, Reno alluded to the case
of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy. She said that in the
pursuit of justice, conflicts cannot always be avoided, leaving
some people feeling betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to rebuild trust, she said, adding, ''Let us
reach out to start to listen to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the Hudson River in Jersey City, N.J., about 100
Cuban-Americans chanted ''Reno, Repent!'' and ''Reno, Resign!''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were angry over Reno's approval of the raid on
the home of Elian's Miami relatives two weeks ago. Federal agents
seized him after the relatives refused orders by the Justice
Department to turn him over to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters gathered at the edge of a foot bridge to Ellis
Island, but were not permitted across to the area where Reno
received the award. The protest was peaceful. About 20 park rangers
and police officers were on hand to provide security.
</P>
<P>
   West New York Mayor Albio Sires said even though the
demonstrators were kept away from the awards site, they'd still
make their presence known.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know we're far away, and she might not hear us,'' he said.
''But I think the fact that so many people are here sends a
message.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy involving the Cuban boy seemed lost on the
celebrants at the awards ceremony. The event was sponsored by the
National Ethnic Coalition Organizations.
