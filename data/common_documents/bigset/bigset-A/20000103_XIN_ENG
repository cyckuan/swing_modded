<HEADLINE> Israel's Stocks Soar to Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel's benchmark stock index
in the Tel Aviv Stocks Exchange soared to a record high Monday, the
first trading day of the new millennium, after a smooth transition
to the year 2000 without computer glitches.
</P>
<P>
The Maof index of 25 largest companies climbed 3.66 percent, the
biggest percentage rise in more than three weeks, to close at 502.
38, a record for a third consecutive session.
</P>
<P>
Twenty four shares rose and only one fell, pushing the index
above 500 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. led the rise, jumping 4.
9 percent to 300 shekels (about 73 U.S. dollars). Analysts expect
the generic drug-maker to benefit as more branded drugs lose patent
protections in years ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Tel Aviv 100 jumped 3.58 percent and closed at 504.66.
</P>
<P>
The stock market closed Sunday, the first weekly trading day in

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Minister Says U.S. Envoy Blocks Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BGHDAD, January 3 (Xinhua)-- The U.S. envoy at the U.N.
Sanctions Committee have blocked three more Iraqi health contracts
signed under the oil-for-food program, the Iraqi health minister
announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Omed Medhat Mubarak told the Iraqi News Agency that the blocked
contracts were for the purchases of laboratory equipment,
diagnosing materials for cholera and medicine for treating
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the action taken by the U.S. envoy at the Sanctions
Committee reflects the hostile anti-Iraq U.S. policy, which aims at
prolonging the suffering of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed harsh economic sanctions on Iraq in 1990
following its invasion of Kuwait. To alleviate the suffering of the
Iraqi people, the U.N. started to implement the oil-for-food
program in December 1996 in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program now in its seventh phase, Iraq is
allowed to export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil to buy
humanitarian supplies for its people reeling under the U.N.
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British envoys at
the Sanctions Committee of deliberately blocking the approval of
its contracts and impeding the implementation of the humanitarian
program.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi FM Slams Latest U.N. Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad
Said al-Sahaf said the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1284
adopted last December is impracticable and tricky, the Iraqi News
Agency (INA) reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Iraq's Satellite Channel, Sahaf said the U.
N. resolution on Iraq fails to meet Iraq's legitimate demands for
the lifting of the crippling U.N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will continue at all levels disclosing the malicious
objectives of this resolution, said Sahaf.
</P>
<P>
He added the resolution implies new restrictions to fetter Iraq
and deny its rights and independence with an aim to turn Iraq into
a protectorate.
</P>
<P>
The resolution is aimed at rewording the existing Security
Council resolutions on Iraq and prolonging the embargo which was
imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted resolution 1284 last December with
11 votes for and four abstentions. China, Russia, France and
Malaysia abstained from voting.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution, a new arms control body, called the U.N.
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), will
replace the U.N. Special Commission in charge of disarming Iraq
(UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
It also offers Iraq with ambiguous terms the chance to have the
trade sanctions suspended after it cooperates with weapons
inspectors in all aspects and makes progress on key disarmament
tasks to be defined by weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf described the new monitoring regime as a tool to keep the
unjust embargo in place.
</P>
<P>
Under paragraph 22 of the U.N. resolution 687 adopted in 1991,
the Security Council will decide whether to lift the trade
sanctions on Iraq after Iraq has fulfilled its commitments to
disarmament, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
However, the Council failed to do so after Iraq had honoured all
its commitments toward relevant U.N. resolutions, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans and Britons try through this resolution to
plunder Iraq's riches and resources... through the hegemony of
their oil companies under the pretext that the Iraqi oil
installations are in urgent need of rehabilitation, a matter which
is completely rejected by Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf stressed that the latest U.N. resolution falls short of a
real suspension of the sanctions, however, it imposes new
conditions and obligations on Iraq and does not allow Iraq to
purchase humanitarian goods directly with its oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly rejected the resolution.

Putin as acting president.
</P>

Russia, a close ally of Iraq, has been working with China for
the lifting of the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Bug Hits Naples Prisoner Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The much feared and perhaps
overrated Y2K or Millennium Bug appears to have made an appearance
in Italian southern city of Naples upsetting the computerized
records of prisoners and detainees awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
Employees in the prisoner records office, in fact, returned to
their offices Monday morning, after the holiday break, to find
mistakes in the birth dates of some detainees, in detention orders,
special parole permits and other measures.
</P>
<P>
The bug, in some cases, pushed trial dates and some birth dates
ahead by 100 years. Thus there were prisoners slated for release
January 10, 2000 who Monday morning should have been released
January 10, 1900, while others have to wait until 2099 for release.
</P>
<P>
The court's chief magistrate, Angelica Di Giovanni, ordered
staff to get out paper and pens to cope by hand with all urgent
cases and briefs approaching deadlines.
</P>
<P>
Paper and ink work will begin on records pertaining to the
release of prisoners in such special circumstances as suspension
of sentences for illness, release for good time, release to work-
prison programs and the like.
</P>
<P>
The head of personnel, Luigi Zuccarino, said Finsiel
technicians were on the job and expected to have the entire system
"de-bugged" by Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Then, all the records dealt with manually will be fed back into
the computers.
</P>
<P>
In Venice, staff in the records office were forced to cope with
the same problem today. An office manager said all the dates were
wrong.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of reading 1945, for example, we read 2045 on the
terminal. But once printed out, the date was correct on the sheet,
"the manager said.
</P>
<P>
He said after telephone contact with other offices around the
country, including Naples, that "no so much the bug, I think this
is a specific problem with the system we had installed, like in
Naples, for the management of data."
</P>
<P>
In Rome, Engineer Augusto Leggio, the technical director of the
Year 2000 Committee installed in Fort Braschi and given the task
of girding for possible Y2K trouble, said Monday, "there were some
problems reported at the local level. They were quickly dealt with
and solved."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says no Immediate final Agreements Expected at Shepherdstown Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States
said on Monday that it did not expect a final agreement to be
reached between Syria and Israel at the second round of talks
being held at Shepherdstown, West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect to be able to achieve a core agreement in one
round of negotiations," State Department spokesman James Rubin
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
We are hoping to achieve is to have an opportunity to discuss
all the outstanding issues ... at the end of which we would
certainly hope that we will be able to achieve real progress
towards closing some of the gaps and toward making this historical
opportunity more possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said it was not reasonable to expect a final agreement
immediately given a four-year hiatus in the negotiations that
broke down in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said President Bill Clinton was meeting with the Israeli
delegation led by Prime Minister Ehud Barak, while Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright was meeting the Syrian delegation led by
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara. There will be a trilateral
meeting later in the day.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Identified as Russian Embassy Attacker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese security forces said
Monday it is a Palestinian who sprayed bullets on the Russian
embassy in Beirut earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The killed Palestinian, 31, is called Ahmed Abou Kharoub, who
lives in Ein El-Hilweh camp near southern port city of Sidon, the
largest one among the 12 Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, the
forces said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"I martyred myself for Grozny (the Chechen capital)," reads a
note found in the gunman's pocket.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that the gunman opened fire from a
residential building near the embassy, killing a policeman and
wounding several others.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese security forces stormed the building and shot dead
Kharoub, seizing hand grenades, Kalashnikov rifles and other guns.
</P>
<P>
Officers said they believe the attacker acted alone but soldiers
combed the area for possible accomplices.
</P>
<P>
A Russian embassy staff told Xinhua that no staff inside the
embassy were injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported last week that Islamists loyal to Chechen
rebels are being trained in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanese security forces denied the report.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of new year, an underground fundamentalist faction
calling itself Takfir and Hejirah ambushed a Lebanese army foot
patrol, killing nine soldiers and taking one officer as hostage.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the faction are sheltering in a rugged mountainous
terrain near the northern port city of Tripoli, which has been
surrounded by the army.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Offers Cooperation with Investigators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
said Monday that he will be fully cooperative in investigation of
allegations that he had accepted nearly half a million U.S. dollars
from a French Jewish millionaire while he was a parliament member.
</P>
<P>
After a reception at his residence in honor of visiting Romanian
President Emil Constantinescu, Weizman said he is pleased that the
State Attorney's Office has begun the investigation and he will
respond after the investigation ends.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein has asked Weizman to hand
over all documents related to the 450,000 dollars he received from
Monte Carlo businessman Eduoard Seroussi between 1988 and 1993, the
Justice Ministry said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
Weizman has admitted that he received money from Seroussi, his
long-time friend, but only as a personal gift before he was elected
president in 1993. One of his supporters said the money was used to
pay for medical treatment for his son Shaul, who was seriously
wounded in war and died in a car accident in 1991.
</P>
<P>
But a local daily Haaretz quoted Yoav Yitzhak, an investigative
journalist who broke the story, as saying Monday that Weizman used
more than 20,000 dollars of the fund to pay debts to the income tax
authorities. About 100,000 dollars were deposited in a joint
account of Weizman's daughter and her husband, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have called on Weizman to resign from his
second term, which began in 1998, after the scandal was reported.
The Labor Party of Prime Minister Ehud Barak has kept silent on the
matter.

<HEADLINE> Law on Parliamentary Elections Revised in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative-dominated
Majlis (parliament) Monday revised the country's elections law,
changing the minimum of votes for a candidate to enter the
parliament from one third to one fourth of the total in the first
round of elections.
</P>
<P>
The revision came after the conservatives had failed to convince
the Majlis to change the parliamentarian elections from two rounds
to a single one.
</P>
<P>
A hard-line Majlis deputy, Mohammad Reza Bahonar, raised a
proposal on Sunday to eliminate the run-off round for the
forthcoming Majlis elections scheduled for February 18.
</P>
<P>
Moderate parliamentarians, who support the reformist policies of
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, walked out of the parliament on
Sunday in a protest to Bahonar's proposal and forced the Majlis to
close its open session.
</P>
<P>
Majid Ansari, leader of the reformist minority in the Majlis,
termed the proposal as a "political coup" by the conservatives who
control most of the state organs in the country.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Abdolvahed Lari, a moderate, said after the
revision that the Majlis ratification "is definitely a better
proposal than the one put forward by Mr. Mohammad Reza Bahonar,
which would have meant the governing of a minority over a
majority."
</P>
<P>
The executive boards assigned by the Iranian Interior Ministry
have allowed 6,459 candidates out of 6,860 applicants to run for
the elections, the sixth one since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The number of candidates might decline after the supervisory
boards assigned by the conservative-dominated Guardians Council
review the qualification of candidates.
</P>
<P>
Considering the coming parliamentary polling as "sensitive,"
both the conservatives and moderates have launched their campaign
months ago in order to win more seats in the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives expect to maintain their majority in the
Majlis while the moderates hope to grasp more seats, paving the way
for the political reforms advocated by President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
However, political analysts here believe that independents will
play an important role in the future Majlis.

<HEADLINE> Russia Pays Off $10 Billion in Foreign Debt in 1999: Central Bank Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia repaid about 10 billion U.
S. dollars of its foreign debts last year, showing a sign of the
country's ability to meet its obligations "within reasonable
limits," said Russian Central Bank chairman Viktor Geraschenko on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, with "the politicization of the
negotiations" there are no alarming signs in Russia's relations
with the International Monetary Fund, Geraschenko said at a
meeting with Russian Acting President Vladimir Putin here.
</P>
<P>
Geraschenko expressed his confidence that "the Russian ruble
will stand firm" in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Geraschenko and Acting President Putin discussed a series of
economic issues, explored ways of raising the population's
purchasing power and set tasks in credit policy and rates.
</P>
<P>
Geraschenko believes that the levers for boosting the
population's buying power can be applied more fully in these
spheres this year because 1999 was the year "of the country's
commercial banks licking wounds."

<HEADLINE> Syrian-Israeli Talks Start with Clinton Arrival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shepherdstown, W.Va, January 3 (Xinhua) -- President Bill
Clinton arrived at Shepherdstown at noon on Monday, to help open a
new round of peace talks between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara, who flew in on Sunday for
the talks, for an inaugural stroll at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Center in Shepherdstown, then is going to hold one-on-one meetings
with each of the negotiators. The three will meet for dinner and
talks in the evening.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters that the
president, taking the negotiations between the two countries as "
an historic opportunity", will act as a facilitator, as an honest
broker, as we have in the past."
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will also hold one-on-one
talks with Barak and Shara on Monday.
</P>
<P>
After today's session, "we're going to take it day to day. At
the end of the week, we'll take stock of where we are," Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks will focus on four issues: Israel withdrawal
from the Strategic Golan Heights, the normalization of relations,
security, and water rights.
</P>
<P>
"There's the fundamental issues of withdrawal, security
arrangements, the nature and timing of peace, and water (that)
need to be resolved. These are differences that are significant
and complex and will involve a lot of hard work and hard decision,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"The president understands that we have an historic opportunity
here to reach lasting peace between Israel and Syria and
potentially between Israel and all of its neighbors," he added.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel held their first high-level meetings last
December in Washington, which has broken the 50-year icy relations
of hostility between two countries. Both sides agreed to continue
their talks for possible agreements on the several issues, the
most important of which is the Golan Heights, snatched by Israel
in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said the two sides tried last month to develop a
framework to move forward, and now they have got to deal with the
tough issues.
</P>
<P>
Albright said on Sunday that it would be a very difficult set
of negotiations starting on Monday as there are so many fateful
decision involved in it.
</P>
<P>
"I am clearly very much seized with the idea that we are doing
something that is historic, that the opportunity is there and that
these two -- President (Hafez) Assad and Prime Minister Barak --
are prepared to make the fateful decisions," she said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Stay Positive on Russian Political Arena: Aide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Past Russian President Boris
Yeltsin will carry out "vigorous political and public activities
as usual" after his early resignation on December 31 last year,
said his former press secretary Dmitri Yakushkin here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin "will continue his contacts with politicians and high-
ranking government officials at an informal level," Yakushkin said
in the Echo of Moscow radio broadcast.
</P>
<P>
Leading politicians will visit Yeltsin at his Gorky residence
and the former president will retain an office in the Kremlin for
normal work, said the senior ex-aide of Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
"There will be many meetings for there are many people who
would wish to talk to the first Russian president," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Informal meetings with politicians, ministers and
administration officials are most likely to take place in the
Kremlin, Gorky or somewhere else," said Yakushkin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is also planning to take trips across Russia and abroad,
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the former Kremlin spokesman, Yeltsin now is
feeling well and is in a light and elevated mood.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin believes this New Year holiday was "one of the luckiest

calls from foreign, public, and political figures as well as from
many Russian politicians.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economists Are Optimistic About the Prospect for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Most economists believed that
U.S. economic expansion would become longest on record, the Wall
Street Journal reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that nearly all of the economists in its
semiannual economic forecasting survey believed that strong
consumer spending, rising business productivity and tame inflation
would keep the U.S. economy humming through the year 2000-
shattering records for the longest economic expansion in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
The consensus forecast for the 53 economists in the survey
called for annualized growth in inflation-adjusted gross domestic
product of 2.6 percent in the first quarter and 3.1 percent in the
second, third and fourth quarters, it said. Although they expected
growth to slow from last year's torrid pace, mainly because higher
interest rates would damp spending on housing and other interest-
rate-sensitive sectors, the projections for the year 2000 are
nevertheless healthy.
</P>
<P>
"If the economy continues to grow past this month--which most
economists insist is all but certain--the U.S. will have surpassed
the previous record for the longest expansion, which occurred
during the 1960s, when the economy grew uninterrupted for 106
months," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, hurdles in the way of an expansion record,
it said. One of those was the much-publicized year-2000 computer
glitch. With the new year passing largely uneventfully, most
economists dismissed its potential to inflict harm. But a small
group of economists believed the problems could disrupt global
commerce and cause the economy to fall into recession.
</P>
<P>
The survey said few economists are worried about inflation. The
consensus forecast is for the consumer price index (CPI),the
nation's most widely watched measure of inflation, to advance at
an annual rate of 2.5 percent during the first half of 2000 and 2.
3 percent during the second half. That is about the same as during
1999. As of November, the CPI was running at an annual rate of 2.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Short-term interest rates will rise, the survey respondents
said, as the Federal Reserve continues to tighten monetary policy.
But the rate boosts will merely slow economic growth and won't
derail it.

<HEADLINE> Criminal Probe Against Kohl Begins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 3 (Xinhua)--The state prosecutor office here
Monday formally began the criminal investigation into ex-
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party donation scandal.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the office said the probe would find out
whether Kohl, long called "the chancellor of reunification,"
should face trial on the criminal charge of breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did not disclose further details.
</P>
<P>
But von Stetten, chairman of the immunity sub-committee of
German parliament, said Kohl was unlikely to be sentenced for that
charge, though "the suspected Helmut Kohl has become a defendant."
</P>
<P>
Kohl is still a legislator in Germany's lower parliamentary
chamber, the Bundestag. The probe by state prosecutors is parallel
to another inquiry by a special committee of the Bundestag into
Kohl's affair .
</P>
<P>
Both probes are expected to last many months.
</P>
<P>
In last November, Kohl, the longest-serving Chancellor in
Germany's post-war history, admitted that had run secret bank
accounts to fund his party, the conservative Christian Democratic
Union (CDU).
</P>
<P>
Kohl further told the television a month ago that he received
some 2 million marks in cash as donations to the CDU during year
1993 to 1998, but he has yet refused to spell out from whom he had
received the money.
</P>
<P>
Under Germany's Party Funding Law, Kohl should have publicized
the donations with the name and address of the donators.
</P>
<P>
The scandal was first erupted in early November, 1999, when
prosecutors in Bavarian state investigated a tax evasion case of
weapon dealer Karlheinz Schreiber.
</P>
<P>
The dealer said he had sent a suitcase full of cash--1 million
marks--to Kohl's close aide. The money, kick-back of Germany's
sale of armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia, was later deposited in a
secret bank account to
finance the CDU.
</P>
<P>
Kohl agreed on the deal at a cabinet session in year 1991, when
he was German Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
German media widely reported that Kohl had also received as
party donations the kick-backs of the sale of a former east German
refinery, the sale of armed helicopters, and the sale of Airbus
jet liners.
</P>
<P>
The 69 year old former Chancellor, who was defeated by Gerhard
Schroeder in 1998 election after serving 16 years, admitted he had
broken rules by not declaring the donations but denied ever
selling government favors or enriching himself personally.
</P>
<P>
The scandal has hurt the CDU despite party leaders' efforts to
distance themselves from their former chief.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll in the RTL television last week showed support
for the CDU had slumped to 38 per cent from the summer high of 46
per cent in the wake of the scandal, while support for the ruling
Social Democrats (SPD) was at 39 per cent.

<HEADLINE> Western Scholars Support Reparations for Black slaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A committee on reparations
for black enslavement under the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) has made some progress on letting the world understand
Africa deserves payments, the OAU Secretary General, Salim Ahmed
Salim said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The group, whose role iican and European scholars, the OAU
chief said.
</P>
<P>
The committee was established in Dakar in 1992 with 12 eminent
members.
</P>
<P>
"There is resistance in acknowledging that Africa deserves
qualifications for reparations and in accepting, if at all, Africa
suffered during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade conducted between
the 15th and 18th centuries. But as of recent scholars worldwide
are backing the argument that Africa suffered," Salim said.
</P>
<P>
The situation is encouraging in the United States where most of
the slaves were sold out and made a huge contribution to the
country's economic and industrial development, said Salim, adding
that more and more scholars and campaigners are taking the issue
seriously in order to attract the attention of the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
The door is open for negotiations with the U.S. and other
western nations on the form of payments, said the OAU chief.
</P>
<P>
The issue of western reparation payments for African sufferings
has been debated worldwide for about twenty years. Today it has
been largely boosted following the payment of reparations to those
suffered atrocities committed by German Nazis during World War
Two.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Exports to Reach Historic High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch government said
Monday that exports by Dutch industry would reach 430 billion
guilders (196 billion U.S. dollars) in 2000, a figure of historic
high.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch Foreign Trade Ministry also predicted in a news
release that the exports are likely to exceed 410 billion guilders
(187 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999, far surpassing the historic
mark of 400 billion guilders (182 billion U.S. dollars). The
exports improved particularly in the second half of 1999, and are
expected to grow by a further 5%.
</P>
<P>
Within the 15-nation European Union, exports to France, the
Britain and the Mediterranean countries are recording particularly
strong growth figures, according to the Dutch government. While
outside the European Union, exports sales to South Africa,
Singapore, South Korea and Japan are performing especially well.
</P>
<P>
Exports to North America have also grown considerably with
about 9%, the foreign trade ministry said. "A certain shift can be
observed from chemicals and semi-manufactures to machinery and end
products, a development which fits in with the image of the
Netherlands as a knowledge-intensive economy," it added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Dutch Foreign Trade Minister
Gerrit Ybema is to pay a visit to India from January 8 to 15, the
government said Monday in a news release.
</P>
<P>
He will be accompanied by a business delegation consisting of
representatives from 40 companies, mainly active in the
infrastructure, transport, financial and energy sectors, the Dutch
government said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistical figures, economic growth in India in
1999 is expected to turn out at 5.5%, with inflation remaining
relatively low. A similar growth rate is predicted for this year.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch government said the elections in September and
October 1999 have given India a reasonably stable government,
which will therefore be able to push through reforms decisively.
</P>
<P>
The government also said that Dutch imports from India are
greater than Dutch exports to India. Exports to India totaled 959
million guilders (437 million U.S. dollars) in 1998, mainly
chemical products and machinery, while imports from India amounted
to 1.52 billion guilders (0.69 billion U.S. dollars), comprising
mainly clothing, textiles and vegetables, it added.

<HEADLINE> SADC Trade Protocol Fails To Kick-Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 3 (Xinhua) (C The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) failed to implement the SADC Trade Protocol on
January 1 as scheduled because of differences over product origin,
a senior Zimbabwean official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Industry and Commerce Ministry Stuart
Comberbach told Zimbabwe News Agency that the 14-member states
had reached an impasse on the rules of origin of the products to
be covered under the trade protocol.
</P>
<P>
He said the Trade Ministers were scheduled to meet in Swaziland
in February to resolve the issue and the outstanding work was
supposed to be finished by March when the protocol was likely to
be implemented.
</P>
<P>
"The Trade Negotiation Forum failed to resolve some of the
issues last month so there is going to be some delay. The major
issue of concern is the rules of origin covering items such as
clothing, textiles and footwear," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rules of origin are meant to ensure that only goods
produced in SADC were traded duty-free among member countries and
that those produced outside the region did not enjoy the same
benefit.
</P>
<P>
An impasse was reached in June last year when the Southern
African Customs Union led by South Africa proposed tough rules of
origin which would have meant that goods manufactured using raw
materials imported outside the SADC region would not have been
covered under the trade protocol.
</P>
<P>
The move was considered harsh by Zimbabwe and other countries
which manufactured certain goods with a considerable input from
imported raw materials.
</P>
<P>
He said at least nine of the 14 member states had ratified the
trade protocol, which was enough for the protocol to be
implemented though the remaining countries which included Zambia,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola were expected to
ratify it soon.
</P>
<P>
"We are quite optimistic that the trade protocol will be
implemented but we do not want to rush with the outstanding
issues. We want to move smoothly though the work has to be
finished as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
When it comes into effect the protocol would facilitate
commercial transactions among member states by establishing a
free trade area within a period of eight years.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the protocol included the promotion of
intra-regional trade on a basis of fair, mutually equitable and
beneficial trade agreements and ruled out discrimination between
member states.

<P>
HARARE, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean opposition parties
Monday welcomed the government's decision to postpone
parliamentary elections to June but preferred to a later date.
</P>
<P>
The parties representatives told the Zimbabwe News Agency that
issues like the referendum on the new constitution, the
establishment of an electoral commission, the updating of the
voters' roll and voter education would need a longer time to be
tackled.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zimbabwe Union of Democrats Margaret Dongo
said, "When the elections come they will depend on the new
constitution of which the referendum will need more than 90 days
to be carried out. We are questioning if the government is sure
that by June everything will be in order."
</P>
<P>
The government was expecting that the referendum on the draft
constitution would be held by February for the people to adopt or
reject the new constitution to replace the Lancaster House
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally the parliamentary elections were held between
March and April but the government postponed this year's
elections to June to allow for adequate time for voter education
and awareness campaigns to be launched by all political parties.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton left
the White House early in the morning for Shepherdstown, West
Virginia, to kick off a second round of the Syrian-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who will make the Middle East peace process a top
foreign policy goal for 2000, will preside over the first day of
the negotiations at the semi-secluded Clarion Hotel and Conference
Center just outside Shepherdstown, 70 miles northwest of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
"The president understands we have an historic opportunity here,
" said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. "The president believes
we can act as a facilitator, as an honest broker, as we have in
the past."
</P>
<P>
After Monday's session, we are going to take it day to day. At
the end of the week, we'll take stock of where we are," Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Shara arrived at Shepherdstown on Sunday for the second
round of talks, the first one was held last December in Washington,
which was described as breaking the ice of the stiff relations
between the two countries as the two sides expressed their
intention to continue the talks, which broke down nearly four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Before departing for Washington on Sunday Barak said that he
felt "the burden of responsibility" to achieve an agreement within
the year.
</P>
<P>
"We don't need to wait for another millennium, another century,
or even another 10 years to find a way to make peace with our
neighbors," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
He implied, but not explicitly stated, his willingness to hand
over almost all of the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the
1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
He said there would tough talks, and agreements comes only when
price is paid.
</P>
<P>
At the departure of Shara on Sunday, Syrian media reiterated
that Syria would demand Israel's total withdrawal from the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
The Shepherdstown talks are expected to focus on four key
issues: security, the normalization of relations, water rights and
how much of the strategic Golan Heights Israel would return to
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who will keep close
watch on the talks by attending the upcoming meeting, cautioned on
Sunday that there is "no done deal" yet between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We all understand how fateful the decisions are," Albright
said. "We are at the beginning of a process here, not at the end
of it."
</P>
<P>
She said there may have to be additional rounds of negotiations
to achieve a final settlement, knocking down any notion that all
that remains is to dispose of some details.

LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) - Britain has finally given up the
battle for the pound. From 1 January, the pound was no longer in
use as the UK falls into line with the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Shoppers have to get used to loose goods, such as fruit and
vegetable, being weighed in kilograms and grams instead of the
pounds and ounces which have been used for centuries.
</P>
<P>
BBC quoted the UK Weights Federation as saying "while virtually
all chair stores and big supermarkets are thought to be ready, six
in ten independent stores have not changed their scales."
</P>
<P>
Those who battled to save the pound say they are perfectly
valid measurements and any switch will cause enormous confusion.
</P>
<P>
Retailers who have had six months' notice of the switch and
many of whom are believed to have failed to prepare in any way,
according to the UK Weights Federation.

Some estimates put the number of small shops, corner
delicatessens and market stalls still unprepared at 35,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) - UK bank Lloyds TSB has confirmed
that it plans a pan-European Internet bank as part of moves to
shed its domestic UK bank image.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the Financial Times newspaper, the
bank will start online operations in Spain by the summer, before
launching in Italy later in the year.
</P>
<P>
Lloyds' spokeswoman Joanna Charlton told reporters that the
bank was developing a "European Internet offering" and was
currently "testing the concept and the systems".
</P>
<P>
It is believed here the online bank is the first move into
Europe by Peter Ellwood, Lloyds' chief executive. It is likely to
run alongside a series of acquisitions in Europe, where Lloyds
intends to grow quickly.
</P>
<P>
An observer in banking sector said that the introduction of
Europe' single currency has created a prime market that many UK
and US banks are keen to exploit.
</P>
<P>
"Lloyds TSB for one is now pondering how best to do that. The
bank finds itself under pressure to expand or seek larger partners
to stay in competition with rivals like HSBC, Barclays and NatWest,
" he added.

<HEADLINE> Capital Gains Bring Canadians' Savings to 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadians are saving nearly 20
percent of their total incomes as a result of capital gains,
according the latest edition of Canadian Business Economics.
</P>
<P>
The newly defined figure is 2 percent higher than an early
1980s peak of 18 percent and a lot more than the official savings
rate of less than 2 percent released last year by Statistics
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The difference in the two savings rates is that Statistics
Canada doesn't include in income the capital gains Canadians have
been earning on their growing investments in the stock and
financial markets, notes author Martin Coiteax.
</P>
<P>
"According to conventional practice, the change in the value of
a household's assets such as stocks, bonds and real estate is not
taken into account in the definition of savings," said Coiteax,
who is also associate professor at Ecole des Hautes Etudes
Commercials in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
In fact, capital gains have come to dominate investment income,
replacing both interest and dividend earnings, he added, arguing
that Canadians haven't been spending all of that increase in
wealth, their savings rate, therefore, has risen, not fallen.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Leather Exports Increase in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia earned 3.1 million U.S.
dollars from leather exports to Europe and Asia in 1999 compared
to 2.2 million dollars in 1998, representing an increase of 41
percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) Exporter audit
report, the sector exported web blue hides and crocodile skins to
Switzerland, Britain, Italy, Singapore and China, Times of Zambia
newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
EBZ attributed the increase in export earnings to the recent
opening of the Small Enterprise Development Board leather tannery
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Europe was Zambia's traditional market with France as one of
the leading markets for wet blue hides, and Italy the biggest
consumer of finished leather and crocodile skins.
</P>
<P>
Asia was, however, considered a better alternative for raw and
semi- processed leather.

<HEADLINE> New Airport Terminal Goes into Operation in Istanbul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A new international airport
terminal was inaugurated in Istanbul on Monday to meet a rising
demand in both business and tourist traffic.
</P>
<P>
The terminal, built at a cost of 306 million U.S. dollars with a
capacity to handle 14 million passengers a year, was opened eight
months ahead of schedule, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
As part of the city's Ataturk Airport complex, the terminal was
designed to withstand earthquakes measuring up to 8.5 degrees on
the open-ended Richter Scale.
</P>
<P>
The terminal has been termed as a gateway which Turkey opens to
the European Union and the world due to Istanbul's unique
geographical location.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul, with a population of nearly 10 million, lies across
Europe and Asia, linking the Balkans, the Caucasus and the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
With the opening of the new terminal, the Ataturk Airport may
bear comparison well with other major European international air
harbors, said the report.

<P>
TEHRAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The remains of 342 Iranian
soldiers killed in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war were discovered in a
recent search operation, said an Iranian official on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The remains will be moved in three convoys from the Shalamcheh
battlefield in the southwestern province of Khuzestan on January 12
to the holy city of Mashhad in the northeastern province of
Khorasan on January 20, said Brigadier General Mirfeisal Baqerzadeh
in charge of search operation for those missing in action.
</P>
<P>
After a funeral procession in Mashhad, the remains of the
soldiers will be taken to their hometowns for burial, the Islamic
Republic News Agency quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not mention whether the remains were found
inside Iranian territory or they were exchanged with the Iraqi
side.
</P>
<P>
Baqerzadeh said the remains of another 64 Iranian soldiers were
also discovered in a joint operation with Iraq, but the Iraqi side
has not yet delivered them to Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that the remains of 44,086 Iranian soldiers have been
discovered in the battlefields since the two countries reached a
cease-fire agreement in 1988.

<HEADLINE> 20 Die, 33 Injured in Clashes in Southern Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Twenty people died and 33 others
were wounded in clashes between Coptic Christians and Muslims in a
southern Egyptian village, a statement issued by the Interior
Ministry said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The first clash erupted Friday night when Muslims shot and
wounded three Coptic Christians after a financial dispute between
two merchants turned sour in Kosheh of Suhag Governorate, 400
kilometers south of Cairo, Egypt's Middle East News Agency has
reported.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a Coptic man and his daughter were shot dead by
Muslims and eight others of both religious parties wounded in
another clash, said the news agency.
</P>
<P>
However, the Interior Ministry statement indicated that more
people were killed or wounded in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The statement attributed the rising death toll to the fact that
several of the wounded had been taken back to their homes rather
than to hospitals to receive medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the bodies were found inside plantations. They died of
the wounds they had sustained," it added.
</P>
<P>
"Eleven of the wounded have left hospitals after receiving
treatment,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 33 stores were damaged and two cars burned in the
clashes, it added.
</P>
<P>
The clashes were caused by a quarrel over money between
merchants Rashed Fahim Mansur, a Copt, and Fayez Awad Hassan, a
Muslim, with family members from both sides joining in.

<HEADLINE> Putin Could Ask for Earlier Presidential Elections: Constitutional Court Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting President Vladimir
Putin could ask the Russian Federation Council to schedule the
presidential elections earlier than in three months as stipulated
by the Constitution, said Marat Baglai, chairman of the Russian
Constitutional Court, Monday.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Monday's meeting with Putin in the Kremlin,
Baglai told the press that he thinks Putin could request the
Federation Council (the upper house of the Russian parliament) to
schedule elections at any time within three months after ex-
President Boris Yeltsin's early resignation on December 31 last
year.
</P>
<P>
The acting president discussed with him many issues related to
the Russian Constitution. Putin "knows the constitution very well
and all his plans conform with it," Baglai said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, according to Baglai, "it is unclear" by the
constitution "whether early presidential elections should take
place in three months or at any time during the three months.""But
this," he added, is "the prerogative of the Federation Council,
and not business of the Constitutional Court."
</P>
<P>
Baglai said that in particular, Putin discussed with him the
Constitution's Article 193 concerning the early transfer of
presidential powers to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Court chairman pointed out in this connection that Putin,"
in accordance with the constitution must remain head of government
for the whole term preceding the elections."
</P>
<P>
Acting President Putin cannot call a referendum, dissolve the
State Duma (the lower house of the parliament), or raise the issue
of confidence in government, Baglai noted.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Asks for Postponement of SADC Trade Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has asked
for a postponement of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) trade protocol until outstanding trade issues on textiles
and sugar are ironed out.
</P>
<P>
Supported by Mauritius and South Africa, the proposal made by
Zambia during a ministerial meeting held in Pretoria, South
Africa, last month was confirmed here Sunday by Zambian Minister
of Commerce, Trade and Industry William Harrington, Times of
Zambia newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Following the postponement, the countdown for SADC trade
protocol will now take place after March 31 instead of originally
scheduled date of January 1.
</P>
<P>
"We asked for a deferment because we do not want to see a
situation where we are disadvantaged under the protocol. We want
to make sure our interests are protected," Harrington was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Harrington did not go into detail about the nature of the
outstanding trade issues, but said experts had been charged with
resolving the various issues that affect individual countries.
</P>
<P>
For Zambia, the contentious issues are in the textile, sugar
and motor and spare parts trade.
</P>
<P>
Both the textile agreement on rules of origin and the sugar
protocol had not yet been reached, and member states were yet to
discuss the development and trade of the motor industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton is preparing to revive a
controversial plan to motivate Americans to put aside money for
retirement and to propose new tax breaks for some of the 44
million people who lack health insurance on his final opportunity
to shape the nation's spending and tax policy, senior White House
officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
-- As residents of the world's second-largest economy ring in
the new year they are hopeful the protracted period of economic
stagnation called Japan's "lost decade" finally may be ending.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- While attention has been focused on the attempt by Russian
troops to take the Chechen capital from Islamic militants,
fighting has been growing near the mountains of southern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
-- A top aide to Russia's acting president, Vladimir V. Putin,
said that it is all but impossible for Mr. Putin to lose the
presidential election tentatively set for March. Mr. Putin's
staff suggested that he is so confident of victory that he will do
little traditional campaigning.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's Barak flew to the U.S. for Monday's resumption of
peace talks with Syria at a West Virginia conference center. "We
don't need to wait for another millennium, another century or even
another 10 years" for peace, the prime minister said. He seeks
fully normal ties, including open borders, but Damascus may not be
thinking as big.
</P>
<P>
-- Strong consumer spending, rising productivity and tame
inflation will keep the economy humming in 2000, nearly all
economists in a Wall Street Journal poll say. If they are correct,
the growth streak would break the record for the longest U.S.
expansion.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals in Nepal Decline in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals by air in
1999 declined by more than 13 percent, contrary to the expectation
that Visit Nepal Year 1998 would boost the tourism industry in
Nepal in the following years.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics issued by Immigration Office of
Tribhuvan International Airport, the total number of tourists who
arrived by air as of December 31, 1999, stands at 345,663,
compared with 397,940 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 figure is even lower than that of 1997, which saw 371,
000 tourist arrivals. The number of tourists who come by air is
around 85 percent of the total tourists visiting Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The drop in tourist arrivals is depressing particularly because
it is the result of a substantial decline in tourist arrivals from
all major destinations such as India, Japan, the United States and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 saw a rise only in the number of tourist arrivals
from Switzerland, Austria and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Nepal marked the year 1998 as the Visit Nepal Year to attract
tourists from all over the world. Though it failed to attain the
target of bringing in 500,000 tourists in 1998, tourism experts
and entrepreneurs had expected a boost of the tourism industry in
the following years.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is also planning to mark 2002 as the Destination Nepal
Year.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- An Indian private airlines was
forced to cancel its Kashmir-bound flight on Monday following a
bomb hoax minutes before it was to take off from here.
</P>
<P>
Flight 9W-605 of the Jet Airways, which was ready to leave the
Palam Airport after 120 passengers had boarded the plane, was
stopped from taking off following a telephone call that a bomb had
been planted in the aircraft, a Jet Airways spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, after four hours of thorough checking by a bomb
disposal squad and airport security officials, the phone call
turned out to be a hoax.
</P>
<P>
The flight was now scheduled to leave on Tuesday, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
An Airbus A-300 plane belonging to the Indian Airlines was
hijacked on its way from Kathmandu to New Delhi on December 24
last year and the week-long drama came to an end just few hours
before New Year's Eve.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Leather Exports up in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia earned 3.1 million U.S.
dollars from leather exports to Europe and Asia in 1999,
representing a 41.1 percent increase compared to 2.2 million
dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the Export Board of Zambia, web blue hides and
crocodile skins were exported to Switzerland, Britain, Italy,
Singapore and China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the sector exported a consignment of footwear
products to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Malawi
during the same period, Times of Zambia newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The export board attributed the increase in export earnings to
the recent opening of the small leather tannery in the southern
African country.
</P>
<P>
Europe is considered Zambia's traditional market with France as
one of the leading markets for wet blue hides, and Italy the
highest consumer of finished leather and crocodile skins.
</P>
<P>
Asia is considered a better alternative for raw and
semi-processed leather.
</P>
<P>
Some of the Zambian leather tanned in Singapore finds its way

</P>
<P>
In his message, Tung emphasized that education is the key to
sustainable economic development, saying education provides all
citizens with an equal opportunity to improve their quality of
life and that of their families.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive also urged teachers to send their views and

Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
"As front-line educators, your participation and support are
essential and indeed vital," Tung said.

<P>
The Education Commission can take their views into account when
finalizing its recommendations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Knowing that all teachers at all levels are on e-mail, Tung
hoped that they would grasp this opportunity to network among
themselves, to communicate and share their experience in teaching.
</P>
<P>
"If Hong Kong is truly to become a cyberhub, all our citizens
must be at ease with technology, including the use of e-mail, the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's capital of Beirut Monday
afternoon returned to normal hours after a fierce fire exchange
between a group of unidentified militants and security forces.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said one policeman and one militant were killed
and several passers-by wounded during the fighting, which took
place near the Russian embassy in western Beirut.
</P>
<P>
There have been conflicting reports on the incident. It remains
unknown whether the police barrack, or the Russian
embassy, or both, was the target of the attack.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen opened fire and threw grenades from an uncompleted
building near the embassy against security forces who later stormed
the building, killing one gunman and continuing chasing the others.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said the killed gunman was a Palestinian. The
motives of the attack was not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
A Russian embassy staff told Xinhua that no diplomats were hit
during the fighting, about 10 meters away from the embassy, and
three grenades were found inside the embassy compound.
</P>
<P>
The fighting happened when hundreds of fundamentalist Muslim
outlaws are being engaged with the government army in a cave-to-
cave combat near the northern port city of Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of new year, the underground fundamentalist faction
calling itself Takfir and Hejirah ambushed an army foot partrol,
killing nine soldiers and taking one officer as hostage.
</P>
<P>
They are sheltering in a rugged mountainous terrain near the
city, which has been surrounded by the army.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's border forces
Monday sealed the Pak-Afghan border in Chitral, North West
Frontier Province (NWFP), to block any possible entry of the
hijackers of an Indian plane, the local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Local police and personnel of security agencies have been
alerted and are checking the entry points at the Chitral border,
according to the private News Network International (NNI) agency.
</P>
<P>
Chitral is the most important pass to Pakistan from Afghanistan,
with three entry points from Afghanistan's northern province of
Badakhashan and eastern province of Kunar.
</P>
<P>
Five Muslim hijackers seized an Indian Airlines plane on
Christmas's Eve and released the hostages at the Kandahar airport
of Afghanistan in exchange for the freeing of three Kashmiri
militants from Indian jails on December 31.
</P>
<P>
India claimed the hijackers have entered Pakistan, but the
claim was denied by Pakistan which said the hijackers will be
arrested if they come to the country.
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Pakistan's tribal area of South Waziristan on
Sunday also sealed the border with Afghanistan to check the entry
of the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
Border officials at Chaman in Balochistan have already been
alerted by the government not to allow the hijackers to enter
Pakistan, NNI said.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Chaman said nobody was able to cross over to
Chaman from Afghanistan's Kandahar Province on the night after the
hijacking drama ended, as they were fully alive to the situation
and have increased surveillance.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has a common border with Afghanistan of some 2,200
kilometers, most of which is in sparsely populated areas.

MANILA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada thanked Monday those who had worked tirelessly to ensure
that the millennium bug would not disrupt basic services,
especially during the critical rollover period last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican told reporters that the
president is glad that the Philippines ended up among the
countries that did not suffer Y2K-related problems.

"The president expresses his thanks to all of them for a job
well done," Barican said, referring to the workers from both the
government and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the Philippines' relatively trouble-free passage
to 2000 was due partly to the cooperation from organizations in
the sectors of finance, manufacturing, telecommunications,
transportation, utilities, health care and government services.
</P>
<P>
Their actions, he added, meant that "people could fly safely,
people could have power uninterruptedly and so forth."
</P>

Most banks remained open during the New Year weekend while
employees of the critical sectors, such as utilities,
telecommunications and transportation, stayed on the job way past
midnight on December 31, 1999, as part of the country's Y2K
preparedness effort.

SEOUL, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Korean Customs Service (KCS)
Monday launched a computerized analysis system to detect and
prevent the smuggling of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
This analyzing system is linked to a database of foreign

</P>
<P>
With this new system on-line, the KCS will be able to find

foreign exchange without receiving merchandise, one of the most
common methods of corporate smuggling of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
"We will be able to keep a close eye on the 16 million requests

<P>
SEOUL, January 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-
jung Monday proposed that South Korea and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) establish an "inter-Korean economic
community."

Making his proposal in his message titled "New Millennium, New

Seoul and Pyongyang could gain much through their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"I proposes today that research agencies on national policy
from the two sides consult for establishing an inter-Korean
economic community," said Kim.
</P>
<P>
Kim's proposal for the economic community is seen as a
continuation of his "sunshine policy" which seeks reconciliation,

<HEADLINE> Domestic Capabilities Called on to Combat Iran's Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- University Chancellors in Tehran
have urged the government to rely on "domestic capabilities,"
rather than foreign expertise, to clear of skies over the country's
big cities.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, 11
university chancellors signed a letter to President Mohammad
Khatami, expressing readiness to compile a comprehensive plan to
fight air pollution in those cities.
</P>
<P>
The letter was in reaction to Tehran Mayor Morteza Alviri's
recent remarks that he would pay 2.5 billion U.S. dollars to Japan
for its assistance to eliminate air pollution in Tehran, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
"Resorting to foreign experts would degrade the Islamic and
popular government of President Khatami," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Alviri announced last month that the city would launch a 15-year
project to combat air pollution, a combination of three plans
worked out by the World Bank, Japanese and Iranian experts.
</P>
<P>
Iranian cabinet on Sunday night adopted a 10-year plan for
fighting air pollution in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution in the Iranian capital city passed dangerous level
in the past weeks due to air stagnation, forcing schools to close
down three times and people to wear masks.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that air pollution has become a focus in the
political struggle between the moderate-dominated Interior Ministry
and Tehran Municipality, and the conservative-dominated traffic
police.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry and Tehran municipality have asked the
Majlis (parliament) to empower the municipality to control traffic
affairs, but the proposal was rejected by the police, which is
under direct command of the Supreme Leader and Commander-in-Chief
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
A traffic police commander said recently that air pollution in
Tehran can be solved if the Interior Ministry and Tehran
municipality agreed with the police's plan to limit private cars.
</P>
<P>
Traffic policemen on Sunday distributed leaflets to drivers,
calling on them to use their private cars on even and odd days
according to the number of their car plates.
</P>
<P>
Over 2 million old vehicles with higher than standard fuel
consumption and exhaust gas emission are the main cause of about 80
percent of air pollution in Tehran, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Attackers Kill 1 Policeman, Wounds 2 in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified militants on Monday
attacked the Lebanese security forces near the Russian embassy in
downtown Beirut, killing one policeman and wounding at least two.
</P>
<P>
There have been conflicting reports on the incident. It was not
immediately clear whether the police barrack, or the Russian
embassy, or both, was the target of the attack.
</P>
<P>
Police said the gunmen fire grenades and bullets from a building
near the Russian embassy at the security forces barrack. The police
returned fire and sealed off the area after the shooting erupted.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports said the Russian embassy was attacked. Lebanese
Muslim radicals have staged protests against Russia's military
operations against Muslim rebels in Chechenya.
</P>
<P>
A staff at the Russian embassy told Xinhua that no diplomats
were hit during the fighting, which took place about 10 meters
away. One gunman was reportedly killed as police closed in on the
uncompleted building.
</P>
<P>
The motive of the attack was not immediately unknown.
</P>
<P>
The fighting happened when hundreds of fundamentalist Muslim
outlaws are being engaged in a violent combat with the government
army near the northern port city of Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the new year, the underground fundamentalist
faction calling itself Takfir and Hejirah ambushed an army foot
patrol, killing nine soldiers and taking one officer hostage.
</P>
<P>
They are sheltering in a rugged mountainous terrain near the
city, which has been surrounded by the army.

<HEADLINE> 32 People Injured During City Elections in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, January 3 (Xinhua) -- At least 32 people, including a
police officer, suffered bullet and splinter wounds Monday in
fierce clashes between police and anti-election opposition
activists in Chittagong city, the second largest city in
Bangladesh, reports reaching here Monday afternoon said.
</P>
<P>
Violence broke out as the Chittagong City Corporation went to
polls Monday morning amidst the opposition's boycott of the
controversial elections.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party-led opposition alliance
enforced a 48-hour non-stop hartal (destructive strike) in
Chittagong from Sunday to thwart the elections.
</P>
<P>
The anti-election activists exploded a series of bombs and used
guns during the hartal Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police so far arrested 10 persons, recovered two firearms and
about 100 bombs from different parts of the port city.
</P>
<P>
The first day of what the opposition called a "curfew hartal"
was marked also by a series of bomb blasts in the city. More than
50 rickshaws and baby taxies were damaged and put on fire by the
activists of the opposition. The hartal completely paralyzed
life in the city.
</P>
<P>
The city, however, went to the polls Monday to elect 41
commissioners and 14 women commissioners in 350 polling centers
under the watchful eyes of about 10,000 security personnel.
</P>
<P>
As there is no rival candidate for mayor, voting was not held
for the mayoral post.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition alliance observed a six-hour hartal
Monday across the country to protest the Chittagong City
Corporation election and press for the resignation of the
government.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city, despite a few clashes between police and
pro-hartal activists of the opposition, the shutdown was largely
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Opposition in the parliament Khaleda Zia on
Sunday called upon people from all walks of life to make the
hartal program a success in order to "demonstrate their no-
confidence in the present government."

<HEADLINE> India to Increase Investment in Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI January 3 (Xinhua) -- India would increase investment
in research and development to 1 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) this year and 2 percent over the next five years,
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the 87th Indian Science Conference in Pune, 1,400
kilometers southwest of here, Vajpayee said his government is
committed to removing bureaucratic hurdles for replicating India's
success in information technology in other areas of science.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India (PTI), Vajpayee told the
five-day meeting that research budget would be increased from the
present 0.86 percent of the GDP to 1 percent this year and further
to 2 percent in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to removing restrictive bureaucratic hurdles
and strengthening cooperative network between research
laboratories, academic institutions, non-governmental
organizations, the industry and government agencies," he said.
</P>
<P>
By world standards, the Indian leader admitted, India's
investments in research and development "are wholly inadequate and
sub-critical."
</P>
<P>
He urged scientists to commit themselves to improving the
standards of science education, promoting India's traditional
knowledge, spreading the culture of venture capital and increasing
awareness about intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
The synergy between existing institutions and assets should be
increased to make the country a global corporate platform,
Vajpayee said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to departments concerned to raise the standard of
science education particularly for children, saying it would
facilitate children's natural creative energies to develop them
into top-class professionals when they grow up.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee asked scientists to deploy science and technology in
sectors like small-scale industries, agro-processing, handicrafts
and artisanship which are essential in a far more result-oriented
way for achieving the national objectives of employment generation
and equitable wealth creation.
</P>
<P>
Disaster management, including early forecasting and prevention,
is another area that needs attention, he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is attended by some 4,000 scientists.

<HEADLINE> Some Philippine Cabinet Members Might Be Fired: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Some Philippine cabinet members
might be fired because they may have failed to fulfill their jobs,
presidential sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing here, Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican
said that although the cabinet could be considered to have
performed outstandingly, some of its members have failed to meet
the public's expectations.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada earlier said he will
announce the names of those who will be replaced in his cabinet in
the first week of January.
</P>
<P>
Before New Year's Eve, the president said that up to four
officials will likely be replaced when he makes his first
announcement. However, he did not name names.
</P>
<P>
Barican himself also admitted that he may have failed to
fulfill his job as the presidential spokesman, particularly in
swinging public opinion to support President Estrada's programs.
</P>
<P>
"For instance, myself and those responsible for media have not
been successful as we would have wanted, in getting our message
across," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barican, however, said there is still no word from the
president as to who would go and who would be retained in the
cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Aid Worker Killed in Vehicle Ambush in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior international aid
worker was killed on Sunday afternoon in an vehicle ambush by some
10 armed gunmen on the road between Mogadishu and Balad district,
some 30 kilometers north of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Engineer Shuayb Mohamed Hussein, who was in charge of the
technical supervision for CARE-International projects in Middle
Shabelleh region, was killed on the spot while two other aid
workers survived the attack.
</P>
<P>
According to the survivors, the gunmen first ambushed their
Landcruiser, and the security guards of the vehicle returned fire.
</P>
<P>
When the vehicle had to stop for changing a cut engine belt,
the same gunmen showed up again and opened fire from a distance.
</P>
<P>
Shuayb was killed instantly. The hastened security guards of
the vehicle fled into the jungle for their own lives.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen came to the Landcruiser and sped away towards Balad
town with several assault rifles used by the security guards.
</P>
<P>
The body of Shuayb was brought to Mogadishu on Sunday night.

<HEADLINE> Top Prosecutor Attends to Appeals on First Work Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- China's top prosecutor Han
Zhubin attended to public appeals and complaints against judicial
corruption and misjudgments here today on the first work day of
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I have been planning to do in the new
millennium is to receive people appealing against judicial
corruption and misjudgment," said Han, procurator-general of the
Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP).
</P>
<P>
"This signifies our determination to adhere to the policy of
serving the people whole-heartedly and accepting public
supervision over prosecutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the three cases he heard this afternoon, two were
accusations against local courts and procuratorates for illegally
meting out harsh penalties.
</P>
<P>
One pleaded that his father be released in time for the
upcoming Spring Festival so he can attend a family reunion. With
tears and restrained cries, a couple in their fifties asked for
the amelioration of an "injustice" done to their son who is still
in detention in Guilin in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
Han ordered provincial-level prosecution offices to immediately
investigate these cases and handle them in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Holding the hands of the tearful mother, he said, "Believe in
the Party, the government and our prosecution system. We will see
that justice is served, no matter who is right."
</P>
<P>
The practice of heads of procuratorates receiving public
appeals began in China in 1992, and has been installed as a
fundamental policy for all procuratorates across the country.
</P>
<P>
Han first introduced this practice into the SPP after being
appointed the country's top prosecutor in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
He and his deputy procurators-general in the SPP have heard 204
cases over the past two years, all of which have been corrected or
upheld after due legal process.
</P>
<P>
This practice plays a significant role in linking prosecutors
with the public and allowing them to better understand people's
hardship and needs, and it must be adhered to, Han said.

Bank Indonesia have been under fire since it issued a policy to
give the banking liquidity assistance (BLBI) in 1998 to the
country's troubled banks mounting to 164 trillion rupiah. But most
of the assistance had been misused by the owners of the banks.
</P>
<P>
Many parties said that Bank Indonesia has become the nest of
the corruption and collusion.
</P>
<P>
Dodsworth also said that audit into the central bank was
intended to strengthen the position of Bank Indonesia and make the
bank more transparent.
</P>
<P>
"We have no interest on who is wrong or who is right, but we
more see the future how the Bank Indonesia could strengthen its
position as a central bank," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the disclosure of the audit to the public
would not jeopardize the ongoing economic recovery program that
now have been launched by the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
IMF and the Indonesian government under the LoI had agreed on
audit into Bank Indonesia. The audit covered internal control,
internal management and banking supervision.

<HEADLINE> Russian Embassy in Beirut hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Attackers hit the Russian embassy
in Beirut Monday with four rocket-propelled grenades but no
casualties had appeared so far, police said.
</P>
<P>
The midday attack was happened on the compound at the busy
Corniche thoroughfare, reports quoted police as saying here.
</P>
<P>
Police guarding the embassy returned fire. There was no
immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but it may be
related to Russia's war against Moslem rebels in Chechnya,
observers here said.
</P>
<P>
The embassy is located in the Mazraa area, a Moslem sector of
the country's capital, Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Moslem militants opposed to Russia's military
campaign against fellow Moslems in the Caucasus have staged
protests against Moscow and have been raising money for the
Chechens.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the rebel republic demanded independence when
the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, but Moscow refused to let the
territory secede.
</P>
<P>
When the Russian troops withdrew at the end of the 1994-96 war,
Chechnya claimed to become independent, although neither Russia
nor any other country recognized the claim.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops entered Chechnya in September after Chechen-
based separatists invaded a neighboring region and were blamed for
ensuing apartment bombings elsewhere in Russia. Russians who are
terrified of the kidnapping and other violence that have plagued
the Caucasus region in recent years largely support the war.

<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- China is tightening the
management of business brokers with today's issuing of a set of
regulations on brokerage fee charges.
</P>
<P>
There have been complaints of administrative interference in
fee collections and little or no adequate services offered after
fees were received, as well as irregularities in the levying of
various charges.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission now mandates that
brokers clearly display the types of services they offer and all
relevant charges, as well as their code of conduct and procedures
in prominent places in their service areas.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate that brokerages charges should be
formulated according to market conditions under the supervision of
the government, and that all charges must be approved by relevant
governmental departments.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also mandate that trade associations and social
organizations must not collude with brokers for any reason for the
purpose of gaining a monopoly or manipulating the market.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright plan to participate in at least some of the negotiations
between Israel and Syria, opening Monday in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the negotiations said that the only American
guarantee to Syrian President Hafez al-Assad before he agreed to
resume peace talks last month was that the United States would be
an active participant in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein has decided to
examine accusations that President Ezer Weizman received some 453,
000 U.S. dollars between 1988 and 1993 from a Jewish tycoon in
France.
</P>
<P>
Figures in the Labor party said that if it turns out that
Weizman provided incorrect information about the purpose of the
money, which his confidants had said was used to pay for medical
treatment for his son Shaul Weizman, "he would have a hard time
fending off public criticism."
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa will begin
three-way talks Monday, kicking off the second round of their
revived peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, Clinton said a peace agreement could be
reached within three months. Syria said an Israeli withdrawal from
the Golan Heights was a done deal, but Barak insisted that the
issue of borders be discussed at the end.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Before his departure for the second round of talks with
Syria, Barak said Sunday that the talks will be difficult and
marked by ups and downs. He stressed that he would not sign a
treaty that does not strengthen Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
At an earlier cabinet meeting, Barak said an agreement with
Syria will enable the Israeli army to acquire the finest weapons
and early-warning systems in the world, and would also bring about
a peace agreement with Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> New Railway, Bridge for East China Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A new rail line and bridge have
been completed and opened to traffic in the port city of Xiamen in
east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the new 19.3-km-long rail line
connects the Haicang Taiwan Investment Zone in east Xiamen with
the Yingtan-Xiamen line, an important stretch of rail linking
Xiamen with other mainland areas.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the project began in July 1998 jointly financed
by the Xiamen city government and the Shanghai Municipal Railways
Administration at a cost of 200 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Haicang Bridge, an offshore suspension bridge, connects the
Haicang Taiwan Investment Zone west Xiamen with Xianyue Road in
the city's downtown.
</P>
<P>
The bridge is 5,926.5 meters long and is the first three-span
suspension bridge in Asia. The bridge was begun in December 1995
and cost 2.87 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The newly operational bridge and railway are of great
significance for enhancing Xiamen's capacity to receive and
distribute goods, expanding the city's ties with other areas of
the country and for promoting trade, air service, and shipping and
mail services across the Taiwan Straits.

<HEADLINE> 1,750 Kilos of Illegal Drug Seized in 1999 in  Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine authorities seized
last year an estimated 1,750 kilos of shabu, or metamphetamine
hydrochloride in the year of 1999, Philippine News Agency said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Senator Loren Legarda, also member of the
Citizens' Drug Watch Foundation Executive Council, as saying that
the record shabu seizure confirmed a United Nation-International
Narcotics Control Board (UN-INCB) report that the lingering
regional economic crisis has fueled the skyrocketing abuse of
amphetamines in many Asian countries, including the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In a recent report, the UN-INCB said "the economic boom that
swept across East Asia in the mid-1990s, coupled with its collapse
in 1997, weakened traditional Asian family structures and put
greater stress on individuals, thus creating the conditions for
greater drug abuse."
</P>
<P>
Legarda said the 3.5-billion-peso (87.5-million-U.S. dollar)
worth of shabu haul last year indicated that more foreign drug
smugglers are "invading" the country.
</P>
<P>
"The invasion" is being fueled by what the senator described as
the country's worsening shabu epidemic and weak law enforcement.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Botswanan President
Ketumile Masire will call a meeting in Zambian capital Lusaka for
peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Tanzania's
Daily News quoted an OAU official as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Masire was selected facilitator for the inter-Congolese
political negotiations in mid-December after the OAU and the
concerned parties held extensive consultations in the war-ravaged
country.
</P>
<P>
"During a preliminary meeting with the parties to the conflict
in Lusaka later this month, the facilitator will propose a
suitable venue and date for the talks," Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim said in Dar
es Salaam at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Botswanan government has pledged to support and facilitate
Masire's assignment, the OAU official said.
</P>
<P>
Those parties involved in the 16-month conflict include
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia which support the government of
Laurent Kabila, and Uganda and Rwanda backing the fragmented rebel
camp.

NAIROBI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Over 60,000 people living in the
Kerio Valley of Marakwet District in northwestern Kenya are facing
starvation following a biting famine in the area, East African
Standard newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Francis Mutwol, district chairman of the ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU) party, called on the government to
immediately send relief food to the district.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party official noted that the famine has rocked the
district following the recent cattle rustling activities which did
not allow the residents to engage in faming and other development
activities.
</P>
<P>
While urging the government to improve the security situation
in the district, Mutwol also appealed to non-governmental
organizations to supplement government efforts.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Assistant Minister for Finance Christopher Lomada has
called on the government to increase relief food supply to West
Potok District in northwestern Kenya as a result of drought
famine.
</P>
<P>
Lomada said on a tour of his constituency that the current
2,000 bags (90 kg per bag) of relief maize supplied to the
district is not sufficient for the hunger-stricken families.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China's Exports Show Unexpected Growth (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the first quarter of 1999, exports of machinery and
electronic products, whose export value accounts for some 40
percent of China's total export volume, recovered from its January
and February slump.
</P>
<P>
By May, exports became positive for the first time in the year,
and beginning in July the export growth rate remained positive for
four consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected growth of China's exports could be attributed
mainly to the fast recovery of the other Asian economies, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
During the first 11 months of 1999, China's exports to Asian
markets hit 91.6 billion US dollars, up 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the country's exports to major Asian partners
all increased or recovered, as exports to the Republic of Korea
increased 24.8 percent, to Japan 9.8 percent, and to members of
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) 12.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region recorded
a negative growth rate of 6.4 percent, but this decrease was far
better than the negative 36.9 percent of the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
In addition, analysts said that raised export tax rebate rates
on January 1 and July 1 had helped expand the export of bulk
products including machinery, electronics, textile goods, footwear,
and toys.
</P>
<P>
Exports of machinery and electronic products, for instance,
reached 68.9 billion US dollars between January and November, up
16.4 percent, while exports of toys hit 2.39 billion US dollars,
up 25.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some trade experts say that China's foreign trade will benefit
from a better international environment this year as the world
economy is expected to grow further.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- China's exports for 1999 are
expected to reach 193 billion US dollars, up an unexpected five
percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Total exports for the first 11 months of 1999 were 174.7
billion US dollars, up 6.6 percent over the previous year,
according to figures released by the General Administration of
Customs. Import and export volume grew 12.7 percent to 323 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Early last year, foreign trade experts and officials were
cautiously predicting the outcome for the year's exports, saying
that because of the worsening Asian financial crisis and the
slowdown of the world economy, it would be very difficult for
China's exports to achieve any growth.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), said early last year during a national
foreign trade conference that foreign trade officials should
explore every possible means to make sure the country's exports
are able to grow "to a certain degree."
</P>
<P>
Exports edged up only 0.5 percent in 1998 over 1997.

NEW DELHI -- India's inflation rate rose past the 3 percent
mark for the week ended on December 18, 1999 and stood at 3.13

<HEADLINE> 40,000 Resettled from Yellow River Project Living Contented Winter Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 40,000 people re-
displaced for the construction of China's Xiaolangdi water control
project before the flood season set in last year are leading a
contented life in their new living residences, official sources
have said.
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Reservoir Resettlement Bureau under the
Ministry of Water Resources have all expressed satisfaction with
the job of relocation during a recent inspection tour of the
reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
 The Xiaolangdi Water Control Project, one of China's key
projects of its kind to harness the sand silting of the Yellow
River's bed, involving the resettlement of approximately 200,000
people. Its construction site is located 40 km north of Zhengzhou,
the capital city of central Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
 Last year, more than 40,000 local farmers at the site of the
Xialangdi project first moved out of the reservoir area last year
so as to ensure that the project's first generating units could
generate hydro-electric power in time.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee that those displaced farmers and other residents
have ideal places to live in, especially before this winter came,
the local governments at various levels paid great attention to
the construction of the new houses, which are provided with easy
access to electric electricity and drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the provincial governments of both Shanxi and Henan
have also allocated over 4,000 hectare of land for the resettled
farmers from the dam project, and many have been planted with farm
crops.
</P>
<P>
China has so far appropriately resettled 120,000 people to
make way for the further construction of the project whose
construction began in 1991, and some additional 60,000 locals are
expected to move out from the reservoir area this year.

"The next step in the peace process could depend on the outcome
of these talks between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
and these religious dignitaries," the official Daily News on
Monday quoted Ven. Kamburugamuwe Vajira Thera, leader of the group,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the delegation comprising Bishop Thomas
Saundranayagam and Bishop Rayappu Joseph follows President
Chandrika Kumaratunga's call to all political parties and the
rebels to support her in ending the war and finding a permanent
solution to the ethnic crisis at her swearing-in ceremony on
December 22, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been troubled by a seemingly unending ethnic war
since 1983 between majority Sinhalese-dominated government troops
and the LTTE rebels who have been fighting for a separate homeland
for minority Tamils in the north and east of the island country.
</P>
<P>
When the world was celebrating the dawn of the new millennium,
Sri Lanka was locked in ferocious gun battles in the northern
Elephant Pass and Jaffna peninsula, leaving scores dead or wounded
on both sides.
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting of the organization, which is represented
by all major religions in Sri Lanka, it was unanimously decided to
create an environment for peace, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The organization's peace efforts will be reported to President
Kumaratunga and the leaders of all political parties.
</P>
<P>
The mission will tell the LTTE that all criteria for peace,
short of a separate state, were negotiable, the newspaper said,
adding that the main opposition United National Party could play a
decisive role by supporting the president's peace efforts.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Maluku Province Quiet but Still Tense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minor clashes and tension were reported on Sunday, although
order has generally been restored on the Central Maluku island of
Seram.
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting versions of the death toll in the island
over the weekend, with the Antara News Agency putting it at 15
when the fighting broke out on Saturday. A local journalist from
the Suara Maluku daily told the Jakarta Post that at least 58
people were killed in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
"According to witnesses the victims were shot dead by members
of the Mobile Brigade Police during the clashes between Christians
and Muslims there," an official from Al Fatah hospital in Ambon
was quoted by the Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
The clash in Seram island near Ambon was the latest to rock
Maluku, once dubbed the spice islands, following bloodshed in
North Maluku and Ambon, just after a semblance of peace at
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Tension remained high in North Maluku following the three-day
clashes starting Thursday last week, which claimed at least 265
lives, making it the bloodiest sectarian riot the country has seen
in decades.
</P>
<P>
In Ambon, occasional gunshots could still be heard in some of
the outlying suburbs of the provincial city.
</P>
<P>
The military said security forces mounted a massive sweep for
illegal weapons in Ambon, seizing hundreds of weapons.
</P>
<P>
Maluku has been the site of bloody communal violence since
January last year. According to police figures, about 1,500 people
have died over the past year in the violence.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that several countries have expressed
willingness to act as mediator in attempts to help Indonesia deal
with the separatist demands and communal violence.
</P>
<P>
The offer was rejected by President Abdurrahman Wahid and
Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs Gen.
Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
"I warn other countries against (giving) any kinds of support,
such as sending weaponry, to promote the establishment of a
country within the Unitary State of Indonesia," Wahid was quoted
by the Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto dismissed the possibility of seeking foreign help to
solve the communal conflict in Maluku.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing to solve the problem in Ambon is that
people should obey the law," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto proposed a territorial separation between Christian and
Muslim groups before holding a dialogue between the warring
parties, with the government serving as the mediator.

annual rice export of 1 million tons. In 1997, the population
reached 46 million with the rice export falling to 16,600 tons,
the lowest figures in history.

hectares of vacant and virgin lands for Cultivation by private
entrepreneurs.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Makes Progress in Health Sector  (By Duan Tingchang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government has enacted a series of health laws to
strengthen legislation concerning health matters such as the
Narcotic Drug Law, the National Drug Law, the National Food Law,
the Traditional Medicine Law and the Traditional Medicine
Practitioner Act.
</P>
<P>
The government is also in the process of enacting a Tobacco
Control Law which aims to reduce the consumption of tobacco and
tobacco products in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar has also strengthened close collaboration,
cooperation and coordination with the World Health Organization,
the U.N. Children's Fund and U.N. Development Program.
</P>
<P>
It also enhanced cooperation with national non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) such as the Myanmar Maternal and Child
Welfare Association, the Myanmar Red Cross Society, the Myanmar
Medical Association, the Myanmar Nurse Association and Myanmar
Anti-Narcotics Association.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's financial support to the health sector accounts about
7 percent of the total government's budget. Forty percent of the
national health expenditure is spent to  improve health care in
the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Myanmar conducts six months to three years' post
graduate training in the country. The training programs include
doctorate, diploma and master courses.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is currently implementing a five-year national health
plan from 1996 to 2001 which covers areas such as community
healthcare, disease control, hospital care, environmental health
and health systems development.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, 103 government hospitals were built in the
country, bringing the total number to 734. During the period, the
number of hospital beds increased from 25,309 to 28,943,
dispensaries from 247 to 350, primary and secondary health centers
from 64 to 86, rural health centers from 1,337 to 1,410,
traditional medicine hospitals from 2 to 5 and traditional
medicine clinics from 99 to 192.
</P>
<P>
Due to the above-mentioned efforts, Myanmar's average life
expectancy of men exceeded 60 years and that of women 62 years, 1.
6 years and one year longer for them compared with 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it shows 44.18 percent of the population in
the rural areas and 49.3 percent in urban areas have used safe
water. Infant mortality rate has also declined in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Myanmar Minister of Health Major-General Ket Sein
admitted recently that "despite the health gains, there still
remains many health challenges, including the need to further
reduce infant mortality and to combat the double burden of
communicable and non-communicable diseases."

<HEADLINE> Britain Sends Generators to Help Blacked-out France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain is sending generators to
France to help restore electricity supplies cut off by last week's
storms, the London Electricity said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We have already sent 50 generators over there and we are in
the process of sending a further 60 which include ones used at the
Millennium Dome and throughout London and the south-east over the
millennium," a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Some generators are being flown across the Channel by French
military planes, while others are being sent by sea to the French
port city of Calais, he said.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from the severe storms which hit France last
weekend has now reached 88, and some 530,000 households are still
without electricity, a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
French electricity authorities said on Sunday it had hoped to
restore power to some 80,000 homes during the day, but work was
hampered by fog in some areas and snowfalls in others.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, French authorities hurriedly disconnected
generators used during New Year's celebrations and dispatched them
to areas hard-hit by the storms.

<HEADLINE> Irish Prime Minister Optimistic About United Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
said on Sunday that he hopes a united Ireland will emerge from the
Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
"In time, my aspiration would still be in the long term to have
a united Ireland," Ahern told Irish radio in Dublin, the Irish
capital.
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that a united Ireland could take "a generation
or more" to overcome the divisions wrought by years of sectarian
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"All of these things are going to take time to heal. We should
concentrate on building up the institutions and confidence and try
to get over the horrors of the past," Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
The Ireland Republic Army and other terrorist groups looked set
to be decommissioned according to the required timetable, a BBC
report quoted Ahern as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister also stressed that efforts should be focused
initially on building trust in the province's new government.
</P>
<P>
Ahern's comments came only days after a poll showed the
majority of the Irish people wanted a united Ireland and that
nearly half believed it may happen within the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Recent progress in bringing peace to Northern Ireland and the
setting-up of a coalition government in that province have led
many in the Republic of Ireland to speculate about the possibility
of Irish unification.
</P>
<P>
Ministers from the republic and the newly-formed Northern
Ireland executive met last month to explore ways of improving
cross-border cooperation, initially on energy supply, education
and transport.
</P>
<P>
Many people see that as a staging post to unity.
</P>
<P>
But Jeffrey Donaldson, a leader of the Ulster Unionist Party,
which is one of the leading parties in Northern Ireland, said that
most Northern Irish people "have no intention of entering a united
Ireland and wish to remain in the United Kingdom."
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s, three quarters of the Irish Island became
independent from Britain while the rest, Northern Ireland,
remained under British rule with a pro-British Protestant majority.
</P>
<P>
As part of the Northern Ireland peace process, the Irish
government last year abandoned its territorial claim on the
British province, a move designed to placate fears among pro-
British Protestants of being forced into a united Ireland.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- European champions Manchester
United left England Sunday for Brazil to compete in the inaugural
World Club Championship.
</P>
<P>
Alex Ferguson's team are without injured midfielder Paul
Scholes, but despite earlier comments the United manager insists
his side are taking the competition seriously.
</P>
<P>
The club's decision to pull out of the FA Cup to compete in
world governing body FIFA's new competition in Brazil caused
controversy.
</P>
<P>
Many critics see the tournament as unnecessary and
unrepresentative because four of the eight teams are not current
champions of their respective continents.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson himself has repeatedly voiced concerns over what
effects playing in the withering heat of the Brazilian summer will
have on his stars.
</P>
<P>
But as he left for South America, he was anticipating a major
event.
</P>
<P>
"You tend to think if FIFA have a hand in something then they
are going to make it a bit different and make it a bit special,"
said the United boss.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that's the case because it could turn into a very
important tournament."
</P>
<P>
England international Scholes failed a fitness test and is now
expected to have surgery for his hernia injury.
</P>
<P>
Youngster Mark Wilson has been called into United's squad as a
replacement.

<HEADLINE> Edmundo May Eligible for World Club Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Edmundo may show up for
Vasco da Gama in its World Club championship opener on Thursday as
the striker was making a quicker than expected recovery from
injury, club officials said.
</P>
<P>
Edmundo, who pulled his thigh muscle in December, had been
expected to miss the game against Australia's South Melbourne and,
possibly, the whole tournament because of a pulled thigh muscle.
</P>
<P>
But team doctor Fernando Mattar said on Sunday "he's been
making a very quick recovery."
</P>
<P>
Coach Antonio Lopes said Edmundo might even play for the last
few minutes of a friendly against the Algeria national side on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Edmundo sustained the injury in a match earlier in December,
then aggravated it.
</P>
<P>
Club director Eurico Miranda threatened to slash Edmundo's
salary after blaming the aggravation on a night out but backed
down when the player apologised and vowed that he was fully
committed to getting fit for the competition.
</P>
<P>
If Edmundo recovers in time for Thursday's match, he will line-
up alongside former World Cup star Romario to form an attacking
pair that has not played together for Vasco in a competitive match.
</P>
<P>
The pair have also had personal differences in the last year
and commentators have wondered how the two flawed geniuses will
fit into the same side.
</P>
<P>
The controversial tournament, organised by soccer's governing
body FIFA, begins Wednesday in Sao Paulo with Corinthians of
Brazil facing Morocco's Raja Casablanca and Spain's Real Madrid
taking on Al Nasr from Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Nine Lebanese Soldiers Killed in Clashes with Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Nine Lebanese soldiers have been
killed in the clashes between Lebanese troops and Islamic
fundamentalists which entered the third day near the northern city
of Tripoli on Monday, an army statement said.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 militants and two civilians were also killed in the
battle in the town of Dinniyeh, west of Tripoli, while an uncertain
number of civilians are still held captive by the militants.
</P>
<P>
The army imprisoned some 50 militants, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The militants, who are from the radical Takfir and Hijrah group,
triggered the conflicts by ambushing an army patrol in the town on
the eve of the new year.
</P>
<P>
Four soldiers were killed in the attack, and one officer and one
soldier were taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
The army is chasing the militants, the number of which is
estimated at between 100 and 300.
</P>
<P>
The radical group is an offshoot of the militant Gama'a al-
Islamiya which has been fighting for the establishment of strict
Islamic rule. Five members of the group have been arrested on
charges of carrying out attacks on two churches in Tripoli in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a Palestinian militant launched a grenade
and gun attack on the Russian embassy in western Beirut, killing
one policeman and wounding seven passers-by. The gunman was killed
by the security forces later.
</P>
<P>
None of the embassy staff was hurt.
</P>
<P>
The motive of the attack is still unknown, but a note found in
the pocket of the Palestinian read:"I martyred myself for Grozny."
</P>
<P>
Local media reported last week that Islamists loyal to Chechen
rebels are being trained in Lebanon. But the Lebanese security
forces has denied the report.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Ambassadors Asked to Help Sued Newspaper in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Union of Cypriot Journalists
(UCJ) Monday asked some foreign ambassadors to Cyprus to persuade
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to drop his charge against the
newspaper Avrupa.
</P>
<P>
Denktash sued Avrupa for "defamatory" reports and a court in
northern Cyprus last week ordered Avrupa to pay a fine of 260,000
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In its letter to the ambassadors of the five permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council and of the European Union, the UCJ "
denounces the prosecution of Avrupa as a flagrant violation of
press freedom and freedom of expression in the Turkish Cypriot
community."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking
union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot newspaper Avrupa, considered as an outspoken
newspaper, has often criticized the northern regime and Denktash on
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The UCJ urged the ambassadors to do their utmost and use their
influence on Denktash "to stop the prosecution of Avrupa and to
relieve the newspaper from paying the strangulating compensation."

<HEADLINE> Inflation Gallops at Year-end in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's retail and whole sale
inflation rocketed at the end of 1999, according to a National
Statistics Institute (DIE) report on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The DIE said that the consumer prices in December rose by 5.9
percent, sending the year-on-year inflation rate to 68.8 percent,
the highest in the year.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale prices in December rose by 6.8 percent, the
highest monthly rise in the year, the DIE said. The year-on-year
wholesale inflation soared to 62.9 percent, also the year's peak
rate.
</P>
<P>
The year-end rise in wholesale prices index reversed persistent
government pledge to lower inflation in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The DIE also said that the average consumer and wholesale
inflation rates for 1999 were 84.6 percent and 53.1 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Recep Onal, the State Minister in Charge of Economy, recently
said that the government-set inflation target for 1999, a 50 to 55
percent rise in wholesale index, would deviate upward by 10
percentage points because of the devastating August 17 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The IMF-agreed targets in Turkey's letter of intent for the 4
billion U.S. dollar stand-by agreement include cutting inflation to
25 percent by 2000, to 10 percent by 2001 and down to single
figures thereafter.

cubic miters of water per year and cover 75 percent of Jordan's
needs for power and 25 percent of Syria's needs.
</P>
<P>
The project, to be implemented in three years, has a storage
capacity of 225 million cubic miters of water and a power-

<P>
PARIS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said Monday that Russia's Acting President Vladimir Putin
is a "man of great quality" who should not be judged only through
the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"I think that he is a man of great quality and is intelligent.
There is an element of change of generation (of Russian leadership)
which is very important," said Vedrine in an interview with the
private French television LCI.
</P>
<P>
He said that one should not judge Putin "uniquely through the
affair of Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also said that what Russians want to do in
Chechnya is "to re-take control of the essential part of this
autonomous republic and afterwards present a political solution."
</P>
<P>
"I will not be surprised that Mr. Putin, in his capacity as
acting president, would try to build a solution of this type. I
think that this is his objective, and this is what the Russian
society supports," said Vedrine.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Enters New Millennium without Bite of Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Ghana has successfully rolled
over into the new millennium without the millennium bug having any
negative effect on operations, the National Y2K project office
said in Accra on Monday.
</P>
<P>
At least 72 hours into the new millennium, no Y2K-related
problems has been reported to the National project office, which
has been monitoring the changeover throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
"Generally, all the utility services as well as all other
critical organizations whose operations are run on computer
systems have rolled over smoothly into the new century without
the anticipated problems," Reginald Arthur, National Project
Coordinator, told the Ghana News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there were minor hitches during the period
but these were not Y2K related.
</P>
<P>
 So far, no banks has complained or experienced any glitches
as were feared on the advent of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
A tour of the major banks in the metropolis on Monday, the
first working day of the year, showed that there was brisk
activity with customers doing business smoothly.
</P>
<P>
They were unanimous that the Y2K problem was genuine and that
the money and effort put into adjusting systems countrywide was
worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Ghana Stock Exchange on Monday assured investors
 that their money is safe since their equipment is working
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Exchange said "the electronic systems and
 applications have been tested and are Y2K compliant."

<HEADLINE> Long-Cultured Cells Yield Cloned Calves  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four calves were born in December 1998 from cells cultured for
two months and two more cloned calves were born in February 1999
from three months culture.
</P>
<P>
The cells were taken from the ear of a 17-year-old prize bull
which is the father of about 160,000 offspring under artificial
propagation.
</P>
<P>
A paper on the technology appears in the January 4 issue of the
U.S. Journal "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences".
</P>
<P>
In the rapidly evolving field of cloning technology, it has
been believed that long-term culture of donor cells would
compromise their efficiency for cloning.
</P>
<P>
But the UConn scientists say that long-term culture of donor
cells may do just the opposite and may make it possible to
manipulate genetic modifications in the donor cells prior to
cloning.
</P>
<P>
Their findings could have enormous implications in the cattle
industry and in the future applications of cloning technology in
biomedical research.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Xiangzhong (Jerry) Yang, head of the UConn Transgenic
Animal Facility and corresponding author of the article, says the
significance of this research should set the stage for future
targeted gene manipulations of the donor cells.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Declines to Criticize India for releasing Muslims over Highjacking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON,January 3 (Xinhua)-- The United States Monday
declined to criticize India's decision to release three Muslim
prisoners for swapping freedom of 155 passengers who were held
captive aboard an Indian Airlines flight.
</P>
<P>
"The United States cannot second-guess or judge how the Indian
government handled the hijacking," the department said.
</P>
<P>
"This incident presented very difficult decisions for the
Indian government. Obviously they weighed all the options after
days of negotiations and rigorous domestic debate," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Airlines flight was highjacked on Dec. 23 on its way
from Nepal to New Delhi. The highjackers demanded the release of
three Muslim prisoners, and the Indian government finally agreed
to the request under the consideration of the lives of the 155
hostages. The highjacking ended Friday at the airport in Kandahar,
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In New Delhi Monday, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee urged
the United States and other world powers to declare Pakistan a "
terrorist state." He said India had enough evidence to prove
Pakistani complicity in the highjacking.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Vajpayee's statement, the State Department said
that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright "has not made such a
determination with respect to Pakistan," the department said.
</P>
<P>
In Shepherdstown, W. Va., where Israeli and Syrian officials
are attending peace talks, State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin said Pakistan had told Washington that it would meet its
obligations under the international convention to apprehend the
highjackers and bring them to justice.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers left Kandahar in a vehicle and were accompanied
by the three former prisoners. They had been given 10 hours by
Afghan authorities to leave the country.

<HEADLINE> ECB Chief Predicts Euro To Rise Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB)
President, Wim Duisenberg, has predicted the rise of the euro
against the dollar in value this year, as the euro zone economy
grows at faster pace than that of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the euro to recover in the course of the year,"
Duisenberg said in an interview with the Dutch television program,
Buitenhof. He said Sunday that he did not expect the euro to fall
below one dollar and thought the euro's exchange rate would "go
the other direction this year."
</P>
<P>
The euro was launched in January 1999 at the level of 1.17 U.S.
dollars but traded below one dollar in early December before
closing the year at 1.0047 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The euro's expected recovery will be the result of stronger
economic growth in the 11 countries using the euro than in the
United States this year as well as next, Duisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
European economists expect the ECB to raise its benchmark
refinancing rate in the first quarter of the year to restrain
inflation as economic growth accelerates.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in the euro region would accelerate to 2.9
percent in 2000 from 2.1 percent in 1999, the European Commission
said last November.
</P>
<P>
A pick-up in the German and Italian economies, Europe's
laggards, had led investors to expect the ECB will increase its
refinancing rate early this year.
</P>
<P>
The euro-zone economy is widely expected to grow 3.1 percent in
the first quarter of 2000 from the same period a year earlier,
compared with a 2.3 percent annual gain in the third quarter, the
latest period for which official figures are available, economists
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the European Union's statistics office, inflation
in the 11 euro-zone countries advanced at a rate of 1.6 percent in
November 1999, the fastest pace since November 1997. It will
probably accelerate to an annual rate of 1.7 percent at the end of
March, economists predict.
</P>
<P>
The ECB, which aims to keep average inflation in the euro zone
below 2 percent, raised its refinancing rate by 50 basis points to
3 percent on November 4 last year, reversing a cut made in April.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France, Europe's No. 2 economy, reported last week
that its jobless rate fell to a seven-year low of 10.8 percent in
December, while confidence among business executives reached a
five-year high.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, business optimism in Germany, the biggest
economy in Europe, rose to the highest level in 18 months in
November, adding the evidence to the expectation of the fast pace
of growth in the future.

WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States condemned
on Monday the bombing near the Russian Embassy in Beirut, which
killed two policemen and injured at least a half-dozen people,
State Department Spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States condemns this cowardly act of terrorism. Our

U.S. is mediating peace talks between Syria and Israel.

Earlier in the day, the unknown gunmen opened fire and threw
grenades from an uncompleted building near the Russian Embassy
against security forces who later stormed the building. Reports
say that one attacker was killed and another was captured.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese have indicated the Russian embassy was the target,
" Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have any concrete information as to what the intent
of this attack was, and no group has claimed responsibility.
Obviously, the Russians and the Lebanese are now conducting
investigations," the spokesman said.

<P>
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W,Va, (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Monday that the Syrian-Israeli peace talks were going well
at the historic town of Shepherdstown, West Virginia, the White
House said.
</P>
<P>
"The president came out of his two meetings believing ... they
were off to a good start," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told
reporters after Clinton had separate meetings with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said Clinton believed both sides were serious about
the negotiations and the first three-way meeting between the
Syrians and Israelis and their American host would take place late
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the United States cautioned against expectation of
immediate agreements between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect to achieve a core agreement in one round of
negotiations," State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators are focusing on the core issues of Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a security arrangement for
Israel, possible normalization of relations and the share of water
resources in the Middle East.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 139.61 at 11,357.
51 and broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 14.03 at 1,455.22.
</P>
<P>
But the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 61.84 at 4,
131.15, surpassing the record closing high of 4,069.31 points, set
in the last session of the year 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index finished the year 1999 up an unheard-of 85.6
percent, at a record close. The Dow index and the S&AMP;P index also
finished at record levels last year.
</P>
<P>
The market initially rallied as the new year session opened
without Y2K intrusion. But a report issued by the National
Association of Purchasing Management sparked fears about higher
interest rates, driving the blue chip indexes lower.
</P>
<P>
The purchasing managers' report said the industrial sector of
the U.S. economy grew in December for the 11th consecutive month
and its price index rose for the eighth month in a row. With Y2K
out of the way, The Federal Reserve would raise interest rates on
February 1 in its relentless effort to cool off the U.S. economy,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve raised rates three times last year to keep
inflation under control but opted not to raise rates for a fourth
time at the close of 1999 in worries about the monetary system
disruption by the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index weathered the volatile market, rebounding from
a loss of as mush as 79 points to finish at the record close.

The NYSE index fell 10.78 at 639.52 and the American Stock

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,143 down, 1,111 up

<P>
ANKARA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish coastal guards have begun
to discharge oil from a Russian ship which ran aground off the
Florya coast in the Bosphorus Strait last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard General Director Hucum Tulgar said they have
received positive responses from ship owners and insurance agencies
to go ahead with clearing oil from the tanker, Turkish Daily News

</P>
<P>
And "work is continuing at Istanbul Technical University to
prevent the ship from sinking or breaking into pieces while the oil
is being discharged," said Tulgar.
</P>
<P>
Low temperature and strong southwestern winds have delayed the
discharging operation.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ship broke into two parts under powerful storms last
Wednesday and leaked large amount of oil into the Marmara Sea which
killed hundreds of fish and devastated wildlife in the region.

<HEADLINE> Germany's New Citizenship Law Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The new citizenship law of Germany
took effect Monday morning, when an ethnic Iranian woman living in
Kiel received her German passport.
</P>
<P>
Behjat Moaali, a 50-yeared lawyer, was the first of the over 7
million foreigners to be naturalized in Germany under the new
citizenship law.
</P>
<P>
The law, passed in June, 1999, as Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder'
s initiative to win support of foreigners, qualifies foreigners
who have lived 8 years or longer in Germany for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Under the old blood lineage citizenship law, effective since
early 1900s, foreigners must live at least 15 years in Germany
before they can apply for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new law grants automatic citizenship to
children born in Germany, as long as their parents have been in
the country here for at least eight years.
</P>
<P>
The new law acknowledges dual citizenship for German-born
foreign children under 18, but after then the children are
required to choose one citizenship.
</P>
<P>
As a tradition, both laws require foreigners to master
sufficient knowledge of German language.
</P>
<P>
Some 7.3 million foreigners are by now living in Germany but
most of them have not been accepted as German citizens. Many
foreigners have been disqualified by authorities even after living
two or three generations in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Deport War Crimes Suspect to Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- An alleged war criminal staying
in a British old people's home was told to leave the country after
police discovered they had no grounds to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office's decision Monday to deport Konrad Kalejs to
Australia, where he has citizenship, came as a blow to the Simon
Wiesenthal Center, which hunts perpetrators of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
The 86-year-old man was suspected of aiding the slaughter of
Jews in Nazi-occupied Latvia that he was being deported to
Australia, which has already decided not to prosecute him.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Australia's Minister of Justice Amanda Vanstone said
Kalejs was free to return there and would be dealt with as
innocent until proven guilty.
</P>
<P>
Kalejs, originally from Latvia, was accused of being part of a
paramilitary police force which collaborated with the Nazis'
Jewish genocide in Latvia in World War II.
</P>
<P>
He denied having been a member of the notorious Arajs Kommando
unit, which actively participated in the mass murder of at least
30,000 civilians, primarily Jews, and called his accusers "liars
and story-tellers."
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw said he was "minded to deport him to
Australia on the grounds that his exclusion from the UK would be
conducive to the public good."
</P>
<P>
"He has been invited to submit any representations he may have,
so these may be considered before a final decision is made," he
added in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Kalejs had already said he planned to leave Britain after being
discovered here two weeks before.
